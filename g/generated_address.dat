50|$|A Cryptographically <b>Generated</b> <b>Address</b> is an IPv6 address whose {{interface}} identifier {{has been}} generated {{according to the}} CGA generation method. The interface identifier is formed by the least-significant 64 bits of an IPv6 address and is used to identify the host's network interface on its subnet. The subnet {{is determined by the}} most-significant 64 bits, the subnet prefix.|$|E
50|$|A Cryptographically <b>Generated</b> <b>Address</b> {{is formed}} by {{replacing}} the least-significant 64 {{bits of the}} 128-bit IPv6 address with the cryptographic hash of the public key of the address owner. The messages are signed with the corresponding private key. Only if the source address and the public key are known can the verifier authenticate the message from that corresponding sender. This method requires no public key infrastructure. Valid CGAs may be generated by any sender, including a potential attacker, but they cannot use any existing CGAs.|$|E
50|$|A Cryptographically <b>Generated</b> <b>Address</b> is used {{to verify}} that {{received}} signed messages were sent by the host to which that address has been assigned. This is done by verifying that the key pair used for signing has been bound to the CGA. Because {{the authenticity of the}} public key can be verified this way, {{there is no need for}} a public key infrastructure. If the host itself is required to be authenticated as well, however, then the CGA itself needs to be authenticated beforehand since the bound public key cannot be trusted if the address is not trusted in such a case (assuming it has not been verified by other methods than CGA).|$|E

40|$|Morgan,Candia:UCL-Institute of Education, London— Cryptographically <b>Generated</b> <b>Address</b> (CGA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} novel {{security}} features introduced in IPv 6 suite. CGA is designed to prevent addresses theft without relying on trust authority or additional security infrastructures. However, CGA is relatively computationally intensive, and bandwidth consuming. Besides, it has some security limitations. This paper defines a Compact and more Secure CGA (CS-CGA) version. We adopt Elliptic Curve Cryptograph (ECC) keys in CGA instead of standardized RSA keys in order to minimize the size of CGA parameters and reduce CGA generation time. To enhance the security of CGA against the global time-memory trade-off attack, the subnet prefix is included in Hash 2 calculations of CGA generation algorithm. For the signature and the key calculations, SHA- 256 is used instead of SHA- 1, which is known to hav...|$|E
40|$|Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) {{were mainly}} {{designed}} to prove address ownership {{and to prevent}} the theft of existing IPv 6 addresses by binding the owner’s public key to the <b>generated</b> <b>address.</b> The address owner uses a corresponding private key to prove its ownership by using signed messages that are originated from that address. Though the CGA approach is quite useful in providing a means of proving address ownership in IPv 6 networks, it does have some limitations and some vulnerabilities. In this paper we will provide a security analysis and descriptions of possible ways of attacking CGA. We found that the CGA verification process is prone mainly to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We also found that CGAs are still susceptible to privacy related attacks. We will therefore propose some extensions to the CGA standard verification algorithm to mitigate DoS attacks and to make CGA more privacy-consciou...|$|E

40|$|The mobile ad hoc network (MANET), {{which is}} {{characterized}} by an infrastructureless architecture and multi-hop communication, has attracted {{a lot of attention}} recently. In the evolution of IP networks to version 6, adopting the same protocol would guarantee the success and portability of MANETs. In this paper, we propose a secure bootstrapping and routing protocol for MANETs. Mobile hosts can autoconfigure and even change their IP addresses based on the concept of CGA (cryptographically <b>generated</b> <b>address),</b> but they can not hide their identities easily. The protocol is modified from DSR (dynamic source routing) to support secure routing. The neighbor discovery and domain name registration in IPv 6 are incorporated and enhanced with security functions. The protocol {{is characterized by}} the following features: (i) it is designed based on IPv 6, (ii) relying on a DNS server, it allows bootstrapping a MANET with little pre-configuration overhead, so network formation is light-weight, and (iii) it is able to resist a variety of security attacks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNAND {{flash memory}} {{is one of}} the {{non-volatile}} memories and has been replacing hard disk in various storage markets from mobile devices, PC/Laptop computers, even to enterprise servers. However, flash memory does not allow in-place-update, and thus a block should be erased before overwriting the existing data in it. In order to overcome the performance problem from this intrinsic deficiency, flash storage devices are equipped with the software module, called FTL (Flash Translation Layer). Meanwhile, flash storage devices are subject to failure and thus should be able to recover metadata (including address mapping information) as well as data from the crash. In general, the FTL layer is responsible for the crash recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel crash recovery scheme for FAST, a hybrid address mapping FTL. It writes periodically newly <b>generated</b> <b>address</b> mapping information in a log structured way, but it exploits the characteristics of FAST FTL that the log blocks in a log area are used in a round-robin way, thus providing two advantages over the existing FTL recovery schemes. One is the low overhead in performing logging during normal operations in FTL. The other is the fast recovery time...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the issue of}} predicting new customers as profitable based on information about existing customers in a business-to-business environment. In particular, we show how latent semantic concepts from textual information of existing customers' websites {{can be used to}} uncover characteristics of websites of companies that will turn into profitable customers. Hence, the use of predictive analytics will help to identify new potential acquisition targets. Additionally, we show that a regression model based on these concepts is successful in the profitability prediction of new customers. In a case study, the acquisition process of a mail-order company is supported by creating a prioritized list of new customers generated by this approach. It is shown that the density of profitable customers in this list outperforms the density of profitable customers in traditional <b>generated</b> <b>address</b> lists (e. g. from list brokers). From a managerial point of view, this approach supports the identification of new business customers and helps to estimate the future profitability of these customers in a company. Consequently, the customer acquisition process can be targeted more effectively and efficiently. This leads to a competitive advantage for B 2 B companies and improves the acquisition process that is time- and cost-consuming with traditionally low conversion rates...|$|E

We have {{examined}} the effect of ac-tivated neutrophils on the release of prostacyclin (PGI 2) from cultured endothelial cells by radioimmunoassay and thin layer chromatography of its stable metabolite, 6 -keto-prostaglandin Fla (6 -keto-PGFI,a). Phorbol myr-istate acetate-activated neutrophils induced a time- and dose-dependent release of 6 -keto-PGFIa from human and bovine endothelial cell monolayers, whereas phorbol my-ristate acetate alone and neutrophils alone did not. Pre-treatment of the endothelial cells with aspirin prevented neutrophil-mediated 6 -keto-PGFia release, indicating {{that it did not}} depend upon neutrophil-generated endoperox-ides. Phorbol myristate acetate-activated neutrophils from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease failed to induce endothelial 6 -keto-PGFI,a release. Addition ofcat-alase but not ofsuperoxide dismutase significantly reduced human and bovine endothelial 6 -keto-PGFI,a release by phorbol myristate acetate-activated neutrophils. Catalase-inhibitable endothelial 6 -keto-PGFIa release was also ob-served after the addition of the hydrogen peroxide-gen-erating system, glucose-glucose oxidase, to bovine and human endothelial cell monolayers. Bovine endothelial 6 -keto-PGFI,a release induced by exogenously generated hydrogen peroxide was attenuated by the phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide may act by triggering endothelial membrane phospho-lipase activation. The release of 6 -keto-PGFI,, by enzy-matically or neutrophil-generated hydrogen peroxide was not associated with endothelial cell lysis as assessed by 5 'Cr release.

The {{need for}} nodes {{to be able}} to <b>generate</b> their own <b>address</b> and verify those from others, without relying on a global trusted authority, is a {{well-known}} problem in networking. One popular technique for solving this problem is to use self-certifying addresses that are widely used and standardized; a prime example is cryptographically <b>generated</b> <b>addresses</b> (CGA). We re-investigate the attack models that can occur in practice and analyze the security of CGA-like schemes. As a result, an alternative protocol to CGA, called CGA++, is presented. This protocol eliminates several attacks applicable to CGA and increases the overall security. In many ways, CGA++ offers a nice alternative to CGA and can be used notably for future developments of the Internet Protocol version 6. ...|$|R
