40|$|We {{consider}} the unitary time evolution of continuous quantum mechanical systems {{confined to a}} cavity in contact with a finite bath of variable size. Measures for Markovianity for such finite system-bath configurations are developed in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt distances of time evolving wave packets. The relevant time scales are identified, which characterize pseudo-Markovian transient behavior, boundary scattering induced non-Markovian oscillations at intermediate times, and non-Markovian rephasing events at long time scales. It is shown how these time scales can be controlled by tunable parameters such as the bath size {{and the strength of}} the system-bath coupling.

40|$|We have derived {{generalized}} {{ideal gas}} equations for a structureful universe consisting {{of all forms}} of matters. We have assumed a universe that contains superclusters. Superclusters are then made of clusters. Each cluster can be further divided into smaller ones and so on. We have derived an expression for the entropy of such a universe. Our model is rather independent of the geometry of the intermediate clusters. Our calculations are valid for a non-interacting universe within non-relativistic limits. We suggest that structure formation can reduce the expansion rate of the universe. Comment: 5 pages, typographical errors removed, Two new equations i. e. eqs. (27) and (28) were added to elaborate an interesting result i. e. hierarchical structure effects the pressure and thermal energy of the universe considerably, We have slightly modified the abstract to incorporate the changes in the text, authers <b>full</b> <b>first</b> <b>names</b> are provide...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of radiation is investigated for the modeless laser having a multilobe mirror with the lobes (planes) inclined by small angles to optical axis. It is shown that {{change of the}} direction resulting from many passages of a ray through the optical system including a multilobe mirror may be described as Brownian walk of a point along the plane or equivalently as a solution of the two-dimensional diffusion equation. Boundary conditions for the diffusion equation may be approximately formulated as null conditions at some angle which, if being reached during the walk, guarantees that the ray escape from the optical system. In the framework of this approximation an explicit formula for the {{distribution of}} the outgoing ray in different angles is derived. After many passages through the optical system the angular distribution tends to some universal function. In the case of the round mirror it may be presented by the Bessel function of order zero.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the terms of address. The writer is curious to know about the terms of address used by two couples of Jakartanese teenagers in formal and informal situation. Beside, the writer also wants to know whether the formal - informal dimensions of social factors affects the subjects? choice of terms of address or not. Related to the study, the writer uses Bright, Kridalaksana, Brown and Ford?s theories on terms of address. Then this study is also supported by Budiman?s theory on personal pronoun and Janet Holmes? theory on the social factors that influence the choice of terms of address. The writer uses descriptive qualitative approach in doing her research. In getting the data the writer uses interview and observation. The interview is done to see the basic requirements of the respondents. The observation is done to gather the data while interacting with the respondents. They are two couples of Jakartanese teenagers. The first couple is Dana and Dita, while the second couple is Dicky and Lita. Finally, the writer finds out the terms of address that the two couples of Jakartanese teenagers used in formal situation are, the first person terms of address Aku (`I?) and the second person terms of address Kamu (`you?), the formal familiar abbreviation of <b>Full</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> (FN). Then in informal situation, the two couples tend to use the multiple names (MN) of the terms of endearment, the multiple names (MN) of the familiar abbreviation of the <b>full</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> and the nickname, the informal first person terms of address Aku (`I?) and the second person terms of address Kamu (`you?), the Jakartanese first person terms of address Gue (`I?) and the second person terms of address Loe (`you?). In addition, they will directly change all of the terms of address above into the Jakartanese first person terms of address Gue (`I?) and the second person terms of address Loe (`you?) in two informal situations, first when they are in a conflict or have an argument with their partner. Second, when they are gathering with a group of friends...|$|R
