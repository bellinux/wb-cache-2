30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>hadron</b> cancer <b>therapy</b> can be amplified by simultaneous application of NP-Pt, resulting {{in the production of}} hydroxyl radicals causing lethal DNA damage by double-strand breaks [14]. Furthermore, DNA damage could also be induced by the attack of OH groups linked with NP-Pt on DNA phosphate groups [2]. NP-Pt can also cause cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis through the release of Pt 2 + ions from the nanoparticles as a result of H 2 O 2 generation due to the low pH in endosomes [1]. It was also demonstrated that DNA double-strand breaks are caused by Pt 2 + ions formed during the incubation of NP-Pt with cancer cells [15]. However, the consequences of introducing NP-Pt into an organism are still not well documented, especially when even very small amounts of nanoparticles or released ions may overcome the blood–brain barrier (BBB), enter the brain tissue, and affect the BBB and brain function. It has also been reported that various types of nanoparticles, in different sizes from 20 to 300 nm and produced from different materials, may cause cell death by apoptosis in the brain tissue [16].|$|R
40|$|International audienceVarious {{types of}} {{ionizing}} radiation {{are commonly used}} in cancer therapy to irradiate tumors. In particular, <b>hadron</b> <b>therapies</b> have emerged as promising methods owing {{to their ability to}} deposit most of their energy in the Bragg Peak, at a well-determined depth inside the tumor (a few centimeters from the entry point, i. e. the skin). There is strong evidence that severe biological effects may result from a class of complex DNA lesions induced by significant energy deposits in or near DNA,[1 - 3] producing either ionization of DNA components (direct effect) or chemical attack of DNA by radicals formed in the surrounding medium (indirect effect or quasi-direct effect when oxidation takes place in the hydration layer[4]). Major efforts have been dedicated during the past decades to developing experimental techniques able to determine the primary molecular fragments that result from oxidative damage to cellular DNA. [5] The products formed and the influence of the sugarbackbone following single ionization of nucleic acids by UV (photon) irradiation in liquid water have been investigated. [6, 7] The advent of femtosecond time-resolved laser spectroscopy has further enabled the investigation of early charge-transfer processes and elementary radical reactions in molecular liquids and solutions. [8] These femtolysis experiments have demonstrated the inadequacy of classical analysis for a proper representation of short-range coupling between non-equilibrium electrons and nascent water-decomposition products. [9, 10] In contrast, swift ions induce multiple ionizations along their tracks (about 10 % of primary ionization events before reaching the Bragg peak). These multiple ionization events have been shown to induce irreparable DNA damage when produced in conjunction with low energy electrons. [11] The specific consequences of multiple ionization events have nevertheless received less attention and can hardly be discriminated experimentally in the condensed phase. [12] From a theoretical point of view, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are proper methods to get a detailed understanding of time-dependent chemical reactivity occurring in complex molecular systems. Among them, firstprinciple MD methods (classical nuclei quantum electrons) provide the most accurate description. While first-principle MD methods have been used to investigate reactions of radiolytic products with nucleotides,[13 - 15] they have rarely been applied to the chemical reactivity of ionized nucleobases in a water environment. Herein, we show a microscopic model of the early stages (femtosecond up to picosecond) following radiation-induced ionization of nucleic acid building blocks in aqueous solution. [16] We will focus herein on the oxidation of uracil (an RNA base, but also a good model for pyrimidine bases) embedded in liquid water. We have developed and applied a first-principle MD method to generate and control ionization events and follow {{the early stages of the}} Coulomb explosion, subsequent to the double ionization of a molecule immersed in liquid water. This method is based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) MD in which effective molecular orbitals (MOs) are propagated in time. [17] The ionization process is obtained by removing electrons from selected MOs (see [18 - 20] and the Supporting Information for a detailed description of this method). Herein, we consider doubly ionized uracil produced in aqueous solution and show, by comparison with the gas phase results,[18] that the local liquid environment plays a crucial role in the observed dissociation. All nuclei are treated classically. This is expected to be a good approximation because the observed proton transfers are very fast, so that quantum effects such as tunneling are negligible.

40|$|Introduction The main {{advantage}} of ion beam therapy over conventional therapy is an improved dose conformation {{and a significant}} lower dose to healthy tissues and organs at risk [1]. To take {{advantage of}} hadrons properties, treatment has to be delivered as it is planned with optimal accuracy. Pencil beam scanning (PBS) delivery technique is nowadays the most advanced technique for <b>hadron</b> beam <b>therapy</b> and needs proper quality assurances processes. For many years, Monte Carlo (MC) codes {{have been used to}} benchmark treatment planning systems (TPS) in conventional radiotherapy. Using a general purpose MC code, like GEANT 4, it is possible to evaluate modalities such as those using combinations of different particles [2]. A pencil beam scanning model for proton treatment plan simulation using GEANT 4 /GATE platform has been validated in a water phantom for IBA PBS dedicated system [3]. In this work, we present preliminary results on validation in heterogeneous phantom using GEANT 4 /GATE model. Moreover simulations with a new MC code, called PENELOPE-proton (F. Salvat), were performed. Materials and methods 1. Measurements in heterogeneous phantom The pencil beam MC model was validated in a water phantom, reproducing pristine Bragg peaks for all tested energies (from 100 to 226. 7 MeV) with accurcay of order of 0. 7 mm (range) and 0. 2 mm (spot size). A spread-out Bragg peak with 10 cm modulation was reproduced with 0. 8 mm range accuracy and a maximum dose difference of less than 2 % point-to-point [3]. Measurements and simulation will be performed in similar beam delivery configurations in a heterogeneous phantom made of slabs collection with different densities and compositions (Fig 1.). Reference pristine Bragg peaks will be measured using plane parallel chamber in both configurations. Dose will be normalized to the number of protons via Faraday-cup measurements. Shifts for measurements are scheduled in January the Essen proton therapy center, Germany, with the IBA PBS dedicated nozzle. 2. Simulations We used the GEANT 4 -based toolkit GATE for active scanning beam simulations. The model proposes a generic method to generate scanned ion beam delivery system without simulation of the nozzle and based exclusively on beam data library measurements required for TPS [3]. We have also used an extension of PENELOPE to protons. PENELOPE-proton results were compared to data obtained with GATE. Moreover FLUKA MC code will be used as a third check. Results Differences of order of 4 - 5 % were observed between the inelastic nuclear models G 4 BinaryCascade and G 4 PreCompound at entrance and in the plateau region. From previous work [3], binary cascade was found to be the best choice to match pristine Bragg peaks measurements but this should be confirmed in heterogeneous medium. PENELOPE code is still in programming development but it is worth emphasizing on the fact that a very simple algorithm is implemented in PENELOPE-proton to account for inelastic nuclear reactions with agreement to other codes comparable to Figure 2 whatever the energy and the phantom configuration chosen. For the PENELOPE-proton algorithm in its present configuration, with detailed simulation of electromagnetic interactions, time calculation for Pristine Bragg Peak simulation is reasonably of the order of the minute to reproduce full purpose MC results like GEANT 4 ones. When accuracy of the code is ensured, simplifications in the electromagnetic processes will be performed to accelerate the simulation. Conclusion GATE was configured to deliver accurate IBA-PBS treatments. A final comparison with measurements in heterogeneous media, with a subsequent selection of the most appropriate nuclear models, is in progress. The PENELOPE-proton code delivered promising results, despite the simple description of nuclear inelastic interactions. Results offer perspectives for a future MC-based TPS involving the minimal physical complexity and maximum simulation speed to perform accurate dose distributions in patients...|$|R

40|$|The laser driven {{acceleration}} of ions {{is considered a}} promising candidate for an ion source for <b>hadron</b> <b>therapy</b> of oncological diseases. Though proton and carbon ion sources are conventionally used for therapy, other light ions can also be utilized.

This fact along with the larger biological damage to cancer cells achieved by helium ions, than that by protons, makes this species an interesting candidate for the laser driven ion source.
