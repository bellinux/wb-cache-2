5|$|There {{are other}} {{conferences}} on international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> as well, {{including the one}} that the World Association for Disaster and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> (WADEM) has held every two years since 1987. However, WADEM focuses more on disaster medicine than <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> system development, {{and many of its}} member physicians are not specialists in <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b> Additionally, the European Society for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> (EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM also publishes The European Journal of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine,</b> develops recommendations for <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> standards for European countries, and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in San Marino. The Asian Society for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> (Asian Society), which was founded in 1998, holds its own biennial conference. In addition to that, the Asian Society, like the EuSEM, develops curriculum recommendations for Asian countries.|$|E
5|$|Two {{international}} <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> conferences {{were launched}} in the 1980s, the International Conference on <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> (ICEM) and the World Association for Disaster and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> Conference (WADEM). ICEM was founded by the International Federation of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine,</b> while WADEM was started by an organization of the same name. Additionally, in the 1990s various national and regional <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> organizations began supporting {{the development of the}} specialty in other countries, including the American College of Emergency Physicians, the European Society for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine,</b> and the Asian Society of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b> This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In July 2013, {{ambulance}} facility, {{equipped with}} an oxygen cylinder, pulse monitor, critical care monitor, stretcher, surgical tools, small cages, tranquilizing darts and <b>emergency</b> <b>medicines,</b> for animals inside the premises was inaugurated.|$|R
30|$|Introduction The {{management}} of pain is an <b>emergency</b> <b>medicineâ€™s</b> priority. It is a {{criterion of quality}} care. We conducted a survey that assesses the degree of patient satisfaction overlooked the pain therapy.|$|R
50|$|In July 2013, {{ambulance}} facility, {{equipped with}} an oxygen cylinder, pulse monitor, critical care monitor, stretcher, surgical tools, small cages, tranquilizing darts and <b>emergency</b> <b>medicines,</b> for animals inside the premises was inaugurated.|$|R
5|$|Educational {{opportunities}} in <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> {{are not available}} in many countries, and even when present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program in <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization {{of the program is}} modeled on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> of South Africa and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> Society of South Africa to support the expansion of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b> Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> {{has been}} a {{recognized}} medical specialty in the United States and other developed countries for nearly forty years, although these countries' EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s. At that point, some of its practitioners turned their attention from developing the specialty at home to developing it abroad, leading {{to the birth of}} international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b> They began to support the growth of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and regional <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> organizations, relief and development organizations, international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and curriculum development.|$|E
5|$|Most {{developing}} countries are taking steps to develop <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> as a specialty, to develop accreditation mechanisms, and to promote the development of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> training programs. Their interest {{is a result of}} improved healthcare, increasing urbanization, aging populations, the rising number of traffic fatalities, and heightened awareness of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> among their citizens. In addition, <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> is useful in dealing with time-sensitive illnesses, as well as improving public health through vaccinations, interventions, training, and data collection. Countries that lack mature EMSs are developing <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> as a specialty so {{that they will be able}} to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b>|$|E

50|$|As of mid-2012, {{the system}} had {{generated}} {{a large number}} of false alarms, with more than 50 such cases documented between 2003 and 2008. State and local health officials have never ordered evacuations or distributed <b>emergency</b> <b>medicines</b> in response to a positive reading from the system.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Sissons {{worked as}} part of a team of {{scientists}} providing <b>emergency</b> <b>medicines</b> for the Government's Medical Equipment Control Committee. Continuing his previous obligations, Sissons' team was forced to work during the evening, often well past midnight, leaving Sissons to walk home to get a few hours sleep before classes the next morning.|$|R
5|$|Another {{conduit for}} the {{transfer}} of knowledge is the International Conference on <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine,</b> a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency physicians by the International Federation for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> (IFEM). In 2012, the conference took place in Dublin, Ireland. The organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations: the American College of Emergency Physicians, the British Association for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine,</b> the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, and the Australasian College for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine.</b> The conference rotated between the founding members until 2010, when it was held in Singapore. Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s, when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other nations' <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> organizations; the conference will rotate to them as well. For instance, in 2014 the conference will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it {{will be held in}} Cape Town, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some {{practitioners}} {{to focus on}} developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> as a subspecialty began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals {{had taken place in}} the late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> abroad. One was the contrast between the EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b>|$|E
5|$|International <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> is a {{subspecialty}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> {{that focuses}} {{not only on}} the global practice of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E

40|$|The African Federation for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicineâ€™s</b> Out-of-Hospital <b>Emergency</b> Care (OHEC) Committee convened 15 {{experts from}} various OHEC systems in Africa to {{participate}} in a consensus process to define levels of care within which providers in African OHEC systems should safely and effectively function. The expert panel concluded that four provider levels were relevant for African OHEC systems: (i) first aid, (ii) basic life support, (iii) intermediate life support, and (iv) advanced life support. Definitions for each provider level were also created to aid standardisation of providers across Africa and to help advance the practice of OHEC...|$|R
50|$|Garen Wintemute, a {{professor}} of <b>emergency</b> room <b>medicine</b> and director of UC Davisâ€™ Violence Prevention Research Program, released a study in 2007 which held that gun shows are a venue for illegal activity, including straw purchases and unlicensed sales to prohibited individuals.|$|R

5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
5|$|The vital {{nature of}} coping {{with the lack of}} {{resources}} available in international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> may be seen in the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E
50|$|The {{physician}} selects {{either a}} general, symptom-based or diagnosis-based template pre-fabricated {{for the type}} of case at that moment, making it specific through use of forms, pick-lists, check-boxes and free-text boxes.

5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> can {{also play a}} {{significant}} role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. <b>Emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> is a {{specialty}} that was first {{developed in the}} United States in the 1960s. For the United States, {{the high number of}} traffic and other accident fatalities in the 1960s spurred a white paper from the National Academy of Sciences; it exposed the inadequacy of the current emergency medical system and led to the establishment of modern emergency medical services. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore followed shortly thereafter, developing their respective <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> systems in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Myxomas, {{the most}} common primary cardiac tumors, are known {{as a source of}} {{cardiogenic}} emboli. The possibility of their early detection has made them of great importance for <b>emergency</b> <b>medicines.</b> Detection of the disease is probable at early stages using echocardiography and associate complications such as syncope, cerebral embolic ischemic strokes, and sudden death. We report experience of a rare case of juvenile acute stroke in a patient with cardiac myxoma affecting all cardiac chambers presenting to the emergency department. In young stroke patients with signs and symptoms compatible with cardiovascular involvement, cardiogenic emboli should be taken into consideration; early echocardiographic studies are highly recommended. Prompt myxoma resection is required in both asymptomatic and stroke patients in whom intravenous thrombolysis course has not been implemented due to any limitations...|$|R

Picone {{was forced to leave}} the Nuba Mountains in 1994 due to his contraction of malaria; however, his subsequent report to MÃ©dicins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) led to the delivery of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicines</b> to the region. In 2011, Picone described the remarkable cultural activities that he witnessed and captured, including a rain dance and a scarification ceremony; both involved the Nuba women, who danced {{at the end of the}} harvest period, while a woman was scarified by a pig tusk [...] "when she first menstruated, when she formed breasts and then when she gave birth." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{developed}} counties, {{training programs}} specifically {{relating to the}} international practice of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> are now available within many <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> residencies. The curriculum that should be covered by such programs {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. Patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, communication skills, professionalism, and system-based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals can take many forms.|$|E
5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> include immature or non-existent training programs, {{a lack of}} adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b> Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine</b> must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E
5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medicine</b> Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of <b>emergency</b> <b>medicine.</b> An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E
