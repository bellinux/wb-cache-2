25|$|In the 2000 presidential elections, PAN {{candidate}} (and eventual winner) Vicente Fox used homosexual stereotypes to demean and humiliate {{his principal}} opponent (Francisco Labastida).

When Mexico City and Coahuila legalized same-sex civil unions the chief opposition came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>PAN,</b> former President Vicente Fox and former President Felipe Calderón. Since then the party has opposed similar bills, with the rationale of protecting traditional family values. Nonetheless, PAN officials have insisted that homosexuals have rights as human beings and should in no case be subjected to hatred or physical violence.|$|E

25|$|In October 1991 former Douglas Aircraft {{executive}} Russell Ray, Jr. {{was hired}} as Pan Am's new president and CEO. As part of this restructuring, Pan Am relocated its headquarters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> Am Building in New York City to new offices in the Miami area {{in preparation for the}} airline's relaunch from both Miami and New York on November 1, 1991. The new airline would have operated approximately 60 aircraft and generate about $1.2billion in annual revenues with 7,500 employees. Following the relaunch, Pan Am continued to sustain heavy losses. Revenue throughout October and November 1991 fell short of what had been anticipated in the reorganization plan, with Delta claiming that Pan Am was losing $3million a day. This undermined Delta's, Wall Street's and the traveling public's confidence in the viability of the reorganized Pan Am.|$|E
25|$|In 1923 the First Feminist Congress of the Pan American League of Women {{was held}} in Mexico and demanded {{a wide range of}} {{political}} rights. That same year the Primer Congreso Nacional de Mujeres (First National Women’s Congress) in Mexico City was held from which 2 factions emerged. The radicals, who were part of workers unions and resistance leagues from Yucatán and were aligned with Elena Torres Cuéllar and María “Cuca” del Refugio García. The moderates, who were teachers and women from Christian societies in Mexico City and representatives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> American League and US feminist associations, followed the lead of G. Sofía Villa de Buentello. 1923 also saw the formation of the Frente Unico Pro Derechos de la Mujer (FUPDM) (United Front for Women‟s Rights). By 1925, women in two other Mexican states, Chiapas and San Luis Potosí had also gained the right to vote. At the close of this period, Villa de Buentello organized the League of Iberian and Latin American Women to promote civil code reform in 1925. The group adopted a series of resolutions, primarily dealing with gender relations and behavior, which also contained provisions on the right to vote and hold public office.|$|E

25|$|The gene {{showing a}} human-specific {{increase}} in DUF1220 copy number was first {{identified as the}} result of a genome-wide array CGH study of lineage-specific copy number differences between human and great ape species. The study found 134 genes that showed human lineage-specific increases in copy number, one of which, MGC8902 (also known as NBPF15, cDNA IMAGE:843276), encoded 6 DUF1220 domains. DUF1220 protein domains are found almost exclusively in the NBPF gene family (which includes the MGC8902 gene), which was independently identified as a result of the first member of this family being disrupted in an individual with neuroblastoma. It was recently found that the exceptional increase in human DUF1220 copy number was the results of intragenic domain hyper-amplification primarily involving the three-domain unit called the HLS DUF1220 triplet. Hyper-amplification of the triplet resulted in the addition of ~149 copies of DUF1220 specifically to the human lineage since its divergence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> species, chimpanzee and bonobo, approximately 6 million years ago. The ancestral DUF1220 domain is not part of the NBPF family but rather is found as a single copy within the PDE4DIP (Myomegalin) gene. PDE4DIP encodes a centrosomal protein and is a homolog of CDK5RAP2, a gene that lacks DUF1220 sequences and, when mutated, has been implicated in microcephaly.|$|E

2500|$|A {{simultaneous}} radio call <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> Am crew caused {{mutual interference}} {{on the radio}} frequency, which was audible in the KLM cockpit as a 3-second-long shrill sound, (or heterodyne).

2500|$|In 1940, Lomax and {{his close}} friend Nicholas Ray {{went on to}} write and produce a fifteen-minute program, Back Where I Came From, which aired {{three nights a week}} on CBS and {{featured}} folk tales, proverbs, prose, and sermons, as well as songs, organized thematically. Its racially integrated cast included Burl Ives, Lead Belly, Josh White, Sonny Terry, and Brownie McGhee. In February 1941, Lomax spoke and gave a demonstration of his program along with talks by Nelson A. Rockefeller <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> American Union, {{and the president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, at a global conference in Mexico of a thousand broadcasters CBS had sponsored to launch its worldwide programming initiative. Mrs. Roosevelt invited Lomax to Hyde Park. But despite its success and high visibility, Back Where I Come From never picked up a commercial sponsor. The show ran for only twenty-one weeks before it was suddenly canceled in February, 1941. On hearing the news Woody Guthrie wrote Lomax from California, [...] "Too honest again, I suppose? Maybe not purty enough. O well, this country's a getting to where it can't hear its own voice. Someday the deal will change." [...] Lomax himself wrote that in all his work he had tried to capture [...] "the seemingly incoherent diversity of American folk song as an expression of its democratic, inter-racial, international character, as a function of its inchoate and turbulent many-sided development.|$|E
