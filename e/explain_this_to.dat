25|$|As {{they look}} at the burning night sky over the Underworld Storybrooke, Hades and Zelena are on a date, as he {{explained}} why he created the world for her, then tells Zelena that he wants to follow her back to the real Storybrooke, if he is able to restore his heart and become human again. However, he also tells Zelena that {{in order to do that}} he wants to leave the outsiders in the Underworld forever, then he asks her to be his partner in chaos (a modified version of a wedding proposal), leaving Zelena feeling awkward. Hades also tells her that he took the precaution of adding the remaining outsiders' names to more tombstones, after Mary Margaret had her name replaced by David's. Unfortunately for Zelena, Regina saw this through a magic mirror, and then confronts Zelena afterwards, as the latter thinks that Hades, like Robin Hood (or Regina), might not be a villain forever. Regina <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> the rest of the outsiders, saying that Zelena was thinking irrationally and in danger, and telling them that the only way to solve this problem was to go to Cora, to break them up. Cora is working in the Underworld Mill, situated above the Lethe, the yellow-colored River of Forgetfulness, and supervised by two guards. She finds a hook hidden under the stalks on grain, cuts off the black anti-magic handcuff, and uses her magic to knock out the guards. Escaping, she bumps into Hook who retrieves his hook and brings her to Regina.|$|E
500|$|Etty {{hoped that}} his {{audience}} would {{take from the}} painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights will justly be punished, but made little effort to <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> audiences. The painting was immediately controversial, and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 {{was one of a}} number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The reputation of the work remained controversial in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's collection they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where [...] it remains.|$|E
500|$|Etty {{felt that}} the work {{illustrated}} the moral that women are not chattels, and were entitled to punish men who violated their rights. He made little effort to <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> his audience, and thus Candaules appeared morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges. From the moment it was unveiled Candaules was condemned as a cynical mix of a distasteful narrative and pornographic images, and there was near-unanimous consensus that it was inappropriate for public exhibition. The piece remained controversial long after Etty's death; Alexander Gilchrist's overwhelmingly flattering 1855 biography of Etty described it as [...] "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while as late as 2011 Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote of Candaules that [...] "it is perhaps {{hard to see the}} painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise". Candaules was bought by wealthy collector Robert Vernon, who {{was in the process of}} building a major collection of British art and was to become one of Etty's most important customers.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2010 {{meeting with}} women NGO representatives, {{asked why he}} kept {{addressing}} them exclusively as mothers, Erdoğan said: [...] "I {{do not believe in}} the equality of men and women. I believe in equal opportunities. Men and women are different and complementary." [...] In 2014, he addressed the Istanbul Women and Justice Summit of the Women and Democracy Association ( [...] , or KADEM): [...] "Our religion [...] has defined a position for women : motherhood. You cannot <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> feminists because they don't accept the concept of motherhood." [...] Calling for [...] "equivalency" [...] between the genders, he stated: [...] "You cannot bring women and men into equal positions; that is against nature because their nature is different," [...] while reaffirming that full equality regardless of gender before the law should be maintained.|$|E
2500|$|Gang-du is in a {{hospital}} when he receives {{a phone call from}} Hyun-seo. She is on the phone long enough to explain that she is trapped somewhere in the sewers with the creature, but her phone stops working shortly after. [...] Gang-du tries to <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> others, but his claims go ignored by all except his family. The four of them escape the hospital. Hee-bong buys a truck, weapons, and a map of the sewers to look for Hyun-seo. They find a snack bar, have a meal and rest. Upon waking up, they encounter the creature. Soon, they discover their gun only serves to anger it, and Hee-bong gets himself killed buying time for his children to escape. Gang-du is captured by the Army. Nam-il and Nam-joo escape but are separated from each other.|$|E
2500|$|Homer's mother, Mona Simpson, {{was married}} to Grampa for several years. According to [...] "Let's Go Fly a Coot", they met in the 1950s and hooked up on the day Grampa {{allegedly}} broke the sound barrier. She became entranced with the hippie lifestyle after seeing Joe Namath's hair on television. She became a fugitive from justice after she abetted in the sabotage of a biological weapons research lab owned by Mr. Burns to deliberately poison everyone in Springfield. To <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> his then-six-year-old son, Grampa said that Mona died while Homer was at the movies. Grampa has a poor relationship with his son, who placed him {{in a nursing home}} as soon as he could, despite Grampa selling his house in order to provide Homer with a mortgage. It is recurringly suggested that, while caring, Grampa was a strict disciplinarian who could be very controlling, neglectful, and even emotionally abusive towards Homer {{when he was growing up}} and he still had not forgiven him for that. Saying that, after Mona left Homer at a young age, Grampa bought up Homer by himself without hesitation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1862, senior {{political}} {{figures in the}} Tokugawa shogunate created the post of Kyoto Shugoshoku (Kyoto Military Commissioner), {{for the purpose of}} recovering public order in the city, which was under the influence of Sonnō Jōi militants. The post of Kyoto Shugoshoku was one that changed much of the dynamic that had theretofore existed in the city. Previously, the holder of the Kyoto shoshidai (...) position had held the highest power there, supervising affairs in the Kyoto-Osaka area as the representative of the Shogun. However, the successive Shoshidai, as well as the city magistrates under their charge, were increasingly unable to secure and maintain the public order, so the post of Shugoshoku was superimposed on the existing structure. Where the Shoshidai and magistrates had been unable to secure through civil law, the Shugoshoku was to achieve through the use of military force. After much deliberation, the choice for the Shugoshoku post came down to two domains: Echizen and Aizu. Of the two, Echizen's Matsudaira Yoshinaga already held high Shogunal office as President of Political Affairs ( [...] ; seiji sōsai-shoku), so all attention was then turned to Matsudaira Katamori. As Katamori was ill, Aizu's senior Edo-based councilor Yokoyama Tsunenori was summoned to Edo Castle instead, and given word of the assignment. Katamori sent a retainer back with a request for being excused: [...] "As this is a shogunal order, we not only {{have no choice but to}} accept. Furthermore, our domain's founder Lord [...] Masayuki laid down a direct command to do so in our house code. However, our lord Katamori is still young, and our men are in the north and unfamiliar with conditions in the Capital. If we were to accept this assignment without question, and a one in ten thousand chance of disaster were to strike, we of the Aizu domain could not possibly do it all alone; the Shogun would have to get involved, as would all of Japan. We would like to consider this carefully." [...] However, the Bakufu would not listen to this refusal. Matsudaira Yoshinaga traveled personally to the Aizu residence, and confronted Katamori with harsh words invoking Aizu's distinguished past as Shogunate functionaries: [...] "If [...] Lord Masayuki were still alive, he would accept without a second thought!" [...] Rumors began to circulate that Katamori refused the assignment out of a desire for self-preservation, to which Katamori is said to have responded, [...] "If people start talking like this, it will shame our domain. There is no way I could <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> the generations of Aizu lords who have gone before me. I have no choice but to accept." ...|$|E

60|$|Brooke smiled {{somewhat}} drily. As {{a matter}} of fact, a near kinsman of his had gained distinction in the Royal Engineers, and another's name was famous in connection with irrigation works in Egypt.

60|$|I sniffed, and {{continued}} to stride.

It might have been difficult to <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> myself; at all events, I did not try to do it. Suddenly an idea struck me.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{intended}} that Sir Henry and his bride were to sit down to the breakfast. That is, I believe, now voted to be a bore--and always should have been so voted.
