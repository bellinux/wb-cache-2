50|$|An early {{attempt in}} the {{direction}} of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics was Irwin's crack extension resistance curve, Crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance</b> curve or R-curve. This curve acknowledges the fact that the resistance to fracture increases with growing crack size in elastic-plastic materials. The R-curve is a plot of the total energy dissipation rate {{as a function of the}} crack size and can be used to examine the processes of slow stable crack growth and unstable fracture. However, the R-curve was not widely used in applications until the early 1970s. The main reasons appear to be that the R-curve depends on the geometry of the specimen and the crack driving force may be difficult to calculate.|$|E

The amount of underweight children has decreased since 1990, from 33 percent to 28 percent between 1990 and 2004. Underweight and stunted children are more susceptible to infection, more likely to fall behind in school, more likely to become overweight and develop non-infectious diseases, and ultimately earn less than their non-stunted coworkers.

40|$|Crohn's {{disease and}} {{ulcerative}} colitis are inflammatory {{diseases of the}} gastrointestinal tract characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation and catabolism. Growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axis is important in inflammatory bowel disease, because of the effects on epithelial cell kinetics, collagen deposition and immunomodulation. The potential of growth hormone as a therapeutic option in inflammatory bowel disease has been proven in various clinical settings. Acquired <b>growth</b> hormone <b>resistance</b> in inflammatory bowel disease seems to be mediated {{by a combination of}} undernutrition and active inflammation.

50|$|Size and {{geometry}} {{also plays}} a role in determining the shape of the R curve. A crack in a thin sheet tends to produce a steeper R curve than a crack in a thick plate because there is a low degree of stress triaxiality at the crack tip in the thin sheet while the material near the tip of the crack in the thick plate may be in plane strain. The R curve can also change at free boundaries in the structure. Thus, a wide plate may exhibit a somewhat different crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance</b> behavior than a narrow plate of the same material. Ideally, the R curve, as well as other measures of fracture toughness, is a property only of the material and does not depend on the size or shape of the cracked body. Much of fracture mechanics is predicated on the assumption that fracture toughness is a material property.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{synergistic}} effect of hydrogenation and plastic predeformation (PPD) on the fracture toughness and fatigue crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance</b> in the tempered 0. 4 - 1 Cr- 1 Ni steel was studied. In the no hydrogenated state, PPD of steel slightly decreases its fracture toughness and increases considerably the fatigue crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance</b> {{in the near}} threshold region of da/dN- ΔK diagram. Crack closure {{is responsible for the}} latter effect. Hydrogenation of the material drastically decreases the fracture toughness and intensifies the fatigue crack growth, especially in the middle region of da/dN- ΔK diagram. The {{synergistic effect}} of PPD and hydrogenation of the investigated steel causes the maximum decrease of crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance,</b> both under static and cyclic loading.

Vickers hardness increased significantly by aging due to the precipitation of hard σ-phase. The aged specimens exhibited much lower fatigue strengths than the un-aged one, where fatigue strength decreased with increasing aging time.

40|$|A {{series of}} AK-constant fatigue crack growth tests in Paris regime {{were carried out}} to {{investigate}} the effect of second phase particle on fatigue crack growth behavior of microstructure controlled steels with uniformly distributed hard particles. Three kinds of materials were used in this study, ferrite matrix with pearlite particles (FP), ferrite matrix with bainite particles (FB) and ferrite matrix with martensite particles (FM). The fatigue crack growth tests by using a single edge cracked tension (SECT) type specimen was performed inside a scanning electron microscope chamber equipped with a servo-hydraulic fatigue machine. The {{results showed that the}} fatigue crack growth rates for all materials did not coincide with each other, even when the crack growth curves were arranged by the effective stress intensity factor range. From the in-situ observations, crack tip stress shielding phenomena, such as interlocking, branching, etc. were found on the crack wake, which enhanced fatigue crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance.</b> In ferrite-pearlite (FP) steel, small size and small spacing of hard particles seemed to induce small but frequent crack deflections, which resulted in crack closure phenomena. On the other hand, large size of pearlite particle seemed to induce stress shielding phenomena and then contribute to high crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance,</b> which was the main reason for higher fatigue crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance</b> of the large size and spacing of pearlite particle compared to the small size of pearlite particle. It was similar result for the ferrite-bainite (FB) steel where the large size and large spacing of bainite particles enhanced the fatigue crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance.</b> The higher volume fraction of hard particle also influenced the fatigue crack growth behavior. In this investigation, the result indicated the higher volume fiaction of hard particle in the ferrite-bainite (FBI) steel has significantly increased the fatigue crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to the ferrite-bainite (FB 2) with lower volume fraction and ferrite-pearlite (FP) steels. The effect of hardness of second phase particle was also investigated. The results revealed that the ferrite-martensite (FM) steel showed significantly higher fatigue crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to the ferrite-pearlite (FP) and ferrite-bainite (FB) steels. From the in-situ observations, the crack tip stress shielding phenomena, such as interlocking, branching, etc were found on the crack wake, which enhanced fatigue crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance.</b> In the FM steel, the deformation of plastic constrained at the crack tip in ferrite region seemed to induce stress shielding phenomena and then contribute to high crack <b>growth</b> <b>resistance,</b> which was the main reason for lower fatigue crack growth rate of the FM steel with harden martensite particle compared to the FP and FB steels with soften pearlite and bainite particles...|$|E
