5|$|Although English is {{the common}} {{language}} of Westeros, the producers charged linguist David J. Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the novels; Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English. It {{has been reported that}} during the series these fictional languages <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> by more people than the Welsh, Irish, and Scots Gaelic languages combined.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum {{to each other}} above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the {{humpback}} whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales only <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but {{it is unlikely that the}} bells would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E

The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has no projects designated I-605 at this time. However, a project to convert State Route 18 (SR18) to a limited-access freeway is under construction currently.|$|E

25|$|The {{second appeal}} was to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> by five Scottish judges in 2009 at the Court of Criminal Appeal. A {{procedural}} hearing at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh {{took place on}} 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defence Counsel, Maggie Scott QC, discussed legal issues with a panel of three judges. One of the issues concerns a number of CIA documents that were shown to the prosecution but were not disclosed to the defence.

25|$|The word entered Late Middle English in {{the fourteenth}} century via Old French orenge (in the phrase pomme d'orenge). The French word, in turn, comes from Old Provençal auranja, based on Arabic nāranj. In several languages, the initial n present in earlier forms of the word dropped off because {{it may have been}} mistaken as part of an {{indefinite}} article ending in an n sound—in French, for example, une norenge may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> as une orenge. This linguistic change is called juncture loss. The color was named after the fruit, and the first recorded use of orange as a color name in English was in 1512.|$|E
