40|$|The {{usage of}} {{temporary}} work agencies services is increasing in the Swedish labour market {{and it has}} also caused some problems. There have been cases where employers have been accused to circumvent the <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to reinstatement by using temporary agency workers rather than rehire preference eligible employees during labour need. The purpose of this thesis is to describe, analyse and enhance {{the understanding of the}} <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> to reinstatement and study when hiring of temporary agency workers, during the period when there is preference eligible former employees, is permitted. The method being used in this thesis has been applied with particular attention to the directives, laws, legislative history and doctrine. The <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> to reinstatement in 25 - 27 §§ of the Employment Protection Act is a protection which states that the employer has to hire employees or former dismissed employees during increased labour needs. The purpose of this right is that an employer should not be able to terminate an employee due to redundancy and then later hire new employees. An employee is entitled to the <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> as he/she meets the criteria of the Employment Protection Act. An increased labour need does not guarantee preference eligible workers a reinstatement. The employee must be qualified for the position. In order for an employer's action to be considered as circumvention of the <b>preferential</b> <b>rights,</b> requires that the action claiming to be circumventing is substantiated, was meant to avoid the <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> and been unfair considering the circumstances of the individual case. The <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> can only be applied in hiring situations. The usage of temporary agency workers is not included in the concept of hiring new employees and is therefore a permitted action during the <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> period. A law change should take place since the <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> no longer fulfils its purpose...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the issue of <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> in relation to the increased practice of hiring temporary staff. The object is illuminated from a diversity perspective by seeing what a circumvention of the <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> may have consequences for vulnerable groups on the Swedish labor market.   The question of <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> to reinstatement is controlled in  The Employment Protection Act. The <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> is for the protection of workers made redundant due to redundancy. The use of agency workers has increased significantly in the Swedish labor market since the industry's legalization in 1993. This has created some problems in terms of <b>preferential</b> <b>rights.</b>   To a circumvention of the law, shall exist requires that the measures constitute circumvention is justified, measures should have been sought to circumvent the law and been unfair in view of the particular case. Hiring of staff is not considered as a new employment, which is the requirement to invoke <b>preferential</b> <b>rights,</b> thus causing it to staff hiring is legitimate action under the preferential time.   To reduce the abuse of the right of priority, I believe that the application of law should be changed so that it takes into account the triangular available on today's labor market...|$|R

40|$|Competitive {{location}} {{problems can}} be characterized {{by the fact that}} the decisions made by others will affect our own payoffs. In this paper, we address a discrete competitive location game in which two decision-makers have to decide simultaneously where to locate their services without knowing the decisions of one another. This problem arises in a franchising environment in which the decision-makers are the franchisees and the franchiser defines the potential sites for locating services and the rules of the game. At most one service can be located at each site, and one of the franchisees has <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> over the other. This means that if both franchisees are interested in opening the service in the same site, only the one that has <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> will open it. We consider that both franchisees have budget constraints, but the franchisee without <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> is allowed to show interest in more sites than the ones she can afford. We are interested in studying the influence of the existence of <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> and overbidding on the outcomes for both franchisees and franchiser. A model is presented and an algorithmic approach is developed for the calculation of Nash equilibria. Several computational experiments are defined and their results are analysed, showing that <b>preferential</b> <b>rights</b> give its holder a relative advantage over the other competitor. The possibility of overbidding seems to be advantageous for the franchiser, as well as the inclusion of some level of asymmetry between the two decision-makers...|$|R

40|$|During the 20 th century Sweden {{faced an}} {{increased}} proportion of workers registered as part-time unemployed, {{especially in the}} care sector. However, due to many valuable efforts, aimed at solving the problem of part time unemployment and political decisions, {{the number of people}} who are part-time unemployed has declined since the late 20 th century. We have investigated part-time workers <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to extending their working hours. According to Section 25 a of the Employment Protection Act, part-time employees who have submitted an interest in increasing their working hours has a <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to increased working hours, with the assumptions that full-time employment with the employer will meet a labor need that the employee has sufficient qualifications for. Qualitative interviews have given us information about how Karlstad Community and a private care company deal with part-time unemployment and their workers <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to extending their working hours. We have found that people who work for Karlstad Community have an opportunity to choose their number of workings hours, thanks to a political decision made in Karlstad Community, aimed at solving the part time unemployment in the care sector. It is important to point out that the decision only effect workers who are connected to the collective agreement between the union, Svenska Kommunalarbetareförbundet, and Karlstad Community. The private care company does not provide such a prospect. Instead it focuses on keeping its costs as low as possible, by only using the human resource when it is needed. Should part-time workers <b>preferential</b> <b>right</b> to increased working hours be strengthened through firmer legislation? Or should the social partners make further efforts to find solutions that cater for both employers’ and employees’ interests. Section 25 a of the Employment Protection Act is in our opinion, not an effective regulation in order to reach the goal with reducing part-time unemployment, since the intentions behind the Section have not been fully possible to realise. However, we do not believe that the workers right should be strengthened through legislation. Instead we would like the social partners to cooperate to a higher extent, in order to make collective agreements that suit different parts of the labor market. If the problem with part-time unemployment continues to exist, the society has to decide how determined it really is to eliminate the part-time unemployment...|$|R

Following inquires by the Petroleum Affairs Commission, the National Petroleum Council recognized deficiencies in the awarding process and ordered a formal investigation. The Attorney General, after concluding that the procedures used in selecting petroleum companies was flawed, recommended a restructuring of the procedures for future bidding rounds that would conform to international standards.
