40|$|The {{germination}} {{and early}} growth of Australian rainforest cabinet timber species were examined. The species were chosen from shade sensitive early secondary to shade tolerant climax successional groups. The germination of 35 Queensland rainforest timber species {{and effectiveness of}} pre-germination treatments were studied. Five distinct patterns of germination are outlined and linked to fruiting season and geographic location. Twenty Queensland cabinet timber species seedlings were subsequently grown in three light regimes and two nutrient treatments. Growth and photosynthetic responses to light and nutrient treatments were examined. The {{quantity and quality of}} solar radiation were altered by the use of painted polyfilm in order to simulate natural rainforest light regimes. Growth responses were variable across treatments and between species. A factorial analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the effects of light (high- 80 % full sunlight and R:FR 1. 01, low- 8 % full sunlight and R:FR 0. 63), nitrogen (control, added nitrogen) and successional status (early secondary, late secondary, climax). Under high light conditions the cabinet timber species significantly increased their total number of leaves, branching, rate of photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance. Under low light conditions a significant increase in internode length, single leaf area, leaf blade length, slenderness (height/diameter ratio) and relative crown depth was observed. The light treatments did not {{have a significant effect on}} stem elongation rate, relative stem elongation rate or total leaf area. The added nitrogen treatment produced a significant increase in stem elongation rate, relative stem elongation rate, internode length, single leaf area, total leaf area, leaf blade length and relative crown depth. Additional nitrogen did not have a significant effect on slenderness (height/diameter ratio), branching, rate of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. The combination of high light conditions and added nitrogen treatment significantly increased diameter <b>increment</b> <b>rate,</b> relative diameter <b>increment</b> <b>rate</b> and water use efficiency in the species being trialed. Low light conditions combined with added nitrogen significantly increased specific leaf area. Early secondary species exhibited the greatest stem elongation rate, relative stem elongation rate, diameter <b>increment</b> <b>rate</b> and relative diameter <b>increment</b> <b>rate</b> compared to late secondary and climax species.

30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that the largest total forest biomass {{potentials}} per unit of land can be found in northern Europe (southern Finland and Sweden, Estonia and Latvia), Central Europe (Austria, Czech Republic and southern Germany), Slovenia, southwest France and Portugal. Several factors may explain these patterns. Regions in northern Europe, as well as Slovenia, can be generally characterised by having a high forest cover (Forest Europe 2015), which results in large forest biomass potentials per unit of land. Central European regions have generally lower forest cover, but growth conditions generally favour higher biomass stocking (Gallaun et al. 2010; Thurner et al. 2013; Moreno et al. 2017) and <b>increment</b> <b>rates</b> (Neumann et al. 2016; Schelhaas et al. 2018) and thereby account for larger forest biomass potentials per hectare of forest. Southwest France and Portugal exhibit also high <b>increment</b> <b>rates</b> and these are closely linked to the presence of intensively-managed plantations of Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and Eucalyptus species, respectively (Brus et al. 2012; San-Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Forests play an {{important}} role in the global carbon flow. They can store carbon and can also provide wood which can substitute other materials. In EU 27 the standing biomass is steadily increasing. Increments and harvests seem to have reached a plateau between 2005 and 2010. One reason for reaching this plateau will be the circumstance that the forests are getting older. High ages have the advantage that they typical show high carbon concentration and the disadvantage that the <b>increment</b> <b>rates</b> are decreasing. It should be investigated how biomass stock, harvests and increments will develop under different climate scenarios and two management scenarios where one is forcing to store high biomass amounts in forests and the other tries to have high <b>increment</b> <b>rates</b> and much harvested wood. RESULTS: A management which is maximising standing biomass will raise the stem wood carbon stocks from 30 tC/ha to 50 tC/ha until 2100. A management which is maximising increments will lower the stock to 20 tC/ha until 2100. The estimates for the climate scenarios A 1 b, B 1 and E 1 are different but there is much more effect by the management target than by the climate scenario. By maximising increments the harvests are 0. 4 tC/ha/year higher than in the management which maximises the standing biomass. The increments until 2040 are close together but around 2100 the increments when maximising standing biomass are approximately 50...|$|R

40|$|In a semi-deciduous {{natural forest}} stand in Cameroon a forest {{inventory}} and increment estimations on all trees with a diameter above 10 cm {{were carried out}} {{in an area of}} 1 ha. The stand is dominated by Triplochiton scleroxylon and is a part of a forest type which is widely distributed in West Africa. The existence of annual rings in the wood of trees was proven by radiocarbon dating and tree ring analysis. The oldest tree (Celtis zenkeri) of the stand was 220 years old. The age class between 41 and 60 years is the strongest in number of individuals. Trees with an age of more than 120 years were found exclusively in the storey of the emergents. The age of the trees correlates very weakly with the diameter and the height. The mean diameter growth rates vary between 0. 2 cm per year in understorey tree species and 0. 82 cm per year in emergent species. The major timber species (T scleroxylon) reaches in mean the minimum felling diameter of 80 cm within 90 years. According to their age and height distribution together with the wood density, we distinguished three major types of life strategies of species cohorts. Species with high wood density and low <b>increment</b> <b>rates</b> in all age classes are generally restricted to the understorey. Species with exclusively old individuals, low or moderate wood densities and high <b>increment</b> <b>rates</b> are restricted to the upper storey and can be classified as long-living pioneers (T scleroxylon). Finally, species with moderate or high wood density, some old individuals in the upper storey and many recruits in the lower canopy can be defined as mature forest trees or trees of the future (Nesogordonia papaverifera, Sterculia rhinopetala). These findings lead to the assumption that the investigated stand can be classified as a very late secondary stand in transition to a mature forest. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

The reason is that gravel particles of stone columns are coarser than surrounding soil, having more void space, hence pore water pressure is merged sooner and more settlement happens at less time. Moreover in column-less model, settlement curve slope is about zero at some cycles, especially final cycles, this is while in stone column model the phenomenon does not happen.

Brushing increased RGRm; neither burial nor defoliation independently affected RGRm, but together they reduced it. Among buried plants, brushing positively affected stem rigidity and strength through increasing RGRd, E, I and EI, and at whole plant level this resulted in a larger BSF and Flateral.

Soil water content (SWC) and predawn leaf water potential (ΨWP) were measured four times during each drought cycle. In parallel, relative leaf water con-tent (RWC) and specific leaf area (SLA) were estimated on leaves {{collected from the}} top to bottom of each cutting. Under well-watered conditions, ‘Luisa_Avanzo’and ‘Dorskamp’dif-fered in their patterns of leaf area expansion. Although dura-tion of leaf expansion was similar between clones, ‘Luisa_ Avanzo’exhibited higher total leaf number increment rates and individual leaf area increases than ‘Dorskamp. ’ As a result, ‘Luisa_Avanzo ’ cuttings reached larger individual and total leaf areas than ‘Dorskamp. ’ ‘Dorskamp ’ leaves had lower SLA than ‘Luisa_Avanzo ’ leaves. In response to successive drought cycles, both clones underwent decreases in total leaf number increment rates and in total leaf area expansion rates, but both whole-plant and individual leaf areas were drastically reduced only in ‘Luisa_Avanzo. ’ ‘Dorskamp ’ maintained a constant leaf area {{as a result of}} an increase in the duration of leaf expan-sion during drought and a significant stimulation of individual leaf area expansion rate and total leaf number <b>increment</b> <b>rate</b> in response to re-watering.

In both clones, re-watering caused partial recovery of SLA to control values. Our data con-firm previous field and greenhouse observations that ‘Dorskamp ’ is more tolerant to successive drought and re-wa-tering cycles than ‘Luisa_Avanzo. ’ We conclude that this dif-ference is mainly attributable to the plasticity of ‘Dorskamp’ after re-watering, rather than to clonal differences in drought responses...|$|E
