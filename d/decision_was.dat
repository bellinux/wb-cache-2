5|$|High Explosive Research was the British {{project to}} {{independently}} develop atomic bombs after the Second World War. This <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> {{taken by a}} cabinet sub-committee on 8 January 1947, in response to apprehension of an American return to isolationism, fears that Britain might lose its great power status, and the actions by the United States to unilaterally withdraw from sharing of nuclear technology under the 1943 Quebec Agreement. The <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{argued that}} the Federal Circuit's <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent. They further argued {{that this was not}} an {{appropriate}} case to hear, as the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale. The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E

5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn {{to give the impression that}} her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E

5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made and not whether the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E
5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of judges to live outside their districts.

5|$|After {{construction}} of the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge was completed in late 1902, tolls were immediately charged along the one lane structure. However, unlike the other two bridges, the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge cost $0.22 (1902 USD). A person traveling on foot {{did not have to}} pay to cross the structure. This <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> different compared to the other bridges, which made it separate. Another <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> that ministers were not tolled so they could better serve their communities. However, when one minister began to abuse the special privilege, he was charged $0.05 for crossing. The tollhouse for collection was in Milanville and was run by the Dexter family.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} highly exaggerated {{reports about}} the role of the Christians and their help to the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu decided to minimise the threat to his kingdom from the British and banish the Christians of Canara. According to Severine Silva, this <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> the logical outcome of the plans he had nurtured since the time of the conquest of Mangalore with his father Hyder in 1768.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock {{was moved to the}} London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, {{relocated}} to Regent's Park. This <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E

5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} carried a third less bombload, it proved more {{reliable}} in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it.

The aircraft operated with reserve squadrons until 1953.|$|E

5|$|Although this <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> {{a boon to}} the Stationers, it was short-lived. Following Millar, {{the right}} to print The Seasons was sold to a {{coalition}} of publishers including Thomas Becket. Two Scottish printers, Alexander and John Donaldson, began publishing an unlicensed edition, and Becket successfully obtained an injunction to stop them. This <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> appealed in Donaldson v Beckett, and eventually went to the House of Lords. After consulting with the judges of the King's Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas, the Lords concluded that copyright was not perpetual, and that the term permitted by the Statute of Anne was the maximum length of legal protection for publishers and authors alike.|$|E
