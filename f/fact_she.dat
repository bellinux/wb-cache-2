5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show.

5|$|Adams filed a countersuit, {{claiming}} {{the case was}} in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she {{claimed to be the}} author of all of the early titles. In <b>fact,</b> <b>she</b> had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship.

5|$|Mills booked {{herself into}} the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food vegan diet, using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills {{discovered}} {{that she had been}} previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type, when in <b>fact</b> <b>she</b> was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called blood type diet. As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she had the idea to collect thousands of discarded prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia's prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{believes}} that Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) {{does not know}} about his affair with her husband, but in <b>fact</b> <b>she</b> is playing dumb {{in order to keep}} Oscar off his guard while she makes arrangements to have him killed. She goes to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) for help, without telling him the details, and he calls a fellow former volunteer sheriff's deputy named Trevor (Chris Gethard) for assistance.

Dwight realizes the target is Oscar when Angela angrily crushes a cookie given to her by Oscar. Dwight tries to get Angela to reconsider, but Trevor has already arrived to carry out the job. Dwight rushes to get Oscar out. They run into Trevor outside. A struggle between the three men ensues, with Oscar ultimately managing to take away Trevor's lead pipe. When Trevor runs away, Oscar and Dwight are confronted by Angela, who blames Oscar for turning her husband gay. Oscar says that he was always gay, and refuses to hand the lead pipe over to Angela. She kicks him in the shin instead. Upset that they do not understand homosexuality, Dwight and Angela go to Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), who is confounded by their outlandish questions over homosexual activity.|$|E

Rachel confronts Quinn about being a spy in the glee club for Sue and tells her that she will be kicked of the Cheerios once Sue finds out about her pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the case turned largely on the {{question}} of who had written the Nancy Drew series. Adams filed a countersuit, claiming that, as author of the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many Nancy Drew titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In <b>fact,</b> <b>she</b> had rewritten the older titles, but was not the original author. When Mildred Benson, the author of the early Nancy Drew volumes, was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series of both Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E

60|$|Beast {{though he}} was, Peter of Colfax stood {{high in the}} favor of the King; and the <b>fact</b> that <b>she</b> was his niece would scarce aid her cause with Henry, for it was more than counter-balanced by the <b>fact</b> that <b>she</b> was the {{daughter}} of Simon de Montfort, whom he feared and hated.|$|R
50|$|Despite the <b>fact</b> that <b>she</b> bore Akbar no children, Ruqaiya {{was always}} kept in high regard by her husband. This was {{evidenced}} by the <b>fact</b> that <b>she</b> remained his sole chief consort {{from the time of}} their marriage in 1557 until his death in 1605. Ruqaiya was thus, the most senior lady in the imperial harem and at court during her husband's reign as well as in his successor's (Jahangir) reign. This was primarily due to her exalted lineage, the <b>fact</b> that <b>she</b> was Mirza Hindal's daughter, a Mughal princess as well as Akbar's first and chief wife.|$|R
5000|$|Former Stanford President Gerhard Casper {{said the}} {{university}} was [...] "most fortunate in persuading someone of Professor Rice's exceptional talents and proven ability in critical situations {{to take on this}} task. Everything she has done, she has done well; I have every confidence that she will continue that record as provost." [...] Acknowledging Rice's unique character, Casper told the New Yorker in 2002 that it [...] "would be disingenuous for me to say that the <b>fact</b> that <b>she</b> was a woman, the <b>fact</b> that <b>she</b> was black and the <b>fact</b> that <b>she</b> was young weren't in my mind." ...|$|R
