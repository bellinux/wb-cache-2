This is {{strictly}} accidental, it just happened to come out right. You know, I try to make them all good, but some come out and some don't. With this one everything seemed to come out right. The actors fell in, the photography fell in and the story clicked. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> lot of breaks!" ...|$|E
500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of her through the door. Sitting {{on top of the}} piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E

The pond has a maximum depth of [...] In May 2006, {{when asked to}} name the best moment in his administration, Bush jokingly said: [...] "I would say the best moment was when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> [...] largemouth bass on my lake." ...|$|E
60|$|Once also <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>an</b> old bear {{enjoying himself}} in a curious way. It was one {{intensely}} hot day, {{in the heart of}} a New Brunswick wilderness. Mooween came out onto the lake shore and lumbered along, twisting uneasily and rolling his head as if very much distressed by the heat. I followed silently close behind in my canoe.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> up <b>a</b> {{bundle of}} papers from {{my desk and}} stole softly from the room. Ray was close at hand, and I called to him.|$|R
60|$|But as Thurid's foot swung so did mine, and <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> him <b>a</b> painful blow {{upon the}} shin bone that saved Xodar from this added ignominy.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{would like}} to {{apologize}} once again to all of my fans here in New Zealand for having to cancel my last two shows of my tour. This is my first time in your beautiful country and I have really {{been looking forward to}} performing for you all. Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> bad flu virus and I {{have not been able to}} recover in time. Thank you all for your continued love and support and I can't wait for the next time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, matters {{got worse}} for the Wolverines, as they {{finished}} in last place with a 28-84 record. Bennett's batting average fell to [...]264, but his on-base percentage remained high at [...]334, and his WAR rating remained strong at 4.1. [...] Bennett later recalled the toll of multiple losing seasons in Detroit: [...] "During {{the next four years}} [...] I wished many times I was out of Detroit, or, rather, out of that team. [...] It was awful. [...] I thought sometimes we were lucky to finish last. [...] Once we lost twenty-five straight games. [...] Every week <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> new pitcher." ...|$|E
60|$|With thrilling, reawakened eagerness, I {{strained}} my hearing. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> faint sound, {{then lost}} it.|$|E
6000|$|And as {{in denial}} of guilt, the one-legged boy replied: [...] "It ain't nothin'. <b>I</b> jes' <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> cold last week, Mr. Inspector, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe there}} is some wild animal up yonder tree, {{spotting}} us," [...] answered Tom. [...] "I think <b>I</b> just <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of its eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the least idea. <b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> few words, and may be wrong; still, it will do no harm should I be mistaken." ...|$|R
60|$|White {{opened the}} door. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of blue uniforms, and {{came forward to}} do the honours.|$|E
60|$|The {{sunlight}} {{was leaving}} the park. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glint of silver to the southward beyond the wooded ridge.|$|E
60|$|But {{through the}} trees <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of Audrey, walking on the lawn; and the assault was never made.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then I {{will come}} round to your place. I really am {{curious to see}} the girl. <b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> passing glimpse {{of her in the}} park that day." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> at <b>a</b> straw. [...] "Sylvia," [...] I cried, [...] "let us {{sit down}} and finish the story! We can surely do that. Come, it is all ready in my mind. I will dictate rapidly." ...|$|R
60|$|Madame Blumenthal seemed, for the time, to have abjured the Kursaal, and <b>I</b> never <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{glimpse of}} her. Her young friend, apparently, was an {{interesting}} study, and the studious mind prefers seclusion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But Mrs. Doncastle's new maid--if {{that was}} she <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{glimpse of the}} other day--is ever so much older than you--a dozen years.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Kernan. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> cold on the car. There's {{something}} {{keeps coming}} into my throat, phlegm or----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... --No, Ned Lambert gasped, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a...</b> {{cold night}} before... blast your soul... night before last... {{and there was}} a hell of a lot of draught...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} why he said this, for I felt certain <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> gleam of {{recognition}} in his eyes. I was not so easily abashed as I had been some years earlier.|$|R
60|$|Next moment I was cantering {{away after}} Colonel Durnford, whom <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> up about <b>a</b> {{quarter of a}} mile from the camp.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{glimpse of}} Ogden as Mr Abney showed {{him into his}} study. He seemed a self-possessed boy, very like but, if anything, uglier than the {{portrait}} of him which I had seen at the Hotel Guelph.|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed to}} an oaken cupboard, {{and as he}} threw it open <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of glistening rows of {{parallel}} barrels, like the pipes of an organ.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He's got away,' I heard Fred say to his father, {{and just}} {{as he said it}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> faint sound of someone moving in the {{branches}} above me.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} black with shadow, {{but in her}} voice <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> hint of tears, and I {{wondered}} whether they were shed on my behalf or on her own.|$|E
6000|$|... "S'nore, si--though {{my mother}} {{having been a}} French woman, {{they tell me that}} <b>I</b> have <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> little from her. We all get {{something}} from our mothers, eccellenza; and it's a pity we could not keep more of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Six o'clock came, and the coach, and the {{man from}} the [...] "Green Dragon" [...] with a portmanteau, and a fat old gentleman walking behind, of whom <b>I</b> just <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glimpse--a venerable old gentleman: I thought I'd seen him before.|$|R
6000|$|... "I almost require {{introducing}} to you, for <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> but <b>a</b> {{glimpse of}} you as we crossed the river, and you look so different {{now that you have}} got rid of that hideous attire that I don't think that I should have known you." ...|$|R
60|$|At first I {{could see}} nothing, but {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{glimpse of a}} bit of smooth and glossy green moving among the scarlet and purple and yellow of the vegetation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{answered}} Mr. Bridmain; 'they show us {{into such}} a bad pew at Milby--just {{where there is a}} draught from that door. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> stiff neck the first time I went there.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found nothing}} worth {{notice in the}} church, {{and was about to}} leave it again, when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of a pretty view through a side door, and stopped to admire it.|$|E
60|$|I nudged him in {{the ribs}} to make him keep quiet, for <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of <b>a</b> gleam from Ayesha's veiled eyes, which were {{regarding}} me curiously.|$|R
60|$|I {{was just}} going to run, when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of <b>a</b> morsel of a child {{carrying}} a big book, and stopped, {{to see what was going}} on.|$|R
60|$|But I knew better. <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{look now}} and again--an undefinable glance, which {{told me the}} whole pitiable tale. She did not love Rochez; and in the drama which we were {{preparing}} to enact the curtain would fall on his rapture and her unhappiness.|$|R
