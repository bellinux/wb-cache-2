40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{intensified}} human activities, {{atmospheric nitrogen}} deposition and agricultural and urban runoff have largely increased {{and led to}} the shifts in the N: P supply ratios in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we examined the effects of N and P supply in waters and nutrient level in substrate on the growth and biomass allocation of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides. In the experiment, A. philoxeroides was applied to five combinations of water N and P supply across <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>nutrient</b> levels in substrate. The growth of A. philoxeroides was determined by N: P ratio and increased with the increase of N: P ratio. High nutrients in substrate also promoted the clonal growth and aboveground allocation of A. philoxeroides. Therefore, high soil nutrients at the water’s edge and high N: P supply ratio in water will facilitate the expansion and invasion of A. philoxeroides in aquatic habitats. In the context of increased anthropogenic nitrogen deposition and runoff inputs with high relative level of N, the invasion of A. philoxeroides to aquatic environments needs more attention...|$|R

40|$|Under {{conditions}} of stress, shallow freshwater ecosystems can undergo a state change {{characterized by the}} rapid loss of macrophytes and subsequent dominance of phytoplankton. Elevated water temperature may promote such change. Here we report the impact of two warming regimes (continuous 3 �C above ambient and 3 �C above ambient during summer only), <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>nutrient</b> loadings and {{the presence or absence}} of fish, on 48 microcosm ecosystems created to mimic shallow pond environments. We found that warming did not significantly encourage phytoplankton blooms, even in combination with increased nutrients and fish. Instead, macrophyte communities remained dominant. Macrophyte-associated invertebrates (gastropods and ostracods) increased in numbers in the warmed microcosms, potentially helping to stabilize the macrophyte communities. Nevertheless, warming produced trends in water chemistry that could be problematic. It increased phosphorus concentrations, total alkalinity, and conductivity. It decreased pH and oxygen saturation and increased the frequency of severe deoxygenation. These trends were largely independent of the other experimental treatments and support the suggestion that moderate warming has the potential to exacerbate existing eutrophication problems.

40|$|Aims: Many {{experiments}} {{have shown a}} positive effect of species richness on productivity in grassland plant communities. However, it is poorly understood how environmental conditions affect this relationship. We aimed to test whether deep soil and limiting nutrient conditions increase the complementarity effect (CE) of species richness due to enhanced potential for resource partitioning. Methods: We grew monocultures and mixtures of four common grassland species in pots on shallow and deep soil, factorially combined <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>nutrient</b> levels. Soil volume was kept constant to avoid confounding soil depth and volume. Using an additive partitioning method, we separated biodiversity effects on plant productivity into components due to species complementarity and dominance. Important findings: Net biodiversity and complementarity effects were consistently higher in shallow pots, which was unexpected, and at the low <b>nutrient</b> level. These <b>two</b> results suggest that although belowground partitioning of resources was important, especially under low nutrient conditions, it was not {{due to differences in}} rooting depths.

The {{aim of the}} study was to determine growth, root morphology, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition, and metabolic profiling of greenhouse lettuce either untreated or treated (root or leaf-root application) with a plant-derived protein hydrolysate. For foliar application, plants were sprayed with 2. 5 ml L- 1, whereas for root application, 100 ml of solution with the same concentration was applied to the growing medium at weekly intervals. Lettuce plants were supplied <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>nutrient</b> solutions: non-salt control (1 mM NaCl) or 25 mM NaCl. Salt stress decreased shoot and root dry biomass, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition and increased foliar proline concentration. Root and leaf-root application of the biostimulant increased fresh yield, dry biomass and root dry weight of lettuce under salinity conditions. This was associated with an improvement of plant nitrogen metabolism and an increase of the Fv/Fm-ratio efficiency in biostimulant-treated plants. Oxidative stress mitigation, increase in osmolytes, changes in sterols and terpenes composition, as well as the less expected increase in glucosinolates were also observed in biostimulant-treated plants grown under saline conditions.

Area of study: Post-planting performance was assessed at two sites in the Valsain Forest (Central Mountain Range, Segovia, Spain). Materials and Methods: Seedlings were grown using the same seed-lot, container type and fertirrigation schedule. A soluble <b>fertilizer</b> <b>with</b> <b>two</b> contrasting doses resulting in 239 and 376 mg N per seedling was applied during the whole culture period. Seedlings grown under {{the highest level of}} fertilization had greater root collar diameter, height, shoot to root ratio, root and shoot mass, and root growth potential before planting. Post-planting performance was assessed at two sites in the Valsain Forest (Central Mountain Range, Segovia, Spain). In each site, seedlings from both fertilization treatments were planted in three plots with contrasting light environment (full sunlight, and under Pinus sylvestris stands with moderate and deep shade conditions). Survival, diameter and height growth were monitored for six years. Main results: Nursery fertilization did not affect survival, but high fertilization enhanced post-planting growth. Survival was highest under deep shade conditions but growth in this microsite was lower than in higher light sites, revealing a trade-off for survival and growth across light levels. Research highlights: The lower fertilization rate used in this study was suitable to produce seedlings with acceptable quality. Planting under shaded conditions (light availability< 30 %) is recommended to maximize the initial success of yew plantations in Mediterranean mountains.

Twenty-nine open-pollinated families, randomly selected in a seed orchard, were cultivated for 23 weeks in a greenhouse in a split-plot design under controlled conditions. Two water regimes (high and low water supply) combined <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>nutrient</b> regimes (high and low nutrient supply) were applied by subirrigation. Both the irrigation and the fertilization treatments had a strong effect in all the assessed traits. Heritabilities for growth and biomass traits were moderate to high (0. 2 – 0. 5) in individual treatments, especially in those treatments that led to intermediate growth. However, when analyzing all treatments together, the impact of the family × treatment interactions led to an important reduction (0. 1 – 0. 2) of the heritability estimates. The results indicated that the genotype × water and genotype × nutrient interactions may be important and could not be ignored in the Galician maritime pine breeding program. However, the study of the family ecovalence values indicated that interactions are mainly due to some interactive families (7 to 31 % of families). Culling several of the female parents with high ecovalence values would result in a stable breeding population and would be enough to overcome the interaction handicap in the breeding program.

V. natans growth decreased significantly with increasing N loading, the effect being dependent, however, on the nutrient status of the sediment.

The larger effect in the nutrient-rich sediment may reflect an observed higher shading of phytoplankton and excess nutrient accumulation in plant tissue, though potential toxic effects of the high-nutrient sediment may also have contributed. Our study confirms the occurrence of a negative effect of increasing N loading on submerged plant growth in shallow nutrient-enriched lakes and further shows that this effect is augmented when the plants grow in nutrient-rich sediment.

In the layered pot system the upper soil was supplied with P and either kept watered or allowed to dry or left P-deficient but watered, whereas the lower soil was watered and fertilised with K. Greater reductions in shoot growth, root length and dry weight in the upper soil layer occurred in -P/wet than in +P/dry upper soil treatment. Shoot P concentration and total P content were reduced by P deficiency but not by upper soil drying. Genotypic responses showed that K-efficient cv.

40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. The poultry {{industry}} {{is an important}} component of agricultural production in the Southern Piedmont of Georgia. Associated manures are typically surface-applied to pastures as a fertilizer for forages. However, this surface application of manures allows phosphorus (P) to accumulate at the soil surface and runoff to become contaminated with P and to transport it to surface waters. As such, a study was conducted to examine the conservation potential of mechanical aeration of grasslands. Mechanical aeration has potential to reduce P transport by partially incorporating applied manures, allowing for more P adsorption by the soil, increasing infiltration by breaking the soil surface, and by slowing runoff flow by increasing the roughness of the landscape. We examined the effects of four aeration treatments (aeration with cores, “no-till” disk aeration perpendicular to the slope, aeration with spikes, and no aeration treatment) on the export of dissolved reactive P (DRP) in surface runoff from grasslands <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>nutrient</b> treatments (broiler litter and a control of no manure). Plots (0. 75 x 2 m) were established on a Cecil soil series with mixed tall fescue/bermudagrass vegetation on 8 to 12 % slopes. Plots were then aerated and manures applied at a rate of 30 kg P ha- 1, prior to simulated rainfall at a rate of 75 mm h- 1. While aeration had minimal impact on volume of runoff, core aeration decreased DRP loads (P < 0. 05) from applied broiler litter by 61 %. Given that Cecil soil is common in pastures receiving broiler litter in the Southern Piedmont, these results suggest that core aeration could have a widespread impact on water quality in the Southern Piedmont region.

40|$|We {{tested the}} effects of {{ungulate}} grazing and nutrient availability on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) emissions in semi-natural temperate grassland. To do this, soil taken from long term grazed and ungrazed grassland was incubated at four temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 20 °C) <b>with</b> <b>two</b> levels of <b>nutrient</b> (NP) addition. The {{results showed that the}} variation in soil CO 2 and CH 4 emissions was explained by temperature and grazing, with grazing increasing the temperature sensitivity of CO 2 and CH 4 production by between 15 and 20 °C. This response was constrained by nutrient availability for CO 2, but not CH 4. These findings suggest that grazing could potentially have important impacts on the temperature sensitivity of greenhouse gas emissions in nutrient limited grassland...|$|R
40|$|Three {{plant growth}} {{enhancement}} chemistries (AuxiGro®, ChaperoneTM, HappyGroTM) were evaluated on DPL 449 BR cotton {{during the summer}} of 2005, Application were made during mid-July to late planted cotton to evaluate and compare effects of these products on cotton growing under severe heat and growth stress to determine if such chemistries could overcome this stress. Two foliar <b>fertilizers</b> were included <b>with</b> <b>two</b> formulations of AuxiGro® to determine if differences associated with these treatments existed. Usage of HappyGroTM = PhotoGroTM resulted in the most fruiting structures/plant while treatments that included ChaperoneTM resulted in reduced numbers of structures when compared with the untreated check on August 24. Highest yields among products tested were noted for the formulations of AuxiGro® 518 which were slightly higher than the untreated check.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} if there are any health eﬀects of long-term consumption of organically grown crops using a rat model. Crops were retrieved over two years from along-term ﬁeld trial at three diﬀerent locations in Denmark, using three diﬀerent cultivation systems(OA, organic based on livestock manure; OB, organic based on green manure; and C, conventional <b>with</b> mineral <b>fertilizers</b> and pesticides) <b>with</b> <b>two</b> ﬁeld replicates. The cultivation system {{had an impact on the}} nutritional quality, aﬀecting γ-tocopherol, some amino acids, and fatty acid composition. Additionally, the nutritional quality was aﬀected by harvest year and location. However, harvest year and location rather than cultivation system aﬀected the measured health biomarkers. In conclusion, the diﬀerences in dietary treatments composed of ingredients from diﬀerent cultivation systems did not lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the measured health biomarkers, except for a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in plasma IgGl evels...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{and soil}} types are usually {{considered}} {{as the two}} main drivers of the rhizosphere microbial communities. The aim of this work was to study the effect of both N availability and plant genotype on the plant associated rhizosphere microbial communities, {{in relation to the}} nutritional strategies of the plant-microbe interactions, for six contrasted Medicago truncatula genotypes. The plants were provided <b>with</b> <b>two</b> different <b>nutrient</b> solutions varying in their nitrate concentrations (0 mM and 10 mM). First, the influence of both nitrogen availability and Medicago truncatula genotype on the genetic structure of the soil bacterial and fungal communities was determined by DNA fingerprint using Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA). Secondly, the different nutritional strategies of the plant-microbe interactions were evaluated using an ecophysiological framework. We observed that nitrogen availability affected rhizosphere bacterial communities only in presence of the plant. Furthermore, we showed that the influence of nitrogen availability on rhizosphere bacterial communities was dependent on the different genotypes of Medicago truncatula. Finally, the nutritional strategies of the plant varied greatly in response to a modification of nitrogen availability. A new conceptual framework was thus developed to study plant-microbe interactions. This framework led to the identification of three contrasted structural and functional adaptive responses of plant-microbe interactions to nitrogen availability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Mineral-N {{fertilization}} {{can lead}} to a short-term enhancement of N 2 O emission from cultivated land. The aim of this field study was the quantitative determi-nation of the short-term N 2 O emission after application of a <b>fertilizer</b> <b>with</b> the new nitrification inhibitor (NI) 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to winter wheat. NO 3 – and NH 4 + <b>fertilizers</b> labelled <b>with</b> 15 N in liquid and granulated form were used in specific fertili-zer strategies. N <b>fertilizers</b> <b>with</b> higher NO 3 – contents caused higher N 2 O emission than NH 4 + <b>fertilizers.</b> For <b>fertilizers</b> <b>with</b> NIs, used in simplified <b>fertilizer</b> strate-gies <b>with</b> fewer applications and an earlier timing of the N fertilization, the N 2 O release was reduced by about 20 %. Of the total N 2 O emission measured, 10 – 40 % was attributed to fertilizer N and 60 – 90 % originated from soil N. Besides the fertilizer NO 3 –-N, the microbial available-N pool in the soil represented a further impor-tant source for N 2 O losses. Compared to liquid fertili-zers, the application in granulated form led to smaller N 2 O emissions. For <b>fertilizers</b> <b>with</b> NIs, the decrease in the N 2 O emission is mainly due to their low NO 3 –-N content and the possibility of reducing the number of ap-plications...|$|R
40|$|The glucose {{effect is}} a well known {{phenomenon}} whereby cells, when presented <b>with</b> <b>two</b> different <b>nutrients,</b> show a diauxic growth pattern, i. e. an episode of exponential growth followed by a lag phase of reduced growth followed by a second phase of exponential growth. Diauxic growth is usually {{thought of as a}} an adaptation to maximise biomass production in an environment offering two or more carbon sources. While diauxic growth has been studied widely both experimentally and theoretically, the hypothesis that diauxic growth is a strategy to increase overall growth has remained an unconfirmed conjecture. Here, we present a minimal mathematical model of a bacterial nutrient uptake system and metabolism. We subject this model to artificial evolution to test under which conditions diauxic growth evolves. As a result, we find that, indeed, sequential uptake of nutrients emerges if there is competition for nutrients and the metabolism/uptake system is capacity limited. However, we also find that diauxic growth is a secondary effect of this system and that the speed-up of nutrient uptake is a much larger effect. Notably, this speed-up of nutrient uptake coincides with an overall reduction of efficiency. Our two main conclusions are: (i) Cells competing for the same nutrients evolve rapid but inefficient growth dynamics. (ii) In the deterministic models we use here no substantial lag-phase evolves. This suggests that the lag-phase is a consequence of stochastic gene expression...|$|R

The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design arrangement with three replications. Salicylic acid alone reduced the plant height and thickened the stem. Plants supplied with a full strength solution had a ticker stem, produced more biomass, and showed higher values of Fv/Fm. Some changes in the uptake pattern of some nutrients, especially boron and sulfur, were noticed. Higher boron concentrations in leaves were in plants sprayed {{with a combination of}} 7 mM citric acid and 1 mM of salicylic acid. Applying combination of citric acid and salicylic acid was more effective than using them individually that suggests an effective synergism between them...|$|R
