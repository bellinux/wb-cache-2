40|$|Arrays {{of beating}} cilia emerged in nature {{as one of}} the most {{efficient}} propulsion mechanisms at a small scale, and are omnipresent in microorganisms. Previous attempts at mimicking these systems have foundered against the complexity of fabricating small-scale cilia exhibiting complex beating motions. In this paper, we propose for the first time arrays of pneumatically-actuated artificial cilia that are able to address some of these issues. These artificial cilia arrays consist of six highly flexible silicone rubber actuators with a diameter of 1 mm and a length of 8 mm that can be actuated independently from each other. In an experimental setup, the effects of the driving frequency, phase difference and duty cycle on the net flow in a closed-loop channel have been studied. Net fluid speeds of up to 19 mm s− 1 have been measured. Further, it is possible to invert the flow direction by simply changing the driving frequency or by changing the duty cycle of the <b>driving</b> <b>block</b> pulse pressure wave without changing the bending direction of the cilia. Using PIV measurements, we corroborate for the first time existing mathematical models of cilia arrays to measurements on prototypes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{possibility}} for physically based mathematical models of the voice source to accurately reproduce inverse filtered glottal volume-velocity waveforms. A low-dimensional, self-oscillating model of the glottal source with waveform-matching properties is proposed. The model relies on a lumped mechano-aerodynamic scheme loosely inspired by the one- and multimass lumped models. The vocal folds are represented by a single mechanical resonator and a propagation line which takes into account the vertical phase, differences. The vocal-fold displacement is coupled to the glottal flow by means of an aerodynamic <b>driving</b> <b>block</b> which includes a general parametric nonlinear component. The principal characteristics of the flow-induced oscillations are retained, and the overall model is able to match inverse-filtered glottal flow signals. The method offers in principle the possibility of performing transformations of the glottal flow by acting on the physiologically based parameters of the model. This is a desirable property, e. g., for speech synthesis applications. The model was tested on a data set which included inverse-filtered glottal flow waveforms of different characteristics. The results demonstrate the possibility of reproducing natural speech waveforms with high accuracy, and of controlling important characteristics of the synthesis such as pitch...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{whether and}} how udder health of a dairy herd in an automated milking system (AMS) could be continuously conserved, in order to enable lastingly economic milk production and high milk quality. To achieve this, the udder health of two dairy herds milked on a Lely-Astronaut, were studied over a longer period. Furthermore {{the performance of the}} diagnostic methods of the milking robot, and the effectiveness of the robots measures for conserving udder health were examined. As a result, a programme for safeguarding udder health of a dairy herd in an automated milking system was developed. Under good, concrete pre-conditions it was observed {{that it was possible to}} safeguard udder health of a herd milked in an AMS. The pre-condition of a problem herd and the absence of effective hygiene measures, on the other hand, led to a continuous decreasing of udder health. The insufficient milking hygiene of the robots on both farms pointed to a specific risk area for udder health. The fact that 180 milkings per day are done with one module, already presents a critical hygiene problem. Insufficient milking hygiene of the robots, creates an even greater problem. (This insufficient hygiene being the bad disinfection of the cleaning brushes, the brush <b>driving</b> <b>block</b> and the teat cup rubbers, between two milkings, and the main rinsing of the robots.) Due to this situation the transfer of pathogens from cow to cow could not be prevented, therefore increasing the risk of mastitis. It is due to this that the two external influences, husbandry and feeding, are very important in keeping cows udders clean. These factors are also important with regard to producing the highest milk yields. The appropriate requirements of the cows, with regard to husbandry and feeding, have to be met to minimise the risk of mastitis. Cleaning and disinfection of the barn ensures a long-lasting low number of pathogens in the cows environment. A further weak point of the milking robot is its inaccuracy in diagnosing mastitis. Neither the electrical conductivity, nor the data of the MQC, were able to give definite diagnosis on the existence or non-existence of mastitis. If there will be no more accurate additional examinations of udder health, big financial losses have to be expected and with a view to consumer protection it is not acceptable. It is therefore necessary that veterinary examinations of herd udder health should be carried out at regular intervals with the help of regular diagnostic methods (clinical, bacteriological, cytological), for accurate diagnosis of mastitis. Analysis of data and veterinary advice to the farmer and staff have to follow. Furthermore the somatic cell count from the monthly milk recording of individual animals, as well as the somatic cell count from the bulk tank should be used for analysis. With regard to the utilization of foremilk for diagnosis, it was detected that the foremilk was not separated, and therefore was always added to the bulk milk, apart from the foremilk of treated cows, of which milk were separated. The California Mastitis Test, is a suitable test for use in the AMS, but only if the cows were tested directly before their normal milking time (milking interval > 5 hrs.) With regard to food production, the continued usage of antibiotic treated cows in the robot-herd, and the influence of the milking frequency on iodine concentration in milk was examined. In 27, 3 % of the cases, the milk of the following milked cow, contained residues of the antibiotic from the previous milked cow. The contamination of the bulk milk with antibiotics could not be prevented by the rinsing after milking of a treated cow. No correlation between iodine concentration and milking frequency could be detected. All data regarding iodine concentration in AMS milk shows, that it is safe for human consumption. It was also noted that the connection between milking interval and udder health, was greatly influenced by the lactation number. It was detected that the connection between milking interval and quarter somatic cell count was influenced by the existence of pathogens in the quarter. Because low somatic cell counts and high milk yields are required, milking intervals of minimal 5 and maximal 12 hours have to be met. The results of the studies show, that the production of high quality milk with an AMS, needs a change of farmers work to strategic prophylactic measures in all husbandry areas. Veterinary support characterised by expertise regarding AMS is therefore necessary. <br /...|$|E

All of the passengers completed three separate, counterbalanced blocks of tasks that consisted of two single-task <b>blocks</b> (<b>driving</b> only and conversing only) and one dual-task <b>block</b> (<b>driving</b> and conversing). The results showed greater variability in velocity, lane keeping and steering control under single-task than under dual-task conditions.

Older drivers exhibited greater variability in velocity, stayed closer to the center of the lane, and waited longer to cross intersections than their younger counterparts, suggesting that they compensate for their declining perceptual and cognitive abilities through changes in driving behavior.

40|$|Abstract: The {{thermodynamics}} of self-assembling {{systems are}} {{discussed in terms of}} the chemical interactions and the intermolecular forces between species. It is clear that there are both theoretical and practical limitations on the dimensions and the structural regularity of these systems. These considerations are made with reference to the microphase separation that occurs in block copolymer (BCP) systems. BCP systems self-assemble via a thermodynamic driven process where chemical dis-affinity between the <b>blocks</b> <b>driving</b> them part is balanced by a restorative force deriving from the chemical bond between the blocks. These systems are attracting much interest because of their possible role in nanoelectronic fabrication. This form of self-assembly can obtain highly regular nanopatterns in certain circumstances where the orientation and alignment of chemically distinct blocks can be guided through molecular interactions between the polymer and the surrounding interfaces. However, for this to be possible, great care must be taken to properly engineer the interactions between the surfaces and the polymer blocks. The optimum methods of structure directing are chemical pre-patterning (defining regions on the substrate of different chemistry) and graphoepitaxy (topographical alignment) but bot...|$|R
40|$|Nastic {{structures}} {{are capable of}} three dimensional shape change using biological principles borrowed from plant motion. The plant motor cells increase or decrease in size through a change in osmotic pressure. When nonuniform cell swelling occurs, it causes the plant tissue to warp and change shape, resulting it net movement, known as nastic motion, {{which is the same}} phenomena that causes plants to angle their broad leaf and flower surfaces to face light sources. The nastic structures considered in this paper are composed of a bilayer of microactuator arrays with a fluid reservoir in between the two layers. The actuators are housed in a thin plate and expand when water from the fluid reservoir is pumped into the actuation chamber through a phospholipid bilayer with embedded active transport proteins, which move the water from the low pressure fluid reservoir into a high pressure actuation chamber. Increasing water pressure inside the actuator causes lateral expansion and axial bulging, and the non-uniform net volume change of actuators throughout the nastic structure results in twisting or bending shape change. Modifying the actuation displacement allows controlled volume change. This paper presents an analytical model of the <b>driving</b> and <b>blocking</b> forces involved in actuation, as well as stress and strain that occurs due to the pressure changes. Actuation is driven by increasing osmotic pressure, and blocking forces are taken into consideration to plan actuator response so that outside forces do not counteract the displacement of actuation. Nastic {{structures are}} designed with use in unmanned aerial vehicles in mind, so blocking forces are modeled to be similar to in-flight conditions. Stress in the system is modeled so that any residual strain or lasting deformation can be determined, as well as a lifespan before failure from repeated actuation.
