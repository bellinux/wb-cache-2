5|$|In a final {{flashback}} scene, Guevara is {{aboard the}} Granma in 1956, {{looking out over}} the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees the Castro brothers alone at the bow of the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E
25|$|In {{all three}} works of The Russian Series {{the details are}} located in the corners or away from the center. The wholeness of the “sandy color, that of soil” is left intact, {{interrupted}} in a discrete manner almost secretively or mistakenly. Yet the dominance of the center overpowers the viewer, returning <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the middle and away from the discrepancies in color. Kabakov would repeat this strategy from 1983-1988 with a second series called Three Green Paintings. In this series, rather than depict objects, he placed texts on the upper left and right hand corners of what is otherwise a field of green enamel paint.|$|E
60|$|With anxious eye {{he turned}} <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the other harbors, and {{suddenly}} gave a start.|$|E
60|$|But ever <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> {{returned}} <b>to</b> {{the wonderful}} lily beside the bubbling spring.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Leavenworth had {{apparently}} just transferred <b>his</b> unhurrying <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the figure.|$|R
60|$|The cowboy shifted <b>his</b> dark <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> Madeline. He {{was cool}} and slow.|$|R
6000|$|... "He rewarded her," [...] said Webster, {{allowing}} <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> stray nonchalantly {{over the}} countryside, [...] "liberally, very liberally." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{ashamed to}} say, sir, that of late I {{have been doing}} just those things," [...] replied Neale, and he raised <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> his chief's.|$|E
60|$|Perched on {{a little}} hillock, and {{straining}} <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the south, the old priest was speaking loudly and excitedly. The crowd deserted us, and gathered about him.|$|E
60|$|Shefford {{had not yet}} {{control of}} speech. Something in <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> {{appeared}} <b>to</b> drive Joe frantic.|$|R
6000|$|Miltoun unshaded <b>his</b> face. <b>His</b> <b>gaze</b> seemed <b>to</b> have {{to travel}} from an immense {{distance}} before it reached Courtier. He answered: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>gaze</b> chanced <b>to</b> {{fall on the}} gold-pan. He {{walked over}} and gravely kicked it, {{scattering}} the gold over the landscape.|$|R
60|$|Addressed thus directly, {{the manager}} allowed <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> wander from the ceiling. He eyed Psmith {{for a moment}} like an elderly basilisk, then {{looked back at the}} ceiling again.|$|E
60|$|He dozed off. The sun was warm, and {{the grass}} very soft and comfortable. Kennedy turned <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the Reservoir again. It was no {{business}} of his what Walton and Perry did.|$|E
6000|$|... "The deuce you be!" [...] said Timothy Fairway, {{enlarging}} <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> cover Christian's whole {{surface and}} a great deal more; Grandfer Cantle meanwhile staring as a hen stares at the duck she has hatched.|$|E
60|$|The {{secretary}} contemplated Bert's collar with sustained attention. Only for {{one moment}} did <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> move <b>to</b> the sandals and back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Peg, listen!" [...] he whispered. <b>His</b> <b>gaze</b> seemed <b>to</b> hypnotize Ken. [...] "Do {{you have}} any idea what you'll do to this bunch from State?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} to Carthoris, but ever <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> wandered <b>to</b> the perfect lines of Thuvia's glorious figure, which the harness of a Barsoomian princess accentuated rather than concealed.|$|R
6000|$|The gentleman {{looked at}} Mr. Lavender very {{suddenly}} {{at the words}} [...] "tiring of this job," [...] and transferred <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the Secretary, who had bent his face down to his papers, and was smothering a snigger with his hand.|$|E
6000|$|The Mormon flung high {{his arms}} and let out the stentorian yell that had rolled down to the fugitives as they waited {{at the mouth of}} Nonnezoshe Boco. But now it had a wilder, more exultant note. Strange how he shifted <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> Fay Larkin! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At night--then--I {{could get}} round him," [...] said Slone, {{thinking}} hard and narrowing <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> scan {{the circle of}} wall and slope. [...] "Why not? ... No wind at night. That grass would burn slow till mornin'--till the wind came up--an' it's been west for days." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{policeman}} {{passed a}} second time; <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> seemed <b>to</b> say, [...] "Now, what's a toff doing on that seat {{with those two}} rotters?" [...] And Shelton caught his eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "More's the pity," [...] said Glenn. Then after a moment, {{in which}} <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> {{returned}} <b>to</b> the fire, he inquired rather too casually, [...] "Does Morrison still chase after you?" ...|$|R
60|$|His {{look was}} a stern one, and <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> seemed <b>to</b> bore Tom through and through. Yet the lad did not flinch. He {{felt that he}} must play his part to the end.|$|R
60|$|The {{blacks were}} half-way across the {{clearing}} when Tarzan's attention was {{attracted by the}} actions of one of the apes. The beast was glaring toward one of the huts. Tarzan followed <b>his</b> <b>gaze.</b> <b>To</b> his infinite relief and delight he saw the stalwart form of Mugambi racing toward him.|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} turned away. Boldwood dropped <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the ground, and stood long {{like a man who}} did not know where he was. Realities then {{returned}} upon him like the pain of a wound received in an excitement which eclipses it, and he, too, then went on.|$|E
60|$|Barely {{had they}} rowed a dozen strokes, when an exclamation from Big John {{led them to}} follow <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the schooners {{forecastle}}-head, where the forecastle cat flashed across {{in pursuit of a}} big rat. Other rats they saw, evidently driven out of their lairs by the rising water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheer up, old thing!" [...] said Archie. [...] "The relief {{expedition}} has arrived." [...] He directed <b>his</b> companion's <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the poster. [...] "Cast {{your eye}} over that. How does that strike you?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was beside}} her now. His hand was up her shoulder. His eyes were down-bent toward hers. She {{looked up into}} <b>his</b> face. <b>His</b> <b>gaze</b> seemed <b>to</b> bore {{straight}} through her to some hidden spring of sentiment within her.|$|R
50|$|For a time, the Needle's {{powers were}} {{enhanced}} by Satannish, increasing his physical attributes {{to that of}} an athletic man, allowing <b>his</b> hypnotic <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> work instantaneously, and rendering his weapon sharp enough to rend cinder block.|$|R
60|$|As she answered, he was {{occupied}} with noting the faintest hint of bronze--perhaps {{a trick of}} the light--in her long, brown lashes. Perforce, he lifted <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> her eyebrows, brown, delicately stenciled, and made sure that the hint of bronze was there. Still lifting <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> her high-piled hair, he again saw, but more pronounced, the bronze note glinting from the brown-golden hair. Nor did he fail to startle and thrill to a dazzlement of smile and teeth and eye that frequently lived its life in her face. Hers was no thin smile of restraint, he judged. When she smiled she smiled all of herself, generously, joyously, throwing the largess of all her being into the natural expression of what was herself and which domiciled somewhere within that pretty head of hers.|$|E
60|$|An Indian brave, {{whose eyes}} were {{directed}} sentimentally to the stars, {{as though he}} were thinking of his lady-love--or buffalo steaks and marrow-bones--cocked his ears and lowered <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> earth, but as nothing more was to be seen or heard, he raised his eyes and thoughts again to love--or marrow-bones.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} and opened the letter. Ginger, heaving himself on to the table, wriggled into a {{position}} of comfort and started to read his evening paper. But after he had skimmed over the sporting page he lowered it and allowed <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> rest on Sally's bent head {{with a feeling of}} utter contentment.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vickers rose and, {{approaching}} his offspring, inspected {{them with}} the same interest {{that he would have}} bestowed upon a wax-works. A certain stiffness of pose combined with the glassy stare which met <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> helped <b>to</b> favour the illusion.|$|R
6000|$|And as <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> {{continued}} <b>to</b> {{follow her}} across the compound to the tiny grass house, the realization came to him crushingly that Berande and that little grass house {{was the only place}} in the world she could call [...] "home." ...|$|R
60|$|Hegan {{stared at}} his chief, then passed <b>his</b> horror-stricken <b>gaze</b> on <b>to</b> Dede, who nodded in sympathy.|$|R
