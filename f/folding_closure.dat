40|$|A new {{procedure}} for event detection and characterization is proposed based on group delay and fixed point analysis. This method enables {{the detection of}} precise timing and spread of speech events such as a vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure.</b> A mapping {{from the center of}} a Gaussian time window to the mean time provides event locations as its fixed points. Refining these initial estimates using minimum phase group delay functions derived from the amplitude spectra provides accurate estimates of event locations and durations of excitations of each event. The proposed algorithm was tested using synthetic speech samples and natural speech database of simultaneously recorded sound waveforms and EGG signals. These tests revealed that the proposed method provides estimates of vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> instants with timing accuracy within 60 µs to 210 µs standard deviations. This algorithm is implemented to be suitable for real-time operation by making extensive use of FFTs without introducing any iterative procedures.

40|$|CONTEXT: Breathing and {{swallowing}} coordination, {{despite the}} expressive number of study, remain as theme deserving further research. OBJECTIVE: To identify a coordination pattern between swallowing {{and the natural}} breathing pause that occur in association with it (swallowing apnea) and also {{the relevance of the}} vocal <b>folds</b> <b>closure</b> in this process. METHODS: Sixty-six adults, male and female, including normal health people, post-laryngectomy individuals and patients with digestive complaints without dysphagia were analyzed. The respiratory air flux interruptions produced by wet requested swallows and dry, requested and spontaneous swallows, were registered using thermo and piezoelectric receptors coupled to synectics medical manometry equipment, using Polygram upper 4. 21 software. The results were analyzed with the Chi-square (3 × 2) and (2 × 2) nonparametric independency test with P = 0. 05. RESULTS: Swallowing apnea is a preventive breathing stop that start just before and stay present during all deglutition pharyngeal phase. It is a well coordinated phenomena that occur as pattern in association with low elastic resistance of the lung, on the expiratory final phase until inspiration initial phase. This breathing stoppage it is usually followed by a short expiraton preceding a new breathing cycle. The swallow apnea and vocal <b>folds</b> <b>closure</b> are both independents mechanisms. CONCLUSION: It is possible to suppose that in the subconscious condition, swallowing apnea is integrated under coordination of the same control mechanism that also involves the elastic resistance of the lung...|$|R

5000|$|Vocal cord {{dysfunction}} (VCD) is a pathology {{affecting the}} vocal folds, {{commonly referred to}} as the vocal cords. VCD is characterized by full or partial vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> that usually occurs for short periods during inhalation but can also occur during exhalation. [...] Alternate terms for VCD include paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM) and paradoxical vocal cord movement (PVCM). Although several contributing factors have been identified, the exact cause of VCD is unknown. An evaluation or visualization of the vocal folds during an episode are recommended to diagnose VCD and to rule out other conditions that can affect the upper and lower airway. Treatment of VCD often combines behavioral, medical and psychological approaches. Although information on the incidence and prevalence of VCD is limited, it is known to occur most frequently in young women.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Major thin-skinned fault {{systems of}} Tertiary age, {{detaching}} on Permian salt, are {{present on the}} platform wes t of the Central Graben in the Central and Southern North Sea. In plan view the fault systems describe two large arcs wh ich are separated by the Mid North Sea High, partially encircling the West Central Shelf of the Central North Sea and the Silver Pit Basin in the Southern North Sea. The fault t rends broadly follow the strike of base salt topography. The geometry of individual faults reflects lateral variation {{in the role of}} basement faults and pre-existing Mesozoic thin-skinned extensional structures. Dominant down-to-the-basin fault polarity suggests that the fault systems represent the limit of a gravity-driven slip zone. Extension is largely balanced by down-dip growth of fold structures. Further implications for hydrocarbon exploration include growth of roll-over <b>fold</b> <b>closures</b> adjacent to the fault zones and creation of a tec tonic barrier to up-dip fluid migration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhile {{a number}} of {{transcription}} factors {{that are likely to}} play a role in cardiac differentiation have recently been described, the signals that lead to the expression of these factors remains poorly understood. Here we report that exposure ofXenopusembryos to continuous low levels of all-transretinoic acid (RA), starting at the time of neural <b>fold</b> <b>closure,</b> blocks expression of myocardial differentiation markers. The development of the remainder of the embryo is relatively normal, suggesting that retinoic acid can act rather specifically on myocardial precursors. Indeed, the pattern of endocardial gene expression appears to remain unaffected by RA treatment. Although RA blocks myocardial gene expression, a superficially normal heart tube forms. The heart tube, however, fails to loop during subsequent development and never forms beating tissue. The effect of RA treatment on expression of myocardial genes is developmental stage dependent, since no influence is observed after myocardial differentiation has commenced. These data indicate that a vital component of the myocardial determination pathway is sensitive to retinoid signaling...|$|R
50|$|Laryngeal hyperresponsiveness is {{considered}} the most likely physiologic cause of VCD, brought on by a range of different triggers that cause inflammation and/or irritation of the larynx (voice box). The glottic closure reflex (or laryngeal adductor reflex) serves to protect the airway, {{and it is possible}} that this reflex becomes hyperactive in some individuals, resulting in the paradoxical vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> seen in VCD. Two major causes of laryngeal inflammation and hyperresponsiveness are gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and postnasal drip (associated with rhinosinusitis, allergic or nonallergic rhinitis, or a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI)). Rhinosinusitis is very common among patients with VCD and for many patients, VCD symptoms are ameliorated when the rhinosinusitis is treated. GERD is also common among VCD patients, but only some experience an improvement in VCD symptoms when GERD is treated. Other causes of laryngeal hyperresponsiveness include inhalation of toxins and irritants, cold and dry air, episodic croup and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).|$|R
50|$|Vocal fold nodules often {{alter the}} {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} vocal folds, which can interfere with their vibratory characteristics. Nodules may increase {{the mass of the}} vocal folds, especially along the medial edge where they are typically found. This increased mass may result in aperiodic or irregular vibration, the perception of greater pitch and loudness perturbations, and of increased hoarseness. Nodules may also affect the mucosal wave of the vocal folds by changing the configuration of the vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> pattern.They often cause incomplete closure of the vocal folds, resulting in an hourglass configuration. The incomplete closure allows more air to escape through the vocal folds, which often results in the perception of breathiness. However, {{it should be noted that}} the degree to which nodules will affect the mucosal wave and vibratory characteristics of the vocal folds depends highly on the size of the nodule. Smaller nodules may still allow the vocal folds to achieve complete closure.|$|R
40|$|The mesenchyme of the {{elevating}} mesencephalic neural {{folds of}} the mouse is composed primarily of mesenchymal cells embedded in an hyaluronate-rich extracellular matrix.

Where the ridges of these domains intersect, numerous 85 -Å participles apparently pile up against tight junctional remnants, creating arrays recognizable as gap junctions. With neural <b>fold</b> <b>closure,</b> the remaining tight junctional elements disappear and are replaced by macular gap junctions. Well below the junctional complex, gap junctions form independent of any visible, preexisting structure. Small, variegated clusters, containing 4 – 30 particles located in flat, particle-free regions, characterize this area. The number of particles within these arrays increases and they subsequently blend together into a polygonally packed aggregate resembling a gap junction. The assembly process in both apical and basal regions conforms with the concept of translational movement of particles within a fluid plasma membrane...|$|R
50|$|Vocal fold nodules are bilaterally {{symmetrical}} benign white masses {{that form}} at {{the midpoint of}} the vocal folds. Although diagnosis involves a physical examination of the head and neck, as well as perceptual voice measures, visualization of the vocal nodules via laryngeal endoscopy remains the primary diagnostic method. Vocal fold nodules interfere with the vibratory characteristics of the vocal folds by increasing the mass of the vocal folds and changing the configuration of the vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> pattern. Due to these changes, the quality of the voice may be affected. As such, the major perceptual signs of vocal fold nodules include vocal hoarseness and breathiness. Other common symptoms include vocal fatigue, soreness or pain lateral to the larynx, and reduced frequency and intensity range. Airflow levels during speech may also be increased. Vocal fold nodules are thought {{to be the result of}} vocal fold tissue trauma caused by excessive mechanical stress, including repeated or chronic vocal overuse, abuse, or misuse.

40|$|SummaryThe {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the differences in spirometric measures obtained from patients with endoscopically-documented paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM) and to compare them to a group of normal subjects without endoscopically-documented paradoxical vocal fold motion during non-provocative breathing and following speech. Thirty eight subjects with documented paradoxical vocal fold motion using transnasal flexible laryngoscopy (TFL) and no history of asthma and 21 normal subjects with documented normal breathing patterns and normal findings on endoscopy underwent flow-volume loop studies. Endoscopic judgments of vocal fold motion from three breathing conditions were made by two observers. The results of the endoscopic judgments indicate that paradoxical motion occurs whether breathing through the nose or mouth in the PVFM subjects, mainly after speaking and inhalation. In addition, the spirometry results indicated that the inspiratory measure of FIVC%, FVC% and FIV 0. 5 /FIVC were significantly lower in the PVFM group compared to the normal subjects. The data supports the hypothesis that in patients with PVFM, inspiratory spirometric values play a role in identifying patients with PVFM. The finding of vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> following a speech utterance in the majority of the PVFM subjects but not in the normal control group warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Because {{voice quality}} depends {{substantially}} on vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> (VFC), voice therapists try to modify VFC by specific voice techniques or adjustments in phonation mode. This study demonstrates {{the impact of}} six different phonation modes on VFC in healthy subjects. Methods : For this study, 21 female subjects with normal voice quality were selected. The impact of different phonation modes and voice techniques was examined by fiberoptic laryngovideoendoscopy during different modes of phonation: habitual phonation, high pitch, low pitch, resonance on /m/, Coblenzer's “abspannen,” and chant talk. The video recordings were judged by three experienced professionals (two Speech and Language Pathologist and one laryngologist) {{by means of a}} visual analog scale. Results : Statistical analysis showed that only resonance on /m/ significantly improved VFC compared with habitual phonation. All other phonation modes and techniques, except low-pitched phonation, led to a significant worse closure in comparison with the closure at normal pitch. The glottic closure observed by low-pitched phonation was not significantly different than the closure at habitual pitch. Interrater agreement was moderate to very good, depending on the mode of phonation.

40|$|Neural {{tube closure}} is a {{critical}} morphogenetic event that is regulated by dynamic changes in cell shape and behavior. Although previous studies have uncovered a central role for the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway in neural tube closure, the underlying mechanism remains poorly resolved. Here, we show that the missing in metastasis (MIM; Mtss 1) protein, previously identified as a Hedgehog response gene and actin and membrane remodeling protein, specifically binds to Daam 1 and couples non-canonical Wnt signaling to neural tube closure. MIM binds to a conserved domain within Daam 1, and this interaction is positively regulated by Wnt stimulation. Spatial expression of MIM is enriched in the anterior neural plate and neural folds, and depletion of MIM specifically inhibits anterior neural <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> without affecting convergent extension movements or mesoderm cell fate specification. Particularly, we find that MIM is required for neural fold elevation and apical constriction along with cell polarization and elongation in both the superficial and deep layers of the anterior neural plate. The function of MIM during neural tube closure requires both its membrane-remodeling domain and its actin-binding domain. Finally, we show {{that the effect of}} MIM on neural tube closure is not due to modulation of Hedgehog signaling in the Xenopus embryo. Together, our studies define a morphogenetic pathway involving Daam 1 and MIM that transduces non-canonical Wnt signaling for the cytoskeletal changes and membrane dynamics required for vertebrate neural tube closure...|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{respiratory}} and laryngeal {{motor control}} {{are essential for}} speech, but may be impaired in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD). Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) improves limb function in PD, but the effects on respiratory and laryngeal control remain unknown. We tested whether STN DBS would change aerodynamic measures of respiratory and laryngeal control, and whether these changes were correlated with limb function and stimulation parameters. Eighteen PD participants with bilateral STN DBS were tested within a morning session after a minimum of 12 h since their most recent dose of anti-PD medication. Testing occurred when DBS was on, and again 1 h after DBS was turned off, and included aerodynamic measures during syllable production, and standard clinical ratings of limb function. We found that PD participants exhibited changes with DBS, consistent with increased respiratory driving pressure (n = 9) and increased vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> (n = 9). However, most participants exceeded a typical operating range for these respiratory and laryngeal control variables with DBS. Changes were uncorrelated with limb function, but showed some correlation with stimulation frequency and pulse width, suggesting that speech may benefit more from low-frequency stimulation and shorter pulse width. Therefore, high-frequency STN DBS may be less beneficial for speech-related respiratory and laryngeal control than for limb motor control.

40|$|Direct {{development}} is a common reproductive mode in living amphibians charactertzed by absence of the free-living, aquatic larval stage. In Eleutherodactylus, a species-rich genus of New World frogs, evolution of direct development from the ancestral biphasic ontogeny is correlated with a comprehensive modification in embryonic cranial patterning, including the loss of many larval-specific components and the precocious formation of many adult (postmetamorphic) structures. We use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine the emergence and early migration of cranial neural crest cells in Eleutherodacelus coqui to begin to assess the possible role of the neural crest in mediating these evolutionary changes. As in metamorphosing frogs, cranial crest cells emerge prior to neural <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> and assemble into three streams: rostral, rostral otic, and caudal otic. These streams contribute to the face and first visceral (mandibular) arch, to the second (hyoid) arch, and to posterior (branchial) arches, respectively. Rostrocaudal position, morphology, and/or migration patterns distinguish subpopulations of cells within the rostral stream and caudal otic stream. With {{the possible exception of}} the small size of the rostral otic and caudal otic streams, evolution of direct development in E. coqui has not altered basic patterns of neural crest emergence or early migration as assessed by SEM.

40|$|The {{sound source}} of a voice is {{produced}} by the self-excited oscillation of the vocal folds. In modal voice production, a drastic increase in transglottal pressure after vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> works as a driving force that develops self-excitation. Another type of vocal fold oscillation with less pronounced glottal closure observed in falsetto voice production has been {{accounted for by the}} mucosal wave theory. The classical theory assumes a quasi-steady flow, and the expected driving force onto the vocal folds under wavelike motion is derived from the Bernoulli effect. However, wavelike motion is not always observed during falsetto voice production. More importantly, the application of the quasi-steady assumption to a falsetto voice with a fundamental frequency of several hundred hertz is unsupported by experiments. These considerations suggested that the mechanism of falsetto voice onset may be essentially different from that explained by the mucosal wave theory. In this paper, an alternative mechanism is submitted that explains how self-excitation reminiscent of the falsetto voice could be produced independent of the glottal closure and wavelike motion. This new explanation is derived through analytical procedures by employing only general unsteady equations of motion for flow and solids. The analysis demonstrated that a convective acceleration of a flow induced by rapid wall movement functions as a negative damping force, leading to the self-excitation of the vocal folds. The critical subglottal pressure and volume flow are expressed as functions of vocal fold biomechanical properties, geometry, and voice fundamental frequency. The analytically derive...|$|R

This transect lies entirely in the Burtts Corner beds of the Silurian Kingsclear Group, revealing a multi-deforma-tion history. Earliest structural elements in the turbidites include a slaty cleavage (S 1) that is close to being bedding-parallel in most places. No F 1 <b>fold</b> <b>closures</b> have been identifi ed, but small enclaves of inverted bedding imply that such structures exist but are of limited scale and restricted occurrence. The most conspicuous structures are upright to overturned, open to tight F 2 folds with chevron profi les, a locally well-developed axial planar slaty cleavage (S 2) and a related crenulation lineation on S 1 (L 12). These folds have curvilinear hinge-lines that show an increase in curvilinearity toward the Fredericton Fault, coincident with a tightening of the interlimb angle. Lineations related to layer-parallel slip during F 2 fold generation remain constant implying the changing geometry {{is a consequence of}} changing bulk strain rather than fold interference. Post-F 2 structures include a sparsely developed set of chevron folds with horizontal axial planes (F 3) and a poorly developed axial planar slaty cleavage (S 3).

40|$|The {{timing and}} pattern of cranial neural crest cell {{emergence}} and migration in the Mexican axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, are assessed using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). Cranial neural crest cells emerge and begin to migrate {{at the time of}} neural <b>fold</b> <b>closure</b> and soon form three distinct streams. The most anterior (mandibular) stream emerges first, {{at the level of the}} mesencephalon. Cells in this stream migrate rostroventrally around the optic vesicle. The second (hyoid) and third (branchial) streams emerge in close succession at the level of the rhombencephalon and extend ventrolaterally. Cells forming the hyoid stream migrate rostral to the otic vesicle, whereas the branchial stream divides into two parallel streams, which migrate caudal to the otic vesicle. At later stages (stage 26 onwards) the cranial neural crest cells disperse into the adjacent mesoderm and can no longer be followed by dissection and SEM. The pattern of cranial neural crest emergence and migration, and division into migratory streams is similar to that in other amphibians and in the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri). Emergence of crest cells from the neural tube, relative to the time of neural tube closure, occurs relatively late in comparison to anurans, but much earlier than in the Australian lungfish. These results establish a morphological foundation for studies in progress on the further development and fate of cranial neural crest cells in the Mexican axolotl, as well as for studies of the role of cranial neural crest in cranial patterning.

Ten participants classified as typical adult speakers were recruited {{to participate in the}} study. The participants were instructed to produce a target word (i. e. “ee,” “easy,” and “easier”) to stop the sweep hand on a timer at 800 milliseconds. The experimental condition required speakers to stop the sweep hand at 800 ms; however, random catch trials were introduced where the sweep hand stopped at varying temporal distances before 800 ms. Participants were instructed to inhibit their response whenever the sweep hand stopped before 800 ms. Participants were fitted with equipment to measure the movement of the chest wall and rib cage, vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure,</b> and aerodynamic response (i. e. pressure and airflow). Participants in the present study performed similarly to previous studies in that inhibition decreased as the stop target neared 800 ms and as the length of the utterance increased. When looking at respiratory and aerodynamic response during inhibition, participants postured the chest wall in 36 % of trials. Participants exhibited inspiratory checking 81 % of the time during inhibited responses. The data demonstrating inspiratory checking indicates that ribcage musculature may be under constant active control throughout preparation for speech production and contradicts the argument that the abdomen is passively controlled.

40|$|The {{measure of}} {{acoustic}} parameters related to dysphonia {{has long been}} one of the main research challenges in voice analysis. When the origin of the voice disorder is occupational, the medico-legal and insurance aspects must be considered, involving, when relevant, the definition of a percentage of physical impairment (usually 1 - 10 % according to the guidelines). An objective aid capable of quantifying these levels is desirable for assisting the medico-legal expert. Vocal fold nodules in voice professionals are mentioned in the European List of Occupational Diseases. Generally, such voices are slightly to moderately deviant, and mainly characterized by audible air escape (breathiness), due to insufficient vocal <b>fold</b> <b>closure.</b> Mild amounts of jitter may also be present. No studies have been published so far testing the ability of software tools to discriminate levels of added noise in signals when the amount of noise is exactly known. In the present study, four program tools (BioVoice, PRAAT, MDVP and AMPEX) are tested on realistic synthesized voice signals corrupted by 4 slightly increasing levels of jitter and 10 levels of additive noise close to the degree of dysphonia occurring in real patients with vocal fold nodules. The results show that the four tools are able to correctly estimate both jitter and noise levels. Specifically for noise, in some cases the agreement is close to 100 %.

These three petrographically indistinguishable iron formation intervals (Fe 2 O 3 T ≥ 21. 4 wt. %) likely represent cogenetic hydrothermal sedimentary units because they display a common geochemical signature: Fe 2 O 3 T = 42. 9 ± 10. 5 wt. %, MnO = 5. 4 ± 3. 1 wt. %, elevated base metal values (Zn+Pb = 1999 ± 1091 ppm), strong enrichment in additional exhalative components (CaO = 5. 3 ± 3. 9 wt. %; P 2 O 5 = 1. 43 ± 1. 00 wt. %), oxidized signature (Fe/Mn = 10 ± 6), {{as well as a}} common immobile element signature (Zr/TiO 2 = 0. 025 ± 0. 007) representative of a pelagic source. The calc-alkaline to transitional host volcanic rocks can be discriminated by Zr/TiO 2, {{and to a lesser extent}} by Th/Nb: Nepisiguit Falls Formation: Zr/TiO 2 = 0. 053 ± 0. 004, Th/Nb = 1. 08 ± 0. 37; Flat Landing Brook Formation: Zr/TiO 2 = 0. 107 ± 0. 043, Th/Nb = 0. 86 ± 0. 17. A symmetrical repetition of the footwall–iron formation–hanging wall stratigraphic sequence is observed in DDH-B 357, with distinct felsic volcanic rock domains separated by the three iron formations. This is best explained by parasitic F 2 folds on the west flank of the south-plunging Brunswick antiform, similar to the <b>fold</b> <b>closures</b> known to host massive sulfide accumulations i...|$|R
