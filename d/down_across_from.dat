5000|$|After, Abby {{is alone}} in a cafe when Jim Prime - {{apparently}} healthy - sits <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> her. Jim reveals a deep attraction to Abby, and introduces himself. Abby acknowledges his similarity in appearance to the physicist [...] "John Bain" [...] whom she is writing a novel about. However, {{as far as she}} knew, John Bain was killed in a devastating explosion in his lab. The unspoken implication is that Jim Prime would not wither away like Beale did, as he entered a universe with no other Jim present.|$|E

50|$|As of 12 P.M. (CDT) Thursday, August 30, power {{companies}} {{said more than}} 900,000 customers were without power in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas and Arkansas. 34 tornadoes touched <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the Southeast <b>from</b> August 27 to September 4 and Isaac (and later its remnants) moved across {{that portion of the}} country.|$|R
50|$|The local Health Centre {{is located}} in Cheviot Way. There has been a Health Centre in Cheviot Way for many years. Originally {{it was a small}} {{prefabricated}} building which was situated just a short distance <b>down</b> the road <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the Telecom building where there is now a sheltered housing complex. Now it is in a newer, larger building with other facilities, including a dentist.|$|R
50|$|The {{invasion}} {{starts out}} well. The expedition wins battles {{as they move}} through Kentucky and allies with several Legworm clans. However, when they meet up with the resistance, the meeting {{turns out to be}} a Quisling ruse and the expedition's leadership is ambushed in the middle of a feast. Southern Command is forced to retreat with supposedly elite Quisling troops (the Moondaggers) following close behind. Valentine eventually becomes second in command and continues to beat the enemy even though Southern command is always outnumbered and in a constant state of retreat. They are eventually pinned <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Evansville, IN, on the Ohio River. A general uprising in Evansville and throughout Kentucky sparks the attacking spirit in Southern Command soldiers and the remnants of the Legworm Clans. They make a final charge at the enemy lines and win the day. For now.|$|E
5000|$|Commentators {{nevertheless}} {{noted that}} the engine was noisy when working hard, the (semaphore style) direction indicators were fragile, and the ambitiously sophisticated front suspension also proved fragile when confronted with France's rural roads, {{many of which were}} still unpaved. [...] The gear box could be disagreeable when changing <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the gate <b>from</b> third speed to second, and the car was only just large enough for four people, with only a small storage area for luggage, located in a hard to get at position behind the back seat and without any external access.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Brooklyn to a {{production}} {{manager at the}} American Can Company, Donohue was raised on Long Island and studied at St. John's University, before pursuing an MA in Business at Adelphi University (1965). His grandfather worked for New York City {{and was a member}} of the Tammany Hall machine. He worked his way through college as a union truck driver before working as a fundraiser for the Boy Scouts of America and the National Center for Disability Services. Henry Viscardi, the group's founder, says that when he met Donohue, [...] "I sat him <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the desk <b>from</b> me and asked what job he wanted to have down the road. He said, `I want your job.' That's Tom Donohue for you.” ...|$|R
60|$|Then a hail came <b>down</b> <b>across</b> {{the waters}} <b>from</b> the tug. There {{was a loud}} splash beneath the bows, while shadowy figures that howled a weird ditty as they hove the hawser in, rose and fell black against the foam-flecked sea on the {{dripping}} forecastle. Nobody had missed Black, who now sat astride the yard watching the tug, as the ship, listing over further and commencing to hurl the spray in clouds about her plunging bows, gathered way. The steamboat would slide past very close alongside, and he saw a last chance of escape. Moving out to the very yard-arm he clutched the lee-brace, which rope led diagonally downwards to the vessel's depressed rail. He looked below a moment, bracing himself for the perilous attempt.|$|R
40|$|Recovery {{was firmly}} {{underway}} in the Intermountain West {{by the fourth}} quarter of 2011 but its pace varied considerably across the region’s 10 major metropolitan areas. Six of the 10 metros saw job growth in the fourth quarter but only four saw it accelerate over the previous one. Output grew everywhere but only in half of the region’s metros did the pace of growth quicken. The unemployment rate was <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the board <b>from</b> one year earlier. House prices in most markets stabilized. Yet signs of a robust, sustained, and self-fueling recovery remained elusive. National economic indicators from early 2012 may suggest that the economic recovery—though still very slow—is picking up speed, but the economic data for the country’s metropolitan areas now available through {{the fourth quarter of}} 2011 paint a somewhat more complicated picture...|$|R
60|$|Bright {{though the}} {{sunshine}} was, a bitter wind came <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the inlet <b>from</b> the gleaming hills that stretched back, ridged {{here and there}} by the sombre green of pines, towards the frozen North, and Deringham and his daughter, who were setting out {{on a visit to}} a town of Washington, had sought shelter in the saloon. Alice Deringham leaned back in a corner, a very dainty picture in her clinging furs, with the ivory whiteness of the panelling behind her. Her father sat close by, with a face that was slightly puckered, and thoughtful eyes, turning over a packet of letters that had reached him from England the day before, and his daughter fancied that their contents by no means pleased him. There were a few of her passengers in the saloon, and one couple attracted her languid attention.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{residential}} street Painter Avenue looking north towards {{the mountains in}} Whittier, ca. 1924. Bushy palm trees of the same height line the sidewalk to the right, behind which the porch of a one-story residential rancher-style home can be seen. At center, a topless automobile can be seen parked along {{the left side of}} the street while a van which reads "Motor Transit Stages" makes its way down the paved road. Farther back, more automobiles can be seen. In from the sidewalk to the left, a one-story modern-deco home can be seen with angular columns to either side of its entrance. Farther back, a two-story craftsman home is visible just in front of what appears to be the yard of a third home, where a car can be seen parked alongside a swatch of picket fence. The mountains are visible in the background, utility wires sloping <b>down</b> <b>across</b> their silhouette <b>from</b> the poles to the right...|$|R
60|$|Meandering Saale is {{on one of}} his big turns, as {{he passes}} Weissenfels; turning, pretty rapidly here, from southeastward, which he was a dozen miles ago, round to northeastward again or northward altogether, which he gets to be at Merseburg, a dozen farther <b>down.</b> Right <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Weissenfels, lapped in this crook of the Saale, or washed by it on south side and on east, rises, with extreme laziness, a dull {{circular}} lump of country, six or eight miles in diameter; with Rossbach and half a dozen other scraggy sleepy Hamlets scattered on it;--which, till the morning of Saturday, 5th November, 1757, had not been notable to any visitor. The topmost point or points, for there are two (not discoverable except by tradition and guess), the country people do call Hills, JANUS-HUGEL, POLZEN-HUGEL--Hill sensible to wagon-horses in those bad loose tracks of sandy mud, but unimpressive on the Tourist, who has to admit that there seldom was so flat a Hill. Rising, let us guess, forty yards in the three or four miles it has had. Might be called a perceptibly pot-bellied plain, with more propriety; flat country, slightly puffed up;--in shape not steeper than the mould of an immense tea-saucer would be. Tea-saucer 6 miles in diameter, 100 feet in depth, and of irregular contour, which indeed will sufficiently represent it to the reader's mind.|$|R

Our vision is of a proud Canada where all are wel-come, where diversity is embraced, and where everyone’s genes are valued equally.

5000|$|Wallace {{is known}} for his {{somewhat}} reckless style of play that leads to his frequent injuries. For this, he has earned the nickname [...] "Crash". He missed a total of 39 games in his first two years with the Bobcats, but his energetic and sometimes dangerous behavior that may have caused his injuries was also what contributed to his gaudy defensive stats. Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said of Wallace [...] "Gerald can only play one way and be effective. Energy -- that's his game." [...] In 2006, Wallace attempted to refine his game in order to avoid being injured, and as a result his numbers suffered. The first month of the season, Wallace had only five total blocks (an average of [...]3 per game) and his averages were <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the statline <b>from</b> 2005. Wallace improved his play in the second month of the season, but he went down with a separated shoulder in a December game against the Indiana Pacers. When he returned, Wallace continued his fine play finishing the season averaging 18.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2 steals, and 1 block in 72 games.|$|R
