5|$|Dr. Otto Octavius is {{preparing}} to attach an exoskeleton onto Alex O'Hirn's body, modeled after that of a rhinoceros. Though Octavius is wary about going through with the experiment, Hammerhead forces him to activate it. O'Hirn's body is surgically attached to the suit and is given immeasurable strength. Meanwhile, Peter Parker is at the Daily Bugle trying to ask out Betty Brant to his school's fall formal, despite their four-year age difference; she finally agrees to consider it and Peter hurries homeward, exhilarated, until he realizes he will need money for the date. He tells his best friend Harry about his plans at school the next day. Peter then receives a text message that his Aunt May is <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> with Betty at the Bugle. Flash Thompson then gives Peter a noogie just before Peter runs off.|$|E
5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

25|$|Two {{weeks of}} {{shooting}} indoors {{were followed by}} two weeks on-location. The interiors of the police station were shot on the now-defunct Producers Studios set while the exterior shots and jail cells were from the old Venice police station. The bus traveling to Sonora was shot on a closed section of the Los Angeles freeway system, with cast and crew <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> on the freeway. Carpenter {{has said that the}} trick with shooting a low-budget film is to shoot as little footage as possible and extend the scenes for as long as one can.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 9, 1989, Whitley awoke and spoke with his mother briefly on the phone. He was then visited by his {{brother-in-law}} Lane Palmer, and the two had coffee and they were planning a day of golf and <b>having</b> <b>lunch,</b> after which Whitley had planned to start writing songs for Lorrie Morgan and himself to record when she returned from her concert tour. Palmer departed at approximately 8:30a.m., informing Whitley {{to be ready to}} leave within an hour. Upon returning, Palmer found Whitley face down on his bed, fully clothed.|$|E
25|$|George Hodson, who {{had been}} <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> in the prison officers' mess near the Number 1 post, responded to Lange's whistle. Bennett shouted to Hodson {{that he had a}} prisoner, Walker, pinned down behind the low church {{boundary}} wall. Hodson headed for Walker and picked up Walker's pipe. Hodson grappled with Walker but the escapee managed to break free so Hodson began hitting him over his head with the piece of pipe. Walker was a faster runner than Hodson, but Hodson continued to chase after Walker with the pipe still in his hand. Both men ran towards the armed Ryan.|$|E

25|$|In November 1924, Yale {{was asked}} {{once again to}} come to Chicago to assist Capone and Torrio, who needed another rival murdered. On November 10, 1924, Yale, John Scalise, and Albert Anselmi {{reportedly}} entered the Schofield Flower Shop and killed North Side Gang leader Dean O'Banion. Eight days later, the Chicago Police arrested Yale and Sam Pollaccia at Chicago's Union Station as {{they were about to}} depart for New York. Yale said he had come to town for the funeral of Unione Siciliana president Mike Merlo and stayed to see old friends. Yale further claimed to be <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> at the time of O'Banion's murder. Police could not shake his alibi and were compelled to release him.|$|E
500|$|After <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> with a {{representative}} from Hodder & Stoughton, who published her detective stories, Heyer felt that her host had patronized her. The company had an option on her next book; to make them break her contract, she wrote Penhallow, which the 1944 Book Review Digest described as [...] "a murder story but not a mystery story". Hodder & Stoughton turned the book down, thus ending their association with Heyer, and Heinemann agreed to publish it instead. Her publisher in the United States, Doubleday, also disliked the book and ended their relationship with Heyer after its publication.|$|E

500|$|These critiques {{were not}} taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they seemed {{so far off}} the point. Problems like intractability and commonsense {{knowledge}} seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference [...] "know how" [...] or [...] "intentionality" [...] made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle [...] "they misunderstand, and should be ignored." [...] Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers [...] "dared not be seen <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> with me." [...] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish. Although he was {{an outspoken critic of}} Dreyfus' positions, he [...] "deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{furious that}} he did not get a chance to ask the cast of [...] any {{questions}} at the convention, {{and the fact that the}} cast instead answered questions completely unrelated to Star Trek, Stewie builds an authentic Star Trek transporter and beams the cast over to interview them (in a nod to the TNG episode [...] "Skin of Evil", Denise Crosby is killed in a show of force). Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast, which includes stealing Cleveland's van, <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> at McDonald's, going bowling, and going to a carnival. However, they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie, who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined Star Trek: The Next Generation for him, and that he hopes they all die.|$|E

500|$|After {{weeks of}} {{having fun with}} Penguins fans on Twitter, the team officially invited Michaels for their Eastern Conference Finals Game 5 matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning (which {{consists}} of several wrestlers in its fanbase, including Hulk Hogan and Titus O'Neil) at Consol Energy Center, upon which Michaels accepted. Michaels met with Penguins' owner Mario Lemieux and sat with former Pittsburgh Steelers' defensive lineman Brett Keisel during the game. Keisel also gave Michaels {{a tour of the}} city including at the Steelers headquarters and <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> at Primanti Brothers in the city's Strip District. The Penguins lost the game in overtime 4-3, but would go on to defeat the Lightning in the series and advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, eventually defeating the San Jose Sharks for the Stanley Cup. Michaels eventually befriended Keisel and attended his annual [...] "Shear Da Beard" [...] event in 2017.|$|E

Peter sneaks off and dons his Spider-Man costume, then engages Rhino in a fight. He wonders what the [...] "Big Man" [...] has been up to with all the supervillains, like Rhino, he has been organizing.

500|$|In a scene {{featuring}} the two title characters <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> at Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan, the couple are arguing about a man's {{ability to recognize}} when a woman is faking an orgasm. Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference, and to prove her point, she vividly (fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. The scene ends with Sally casually returning to her meal as a nearby patron (played by Reiner's mother) places her order: [...] "I'll have what she's having." [...] When Estelle Reiner died at age 94 in 2008, The New York Times referred to her as the woman [...] "who delivered {{one of the most}} memorably funny lines in movie history". This scene was shot again and again, and Ryan demonstrated her fake orgasms for hours. Katz's Deli still hangs a sign above the table that says, [...] "Where Harry met Sally... hope you have what she had!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1949, Stackpole {{moved to}} Chauriat in the Puy-de-Dôme area of central France, {{returning}} {{with his second}} wife Ginette to her birthplace. There, his art became less figurative and more abstract, both in sculpture and in painting. He kept a flow of correspondence with his old friends in San Francisco, including Helen Salz, who described his letters as devoid of any mention of sculpture or painting, or any project that Stackpole might have been working on—instead, he wrote of musicians and music, and of his encounters with people. Salz bought a Stackpole bust of poet George Sterling and donated it to the University of California in 1955–56, to be displayed in Dwinelle Hall. In early 1964, Stackpole visited San Francisco to see his family, and he called up his old friend Kenneth Rexroth. In his San Francisco Examiner newspaper column, Rexroth wrote of <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> with the Stackpole family, and reminded his readers {{that the man had}} been known [...] "for 20 years or more [...] San Francisco's leading artist." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Hank Landry is a prime suspect for Keith, Landry reassures Veronica that she can still be his protégé. Keith {{continues}} to question Mindy O’Dell, citing inconsistencies in his testimony. Mindy says that the other man arguing in her room was the Dean. She also says that Hank {{could have been the}} murderer, as she was not in the area {{at the time of the}} murder. Keith enters Veronica’s criminology class and arrests Hank. Keith questions him as well, and he says that Mindy set him up with the blood on his clothes, noting that he went to a convenience store before driving home. However, Keith puts him in a cell, where he is visited by Tim Foyle, and Hank tells him to find the bug that was placed on his phone. Later, Veronica sees Tim breaking into Mars Investigations, trying to find the bug, and Tim effectively enlists Veronica’s help. They visit the convenience store with no luck for the time being. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) sees Logan (Jason Dohring) and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) <b>having</b> <b>lunch</b> together and tells Veronica, but she doesn’t seem upset. Mindy buys a boat at the local pier. Keith and Veronica receive news that Mindy has left town.|$|E
