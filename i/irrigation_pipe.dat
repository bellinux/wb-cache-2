50|$|The Hill Hummer, {{also known}} as the Maxair Hummer was an {{ultralight}} aircraft developed in the United States in the late 1970s. An extremely minimalist design, the main structural element of the aircraft was a length of 5-inch aluminium <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipe.</b> At one end of this pipe was a seat for a pilot, and at the other, a V-tail. Behind the pilot's seat, an aluminium truss structure supported a fabric parasol wing, which was further braced with wires to another truss element that served as a kingpost above it. The engine was mounted pusher-wise {{at the rear of the}} wing truss, the length of the mounting to be selected by the builder to balance the weight of the pilot.|$|E

50|$|Having {{first come}} to Altamonte Springs, Florida in 1913 for his health, Haines soon {{purchased}} property {{on the west}} side of Lake Orienta and began growing asparagus plumosa ferns shortly after World War I. By the early 1920s he was shipping ferns to all parts of the United States via the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. His Royal Fern Corporation was chartered in 1922 with an authorized capital of $450,000. Haines was the major stockholder with three hundred shares, but George Kingsley, the secretary/treasurer, was also a substantial investor with one hundred forty-five shares. Vice-president James A Cotting of Winter Park owned five shares. Ed W. Mitchell was general manager. With thirty-three acres in production at the time of its incorporation, the firm expanded until it was cultivating sixty-five acres by 1925. Since much of the area was under slat-roof covering to protect the tender plants, one over-enthusiastic reporter called it the largest industry in the world under one roof. The fernery had thirty miles of <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipe,</b> a pre-cooling plant, and its own electric light and water system. There was a complete company town with forty homes for employees, a commissary, a church, a school, a park, and a moving picture theater adjacent to the fernery. The Royal Fernery was the catalyst which made Altamonte Springs a center for fern growing for many years.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{irrigation}} system {{is required to}} be designed economically and should be reliable with minimal suspension in water supply. This study suggests a multi-criteria design approach for <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipe</b> network systems. A system reliability is suggested as a second objective, which is defined as annual non-supplied volume of water by considering pipe failure. The non-supplied water is quantified based on the expected number of pipe failure and pipe repair time.

Once the least-cost design is determined, the system reliability is calculated for the obtained optimal design.

40|$|For {{accidental}} electrocutions in Washington State from 1950 to 1979, {{the standardized}} proportionate mortality ratio for farmers {{compared with the}} general population {{was found to be}} 226 in a recent report. This excess mortality rate in Washington State was investigated by the authors, who reviewed death certificates and associated local newspaper reports of all farmers killed by electrocution during 1950 - 79 and of all persons killed by electrocution during 1970 - 79. Selected employers, next of kin, and public utility personnel were also interviewed. In Washington State 42 farmers were electrocuted during the years 1950 - 79; 23 of them were killed while working near <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes</b> that came into contact with overhead electrical lines. During 1970 - 79 there were 15 irrigation pipe-associated (IPA) electrocutions among farmers and 15 among farm workers.

40|$|The Hartley Sand Trap {{could mean}} the end to the curse of sand {{blocking}} up filters and <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes.</b> This simple invention developed and patented by Tim Hartley is worth the while for any farmer or farmers group involved in irrigation. It removes sand from the borehole, at the well-point or the river, while under online pressure. Here is how it works. Sandy water enters {{the bottom of the}} Trap equipment under pressure up to 10 bar and clean water comes out {{from the top of the}} Sand Trap under the same pressure. The rising speed of the water is slower than the settling speed of the sand which can therefore never reach the Trap s outlet only the clean water can. The accumulated sand can periodically be flushed through from the Trap by opening the flush valve. The maximum flow rate of the trap is 4, 000 litres/ hour. For higher flow rates, two or more sand traps would have to be installed in parallel. The device costs ZAR 980 South African Rand (t 142), excluding transport.

All of these plastic materials require, {{at the end}} of their lifetime, suitable collection and treatment systems. Agricultural activities in some areas of the Apulia Region, Southern Italy, are characterized by huge quantities of plastic wastes and local authorities and farmers associations have been interested in solving this problem by applying modern land management tools such as Geographical Information System (G. I. S.). In this paper a G. I. S. methodology is applied to an area of 10, 200 ha in the Trani municipality, included in the Province of Barletta, Andria, Trani (BAT) - Apulia Region, in order to assess the agricultural plastic waste generation. The use of plastics at the agricultural farms has been investigated and related to the land use by applying statistical analysis, orthophoto analysis and remote sensing surveys. These data were introduced in a specific geo-database, and the agricultural plastic waste quantity and localization were defined. Vineyards and olive groves are scattered in this area, so the agricultural plastic waste mostly consists in <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes,</b> after-use covering films and anti-hail nets used on vineyards. The analysis carried out showed that up to 614 kg ha- 1 of covering films waste are yearly produced in some areas while the estimation of waste from the anti-hail nets was up to 159 kg ha- 1 and the waste yearly produced from <b>irrigation</b> <b>pipes</b> was up to 83 kg ha- 1.
