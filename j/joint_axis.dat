The aim of this experiment was to compare three different methods of defining this axis: the knee alignment device (KAD) method, a method based on the transepicondylar axis (TEA) and an alternative numerical method (Dynamic). The former two methods are common approaches that have been applied clinically in many quantitative gait analysis laboratories; the latter is an optimisation procedure. A cohort of 20 subjects performed three different functional tasks (normal gait; squat; non-weight bearing knee flexion) on repeated occasions. Three-dimensional hip and knee angles were computed using the three alternative methods of defining the knee <b>joint</b> flexion–extension <b>axis.</b> The repeatability of hip axial rotation measurements during normal gait {{was found to be}} significantly better for the Dynamic method (p < 0. 01). Furthermore, both the variance in the knee varus–valgus kinematic profile and the degree of knee joint angle cross-talk were smallest for the Dynamic method across all functional tasks.

However, a challenge lies in determining the location of the instability or the least stable vertebral joint. A mathematical analysis, based on a commonly used approach in engineering for determining structural stability, has been developed for the lumbar spine. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the feasibility of a method for mathematically locating potential areas of instability within a computer-based model of the lumbar spine. To validate this method, the eigenvector from the stability analysis was compared to the output from a geometric equation that approximated individual vertebral joint rotational stiffness with the idea that the entry in the eigenvector with the largest absolute value would correspond to the vertebral <b>joint</b> and <b>axis</b> with the lowest stiffness. Validation of the eigenvector was not possible due to computational similarities between the stability analysis and the geometric rotational stiffness method. However, it has been previously demonstrated that the eigenvector can be useful for locating instability, and thus warrants future study. Determining the least stable vertebral <b>joint</b> and <b>axis</b> can be used to guide proper motor pattern training as a clinical intervention. It was also shown in this investigation that an even distribution of fascicle force and stiffness generated stability.

40|$|Gravity, it {{eventually}} gets us all. The challenge for our bodies {{is to maintain}} stability and move efficiently {{against the forces of}} gravity. Disease, injury, environment, emotions, body type, kinesthetic sense and repetitive activities can lead to adverse movement patterns and further dysfunction. Identifying abnormal movement patterns and understanding the interplay between gravity, buoyancy and our bodies is essential for the aquatic therapist. Ideal alignment especially the curves of the spine are important in withstanding the forces of gravity. For a weight bearing joint to be stable the gravity line must fall through the <b>joint’s</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation. For example: in standing the gravity line should fall just anterior to the knee and posterior to the patella this allows the knee to remain straight and the person upright without excessive forces at the joint or excessive effort from the quadriceps. If the gravity line falls anterior to the patella the forces of gravity tend to push the knee into hyperextension causing increased stress to the soft tissue of the posterior knee. This position causes the ACL to be on slack and over time leads to weakness of the ligament and possibly increasing risk of ACL injury in young women who tend to have this alignment. The first step in postural assessment is evaluation of where the gravity line falls at each joint. Posture is often described based on static position, forward head, military style, sway back, kyphosis-lordosi...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Calculating {{segmental}} (vertebral level-by-level) torso {{masses in}} Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) patients allows the gravitational loading on the scoliotic spine during relaxed standing to be determined. This study used CT scans of AIS patients to measure segmental torso masses and explores how joint {{moments in the}} coronal plane are affected by changes {{in the position of}} the intervertebral <b>joint’s</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation; particularly at the apex of a scoliotic major curve. Methods. Existing low dose CT data from the Paediatric Spine Research Group was used to calculate vertebral level-by-level torso masses and joint torques occurring in the spine for a group of 20 female AIS patients (mean age 15. 0 ± 2. 7 years, mean Cobb angle 53 ± 7. 1 °). Image processing software, ImageJ (v 1. 45 NIH USA) was used to threshold the T 1 to L 5 CT images and calculate the segmental torso volume and mass corresponding to each vertebral level. Body segment masses for the head, neck and arms were taken from published anthropometric data. Intervertebral (IV) joint torques at each vertebral level were found using principles of static equilibrium together with the segmental body mass data. Summing the torque contributions for each level above the required joint, allowed the cumulative joint torque at a particular level to be found. Since there is some uncertainty in the position of the coronal plane Instantaneous Axis of Rotation (IAR) for scoliosis patients, it was assumed the IAR was located in the centre of the IV disc. A sensitivity analysis was performed to see what effect the IAR had on the joint torques by moving it laterally 10 mm in both directions. Results.

40|$|Background: Locating the {{position}} of the subtalar <b>joint</b> <b>axis</b> can be a predictive clinical variable in biomechanical analysis and a valuable tool in the design of functional foot orthoses. Before testing Kirby's palpation technique to locate the subtalar <b>joint</b> <b>axis</b> in cadavers, it was important to develop and test the experimental methods in a mechanical model in which the exact location of the hinge joint can be controlled. Methods: Four testers determined the hinge joint location and moved it through its range of motion, capturing the movement of the <b>joint</b> <b>axis</b> using a kinematic model. The <b>joint</b> <b>axis</b> location was determined and validated by comparing the actual hinge joint location on the mechanical model with the location determined by the palpation technique described by Kirby in 1987 and the location determined by the helical <b>joint</b> <b>axis</b> method using three-dimensional kinematic data. Results: The overall angles result in mean slopes and intersections of 87 ° and 92 mm, 86 ° and 97 mm, 85 ° and 92 mm, and 88 ° and 91 mm for testers 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Testers 1 and 3 were able to determine the location to 1 ° and 1 mm accuracy, tester 2 to 0 ° and 4 mm, and tester 4 to 2 ° and 2 mm compared with the kinematic data.

Methods: Four testers with different levels of experience determined the subtalar <b>joint</b> <b>axis</b> location and moved the subtalar joint through its range of motion, capturing the movement using kinematic analysis. The comparison of the spatial subtalar <b>joint</b> <b>axis</b> location as determined by palpation between and within testers determined the intertester and intratester reliability. The helical axis method was performed to validate the model. Results: The intrarater reliability varied from a high of alpha = 0. 96 to a low of alpha = 0. 26 for the slope and was, in general, high (alpha = 0. 78 - 0. 95) for the intersection. The interrater reliability scored moderate to high, depending on the specific cadaver specimen. Concerning the exact location of the subtalar <b>joint</b> <b>axis,</b> no significant difference was found between the results determined by different testers and the helical axis method.

It appears to be obvious that the constraints provided by the femorotibial joint surface are insufficient for functional knee stability, though a combination of resisting structures such as the menisci, the joint capsule, the muscles, and the intra- and extraarticular ligaments account for both functional range of motion and joint stability under loading conditions.|$|R
