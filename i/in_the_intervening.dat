30|$|Respondents {{mentioned}} that livestock number {{was the best}} indicator for evaluating rangeland condition <b>in</b> Afar region. <b>The</b> existing empirical evidence based on metrological data did not show any significant decline <b>in</b> precipitation for <b>the</b> last four decades between 1971 and 2011 {{as opposed to the}} perception of pastoralists where 80 % of them reported a decline in precipitation. A one unit increase in labor force suggested about 16.1 % decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choice of livestock selling as coping strategy in Afar pastoral areas of North-East of Ethiopia. The non-intervened pastoral households had more preference (3.78 %) to practice herd splitting than those pastoral households <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> district. Similarly, <b>the</b> non-intervened pastoral households had 4.43 % more preference to use crop residue for livestock feeding than pastoral HHs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> areas.|$|R
40|$|Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a {{theoretical}} framework, this study evaluated a 4 -month, individual cognitive-behavioral intervention program to decrease burnout and increase self-efficacy, engagement, and performance among university students. The main {{objective of the}} intervention was to decrease the anxiety the students coped with before exams {{in order to increase}} their beliefs of self-efficacy. Besides <b>the</b> study group <b>intervened,</b> two control groups were involved (i. e., a ‘‘stressed’’ control group and a ‘‘healthy’’ control group). All 3 groups filled out a questionnaire before the intervention and then again 6 months later (2 months after the intervention was completed). The results show that self-efficacy, engagement and performance increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> group when compared to both control groups. Regarding burnout, decreases were noted <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> and stressed control groups but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> healthy control group.

5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the original upon its release, although it was generally critically well-reviewed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> decades, criticism has been deeply divided.

5|$|Following an {{investigation}} into Speyer's wartime conduct held in camera by the Home Office's Certificates of Naturalisation (Revocation) Committee, Speyer's naturalisation was revoked by an order dated 1 December 1921. On 13 December 1921 an order was issued by King George V for Speyer to be struck off {{the list of the}} Privy Council.

5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> years, a virus in mice was shown {{to be related to}} the virus causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.|$|E

His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander's only source of comfort was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.|$|E

The apprentice is cast away on Sucia, an island abandoned by the sect 200 years prior. The island contains groups of the Shapers' creations, who have formed their own ideologies regarding their creators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> years.

5|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at}} Jupiter in 1995 after a six-year journey from Earth {{to follow up}} on the discoveries of the two Voyager probes and ground-based observations taken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> years. Io's location within one of Jupiter's most intense radiation belts precluded a prolonged close flyby, but Galileo did pass close by shortly before entering orbit for its two-year, primary mission studying the Jovian system. Although no images were taken during the close flyby on 7 December 1995, the encounter did yield significant results, such as the discovery of a large iron core, similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Various {{changes were}} made in the second edition. Some of the social {{commentary}} regarding the poor treatment of Native Americans by the government was toned down. The name of the Native tribe was changed from the Orteils Ficelés ("Tied Toes") to the Pieds Noirs ("Black Feet"). Perhaps because Al Capone's power had diminished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> years, Hergé depicted Capone's scarred face in the 1945 version. He removed the reference to Mary Pikeford from the ceremonial dinner scene and deleted two Chinese hoodlums who tried to eat Snowy. References to Belgium were also removed, allowing the story to have a greater international appeal.|$|E
5|$|A motto, {{placed on}} a scroll below the Royal Arms of England, seems to have first been adopted by Henry IV in the early 15th century. His motto was Souverayne ("sovereign"). His son, Henry V adopted the motto Dieu et mon droit ("God and my right"). While this motto has been {{exclusively}} used since the accession of George I in 1714, and continues to form part of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom, other mottoes were used by certain monarchs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> period. Veritas temporis filia ("truth {{is the daughter of}} time") was the motto of Mary I (1553–1558), Semper Eadem ("always the same") was used by Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and Anne (1702–1714), James I (1603–1625) sometimes used Beati pacifici ("blessed are the peacemakers"), while William III (1689–1702) used the motto of the House of Orange: Je maintiendrai ("I will maintain").|$|E
5|$|Disney {{announced}} their intentions to develop The Incredibles 2 in March 2014. Bird returned to direct {{and write the}} screenplay. Nelson, Hunter, Vowell, Jackson, and Bird will also return to voice their characters, while Dash will now be voiced by Huck Milner as Fox's voice had deepened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> years. The film will follow immediately {{from the end of}} The Incredibles with the Parrs facing the Underminer. The film will focus on Holly Hunter's character, Elastigirl. Originally, The Incredibles 2 was to be released on June 21, 2019 as Pixar's next film after Toy Story 4. Due to delays on that title, Pixar swapped the releases, and currently The Incredibles 2 is set for release on June 15, 2018.|$|E
30|$|Ischiofemoral {{impingement}} involves impingement of the ischial tuberosity and {{the lesser}} trochanter, resulting <b>in</b> compression of <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> quadratus femoris muscle.

30|$|The {{results showed}} that {{livestock}} holding per household was higher on average (22.90 [*]±[*] 2.27 Tropical Livestock Unit (TLU)) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-intervened woreda than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> woreda (8.30 [*]±[*] 3.85 TLU). Respondents mentioned that livestock productivity was adversely affected {{by a number of}} factors such as invasion of Prosopis juliflora (Dergi Hara), shrinkage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capacity of rangelands (Beadu and Bebea’), and recurrent droughts. Scarcity of grazing resources attributed to the invasion of Dergi Hara and drought created livestock feed crisis with strong implication on the livelihood of pastoralists. Our {{results showed that}} the traditional resource management practices such as mobility, herd splitting, and diversification had a role to contribute to the improvement of rangeland management and conservation of biodiversity. Traditional rules and seasonal-based grazing patterns of riversides during drought were perceived as key elements for rangeland resource management and conservation of rangeland resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study area.|$|R
