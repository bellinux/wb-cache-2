5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E

5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> the choice was a correct one {{that leads to a}} satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E

5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the area}} of a curve is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> circles are the slowest curves to collapse to a point under the curve-shortening flow. All other curves take less time to collapse than a circle of the same length.|$|E
40|$|Conceivability is an {{important}} source of our beliefs about what is possible; inconceivability is {{an important}} source of our beliefs about what is impossible. What are the connections between the reliability of these sources? If one is reliable, does <b>it</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> the other is also reliable? The central contention of this paper is that suitably qualified the reliability of inconceivability implies the reliability of conceivability, but the reliability of conceivability fails to imply the reliability of inconceivability. If conceivability is a reliable guide to possibility, does <b>it</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> inconceivability is a reliable guide to impossibility? 1 Conversely, if inconceivability is a reliable guide to impossibility, does <b>it</b> <b>follow</b> <b>that</b> conceivability is a reliable guide to possibility? Three positions are available. One answers both questions in the affirmative, thereby insisting on a two-way reliability connection. If this is correct, the processes stand, or fall, together, and a case for the reliability (or unreliability...|$|R

5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> the flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative. He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the {{necessary}} {{existence of the}} greatest possible being, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> there is a being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E

5|$|The {{prognosis}} after different treatments varies and {{is based}} on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.|$|E
5|$|These {{provisions}} {{are similar to}} those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to theft. It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes, including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a mortgage can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property. Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen; <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> such property cannot be the subject of a charge of criminal damage.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
