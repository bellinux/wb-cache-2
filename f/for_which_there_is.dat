5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to date recessions in America {{beginning}} in 1790. These periods of recession were not identified until the 1920s. To construct the dates, researchers studied business annals during the period and constructed time series of the data. The earliest recessions <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E
5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved skulls and {{abundant}} skeletal material, Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere. It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no evidence.|$|E

5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E
5|$|Along crater and canyon walls, {{there are}} {{thousands}} of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies. The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the southern hemisphere and to face the Equator; all are poleward of 30° latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice, although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust. No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active. Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history. Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across {{a large proportion of the}} surface, <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{representations}} of 1 also occur in non-integer bases. For example, {{in the golden}} ratio base, the two standard representations are 1.000... and 0.101010..., and there are infinitely many more representations that include adjacent 1s. Generally, for almost all q between 1 and 2, there are uncountably many base-q expansions of 1. On the other hand, there are still uncountably many q (including all natural numbers greater than 1) <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one base-q expansion of 1, other than the trivial 1.000.... This result was first obtained by Paul Erdős, Miklos Horváth, and István Joó around 1990. In 1998 Vilmos Komornik and Paola Loreti determined the smallest such base, the Komornik–Loreti constant q = 1.787231650.... In this base, 1 = 0.11010011001011010010110011010011...; the digits are given by the Thue–Morse sequence, which does not repeat.|$|E

5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than it is today, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. The oldest house <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Church {{architecture}} in Scotland incorporates all church building within the modern borders of Scotland, {{from the earliest}} Christian structures in the sixth century until the present day. The early Christian churches <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> evidence are basic masonry-built constructions {{on the west coast}} and islands. As Christianity spread, local churches tended to remain much simpler than their English counterparts. By the eighth century more sophisticated ashlar block-built buildings began to be constructed. From the eleventh century, there were larger and more ornate Romanesque buildings, as with Dunfermline Abbey and St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney. From the twelfth century the introduction of new monastic orders led to a boom in ecclesiastical building, often using English and Continental forms. From the thirteenth century elements of the European Gothic style began to appear in Scotland, cumulating in buildings such as Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilt Melrose Abbey. Renaissance influences can be seen in a move to a low-massive style that was probably influenced by contacts with Italy and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The oldest house <b>for</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{evidence}} in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, {{dating from the}} Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE. The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the}} oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.|$|E
