The historical narrative incorporates a discussion of earliest contacts between Britain and Islam; 'evolution' of knowledge about Islam; movement of British agents into the Islamic world - and their importance in providing crucial information about different forms of Islam; (mis) representation of Islam; isolation of themes regarding perceptions of Islam. In Chapter 3, contemporary issues concerning Muslims in Britain are surveyed in the context of themes emerging as important in assessment of Islam, during the discussion of formative contacts. These themes are discussed {{within the context of a}} Survey of Islam in Britain; an analysis of 'Fundamentalism’; The Satanic Verses controversy; British Muslim Community Representation and Leadership; the position of Women in British Islam; Islam in Europe; the role of the contemporary Media in perceptions of Islam; a survey of the 1991 Gulf War, in which many impressions of Islam conveyed by formative contacts were re-articulated. Within Chapter 4, other important issues affecting Muslims in Britain, notably education, interfaith dialogue, and social welfare, are incorporated into a discussion on British Muslim identity. The dissertation concludes with establishing whether there is correlation between formative contacts and contemporary British Muslim issues. It assesses the way forward for Islam in Britain in the light of lessons learnt - and what work needs to be done by Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Britain to improve the perception of Islam...|$|E

This paper reports on challenges of the compulsory third year Undergraduate Dissertation, and on implementing and evaluating interventions to help students meet these challenges. My colleague and I carried out pre- and post-module surveys of student perception and made use of an ongoing student diary from one student to determine student needs and experiences. We discovered that students find structuring their literature reviews challenging {{and need to be}} trained to see the applicability of some of the literature to their particular thesis situations. There is evidence that students in European institutions face similar challenges. Our action research was informed by a constructivist, dialogic, pedagogic approach which, importantly, included supporting students’ writing from within their subject area. In attempting to find solutions to these problems, we were influenced by the academic literacies with its emphasis on learner differences, but more by the genre approach. I argue that existing manuals on research Dissertations, which focus largely on topic choice, storage of notes and may need to give higher priority to structuring the literature review. Our report includes a survey of students’ attitudes and expectations regarding the Dissertation, then moves on to describe and assess changes which were made to the Dissertation in the Degree in question.

40|$|Background & Objective: Writing {{dissertation}} is {{an opportunity}} for students to become familiar with methodology of a research process during the period of education. In recent years, there has been special emphasis on proper studies’ structure, similar and scientific writing process in research reports and dissertations. Attending methodology workshop for faculties and students, together with preparing booklets has helped a lot, but still there is a long way to meet the optimal standards. This study was conducted to evaluate methodological structure of medical dissertations in Golestan University of Medical Sciences from 1996 to 2005. Methods : This is a descriptive-analytic Study. For data collection all of the dissertations (257) were studied and scored with a check list that was designed for a national research on thesis. The maximum score for each thesis was 500. Results : The results showed that the mean score (± SD) of the dissertations has increased from 269. 9 (± 78) in 1996 to 351. 5 (± 33. 1) in 2005. According to this study, 76. 9 percent of dissertations had statistical consultants, and the most frequent design was cross-sectional. There was a significant relationship between final score of dissertations and grade of them (r= 0. 38, P= 0. 039). The weakest parts of the dissertations were methodology, then statement of problem and then discussion. Conclusion : Although methodology structure of medical dissertations has improved considerably recently, but there is a long way to reach optimal status. Education of faculty members and students in research field, guiding students for finding best tactics of research and supporting them to perform researches help to enhancement of dissertations quality. This needs a fundamental reform in long term planning for medical education. Keywords: <b>Dissertation,</b> <b>Structure,</b> Medical student, Golestan University of Medical Sciences...|$|E

The three-article <b>dissertation</b> <b>structure</b> is used to reflect separately on the stages of problem identification, designing the solution, and implementing and evaluating the solution. The purpose of this project is to capture an insider 2 ̆ 7 s view of beginning the PLC journey. Researchers first conducted problem-based consultations with principals and teacher leaders at the three schools in an effort to understand and define common barriers that prevented teacher collaboration and ownership of school change efforts. The common barriers identified included teacher isolation, lack of focus and collective accountability on student outcomes, and lack of time and a structure for collaboration. Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) were identified as the proposed solution to address the need for collaborative, comprehensive, focused work toward school improvement at all three school sites. The researchers developed a plan for implementation of PLCs, to be led by the principals and teacher leaders at each school, and provided on-site weekly support, assuming the role of coaches. Researchers collected data throughout {{the first six months of}} implementation, capturing observational data as well as teacher and principal perceptions through interviews and surveys. The overall findings indicate that the PLC process has been effective at all three schools in increasing levels of collaboration, teacher reflection, and ownership of student outcomes. All schools, however, are in a developing stage therefore there are pockets of resistance and a lack of belief in the value of the work. This research validates that PLCs are a vehicle for change which complement the nature of Catholic schools and can address challenges for sustained school improvement...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the context}} of this PhD Thesis a novel {{fabrication}} technology was developed. Various types of of thermal sensors based on the specific technology were constructed, capable of measuring a variety of physical quantities. The specific technology combines typical printed circuit board manufacturing techniques with micromachining methods, this way addressing fundamental microsystem problems, the most significant of which being their electrical communication to the macroworld. Furthermore, as the fabricated devices consist of polymer materials, the thermal isolation of the sensing elements is highly effective, offering the potential of multiple quantities measurement with a highly satisfying performance observed in all circumstances. Regarding the <b>dissertation</b> <b>structure,</b> in Chapter 1 an introduction to the concept of measurement and sensing is made. Chapter 2 contains an overview of the technological background regarding the fabricated devices. The introductory chapters conclude with Chapter 3, which constitutes the theoretical background regarding the operation of thermal sensors by providing an analysis of the heat transfer mechanisms. The following chapters concern the presentation of the Thesis results. The detailed description of the developed fabrication technology is carried out in Chapter 4, with an in-depth analysis of each procedure step. The advantages of the specific fabrication technology are then discussed, along with an extended description of the structural and operational characteristics of the produced devices. The initial applications of the fabricated structures are presented in Chapter 5, {{in the first part of}} which the operation of a vacuum sensor is described, while in the second part a position sensor is presented. Chapter 6 illustrates the simulation procedure and the developed models that refer to the operation of the liquid flow sensor. Based on the simulation results a liquid flow sensor was designed, the characterization of which is presented in Chapter 7, alongside the operational results of a gas flow sensor. An extension of the basic fabrication technology which allows the integration of microchannels on the sensor surface enables for the construction of a microfluidic flow sensor as presented in Chapter 8. Finally, in a differently orientated evolution of the fabrication technology, a flexible gas flow sensor was developed, as shown in Chapter 9...|$|E

40|$|Metabolism {{expresses the}} {{phenotype}} of living cells and understanding {{it is crucial}} for di_erent applications in biotechnology and health. However, metabolism involves an intricate network of biochemical reactions and the measure of their activity requires sophisticated methods that integrate disparate experimental data. High-throughput 'omics' technologies have posed a novel scenario where metabolism can be more globally analyzed and have brought about a new _eld of research termed metabolic systems biology. Speci_cally, organism-speci_c genome-scale metabolic networks, which de_ne the speci_c set of reactions for a given organism based on its genomic data, constitute the core of metabolic systems biology. The use of genome-scale metabolic networks {{is becoming more and}} more popular and their value has been proved for di_erent applications. In particular, these networks allow the analysis of metabolic pathways at an unprecedented level of detail and, to that end, di_erent mathematical pathway concepts have been developed. The concept of elementary _ux modes (EFMs) holds a prominent place in the _eld of metabolic systems biology, as it goes beyond prede_ned pathways and correctly captures _exibility found in metabolic systems. With the increasing availability of metabolomic, proteomic and, to a larger extent, transcriptomic data, the elucidation of speci_c metabolic properties in di_erent scenarios and cell types is a key topic in systems biology. The use of EFMs for this purpose has been limited so far, mainly because their computation has been infeasible for genome-scale metabolic networks. The purpose of this doctoral thesis is to overcome these issues and develop a novel framework for contextualizing gene expression data based on EFMs arising from genome-scale metabolic networks. Speci_cally, this thesis focuses on: The computation of a representative subset of EFMs that characterize global metabolic properties for a given cell/organism. A general statistical framework for selecting the most relevant EFMs in di_erent scenarios based on gene expression data. Application of this framework to distinguish metabolic features between various lung cancer subtypes. <b>Dissertation</b> <b>structure</b> This doctoral thesis is structured in two main parts.

Objetivamos averiguar como tais adolescentes estÃo compreendendo a construÃÃo das imagens de si na inserÃÃo em novos espaÃos de socializaÃÃo, como o das redes sociais. Inicialmente, realizamos uma observaÃÃo participante num grupo de apoio com 10 (dez) alunos, promovido pela equipe de OrientaÃÃo Educacional e Psicologia da escola da qual eu, pesquisadora e psicÃloga da instituiÃÃo, participei. O grupo foi proposto no intuito de trabalhar questÃes como autoestima, estresse, ansiedade e autoconhecimento atravÃs de atividades direcionadas, rodas de conversa, dinÃmicas e relaxamento. Participaram 10 (dez) estudantes dos 1 Â e 2 Â anos do Ensino MÃdio que gostariam de se engajar livremente na atividade. Durante a formaÃÃo do grupo, os estudantes passaram a se comunicar e manter relaÃÃes entre si, discorrendo sobre as prÃticas comunicacionais externas ao grupo. A internet apareceu como uma das principais mediadoras das relaÃÃes sociais. AlÃm de observaÃÃes presenciais, coletamos dados de como eles se relacionam nas redes sociais em modalidade grupal no WhatsApp. Na sequÃncia, foram selecionados 05 (cinco) integrantes que desejassem participar das fases seguintes da pesquisa: coleta de postagens na pÃgina pessoal Facebook durante os Ãltimos 05 (cinco) meses e entrevistas em profundidade. A estrutura dissertativa apresenta, inicialmente, os aspectos teÃrico-metodolÃgicos atravÃs da problematizaÃÃo, delimitaÃÃo do objeto e justificativa.

Initially, a participant observation was made in a support group with 10 (ten) students, conducted by Educational Guidance team and school psychology, which I, researcher and psychologist of the institution, attended. The group was proposed in order to work issues such as self-esteem, stress, anxiety and self-knowledge, through targeted activities, conversations, dynamics and relaxation wheels. A total of ten students of 1 st and 2 nd year high school students who would like to engage freely in the activity carried out against the shift. During the formation of the group, the students started to communicate and maintain relationships with each other, discussing the communication practices in which were engaged outside the group. The Internet appeared as a major mediator of social relations. They proposed the formation of a closed group WhatsApp to prolong the weekly contact. In addition to classroom observations, collect data as they relate to social networks in group mode in WhatsApp. Following, we selected 05 (five) members wishing to participate in the following phases of the research: collection of posts on the homepage Facebook over the past 05 (five) months and in-depth interviews.

40|$|Title: 'The Mode of Extemporization' The Role of Informality in Reconstituting Formal Urban Spaces: The Case of Nakuru, Kenya Researcher: Lawrence Esho, Promoted by: Prof. Han Verschure, Prof. Jef Van Den Broeck Amongst {{the many}} {{challenges}} of urbanization, {{the phenomenon of}} informali ty is today {{perhaps one of the}} most enduring realities confronting citie s in developing contexts. It is therefore unsurprising that its purporte d discovery in the early 1970 s aroused a zealous institutional and sch olarly interest, the objects being to elucidate its nature, explicate fa ctors responsible for its emergence and propagation and deliberate its i mplications for development policy. Consequently, the emergent discourse depicts the phenomenon as a corollary of complex and highly contradicto ry processes involving the articulation and colligation of historical, c ultural, political, socio-economic forces and spatial conditions. The de bate is elaborate, but only in respect of the socio-economic dimension o f informality. It however, remains vague on spatial aspects, and in spit e of there being consensus on the impacts of informal activities and app ropriative spatial practices on processes of contemporary urban morphoge nesis, much overemphasis is placed on the formers alleged degrading imp ort on urban spatial structures. This study queries the plausibility of such a stance, particularly in view of the fact that the real essence of such practices is yet to be determined in this regard. Additionally, th ere is as yet, no compelling account relating the informal dynamic to th e spatial frame of cities. Specifically, the possible agency of spatial- structural-institutional aspects of urbanity in the emergence and propag ation of informal urbanities is a subject that has remained largely unex plored. Consequently, the ensuing inquiry seeks to reorient the current debate on informality away from the international development and local macro and micro/socio-economic focus by exploring the theme within the m ore specific and substantive area of space theory and spatial planning. By critically exploring the interface between informality, urban space a nd spatial planning practice, the study not only seeks to foster underst anding on the subject in general, but more specifically, to explicate th e urban space allocation/appropriation mismatch that characterizes spati al scenes in Sub-Saharan African urban context. The exploration begins by revisiting the century-old history of urbaniza tion in Africa. Here, in addition to shedding light on historical underp innings of salient aspects of African urbanization and urbanity, it trac es the emergence of informality as a distinct residential, professional/ occupational, and social urban category to the advent in the continent, of western capitalism and modern urbanization. Likewise, it implicates e xclusionary planning principles and spatial frames introduced in the col onial era, and further perpetuated by urban managers and planners in the post-colonial era, in the propagation of informal space appropriation p ractices in the African city. This proposition is further explored throu gh a specific urban case, the city of Nakuru in Kenya. Here, an explorat ory analysis in respect of existing spatial patterns of appropriation co nfirms a positive correlation between spatial structure and the emergent pattern of localization. The relationship is not only symbiotic but dia lectical, meaning that whereas the urban anchorage of informal practices depends to a large extent on the urban underlayments structural proper ties, the former exerts a reconstitutive influence in relation to the la tter. This suggests that informal practices, even while promoting a mode of appropriation that seemingly borders on the eclectic, nevertheless p artially submit to the regimented command of contrived spatial structure s (i. e., the formal urban spatial grid). However, while so doing, they i nstigate a process of adapting these formal structures to their unique a ppropriative disposition in relation to space. These, as well as the stu dys other insights are of significant import, particularly as they chal lenge claims of aberrancy and degeneracy attributed to informal practice s and associated spatial patterns of appropriation. The two perspectives have long underpinned the ambivalent and sometimes inimical relationshi p between actuators of the informal dynamic and the formal planning and plan enforcement regimes. Most significantly, the findings underscore th e inevitability of a planning paradigm shift in relation to the phenomen on of informality. Subsequently, the dissertation advocates not only for approaches that recognize informally as a durable element of Africa urb anity, but which also endeavour to employ the synergy inherent in the fo rmal/informal dynamic to frame structures that will more readily effectu ate a harmonious, equitable, and sustainable urban development.

The <b>dissertation</b> was <b>structured</b> along the three types of work-family conflict, time-based, behaviour-based and strain-based conflict, also including the organizational and gender context. Three research questions were formulated: how do manager fathers experience conflicts between their work and family lives; how does the organization they are working for influence their capability of achieving work-family balance, especially in the frame of flexibility; and finally, how do discourses on managerial masculinity or involved fathering affect their work-family balance...|$|R

Public narratives about middle school literacy utilize high-stakes assessment results to categorize students, often in unilateral and unproductive ways (Franzak, 2006; Vasudevan & Campano, 2009). In contrast, empirical evidence suggests {{middle school students}} who fail to meet proficiency benchmarks represent a variety of skill profiles (Dennis, 2013; Lesaux & Keiffer, 2010) and interact with peers, texts, and teachers differently based on their identities and perceived identities (Hall, 2009; 2012). Despite this evidence, broad categorizations of students {{play a role in}} the design of many middle school instruction programs. Classroom literacy practices are influenced by teachers' interpretations of this information as well as other historical and local factors as they construct uniquely situated local literacy practices. This <b>dissertation,</b> <b>structured</b> as three separate but related papers, examines the intersection of a social practice view of literacy and a social construction view of disability. By documenting the literacy practices observed, the teachers' aims in constructing them, and the participation of students who are identified as struggling, this dissertation particularized what reading disability and difficulty meant for two students across multiple contexts in one middle school. Implications of this research suggest that understanding students with reading difficulties and disabilities from multiple perspectives, centering on their expertise, will enable teachers to enact more inclusive practices and contribute new viewpoints to research...|$|R
40|$|This {{cumulative}} dissertation examines {{applications of}} decision {{support in the}} field of social media and cloud computing. By the advent of Social Media, Big Data Analytics and Cloud Computing, new opportunities opening up {{in the field of}} decision support due to availability and ability to process new types of data sets. In this context, this dissertation introduces systems for the use of social media data for decisions and an approach for decision support in choosing a cloud computing provider. In this dissertation, the benefits of different Facebook profile data for use in product recommender systems will be analyzed. Two experiments are carried out, in which the recommendation quality is determined by user survey. In another part of this <b>dissertation,</b> <b>structured</b> stock recommendations of an online community are used to automatically derive and update a stock portfolio. So investment decisions in the stock market are supported by a regular recalculation of the community rating for individual stocks. An succeeding article on this topic develops a formalized model for the description of investment strategies to enable a portfolio management system that automatically follows a strategy parameterized by an investor. Finally, a cloud broker model is presented which offers price / performance-based decision support in identifying an appropriate IaaS provider on the market for public cloud services. In a fundamental part of the thesis an IT architecture design is proposed which allows the parallel use and evaluation of different solution approaches in an operative IT system. Statistical tests are used to identify the best performing approach(es) and prefer them quickly while in operation. Overall, this cumulative dissertation consists of an introduction and five published articles...|$|R
40|$|The {{structures}} for {{the expression of}} fault-tolerance provisions into the application software are the central topic of this <b>dissertation.</b> <b>Structuring</b> techniques provide means to control complexity, the latter being a relevant factor for the introduction of design faults. This fact and the ever increasing complexity of today's distributed software justify the need for simple, coherent, and effective {{structures for}} the expression of fault-tolerance in the application software. A first contribution of this dissertation is the definition of a base of structural attributes with which application-level fault-tolerance structures can be qualitatively assessed and compared {{with each other and with}} respect to the above mentioned need. This result is then used to provide an elaborated survey of the state-of-the-art of software fault-tolerance structures. The key contribution of this work is a novel structuring technique {{for the expression of}} the fault-tolerance design concerns in the application layer of those distributed software systems that are characterized by soft real-time requirements and with a number of processing nodes known at compile-time. The main thesis of this dissertation is that this new structuring technique is capable of exhibiting satisfactory values of the structural attributes in the domain of soft real-time, distributed and parallel applications. Following this novel approach, beside the conventional programming language addressing the functional design concerns, a special-purpose linguistic structure (the so-called "recovery language") is available to address error recovery and reconfiguration. This recovery language comes into play as soon as an error is detected by an underlying error detection layer, or when some erroneous condition is signaled by the application processes.

40|$|In {{the domain}} of safety and {{security}} specialized organizations often have to collaborate on an occasional basis with other organizations to head challenges {{that none of the}} partners can head (as easily) on its own. Such collaborations are temporal and often virtual in nature. One emerging perspective to study such collaborations is that of transactive memory systems (TMS). TMS are cognitive systems collaborating people develop to facilitate knowledge transfer and to contribute to people’s abilities to coordinate specialized knowledge. Developing an effective TMS may result in new organizational capabilities and services, while failure to do so is a known barrier to distributed team success. Addressing several gaps in TMS literature, in this <b>dissertation</b> the <b>structure,</b> functioning, and emergence of TMS are being explored of temporary and geographically distributed collaborations at intra-organizational level...|$|R

40|$|Complex {{international}} projects face various {{risks and}} challenges. Technical, {{economic and social}} complexities are constant companions of this form of doing business. Management of intra- and interorganizational network processes are thus a key competence for success. This <b>dissertation</b> analyzes <b>structures</b> and socio-economics performance in complex projects. The initial research hypothesis follows the logic that high socio economic complexity in international projects requires a strong integration of network governance in such projects in order to perform successfully. Management recommendations are generated by means of interviews, report analysis and quantitative analysis through organizational network analysis. Results show that a network and thus stakeholder oriented project management is {{necessary in order to}} improve and handle socio-economic complexity in projects. The ability of an organization to develop networks in short time, to form and to manage them becomes thus an important form of social capital...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} {{the situation of the}} right to adequate food in Nepal. The starting point are the constitutional recognition of the right to food sovereignty in this country’s Interim Constitution of 2007, and the inclusion of the rights to food, food security and food sovereignty in the 2015 Constitution of the Republic of Nepal. The general objective is to describe and assess the relevance and limits of the legal recognition of this right. In order to do so the <b>dissertation</b> is <b>structured</b> around the identification of structural, process, and outcome indicators that allow for the description of the legal and institutional framework for the right to food in this country; for the identification of steps taken towards the realization of this right; and finally for the analysis of changes in the right to food situation during the analyzed time period...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{becoming}} an urban teacher is multi-layered and complex, filled with intense struggles and success in small doses. Despite expensive reform efforts, political cries for accountability and standardized testing, and periodic shifts in school control, urban students and teachers are still—in large numbers—experiencing failure and defeat. Many new teachers in urban schools are not from urban backgrounds. They must learn about school and community culture, as well as {{gain an understanding of}} their own notions of school in order to bridge the cultural and social distance that separates them from the urban school community. Concurrently, they enter teacher preparation to acquire expertise in technical aspects of teaching and are challenged to develop caring and trusting relationships with students in their classrooms. ^ This research paints an ethnographic portrait of the journey of a cohort of white, middle-class student teachers working {{to make sense of the}} interrupted and chaotic urban school setting in a secondary teacher preparation program. The study is located within the context of a teacher preparation program as the researcher was also a participant in the program and the study. Using qualitative methods, the study documents how cohort members negotiated the difficult conflicts between their expectations of schools and schooling and the reality of the interrupted urban school context. The design of the research also helped to create a community of student teachers that worked together to learn about teaching. ^ The <b>dissertation,</b> <b>structured</b> as a series of case studies, builds on notions of teaching as a performing art and focuses on key components of effective urban teaching and learning to teach in urban contexts: improvisation, care, collegiality, and trust. Seven recommendations for urban teacher education emerged from the data analysis. The most important recommendations center on the creation and maintenance of cohorts of student teachers, the implementation of workshops for student teachers in drama, improvisation and performance, and the focused academic study of the interrupted-ness and distressed condition of urban schools. ...|$|R
