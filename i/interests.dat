40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{stationary}} characteristics of computed real <b>interest</b> rates with nominal <b>interest</b> rates and inflation for 22 OECD countries. Using quarterly data over the 2000 – 2010 period, LM unit root test is employed which endogenously determines {{up to two}} structural breaks in level and trend. The empirical findings suggest a combination of stationary and nonstationary results for real <b>interest</b> rates, nominal <b>interest</b> rates and inflation. Besides, the internal stationarity or nonstationary interactions of real and nominal <b>interest</b> rates are investigated by inflation. The results indicate that stationary nominal <b>interest</b> rates and inflation cause stationary real <b>interest</b> rates. At the same time nonstationary nominal <b>interest</b> rates and inflation could cause a stationary or nonstationary real <b>interest</b> rate with respect to cointegration. Stationary nominal <b>interest</b> rate and nonstationary real <b>interest</b> rate cause to nonstationary real <b>interest</b> rate while nonstationary nominal <b>interest</b> rate and stationary inflation could cause stationary or nonstationary real <b>interest</b> rate. </p...|$|R

5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant <b>interests.</b> The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong <b>interests</b> grounding prima facie rights, and some prima facie rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily prima facie rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' <b>interests</b> against suffering and death ground prima facie rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These prima facie rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E
