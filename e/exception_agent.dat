40|$|Over {{the recent}} years, IP and email {{spoofing}} gained much importance for security concerns {{due to the}} current changes in manipulating the system performance in different online environments. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) {{has been used to}} secure these environments for sharing their data over network and host based IDS approaches. However, the rapid growth of intrusion events over Internet and local area network become responsible for the distribution of different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing systems. The current signature detection approach used by IDS, detects unclear actions based on analyzing and describing the action patterns such as time, text, password etc and has been faced difficulties in updating information, detect unknown novel attacks, maintenance of an IDS which is necessarily connected with analyzing and patching of security holes, and the lack of information on user privileges and attack signature structure. Thus, this paper proposes an EADS (<b>Exception</b> <b>agent</b> detection system) for securing the header information carried by IP over online environments. The study mainly concerns with the deployment of new technique for detecting and eliminating the unknown threats attacks during the data sharing over online environments.

40|$|Abstract—Open multiagent systems {{consist of}} {{autonomous}} agents that are built by different vendors. In principle, open multiagent systems cannot provide any guarantees about {{the behaviors of}} their agents. This means that when agents are working together, such as carrying out a business protocol, one agent’s misbehavior may potentially create an <b>exception</b> for another <b>agent</b> and obstruct its proper working. Faced with such an <b>exception,</b> an <b>agent</b> {{should be able to}} identify the problem by verifying the compliance of other agents. Previous work on verification of protocols unrealistically assume that participants have full knowledge of a protocol. However, when multiple agents enact a protocol, each agent has access to its part of the protocol and not more. This will require agents to check verification by querying others and more importantly by discovering the contracts between them. Here, we propose a commitment-based framework for detecting exceptions in which an agent augments its part of the protocol with its knowledge to construct states that are previously hidden to the agent by generating possible commitments between other agents. The agent then queries others to confirm those states. Our framework is formalized using C+ and is tested using a realistic business scenario. I...|$|R
30|$|Clearly, even if {{during the}} {{lifetime}} {{there is a}} downward adjustment in the labor supply, overall, the risks suggested by Boersch-Supan and Ludwig (2010) materialize only to a small extent in our model—labor supply increases substantially and for nearly all types of subcohorts (the only <b>exception</b> are <b>agents</b> with high impatience and high preference for leisure, especially in the DC system). Moreover, the ranking of adjustments in the labor supply is preserved across the pension systems for the respective subcohorts. The increases are similar across the pension systems, although DC provides stronger incentives for work. The higher the preference for leisure and impatience, the larger the scope of labor supply adjustment.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues in dealing with {{exceptions}} in open multi-agent systems (MAS) is lack of uniform representation of exceptions and their shared semantics. In {{the absence of a}} uniform framework different business organizations may use different representations for the same exception or may interpret the same exception in different ways. In order to address this issue we apply an ontological approach as a uniform way of representing and interpreting exceptions in cross-organizational settings. This helps agents from different organizations interpret exceptional situations in an unambiguous way and exchange exception related information using standard structures. We believe that an exception ontology along with a domain ontology increases the open MAS reliability and also enhances its fault tolerance capability. The proposed ontology is built using the ontological support provided by the JADE <b>agent</b> framework and <b>exception</b> diagnoses <b>agents</b> are implemented using the JACK™ agent framework...|$|R

40|$|Diagnosing {{exceptions}} in multi-agent systems (MAS) is {{a complex}} task due to the distributed nature of the data and control in such systems. This complexity is exacerbated in open environments where independently developed autonomous agents {{interact with each other}} in order to achieve their goals.

In this paper we propose a novel exception diagnosis system that is able to analyse and detect exceptions effectively. The proposed architecture consists of specialised <b>exception</b> diagnosis <b>agents</b> called sentinel agents. The sentinel agents are equipped with knowledge of observable abnormal situations, their underlying causes, and resolution strategies associated with these causes.

As with few <b>exceptions</b> these <b>agents</b> have marrow depressant qualities {{there has always been a}} serious danger that therapeutically effective doses will prove lethal as a consequence of haematopoietic failure. Within the last 10 years some encouragement has come from the demonstration that an injection of viable bone marrow can restore haematopoietic function (Lorenz, Congdon and Uphoff, 1952) when given after a dose of irradiation sufficient to cause haematopoietic failure but insufficient to damage irreparably the intestinal epithelium. It has been shown quite clearly that this restoration is due to repopulation of the depleted haematopoietic sites by the injected marrow (Ford et al., 1956). Barnes et al.
