5000|$|The {{basic unit}} in MDI is a Men's Team, a {{relatively}} small group of men who meet on a regular, usually weekly, basis. Men who have each other's backs, as it were. Since only men can really {{know what it is}} like to be a man, these teams are not just a place to meet to discuss men's issues, but a space to gather; where men enter a rarefied circle that harkens back to a time when men's very survival depended on other men they could trust. Values such as honor, action, trust, loyalty, sacrifice, strength, integrity and success are cultivated in a real experiential way so that members are grounded in their masculinity and not overcome by <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>lose</b> sight of <b>it.</b> In these meetings their batteries are re-charged in a way that cannot be done anywhere else, so that when its members return to their families and significant others, they come back with a renewed sense of their purpose and masculinity, which, in their belief, cannot be achieved by group therapy or by intellectual means. Team is the operative word, where members pursue their own personal growth while supporting the team to succeed at making a difference in their community. Teams are typically satellites of a larger [...] "Men's Division", which itself is a collection of teams, which takes on the same purpose as their teams, namely to foster success of its members while taking part in community service, charitable causes and civic activities. Teams are led by captains or team leaders whose basic function is to direct the momentum that a team of men naturally generates, to keep it on point and manage the meetings themselves. Any adult male can become a member of MDI regardless of religious belief, life experience or ethnic background. The Teams are grouped in Divisions, and the Divisions are grouped in Regions. There are currently seven regions in MDI: Eastern Canada, New England, the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Southwest, the Western Region and Western Canada.|$|R
