40|$|This thesis {{maintains}} that <b>glazes</b> may be colored or textured {{by the addition}} of common substances such as metal filings, gravels, sands, or local clays. Three basic <b>glazes</b> were chosen: one transparent, one mat, and one semi-mat. To these basic <b>glazes</b> more than fifty inorganic materials were added in separate test batches. A diversity of results was produced ranging from a glossy, sand-speckled <b>glaze</b> to a rough <b>glaze</b> made with aluminum shavings; from a white, iridescent <b>glaze</b> made with gypsum to a dull gun-metal black <b>glaze</b> made with brass shavings; from a transparent colorless <b>glaze</b> made with aspirin tablets to a dark green translucent <b>glaze</b> made with copper filings. This study can be used as the basis for a unit on <b>glazes</b> in a secondary school classroom; its purpose is to serve as an introduction to <b>glazes,</b> while teaching the students an appreciation of some of the earth’s abundant raw materials and how they can be used in ceramic <b>glazes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Surface {{smoothness}} is {{an important}} characteristic of ceramic <b>glazes</b> as it influences chemical resistivity, glossiness and stainability of <b>glazes.</b> Surface crystallinity of zirconia-based and titania-based <b>glazes</b> (as two common opaque <b>glazes),</b> calcium-zinc based matte <b>glaze</b> and also two transparent <b>glazes</b> with different compositions were studied in this work. Degree of surface crystallinity measured by stereological methods using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that transparent <b>glaze</b> has the minimum degree of crystallinity (2. 1 %) and the maximum amount (25. 4 %) was obtained for matte <b>glaze.</b> In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the <b>glaze</b> mineralogy. Optical surface profiler showed that the smoothest surface belongs to titania-based opaque <b>glaze</b> (Ra = 0. 0157 µm) and transparent <b>glaze</b> (Ra = 0. 0168 µm). In contrast, the roughest <b>glaze</b> surface corresponded to the matte <b>glaze</b> (Ra = 0. 2772 µm). The results suggest that surface roughness is influenced by crystallinity of surface, but degree of surface crystallinity {{is not the only}} parameter that can influence the surface roughness. The most important factor is the morphology of the crystals grow and their protrusion from the surface. © 201...|$|R

5|$|A {{survey by}} {{archaeologist}} Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed {{a number of}} medieval potsherds {{in the vicinity of}} the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and cockle shells. Fragments of green <b>glazed</b> jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant sandstone roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century <b>glazed</b> ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally the <b>glazes</b> {{that are}} used are mostly slipware or <b>glazes</b> formed from the purest and {{smallest}} particles found in the clay body. Two main <b>glazes</b> are applied to the pots. The first of these is a yellow <b>glaze</b> that is formed by adding chalk to the natural clay body. The <b>glaze</b> is an off-white before the firing and after turns into a warm yellow. The second <b>glaze</b> is made similarly, but instead of adding chalk, the villagers use burned batteries, and some compound in the batter ash turns the <b>glaze</b> black when fired.|$|R

5|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic <b>glazed</b> stepless cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth <b>glazed</b> nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475km/h (295mph) at 5,000m (16,400ft) and a cruise speed of 370km/h (230mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300km/h (190mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.|$|E
50|$|In this recipe, the {{addition}} of alkali helps to increase the hardness of the surface and clarify the colour of the <b>glaze</b> as well. With the development of tin <b>glazes,</b> the significant amount of tin oxide indicates its deliberate addition as an opacifier. A recipe involving the use of three ingredients was given in Abu’l-Qasim’s treatise from Persia in the 14th century: a glass-frit of quartz and potash, a lead-tin calx and a calcination of limestone and quartz. Afterwards, with the spread of tin <b>glazes,</b> lead gradually became the principal background in tin <b>glazes,</b> though {{a small proportion of}} alkali was still introduced in order to increase the fusibility. No specific recipes alluding to tin <b>glazes</b> in Spain have been found in ancient archives. However, recent research has shown that, at least since the 10th century AD, most Islamic white <b>glazes</b> in Spain were lead-silica <b>glazes</b> with tin oxide as an opacifier. That is, no alkaline <b>glazes</b> or lead-alkaline <b>glazes</b> have been found. Piccolpasso recorded several <b>glazes</b> used in Italy in the 1550s, all variations of lead, tin, lime, soda and potash <b>glazes.</b> It is believed early Spanish <b>glazes</b> were similar.|$|R

25|$|The use of lead <b>glaze</b> {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali <b>glazes</b> {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali <b>glazes</b> must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful <b>glaze</b> must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the <b>glaze.</b> It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the <b>glaze</b> and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the <b>glaze</b> contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as <b>glazes</b> are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead <b>glaze</b> has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali <b>glazes.</b> Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead <b>glaze</b> matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali <b>glaze,</b> rendering it less prone to crazing. A <b>glaze</b> should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead <b>glaze</b> mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali <b>glazes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either {{direct or indirect}} trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, <b>glazed,</b> and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on blue and white panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey <b>glazed</b> bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467.
