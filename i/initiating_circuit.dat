Norepinephrine long-term potentiation of perforant path input to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus provides a model for norepinephrine initiated memory processes. However, in vitro, the pairing of perforant path stimulation and norepinephrine is not required for the occurrence of norepinephrine-dependent long-term potentiation. Since bath application of norepinephrine induces long-term changes in 2 nd messenger signalling and differs {{in a number of}} ways from physiological norepinephrine release, the present study is an in vivo test of the associative requirement for the pairing of perforant path input with norepinephrine to induce long-term potentiation. Phasic activation of the locus coeruleus is provided by glutamate infusion into the locus coeruleus to initiate transient norepinephrine release in the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Perforant path stimulation (0. 067 Hz) was given throughout the experiment in the paired condition. In the unpaired condition perforant path stimulation was interrupted 10 min prior to locus coeruleus activation and resumed 10 min after locus coeruleus activation. Locus coeruleus-induced long-term potentiation of both EPSP slope and population spike only occurred in the pairing condition. This result argues that, in vivo, temporal proximity of locus coeruleus-associated norepinephrine release and perforant path stimulation are required to induce long-term plasticity. The associativity requirement for locus coeruleus activation and perforant path stimulation in vivo is consistent with the hypothesis that norepinephrine can <b>initiate</b> <b>circuit</b> changes supporting learning and memory...|$|R

The paper tests the viability of two EH concepts: a battery management system, and a semi-autonomous system. A statistical estimate of the button operations is performed for various computer activities, showing that an average of up to 3300 mouse clicks per hour was produced for gaming applications, representing a tip frequency of 0. 91 Hz on the PVF 2 member.

However, attackers who have the knowledge of a priori trust distributions are still capable of largely reducing the anonymity protected by trust-based circuits. The root cause is that these attackers have a high probability to guess the users who <b>initiate</b> trust-based <b>circuits</b> through the routers trusted by few other users (i. e., inference attacks). In this paper, we uncover trust degree, an essential feature of routing anonymity that is effective in defeating inference attacks but has been overlooked {{in the design of}} existing trust-based onion routing. We conduct an isolated model based analysis to understand why the trust degree is effective and how {{it can be used to}} resist inference attacks. Our major contributions are three-fold. First, we present a model to exclusively reason about inference attacks in trust-based onion routing. This model isolates the anonymity compromised by inference attacks from other attacks (e. g., correlation-like attacks), and hence derives an exclusive design space that reveals trust degree as the key feature against inference attacks. Second, to show the usefulness of our model, we design a new routing algorithm by taking into account of trust degree. Our algorithm can protect anonymity against inference attacks without sacrificing the capability against attackers' routers. Third, we compare trust-based routing algorithms with and without considering trust degree using real-world social networking datasets. These comparisons present evidence to confirm the effectiveness of trust degree in defeating inference attacks under real-world settings. Department of Computin...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} studies have indicated an important regulatory role for natural killer (NK) cells, a major constituent of the innate immune system in modulating antigen-specific responses. Herein, we have investigated the possible participation of these cells in regulating the polyclonal response as well. For these studies we have utilized heat-killed Brucella abortus (HKBA). Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterium that is pathogenic for both humans and animals. An outstanding feature of the infectious process is the rapid production of polyclonal antibodies, particularly of the IgG 2 c subclass, that bypasses the requirement for clonally specific antigen recognition. We report here that NK-cell depletion profoundly reduced the production of these polyclonal antibodies suggesting that activation of B cells by HKBA requires help from NK cells.

40|$|RdgB 2 is {{required}} for dim-light input into intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells ABSTRACT A subset of retinal ganglion cells is intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and con-tributes directly to the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment under bright-light conditions. ipRGCs are also indirectly activated by light through cellular <b>circuits</b> <b>initiated</b> in rods and cones. A mammalian homologue (RdgB 2) of a phosphoinositide transfer/ex-change protein that functions in Drosophila phototransduction is expressed in the retinal ganglion cell layer. This raised the possibility that RdgB 2 might function in the intrinsic light response in ipRGCs, which depends on a cascade reminiscent of Drosophila phototransduc-tion. Here we found that under high light intensities, RdgB 2 −/ − mutant mice showed normal pupillary light responses and circadian photoentrainment. Consistent with this behavioral phenotype, the intrinsic light responses of ipRGCs in RdgB 2 −/ − were indistinguishable from wild-type. In contrast, under low-light conditions, RdgB 2 −/ − mutants displayed defects in both circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light response. The RdgB 2 protein was not expressed in ipRGCs but was in GABAergic amacrine cells, which provided inhibitory feed-back onto bipolar cells.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that a Taoist-group called Ch‘uan Chen Chiao (全眞敎) {{was formed in}} the North-China province in the Chin Dynasty. This Ch‘uan Chen Chiao had grown remarkable, because Chi‘u Chang-ch‘un (丘長春), {{one of the greatest}} disciples of that group's founder, was invited by and given high favour by Chingis Khan who at that time had been waging war in Central Asia. The journey, which Chang-ch‘un extended up to the camp of Chingis Khan, is popularly called the Western Circuit. There has been already one or two kinds of interpretation for the reason why Chang-ch‘un made the Circuit far away to Central Asia. But, these opinions are not acceptable to me because they did not give any attention to the relation between Ch‘uan Chen Chiao's doctrine and his journey. According to Ch‘uan Chen Chiao, a Taoist's training method was divided into two parts, i. e., one's own internal salvation-work and other's external salvation-work. The Chinese people had suffered much from a series of wars in those days. It is quite natural that the work of saving a suffering people should have constituted one of the important external training activities imposed on Taoist. We may say that Chang-ch‘un had <b>initiated</b> his <b>Circuit</b> so as to grasp an opportunity for external training. It, however, became clear, according to his own travelling-tale as well as the biographies written by Chang-ch‘un's disciples, that Chang-ch‘un made such an extensive trip duc to the advice given by his students in order to greatly propagate Ch‘uan Chen Chiao in the future. To develop a group {{was also one of the}} Taoist's external training tasks. Therefore, the motive as well as the purpose of conducting a Circuit was the practice of doctrine as a typical Ch‘uan Chen Taoist. In the long run, Chang-ch‘un's Western Circuit was completely successful and Chang-ch‘un was able to establish a strong foundation for the growing Ch‘uan Chen Group in yuan Dynasty. Therefore, we must say that the role played by Chi‘u Chang-ch‘un was literally tremendous for the growth of Ch‘uan Chen Chiao in its early stage. The rapid development of Ch‘uan Chen Chiao became fuel for controversy with Buddhism later on. So, Chang-ch‘un's Western Circuit had brought an unexpected influence into this ideological conflict...|$|R
40|$|Chip multiprocessors {{with few}} {{to tens of}} {{processing}} cores are already commercially available. Increased scaling of technology is making it feasible to integrate even more cores on a single chip. Providing the cores with fast access to data is vital to overall system performance. When a core requires access {{to a piece of}} data, the core's private cache memory is searched first. If a miss occurs, the data is looked up in the next level(s) of the memory hierarchy, where often one or more levels of cache are shared between two or more cores. Communication between the cores and the slices of the on-chip shared cache is carried through the network-on-chip(NoC). Interestingly, the cache and NoC mutually affect the operation of each other; communication over the NoC affects the access latency of cache data, while the cache organization generates the coherence and data messages, thus affecting the communication patterns and latency over the NoC. This thesis considers hybrid packet/circuit switched NoCs, i. e., packet switched NoCs enhanced with the ability to configure circuits. The communication and performance benefit that come from using circuits is predicated on amortizing the time cost incurred for configuring the circuits. To address this challenge, NoC designs are proposed that take advantage of properties of the cache traffic, namely temporal locality and predictability, to amortize or hide the circuit configuration time cost. First, a coarse-grained circuit configuration policy is proposed that exploits the temporal locality in the cache traffic to periodically configure circuits for the heavily communicating nodes. This allows the design of a locality-aware cache that promotes temporal communication locality through data placement, while designing suitable data replacement and migration policies. Next, a fine-grained configuration policy, called Déjà Vu switching, is proposed for leveraging predictability of data messages by <b>initiating</b> a <b>circuit</b> configuration as soon as a cache hit is detected and before the data becomes available. Its benefit is demonstrated for saving interconnect energy in multi-plane NoCs. Finally, a more proactive configuration policy is proposed for fast caches, where <b>circuit</b> reservations are <b>initiated</b> by request messages, which can greatly improve communication latency and system performance. ...|$|R

We focus on interictal activity in focal temporal lobe epilepsy and evaluate functional connectivity (FC) differences that emerge as function of bilateral versus strictly unilateral epileptiform activity. We assess the strength of FC at rest between the ictal and non-ictal temporal lobes, in addition to whole brain connectivity with the ictal temporal lobe. Results revealed strong connectivity between the temporal lobes for both patient groups, but this did not vary {{as a function of}} unilateral versus bilateral interictal status. Both the left and right unilateral temporal lobe groups showed significant anti-correlated activity in regions outside the epileptogenic temporal lobe, primarily involving the contralateral (non-ictal/non-pathologic) hemisphere, with precuneus involvement prominent. The bilateral groups did not show this contralateral anti-correlated activity. This anti-correlated connectivity may represent a form of protective and adaptive inhibition, helping to constrain epileptiform activity to the pathologic temporal lobe. The absence of this activity in the bilateral groups may be indicative of flawed inhibitory mechanisms, helping to explain their more widespread epileptiform activity. Our data suggest that the location and build up of epilepsy networks in the brain are not truly random, and are not limited to the formation of strictly epileptogenic networks. Functional networks may develop {{to take advantage of the}} regulatory function of structures such as the precuneus to instantiate an anti-correlated network, generating protective cortico-cortico inhibition for the purpose of limiting seizure spread or epileptogenesis...|$|R
50|$|A line of {{research}} investigates long term potentiation (LTP), a process that describes how a memory can be consolidated between two neurons, or brain cells, ultimately by creating a circuit within the brain that can encode a memory. To <b>initiate</b> a learning <b>circuit</b> between two neurons, one prominent study described using tetanus stimulations to depolarize one neuron by 30mV, which, in turn, activated its NMDA glutamate receptors (Nowak, Bregestovski, Ascher, Herbert, & Prochiantz, 1984). The activation of these receptors resulted in Ca2+ flooding the cell, initiating a cascade of secondary messengers. The cascade of resulting reactions, brought about by secondary messengers, terminates with the activation of cAMP response binding element protein (CREB), which acts as a transcription factor for various genes and initiates their expression (Hawkins, Kandel, & Bailey, 2006). Some proponents argue that the genes stimulate changes in communication between neurons, which underlie the encoding of memory; others suggest that the genes are byproducts of the LTP signaling pathway and are not directly involved in LTP. However, following the cascade of secondary messengers, no one would dispute that more AMPA receptors appear in the postsynaptic terminal (Hayashi et al., 2000). Higher numbers of AMPA receptors, taken together with the aforementioned events, allow for increased firing potential in the postsynaptic cell, which creates an improved learning circuit between these two neurons (Hayashi et al., 2000). Because of the specific, activity-dependent nature of LTP, it is an ideal model for a neural correlate of memory, as postulated by numerous studies; together, these {{studies show that the}} abolishment of LTP prevents the formation of memory at the neuronal level (Hawkins, Kandel, & Bailey, 2006).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Spinal interneurons {{have emerged}} as crucial targets of supraspinal input during {{post-injury}} axonal remodelling. For example, lesioned corticospinal projections use propriospinal neurons as relay stations to form intraspinal detour circuits that circumvent the lesion site and contribute to functional recovery. While {{a number of the}} molecules that determine the formation of neuronal circuits in the developing nervous system have been identified, it is much less understood which of these cues are also expressed in the injured spinal cord and can thus guide growing collaterals and <b>initiate</b> synaptogenesis during <b>circuit</b> remodelling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this question we characterized the expression profile of a number of guidance and synaptogenic molecules in the cervical spinal cord of healthy and spinal cord-injured mice by in situ hybridization. To assign the expression of these molecules to distinct populations of interneurons we labeled short and long propriospinal neurons by retrograde tracing and glycinergic neurons using a transgenically expressed fluorescent protein. Interestingly, we found that most of the molecules studied including members of slit-, semaphorin-, synCAM-, neuroligin- and ephrin- families as well as their receptors are also present in the adult CNS. While many of these molecules were abundantly expressed in all interneurons examined, some molecules including slits, semaphorin 7 a, synCAM 4 and neuroligin 1 showed preferential expression in propriospinal interneurons. Overall the expression pattern of guidance and synaptogenic molecules in the cervical spinal cord appeared to be stable over time and was not substantially altered following a midthoracic spinal cord injury. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study indicates that many of the guidance and synaptogenic cues that regulate neuronal circuit formation in development are also present in the adult CNS and therefore likely contribute to the remodelling of axonal connections in the injured spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. Four {{patients}} with previous repair of tetralogy of Fallot and ventricular tachycardia underwent map-guided surgery to ablate the arrhythmias. Background. Although {{patients with}} repaired tetralogy of Fallot are {{at increased risk}} of sudden death due to ventricular tachycardia, little is known of the origin and mechanism of this arrhythmia. Methods. A customized right ventricular balloon with 112 electrodes was used to record endocardial activation and, where possible, simultaneous epicardial recordings were obtained with a sock electrode array. Three patients had an aneurysm of the right ventricular outflow tract and one had a septal aneurysm. All had moderate to severe pulmonary valve insufficiency. Preoperative electrophysiologic study demonstrated inducible rapid (cycle length 180 to 300 ms) hemodynamically unstable monoform ventricular tachycardias. Results. Intraoperatively, five different tachycardias (two in one patient) were induced and mapped. The sites of earliest activation were located in the subendocardium of the right ventricular outflow tract in all, but they varied widely among the septum, free wall and parietal band and could not be identified by visible scar. All were due to a macroreentrant <b>circuit</b> <b>initiated</b> by a critical delay in activation beyond a functional arc of block. Two patients treated by cryoablation while the heart was beating and perfused at normal temperature had inducible ventricular tachycardia postoperatively. In the two subsequent patients, the application of cryoablation under anoxic cardiac arrest resulted in noninducibility of arrhythmia. Conclusions. Ventricular tachycardia in tetralogy of Fallot in these four patients was caused by macroreentry in the right ventricular outflow tract. Surgical success depends on detailed mapping and cryoablation under anoxic cardiac arrest. In patients at risk of sudden death, map-directed surgery may offer distinct advantages over either implantable devices or drug therapy...|$|R

Using a bipolar voltage cutoff of 1. 5 mV, the total infarct areas measured using the basket catheter, linear catheter, and MRI were similar (17. 8 cm 2 vs 20. 9 cm 2 vs 17. 5 cm 2; P =. 69); however, the correlation between MRI and catheter scar area measurement was best for the basket catheter (basket vs linear: r =. 76 vs r =. 71). In 3 animals, sustained poorly tolerated VT was <b>initiated</b> and the <b>circuit</b> mapped successfully with the basket catheter in < 5 minutes. Conclusion. Rapid substrate and activation mapping using a 64 -electrode mini-basket catheter allows detailed voltage and activation mapping in postinfarction cardiomyopathy. This system may be useful for substrate and VT mapping in human postinfarction cardiomyopathy...|$|R
