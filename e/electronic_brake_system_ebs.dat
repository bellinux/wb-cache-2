40|$|Scania CV AB {{is one of}} {{the major}} heavy truck {{manufacturers}} in the world. Many of their trucks use a brake system that is electronic where the driver demands retardation and the brake power is generated pneumatically. The objective of this thesis is to re-search if it is possible to determine the pressure at which the brakes start giving a retard-ing force, the application pressure, for the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>System</b> (<b>EBS)</b> and if a pre-dictive estimation of the application pressure can be implemented. Three different ways of determining the application pressure are presented in the thesis and a signal processing method where the mean of pre-braking acceleration is used for change detection gives the most reliable results. This method is then implemented in a recursive filter where a predictive estimation of the application pressure is developed. Due to the lack of precision in the signals the estimation does not give a result that can be used and until this is solved by Scania it is difficult to see how a good way of pre-dicting the application pressure can be developed...|$|E
40|$|This review {{concerns}} potential {{traffic safety}} {{effects from the}} introduction of longer and heavier trucks than those currently allowed in Sweden. For this purpose, a summary of results from accident studies, literature summaries and in-depth studies of fatal accidents involving heavy trucks {{done in the past}} few years was made. In addition, a focus group study with truck drivers was conducted and results from a parallel VTI study concerning overtaking of longer trucks have also been included in order to give an overall picture of the possible traffic safety effects associated with the introduction of longer and heavier trucks in Sweden. Following are some of the recommendations, based on the aspects that have been addressed in this report: Longer and heavier vehicles should mainly operate on main roads where it is possible to overtake heavy vehicles without fear of oncoming traffic. Longer and heavier vehicles should operate as little as possible in urban areas. 9 ̆ 5 Longer and heavier vehicles shall be constructed for good stability, and be equipped with <b>Electronic</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>System</b> (<b>EBS).</b> 9 ̆ 5 Longer and heavier vehicles puts greater demand on tires, brakes and especially maintenance and inspection. 9 ̆ 5 Driver fatigue is a cause of an essential part of single-vehicle accidents with heavy vehicles. Drive and rest times may be harder to keep with the extra-long vehicles if rest areas, which are already today overcrowded along certain roads, are not extended. 9 ̆ 5 The signs of the transition distance on 2 + 1 roads should be reviewed to possibly reduce the risk of dangerous situations and emergencies caused by overtaking of heavy vehicles. 9 ̆ 5 Additional field studies on two-lane roads are necessary to determine whether there is a higher risk to overtake a 30 m long vehicle compared to overtaking a conventional heavy truck...|$|E
40|$|A {{reasonable}} {{response to}} transport industry pressure for increasing efficiency is for road authorities and regulators to allow higher mass limits (HML) heavy vehicles {{onto the road}} network. This forms {{part of an overall}} strategy to encourage "multi-combination vehicles" or MCVs (Haldane, 2002) onto portions of the road network that can withstand greater mass loadings. One of the tools used currently and increasingly by regulators and road authorities in Australia to monitor heavy vehicles (HVs) is the Intelligent Access Programme (IAP) under the auspices of Transport Certification Australia (TCA). The IAP monitors the location, timing, speed and configuration of a HV using vehicle telematics and usually incorporates GPS satellite tracking. The first large-scale application of IAP to HVs will be on HML vehicles. To manage the mass aspects of expanded HML access in the meantime, an interim solution involving a self-declaration function allowing transport operators to identify when they were operating at HML {{will be part of the}} initial monitoring of HML HVs under IAP. The reason for this was, in setting up IAP Stage 1, the TCA Board realised that an on-board mass monitoring solution for HVs was potentially several years away. In so doing, the TCA Board realised that the long-term solution to managing HV mass would be via on-board mass monitoring technology. To this end, TCA’s 2006 / 07 business plan, endorsed by the TCA board in July 2006, contained two new research projects to ensure the expansion and value adding of its services to the transport industry and road authorities. The projects have identified technical issues regarding on-board mass monitoring systems including: *	Determination of tare vs. payload using OBM system at an evidentiary level; *	Accuracy, robustness and tamper issues of OBM components (mass sensors, connections, power supply, display unit etc.); *	Potential use of <b>electronic</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> (<b>EBS)</b> data to cross-check measurement results from OBM system; and *	Potential standardization of OBM components to achieve interoperability between trailers fitted from different supplier. Accordingly, one of these projects will provide a standard to ensure interoperability between any IAP certified prime mover and trailer monitoring devices. The other project will investigate the feasibility of on-board vehicle mass-monitoring devices for IAP use. This test plan addresses that portion of the feasibility assessment project concerned with: *	accuracy as determined by measuring OBM outputs vs. certified scales; and *	tamper-evidence as garnered from changes to dynamic signals from OBM systems, including from electronic braking systems (EBS) and engine control modules (ECM). To do so it sets out a programme to test suitable and available OBM systems to be reported by the TCA when the on-board vehicle mass feasibility of project is completed in 2009...|$|E

In order to introduce these features {{in a short time}} period, with affordable costs including validation makes it necessary to find an alternative approach to existing practices of development process. Based on the advanced engineering studies on model based product development, within Volvo Group Trucks Technology, a proposal was to have a simulation environment capable of integrating the entire range of functional systems represented by physical models and motion controllers followed by implementing software in loop simulations for the verification of the motion control systems. The aim of this thesis was to generate a simulation environment to support function development of new active safety functions and verification of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> (EBS) functions by integrating existing in-house tools within Volvo Group Trucks Technology and the complied software code (EBS- 7) from the supplier.

Of equal importance is their ability to detect and avoid programming mistakes. The development of CPS has predominantly been accomplished using the C programming language. Although C is a powerful language, it lacks features present in other languages that facilitate the development of reliable systems.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a prototype energy harvesting autonomous sensor, called the Autonomous Wheel Speed Sensor (AWSS), that is targeted for {{operation in the}} <b>Electronic</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> (EBS) of vehicles. In order to monitor the rotational state of a wheel, the EBS currently uses a passive Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) which is a variable reluctance electromagnetic transducer.

This project presents the first successful attempt at converting the WSS into an energy harvesting wireless wheel speed sensor or in other words an Autonomous Wheel Speed Sensor (AWSS), which provides information about the rotational state of the wheel to the EBS system over a wireless link. Unlike most wireless sensors which use batteries, the AWSS employs energy harvesting to power itself by simultaneously using the WSS electromagnetic transducer as an energy harvester as well as a sensor. By thus making an autonomous WSS, the amount of cables in the existing WSS assembly can be reduced, leading to savings in material, assembly and maintenance costs. The self-powered prototype AWSS successfully implements periodic wireless transmission of the wheel speed along with near real-time wheel lock detection, at a duty cycle of less than Th...|$|R
