5|$|According to Moubayed, Atrash's anti-government {{activities}} significantly {{contributed to}} Shishakli's resignation and departure from Syria in February 1954 amid the countrywide unrest. In the first post-Shishakli democratic election later that year, Atrash {{was elected to}} parliament. Atrash was offered a cabinet position in Said al-Ghazzi's September 1955 government, but <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> the offer because of the Ba'ath Party's opposition to the government's makeup.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{winning the}} Jack Adams Award as top coach and being {{popular with the}} Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year {{contract}} extension by replacement GM Darcy Regier. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> this under {{the grounds that it}} was too short, and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.|$|E

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> German racial {{supremacy}} {{and instead}} saw the Norwegian race as the progenitor of northern Europe, tracing {{his own family}} tree in his spare time. Party members did not receive preferential treatment, though Quisling did not himself share in the wartime hardships of his fellow Norwegians. Nevertheless, many gifts went unused {{and he did not}} live extravagantly.|$|E
5|$|His new {{alphabet}} closely resembled an 1853 {{publication of}} Isaac Pitman, containing only 33 letters. However, at this point, Young was still enamored {{with the original}} Deseret alphabet, and so <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> the proposal and Watt continued to publicly promote the alphabet {{as part of his}} job despite his reservations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that we do not}} have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E

5|$|After a {{promising}} {{start to the}} 1996–97, Everton were beaten six {{times in a row}} after Christmas and Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the show of support, though <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> a transfer offer from Chelsea, who were prepared to double Southall's wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's resignation, and steered the club away from relegation.|$|E
5|$|As a British {{passport}} holder born outside the United Kingdom, FIFA regulations {{at the time}} allowed him to select which of the Home Nations {{he would like to}} represent, which led to interest from the non-English Home Nations. In September 1999, <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> a call-up from Northern Ireland in favour of joining up with Wales, managed by former Manchester United teammate Mark Hughes and coach Eric Harrison. However, he picked up an ankle injury in the lead-up to the game and missed out on the match-day squad.|$|E
5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E

5|$|Castro {{proclaimed the}} new {{administration}} a direct democracy, in which Cubans could assemble at demonstrations to express their democratic will. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> the need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of socio-economic elites. U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties, {{and the absence of}} freedom of speech and press.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E
5|$|Lezica {{informed}} Cisneros of {{the request}} for an open cabildo and the Viceroy consulted Leiva, who spoke in favor of it. The Viceroy summoned military commanders {{to come to the}} fort at 7pm, to demand military support. There were rumors that it could be a trap to capture them and take control of the barracks. To prevent this, they took command of the grenadiers that guarded the Fort and seized the keys of all entrances while meeting with the Viceroy. Colonel Cornelio Saavedra, head of the Regiment of Patricios, responded on behalf of all the criollo regiments. He compared the current international situation with that prevailing {{at the time of the}} mutiny of Álzaga over a year earlier, pointed out that Spain was now almost entirely under Napoleonic control and that the undefeated Spanish provinces were very small in comparison with the Americas. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> the claim of sovereignty of Cadiz over the Americas, and concluded that the local armies wanted to look after themselves, rather than following the fate of Spain. Finally, he pointed out that the Supreme Central Junta that appointed Cisneros as Viceroy no longer existed, so <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> Cisneros' legitimacy as Viceroy and denied him the protection of the troops under his command.|$|E
5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} be brought to the {{imperial}} capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> as slander.|$|E

5|$|Mulla Sadra (c. 1571/2 – 1640) was an Iranian Shia Islamic philosopher who was {{influenced}} by earlier Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna and Suhrawardi, {{as well as the}} Sufi metaphysician Ibn 'Arabi. Sadra discussed Avicenna's arguments for the existence of God, claiming that they were not a priori. <b>He</b> <b>rejected</b> the argument on the basis that existence precedes essence, or that the existence of human beings is more fundamental than their essence.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon, {{expecting to}} win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations {{on the basis of}} accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however <b>he</b> <b>rejected</b> the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed; they prevailed. Napoleon adamantly refused.|$|E
