5|$|Edgar Murray finds Threni less {{expressive}} {{than the}} Krenek, {{and more like}} the Lamentationes of Thomas Tallis.

5|$|A Nosek family {{representative}} {{said that}} based on the witness testimonies, the family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that Blythe was solely responsible. He continued {{that he would not}} be substantiating the requested amount, as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father's birthday, and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that performance was {{vital to the}} plays, nor did he ever acknowledge {{the presence of an}} audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E

As a result, Cristaldi married Zeudi Araya and had no further contractual relationships with Cardinale.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia Lennon {{personally}} {{believed that}} Mardas invented {{the story about}} sexual impropriety to undermine the Maharishi's influence on the Beatles, as Mardas was always jealous of anyone having Lennon's attention. Harrison and McCartney later offered their apologies to the Maharishi (McCartney said that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> the accusation at all). In 2010, Mardas issued a statement denying that he had spread rumours.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{attempted}} {{to pass the}} Meech Lake Accord, a series of constitutional amendments to persuade Quebec to endorse the Canada Act 1982.

5|$|Laurens Hammond died in 1973, and {{the company}} {{struggled}} to survive, proposing an acquiring of Roland in 1972, which was turned down.

5000|$|St. Augustine had a {{very deep}} sense of the {{difficulty}} of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question [...] "I Am" [...] what? From John 8, 24: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am, you will die in your sins." [...] But Augustine asked, [...] "si non credideritis quia ego sum?" [...] (I Am What?) There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing. [...] "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing." [...] Augustine: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the Christ; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the Son of God; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the Word of the Father; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the author of the world; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am that, you will die in your sins. This I Am, He says He Is, is embarrassing. Even if Moses could understand this, how could the people to whom he was being sent understand it? In point of fact, he did add: 'I Am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Exodus 3, 13-15)(Augustine on the Gospel of St. John) (Gilson, p. 85) ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{followers}} of Tantra were often branded as Nāstika {{by the political}} proponents of the Vedic tradition. The term Nāstika <b>does</b> <b>not</b> denote an atheist since the Veda presents a godless system with no singular almighty being or multiple almighty beings. It is applied {{only to those who}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in the Vedas. The s and s <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in God, but they believe in the Vedas and hence they are not Nāstikas. The Buddhists, Jains, and Cārvākas <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in the Vedas; hence they are Nāstikas. N. N. Bhattacharyya ...|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, many {{residents}} in shanty towns failed to hear tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Some did hear the warnings, but they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> them as the same warning had been issued several weeks before and nothing had happened. In addition, city officials warned the residents living near the dam to take shelter in public buildings though most refused to leave. The government ignored all requests to shore up an earthen dam, as they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> Liza would pose a significant threat of damage to the Baja California Peninsula. Along the Gulf Coast, troops evacuated residents, and radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor. During the afternoon hours of September29, the education department suspended classes as it began to rain.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat {{members who}} had {{supported}} Shachtman were expelled by the emergency conference, {{with the support of}} Trotsky himself. While leader of the SWP James P.

A new International Executive Committee was appointed, which came under the increasing influence of the Socialist Workers Party.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{returned}} to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, {{to take the}} men home.

5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
