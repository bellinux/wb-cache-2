40|$|Unprecedented {{population}} {{aging in}} poorer settings {{is coinciding with}} the rapid spread of obesity and other chronic conditions. These conditions predict disability and poor self-rated health and often are more prevalent in women than men. Thus, gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> obesity and other chronic conditions may account for older women's greater disability and worse self-rated health in poor, rural populations, where aging, obesity, and chronic conditions are rapidly emerging. In a survey of 604 adults 50 years and older in rural Guatemala, we assessed whether gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> obesity and other chronic conditions accounted for gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> disability and self-rated health. Obesity strongly predicted gross mobility (GM) disability, {{and the number of}} chronic conditions strongly predicted all outcomes, especially in women. Controlling for gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> body-mass index (BMI) and especially the number of chronic conditions eliminated gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> GM disability, and controlling for gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> the number of chronic conditions eliminated gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> self-rated health. We recommend conducting longitudinal cohort studies to explore interventions that may mitigate adult obesity and chronic conditions among poor, rural older adults. Such interventions also may reduce gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> later-life disability and self-rated health.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of social norms and attitudes about gender, i. e. culture, for labour market {{behaviour}} and cultural assimilation of immigrants in Sweden. Using source country gender gaps as cultural proxies {{we find that the}} labour force participation of immigrants in Sweden is related to culture, in the sense that immigrants originating from countries with high gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> labour force participation rates (LFPR) also have high gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> LFPR within their immigrant group on the Swedish labour market. On the contrary, high source country gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> earnings are, if anything, associated with lower gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> earnings within immigrant groups in Sweden. In addition, we find that gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> LFPR among immigrants in Sweden assimilate towards the corresponding gap among natives as time in Sweden increases. These results suggest that culture is one explanation for the existence of gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> LFPR and that cultural assimilation takes place as time since exposure to the source country culture increases...|$|R

The method that is used in {{this research}} is descriptive statistics and than diversity trial done by using test t to compore the result which is gotten with gaps or without <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> palm oil plants (Steel and Torrrie, 1993).

40|$|Using {{cross-country}} and panel regressions, {{we investigate}} {{to what extent}} gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> education and employment (proxied using gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> labor force participation) reduce economic growth.

We find that gender <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> education and employment significantly reduce economic growth. The combined ‘costs’ of education and employment <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> Middle East and North Africa and South Asia amount respectively to 0. 9 - 1. 7 and 0. 1 - 1. 6 percentage point differences in growth compared to East Asia.
