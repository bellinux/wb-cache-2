5|$|At the 2007 World Championships, Lysacek {{made his}} first attempt at landing a quadruple jump in the short program. He {{attempted}} a quad-triple, but {{stepped out of the}} quad and put his hand down, and followed it with a double. He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a <b>double</b> <b>loop</b> instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth once again in the long program, placing fifth over all.|$|E
5|$|When {{advisories}} {{first began}} on Olga, forecasters were uncertain {{how long the}} storm would persist, due to the storm's presence within a much larger storm; one hurricane model anticipated an increase in wind shear within 24hours, which would likely cause quick dissipation. However, the NHC accurately forecast the storm to remain a cyclone for several days. Olga initially tracked northeastward, followed by a turn to the west due to a building ridge to its north. On November25, the storm began acquiring more characteristics of a tropical storm, such as detaching from the larger storm and developing more distinct convective rainbands. This was due to decreasing wind shear and continued atmospheric instability, although only marginally warm sea surface temperatures. After turning to the southwest, Olga resumed a northwest motion, and at 1200UTC on November26 intensified into a hurricane. By that time, an eye had developed in the center, and the previously large wind field had contracted. Upon attaining hurricane status, Olga was tracking northwestward due to an approaching trough. The eye steadily became better defined as outflow increased, and on November27 Olga attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h), along with a minimum pressure of 973mbar (28.73inHg). While at peak intensity, the hurricane executed a <b>double</b> <b>loop</b> about 455mi (730km) east of Bermuda, due to interaction with a larger cyclonic circulation that was isolated from the westerlies.|$|E

One year after opening in 1982, the Thunderbolt opened as the world's longest steel <b>double</b> <b>loop</b> roller coaster. A new themed {{area known as}} Gum Tree Gully also opened. In 1983, Blue Lagoon water park opened and Dreamworld introduced Belinda Brown as the park's third mascot. In 1984 the park began seven-day trading {{after two years of}} only being open Thursday through to Tuesday. In 1986, Gold Rush Country (now the Town of Gold Rush) opened featuring Eureka Mountain Mine Ride and Thunder River Rapids Ride. In 1987, Koala Country opened and in 1989 the Skylink Chairlift opened.|$|E

25|$|In the Henry {{system of}} classification, {{there are three}} basic {{fingerprint}} patterns: loop, whorl, and arch, which constitute 60–65%, 30–35%, and 5% of all fingerprints respectively. There are also more complex classification systems that break down patterns even further, into plain arches or tented arches, and into loops that may be radial or ulnar, depending {{on the side of}} the hand toward which the tail points. Ulnar loops start on the pinky-side of the finger, the side closer to the ulna, the lower arm bone. Radial loops start on the thumb-side of the finger, the side closer to the radius. Whorls may also have sub-group classifications including plain whorls, accidental whorls, <b>double</b> <b>loop</b> whorls, peacock's eye, composite, and central pocket loop whorls.|$|E
25|$|Value network {{analysis}} addresses both financial and non-financial value. Every business relationship includes contractual or mandated activities between participants — and also informal exchanges of knowledge, favors, and benefits. The analysis {{begins with a}} visual map or diagram that first shows the essential contractual, tangible revenue- or funding-related business transactions and exchanges that occur between each node of the networks. Nodes represent real people, typically individuals, groups of individuals such as a business unit or aggregates of groups such {{as a type of}} business in an industry network. During analysis when adopting a reflective, <b>double</b> <b>loop</b> or generative learning mode, it is beneficial to regard nodes as role plays (shortened to roles). Practitioners have found {2} that conversation between participants about role plays within a larger whole invariably results in transforming individual behaviour and gaining commitment to implementing needed change as elaborated below.|$|E

2500|$|Double wire, twin loop, or Wire-O binding {{is a type}} of binding that is {{used for}} books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment. The binding {{involves}} the use of a [...] "C" [...] shaped wire spine that is squeezed into a round shape using a wire closing device. Double wire binding allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge. This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" [...] in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the wire binding elements (<b>double</b> <b>loop</b> wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a [...] "closer" [...] which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape. The back page can then be turned back to its correct position, thus hiding the spine of the book.|$|E
