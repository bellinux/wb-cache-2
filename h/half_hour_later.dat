25|$|At about 10 pm on December 22, 1933, Mrs. Huffman {{reported}} smelling {{an unusual}} odor, and {{was overcome by}} a feeling of nausea. The odor and the nausea returned again at about a <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> at which time Huffman contacted the police. A third attack occurred around 1 am, this time affecting the entire house. In total, eight members of the Huffman family were affected by the gas, along with Ashby Henderson, a guest staying at the house. Their symptoms included headaches, nausea, facial swelling, and constriction of the mouth and throat. Alice Huffman, the daughter of Cal Huffman, suffered a more severe reaction to the gas than the other residents. Her throat became so constricted that she stopped breathing {{and had to be}} resuscitated. She also suffered convulsive fits for several weeks after the attack, though local physician S.F. Driver recorded {{at the time that he}} believed this was most likely due to anxiety brought on by the attack, rather than the effects of the gas itself.|$|E
500|$|At 1930UTC on September15, the {{hurricane}} made landfall on Key Largo, {{and about a}} <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later</b> struck the Florida mainland. The center passed very close to Homestead Air Reserve Base about an hour after landfall, where a central barometric pressure of [...] was recorded. The observation suggested a landfall pressure of , and based on its small size and peak winds of 130mph (215km/h); equivalent to a Category 4 on the current Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. This estimate was backed up by gust of 138mph (222km/h) at Carysfort Reef Light. The hurricane weakened over Florida while curving {{to the north and}} north-northeast, although the proximity to water and the passage over the Everglades limited substantial weakening. Hurricane-force winds spread across much of Florida until the storm emerged into the western Atlantic near St. Augustine late on September16. At around 0000UTC the next day, {{the hurricane}} weakened to tropical storm status. About 11hours later, it made another landfall near the border between Georgia and South Carolina with winds of 70mph (120km/h).|$|E

500|$|The Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons {{were spotted}} {{on the morning}} on 27 May 1904 and Tōgō ordered his ships to put to sea. Izumo and Iwate had rejoined the 2nd Division in {{anticipation}} of this battle and Kamimura's ships confirmed the initial spotting later that morning before joining Tōgō's battleships. Together {{with most of the}} Japanese battleships, the division opened fire at 14:10 on the Russian battleship , which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. After a failed torpedo attack was repulsed by Iwate and several other cruisers around the same time, the Russian battleship [...] suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at short range. Kamimura's ships engaged her for five minutes before she disappeared back into the mists. Later in the day, Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers around 17:30. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and encountered the Russian battleline about a <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later.</b> He stayed at long range and his ships fired when practicable before ceasing fire at 19:30.|$|E
2500|$|A State Department report {{stated that}} {{eight to ten}} attackers opened fire [...] "from {{multiple}} nearby locations, with some aggressors dressed in civilian apparel and others in Iraqi police uniforms". The report said that as the convoy tried to leave, its route was blocked by insurgents armed with machine guns at 12:08 p.m. According to another U.S. government report, [...] "The team returned fire to several identified targets" [...] before leaving the area and a second convoy en route to help was [...] "blocked/surrounded by several Iraqi police and Iraqi national guard vehicles and armed personnel".

2500|$|Former Heavy Chain and Desert One veteran 64-0564 {{crashed into}} the ocean shortly after a pre-dawn takeoff from NAS Cubi Point, Philippines, on February 26, 1981, killing 15 {{passengers}} and eight of nine crewmen. The Talon was taking part in Special Warfare Exercise 81 and had flown 12 missions in the preceding 16 days. Following an administrative flight the day before, the crew was scheduled for its last mission, a night exercise that was set back from 01:00 local time to 04:30. The flight profile consisted of a normal takeoff, a tactical landing a <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later</b> to onload 15 Navy SEALs, followed by a tactical takeoff. The Talon reported normal flight conditions six minutes after the tactical takeoff, but crashed nine minutes later. No cause was determined, but investigators found that the likely causes were either crew fatigue from operations tempo, {{or failure of the}} terrain following radar to enter [...] "override" [...] mode while over water.|$|E
