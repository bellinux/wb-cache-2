50|$|Modern light-frame {{structures}} usually gain {{strength from}} rigid panels (plywood and other plywood-like composites such as {{oriented strand board}} (OSB) used to form {{all or part of}} wall sections) but until recently carpenters employed various forms of diagonal bracing to stabilize walls. Diagonal bracing remains a vital interior part of many roof systems, and <b>in-wall</b> wind braces are required by building codes in many municipalities or by individual state laws in the United States.

5000|$|Choke. This {{style of}} switch takes varying {{physical}} forms. The wall control, which contains a motor speed regulator of some sort, determines {{how much power}} is delivered to the fan and therefore how fast it spins. Older such controls employed a choke—a large iron-cored coil—as their regulator; these controls were typically large, boxy, and surface-mounted on the wall. They had anywhere from four to eight speeds, typically four or five. Newer versions {{of this type of}} control do not use a choke as such, but much smaller capacitors or electronic circuitry; the switch is typically mounted in a standard <b>in-wall</b> gang box.|$|E
50|$|The tallest {{building}} in Argentina and Latin America at the time, the 80-meter tower remained a city landmark even after its height was superseded by the nearby Kavanagh building in 1936.

Nearly abandoned, it was acquired in the year 2000 by Paris-based hospitality giant Accor for the purpose of developing Argentina's first Sofitel Hotel.|$|E
5000|$|The wall inlets are {{connected}} to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air return ducts (if permitted by building code). In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a [...] "rough-in" [...] phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other <b>in-wall</b> utilities (e.g. plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.), and just before drywall, paneling, or other surface finishes are installed. Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.|$|E
5000|$|Ken Humphreys and Edward Haase {{developed}} {{a series of}} architectural speakers, speakers that use {{the structure of a}} building as the “cabinet”, at the request of Fleetwood Enterprises of Riverside, California, which wanted to incorporate high-end speakers in its motor homes without taking up much space. Their first experiment with replacing bulky box speakers was a speaker featuring an <b>in-wall</b> mounted woofer, a loudspeaker used to produce low-pitch sounds. They then tested the feasibility of using walls and ceilings as alternatives for speaker cabinets; all experimenting was done with anechoic chambers, microphones, and wall enclosures. Soon Humphreys and Haase reproduced the high quality sound produced by large, space-consuming box speakers in flush-mounted architectural speakers. [...] Much of this early work was done in conjunction with Sonance (Dana Innovations) and both companies are credited with many early developments for architectural speakers.|$|E
5000|$|Under the {{direction}} of Kevin and Scott Frankel, the family-owned company started building all custom homes to LEED standards in 2009. [...] The homes built included green features such as spray foam insulation, tank-less water heaters and dual-speed air conditioning.

[...] The company also {{became one of the}} first homebuilders to adopt the GHBA’s Green Built Gulf Coast (GBGC) program introduced in 2010 that utilized green building practices appropriate for the Texas Gulf Coast. [...] In addition to standardizing green building, Frankel Building Group in 2010 made smart home technology standard in its custom homes. The basic Crestron home automation system included an <b>in-wall</b> docked iPad to control the system and security, providing control of lighting, HVAC, entertainment systems, gates, garage, fountains and pool.|$|E
50|$|On {{this day}} a {{procession}} {{was held in}} the early 19th century from the Santa Maria Church in the Old Part to the San Sebastián Church in the district of Antiguo, while later limited on the grounds of weather conditions to the <b>in-wall</b> area. The event finished with a popular dancing accompanied on the military band's flutes and drums. In addition, every day a soldier parade took place to change the guards at the town's southern walls. Since the San Sebastián Day was the first festival heralding the upcoming Carnival, it's no surprise that some youths in Carnival mood followed them aping their martial manners and drumrolls, using for the purpose the buckets left at the fountains. In the period spanning the 1860s and 1880s the celebrations started to shape as we know them today with proper military style outfits and parades and the tunes fashioned by music composer Raimundo Sarriegui.|$|E
5000|$|Ability {{to handle}} [...] "difficult" [...] debris — Central vacuums, {{especially}} filterless models, can efficiently remove difficult dry substances, such as plaster dust, spilled flour, laser printer toner, metal knockout slugs and wire clippings from electrical work, or even small pieces and slivers of broken glass. This ability {{may depend on}} the ability of the filter bag to resist clogging or breakage; filterless models are capable of removing the widest range of materials. [...] "Wet vacuum interceptor" [...] accessories are available for some systems; these operate by separating liquids from the dirty airstream prior to passage into the <b>in-wall</b> tubing and central unit. These [...] "wet vac" [...] units are subject to the same limitations as [...] "wet-or-dry shop vacuums", and must be washed out and dried after use to prevent unpleasant odors and mold growth. However, toxic materials, such as asbestos should never be cleaned up with anything but specialized equipment made expressly for the purpose.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Dana Innovations (Sonance) sued SpeakerCraft for {{infringement}} {{of patents}} on {{a method of}} retrofitting a wall to mount speakers. The speaker mounting system Sonance claimed to have patented was in fact largely invented by the SpeakerCraft partner Ken Humphreys as is evidenced by his name as an inventor. This invention is composed of a bracket attached by screws through the wall to the speaker support. The speaker is then wedged between the bar and the support surface in {{a hole in the}} wall, resulting in the speaker being flush-mounted to the wall. SpeakerCraft moved for a summary judgment of invalidity. The district court of California held that the patents were invalid because they were anticipated by an <b>in-wall</b> speaker offered by Boston Acoustics Inc. more than a year prior to the application dates of each patent. The U.S. Court of Appeals held that the patents were not anticipated by the Boston Acoustics product and reversed the district court’s decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. The circuit court affirmed the district court’s decision.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{installing}} a pocket door {{rather than a}} hinged door can add an average of ten square feet of floor space, according to building expert Tim Carter, who considers the pocket door [...] "one of the top ten most overlooked items when many architects and builders plan a home". The doors were particularly common in Victorian homes to close off such areas as sitting rooms or dens; however, as architectural tastes changed, many of the hardware manufacturers went out of business. With improvement in the hardware {{and the growth of}} the market for condominiums and town homes, there has been a resurgence of interest in this space-saving feature. Modern residential uses include bathrooms, closets, laundry or utility rooms, or home offices. A wall-hung variation called an [...] "open pocket door" [...] may be used where <b>in-wall</b> installation is impractical; this version is recommended for homes with disabled residents due to greater ease of opening compared to traditional hinged, pull-open doors. One downside to pocket doors is hidden parts and hardware, which can make them difficult to replace or repair when something goes wrong. Fixing the problem might require removing the door and trim and opening up the wall. [...] The 1953-'54 Kaiser Motors Darrin sports car used pocket doors.|$|E
5000|$|SpeakerCraft {{was founded}} in 1976 by Edward Haase, Ken Humphreys and Eugene Humphreys. Beginning as a retail stereo store and {{original}} equipment manufacturer of loudspeakers for companies such as Sonance, Niles Audio, Bang and Olufsen, JBL, Polk Audio, and many others, the company evolved into a designer and installer of custom audio systems. In 1988 Humphreys sold his interest to Jeff King, Sr. Jeff remained with the company until it ultimately sold in 2000 to Burkhardt, Management and Kinsman Capital. Jeff was {{a major force in}} both operations and development as well as defining the companies position for future growth. He was the primary decision maker that included hiring Jeremy Burkhardt in 1991 in the companies 16th year of business. Jeff Francisco managed the custom installation business and retail store where he studied product development and developed custom systems for the company. In 1994, Ed Haase, Jeff King and Jeremy Burkhardt founded The SpeakerCraft Brand of architectural loudspeakers as a line of high-end custom speakers; they were set on making a new brand for the CEDIA marketplace. In 1999 Haase and King offered Burkhardt a partnership. [...] From 1994 to 2000 this team invented and patented products, grew the brand and took market share. As mentioned Burkhardt, Management and Kinsman Capital bought out Haase and King, with the two exiting the company in 2000. Burkhardt remained with the company, serving as Vice President of Sale and Marketing Along with Jim Munn the companies CEO and Bob Cavasos the companies CFO. This team-up led to the fastest growth in company history, Kinsman's access to capital vaulted SpeakerCraft to the number one position in the industry. Management and Kinsman sold SpeakerCraft again in 2004 to Nortek,Inc, for 58 million dollars, and Burkhardt, like all minority shareholders benefited proportionately from this sale. Munn and Cavasos stepped out and Burkhardt remained as a 32-year-old CEO with a vision for growth, seeing the iPod as forever the defining grounds for SpeakerCraft's future in distributing audio through the home. [...] Selected by CE PRO magazine as a top ten industry leader, Burkhardt again leveraged his ownership and became an owner in Nortek, Inc and was promoted to company CEO. The company currently produces more than 1000 products, which include loudspeakers, amplifiers, iPod multi-room music distribution systems, and accessories that allow for various system configurations and sizes. SpeakerCraft's patented AIM series of speakers is available in ceiling and wall versions; these were patented by Haase, Francisco and Burkhardt are the largest advancements in architectural speakers. In 2007 Haase returned to SpeakerCraft as Chief technical Officer. Developing some of the finest SpeakerCraft inventions, Haase is known as the man that invented the <b>in-wall</b> speaker.|$|E
30|$|The Long Gallery {{where the}} library of Blickling Hall is kept {{is one of the}} {{highlights}} of the entire property. This study therefore included the <b>in-wall</b> monitoring of the Long Gallery. The results show that the gallery <b>in-wall</b> temperatures fluctuate between 5.5 and 25  °C with an average of 14.4  °C, while the relative humidity values vary between 66.5 and 77 % with an average of 72 %. The fact that the <b>in-wall</b> relative humidity values are all lower than 77 % is quite positive from a biodeterioration point of view and an indication that the building fabric is coping well with the local climate. The rarity of wind incidents with speeds higher than 2  m/s are considered to contribute to the relatively low <b>in-wall</b> relative humidity values (discussed more in depth in “In-wall moisture enrichment due to rain penetration” section). When the daily maximum variations are examined, one sees that the maximum daily difference in the relative humidity values is in the range of 12 %, whilst this is negligible for temperature values. The likely implications of these high relative humidity values combined with temperatures at the high end is further discussed in “Mould formation and other moisture induced bio-deterioration” section. Also, it is noteworthy that even when the outdoor temperature values fall below the freezing point, the <b>in-wall</b> temperatures stay above 0  °C. In fact, the minimum <b>in-wall</b> temperature is 5.5  °C. Therefore, cyclic freeze and thaw is not a relevant phenomenon for this part of the estate.|$|E
30|$|We {{also see}} that {{the inner and outer}} wall surface {{temperature}} peaks and troughs happen at the same time, suggesting low thermal inertia once again. The <b>in-wall</b> temperature values on the other hand are rather constant. We also {{see that the}} peaks in the <b>in-wall</b> RH values correspond to peaks in the outer surface temperatures, pointing out presence of free water within the building fabric.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} in “Impact of temperature and relative humidity variations” section, the gallery <b>in-wall</b> relative humidity values are always below 77 %, which, {{compared to the}} <b>in-wall</b> RH values measured in the unheated turret attached to the North East corner of the Long Gallery, are quite low. On this particular wall, we do not observe a similar moisture enrichment phenomenon, even under heavy rain incidents that satisfies the half-day with more than 4  mm of horizontal rainfall criterion. This {{is considered to be}} {{due to the fact that}} the wall is not facing the prevalent wind direction and is not exposed to wind speeds higher than 2  m/s.|$|E
30|$|Separately, {{a set of}} {{standalone}} {{temperature and}} relative humidity sensors (EL-USB- 2) were placed in various places across the building (in the basement for <b>in-wall</b> indoor values, in the gallery for <b>in-wall</b> values and underneath a moat in the garden for outdoor values) to monitor the temperature and relative humidity (measurement ranges: 0 – 100 % RH±, − 35 to + 80  °C T ±  0.5  °C), again on a half-hourly basis. These standalone sensors were chosen from the thinnest products available commercially (around 2  cm thickness) to ensure limited impact on historic fabric, and disruption to mortar joints. Existing cracks or other defects on the walls were exploited for their placement {{in order to minimize}} intervention. In addition, the National Trust’s outdoor and gallery indoors monitoring data were used in this paper.|$|E
