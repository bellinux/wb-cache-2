5|$|Until 1992, Górecki {{was known}} only to connoisseurs, {{primarily}} as one of several composers from the Polish School responsible for the postwar Polish music renaissance. That year, Elektra-Nonesuch released a recording of the 14-year-old symphony that topped the classical charts in Britain and the United States. To date, it {{has sold more than}} a million copies, vastly exceeding the <b>expected</b> <b>lifetime</b> sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th-century composer. This success, however, has not generated similar interest in Górecki's other works.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder {{with a new}} Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original <b>expected</b> <b>lifetime</b> of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E
5|$|Vega is {{only about}} {{a tenth of the}} age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its <b>expected</b> <b>lifetime</b> is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present {{approaching}} the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.|$|E

A (small) difference in <b>expected</b> <b>lifetimes</b> may induce entirely different implications for the behavior of st cost minimizing consumer, {{as compared to the}} case with equal <b>expected</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> The result supplements the explanations for the extremely high discount rates that have been reported for energy efficiency investments. We also provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a reservation property, both in the case of deterministic and of random lifetimes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V.

5000|$|A conference {{paper by}} Oguchi et al. sought to {{identify}} and test differences in definitions of product lifetime expectations. Oguchi et al. illustrated that previous research into <b>expected</b> product <b>lifetimes</b> has been inconsistent in its {{use of the term}} <b>expected</b> product <b>lifetimes.</b> For example, Cooper enquires about [...] "reasonable" [...] <b>expected</b> <b>lifetimes,</b> while Brook Lyndhurst [...] discusses [...] "normal" [...] <b>expected</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> Wieser et al. identified the tension between everyday expectations and desires, distinguishing between these expectations in his study of 21 products. In addition, earlier work by Tasaki et al. and more recent work by WRAP have asked users to report both how long they have owned an item for, and how long they expect to use the item for in future: WRAP term this [...] "active use". Building on these previous studies (described above), Oguchi et al. identified and tested three distinct definitions of <b>expected</b> product <b>lifetimes,</b> these are outlined below.|$|R

25|$|From an {{electrical}} {{point of view}} the electrolyte in an electrolytic capacitor is the actual cathode of the capacitor and must have good electrical conductivity, which is actually ion-conductivity in liquids. But {{it is also a}} chemical mixture of solvents with acid or alkali additives, which must be non-corrosive (chemically inert) so that the capacitor, whose inner components are made of aluminum, remains stable over its <b>expected</b> <b>lifetime.</b> In addition to the good conductivity of operating electrolytes, there are other requirements, including chemical stability, chemical compatibility with aluminum, and low cost. The electrolyte should also provide oxygen for the forming processes and self-healing. This diversity of requirements for the liquid electrolyte results in a broad variety of proprietary solutions, with thousands of patented electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|Oil sands {{operations}} {{differ from}} conventional oil {{in that the}} initial profitability is somewhat lower, but the geological and political risks are low, the reserves are vast, and the <b>expected</b> <b>lifetime</b> of production extends for generations rather than just a few years.

From the standpoint of federal-provincial revenues, they also differ in that the federal government will receive larger higher share and higher return on its incentives than it would from conventional oil, while the provincial share, although substantial, will be proportionally smaller. Consequently, there has tended to be much less intergovernmental conflict and more agreement on how these projects should be handled.|$|E

The couple maximizes expected utility over their joint lifetime by dynamically adjusting their asset allocation and purchasing term-life insurance. We conduct three numerical analyses: In the base case, we find optimal policies assuming the <b>expected</b> <b>lifetimes</b> are correct. The other two examples introduce longevity risk through either a shift in the <b>expected</b> <b>lifetimes</b> or an unexpected cut in retirement income.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} potential changes in the length of product life cycles in the US seed corn industry. We use the observed survival time on the market for hybrids sold during 1997 - 2009 to conduct a survival analysis. Our empirical results show that the <b>expected</b> <b>lifetimes</b> for corn hybrids with single biotech traits are 5 - 15 % longer than for hybrids with multiple (stacked) traits, and the <b>expected</b> <b>lifetimes</b> for conventional corn are 13 - 17 % longer than stacked hybrids. Also, the product life cycles for all types of hybrids have decreased over the past twelve years (especially after 2004), but the rate of decline is roughly similar across hybrid types. Based on this evidence, we conclude that the shorter product life cycles are closely linked to the accelerated levels of biotech product innovation in the US seed corn industry over the period of analysis. accelerated failure time, biotechnology, product life cycle, survival analysis, Productivity Analysis, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R
