40|$|It is {{well known}} from {{differential}} geometry that ann-dimensional Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space of dimension 2 n+ 1 [Nas 54]. Though the proof by Nash is intuitive, {{it is not clear}} whether such a construction is achievable by an algorithm that only has access to a finite-size sample from the manifold. In this paper, we study Nash’s construction and develop two algorithms for embedding a fairly general class of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds (initially residing in R D) into R k (where k only depends on some key manifold properties, such as its intrinsic dimension, its volume, and its curvature) that approximately preserves geodesic distances between all pairs of points. The first algorithm we propose is computationally fast and embeds the given manifold approximately isometrically into about O(2 cn) dimensions (where c is an absolute constant). The second algorithm, although computationally more involved, attempts to minimize the dimension of the target space and (approximately isometrically) embeds the manifold <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>O(n)</b> dimensions. ...|$|E
40|$|FDA - the Factorized Distribution Algorithm - is an {{evolutionary}} algorithm that combines mutation and recombination {{by using a}} distribution. First the distribution is estimated from a set of selected points. It is then used to generate new points for the next generation. In general a distribution defined for n binary variables has 2 n parameters. Therefore it is too expensive to compute. For additively decomposed discrete functions (ADFs) there exists an algorithm that factors the distribution into conditional and marginal distributions, each {{of which can be}} computed in polynomial time. The scaling of FDA is investigated theoretically and numerically. The scaling depends on the ADF structure and the specific assignment of function values. Difficult functions on a chain or a tree structure are optimized <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>O(n</b> p n) function evaluations. More standard genetic algorithms are not able to optimize these functions. FDA is not restricted to exact factorizations. It also works for approximate factorizations.

This type of research is qualitative descriptive. The subjects were students of class VE FKIP UMS Math. The technique of collecting data through observation, in-depth interviews, documentation and questionnaires. The data validity use methodology triangulasm which integrate documentation, observation, and interview. The data analysis technique used is the model analysis Miles and Huberman.
