The solvent was dimethyl sulfoxide (DMS), emulsified and micro-dispersed with amphoteric surfactant. The fabric was washed using non-ionic surfactants, alcohol ethoxylate (AE- 7) with 7 m. E.

A sequestering agent, DTPMP, was used to improve the results for detergency. The tensile strength and burst strength of the wool fabric washed with those surfactants and the microdispersed DMS with repeated washes was assessed. With those non-ionic surfactants used in the same programmed washing tests, the redeposition of a solid impurity, namely carbon black, during the washing was also studied, and a notable decrease of redeposition was attained with addition of the microemulsified DMS, which was also observed with the additional use of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (LAS).

40|$|In this work, <b>detersive</b> power (soil removal) was studied after washing a soiled wool fabric with {{addition}} of a non-toxic solvent microemulsion to conventional washing detergent formulations {{with the aim of}} improving the performance of the conventional washing. The non-toxic solvent used was dimethyl sulfoxide micro-dispersed with an amphoteric surfactant as emulsifier. The fabric was washed with biodegradable non-ionic surfactants such as an alcohol ethoxylate (AE) with 7 mE. O. and an alkyl polyglucoside with 1. 4 glucoside groups (APG). The fabric used was EMPA 107 wool (soiled with standard impurities). The non-ionic surfactants were used separately and in mixture in varying proportions for the washes. Given the large amount of impurities in the wool fabric, sodium carbonate and sodium chloride were used to attain a suitable pH to avoid damaging the wool. The fabric was washed at low temperature with water of different hardness (20 º hf, 30 º hf and 40 º hf).

40|$|SummaryIntroductionHip {{arthroplasty}} {{needs to}} be performed in an emergency setting after intracapsular femur neck fracture, whereas pain makes preoperative skin preparation of the limb difficult and it may therefore be incomplete. To date no study has analyzed the patient's skin bacteriological status in these surgical conditions. HypothesisThe skin's bacterial flora is quantitatively and qualitatively different in the trauma context compared to an elective scheduled arthroplasty for chronic hip disease. Materials and methodsTwo groups of patients, undergoing hip arthroplasty and having the same preparation {{at the time of}} surgery but different skin preparation procedures the day before and the day of surgery, were prospectively compared: 30  patients operated on in an emergency setting for fracture (group A) had no skin preparation and 32  patients operated on in scheduled surgery (group B). Group A had no skin disinfection before going into surgery, whereas group B followed a predefined protocol the day before surgery. Skin samples were taken on gelose at three different stages of skin preparation at the time of surgery (before and after <b>detersive</b> cleaning, {{and at the end of}} the surgery) and on two sites (inguinal and greater trochanter). The bacteriological analysis took place after 48 hours of incubation. ResultsBefore <b>detersive</b> cleaning, group A had 3. 6 times more bacteria than group B in the trochanter region and 2. 7 times more in the inguinal area. After <b>detersive</b> cleaning, the contamination rate in the trochanter area was similar in both groups (group A: 10 %; group B: 12. 5 %), but different in the inguinal region (group A: 33 %; group B: 3 %; P= 0. 002). At the end of the surgery, no difference was identified. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Bacillus cereus accounted for 44 % and 37 %, respectively, of the bacteria isolated. In addition, the frequency of pathogenic non-saprotrophic bacteria was higher in group A (38 %) compared to group B (6 %). At a mean follow-up of 9. 7 months (range: 8 – 11 months), no infection of the surgical site was identified. ConclusionThe dermal flora is more abundant and different when the patient is managed in an emergency context. Although effective in the trochanter area, cutaneous <b>detersive</b> cleaning in the operating room is insufficient in the inguinal area and the frequency of pathogenic bacteria warrants identical rigor in preoperative preparation in all situations.

In all these circumstances, the muscular or omental flaps which are transferred into the chest are selected according to the recipient field and to their respective access to the upper, middle and lower portions of the pleural space or mediastinum. Twelve different flaps so appear available to achieve the adequate reconstruction, filling or coverage of nine distinct topographic sites.

40|$|Sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI) {{has been}} a {{predominant}} ingredient in syndet bar formulation for more than thirty years. Although cost effective and well recognized for good skin compatibility, SCI is not regularly found in liquid detergent systems due to its limited solubility in water. This study focuses on the under-standing of enthalpy of solubilization, equilibrium of solubilization, and the structures and properties of sodium cocoyl isethionate and various surfactants. The purpose of this exercise {{is to help the}} formulator to find appropriate surfactant systems to keep sodium cocoyl isethionate in aqueous olution. The solubility of SCI in water is unfavorable in terms of enthalpy of solvation. When setting up equilibrium of solubilization, there are three possible phases, and three methods have been developed to prevent SCI from recrystallizing in aqueous olutions. The first focuses on tying CI ions within micelies made of secondary surfactants. The second focuses on the exchange of sodium ions with ammonium ions (and/or triethanola-monium). The third centers on emulsification of SCI and the subsequent change of micelies into emulsified oil drops. A combination of two or three of these methods will enable the formulator to use SCI as the primary surfactant in liquid <b>detersive</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this work}} is to attain {{improvement}} of the softness of cotton fabric during the washing process with ecological surfactants. To attain that improvement, sodium bentonite microparticules {{was added to the}} detergent formulations to produce a softening effect during washing and obtain the so called “soft detergent” effect. Sodium bentonite (a mineral composed mainly of hydrated aluminium silicates) was mixed with the surfactants used in ecological detergents. Two types of particle size of these microparticles with ammoniumsilicone softener treatment for improving this effect on their behaviour were used. The surfactants used were an anionic surfactant, namely LAS, and two non-ionic surfactants, namely APG and AE, used separately and as mixtures, without builders, to demonstrate their <b>detersive</b> power in one wash and repeated washes, depending {{on the nature of the}} surfactants and on their separate mixtures and mixtures in different proportions of anionic and non-ionic surfactants in combination in all cases with a constant concentration of sodium bentonite with two particle sizes. Evaluation was performed of the subjective softness (by handle) of pairs of samples by several observers and also of changes in whiteness after deposition of the bentonite during washing, which was checked with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the fibres of the cotton fabric.

40|$|Spring, W. Recueil des Travaux Chimiques des Pays-Bas et de la Belgique (1909), 28, 120 - 35; SciFinder (Chemical Abstracts Service: Columbus, OH); [URL] (accessed July 8, 2010). The {{action of}} soap is {{explained}} by the following facts: (1) Carbon hastens the decomp. of soap in water by causing {{the formation of an}} acid salt. This combination of C with the soap is not stoichiometric but a combination such as exists between colloidal substances. The combination of the C with the soap is formed because of the difference of the electrical polarity of its constituents from water. (2) C suspended in water forms a combination of absorption more or less stable with the solid substances, especially cellulose. This, the author says, is proved by the fact that a suspension of finely divided C in water will give up its C to filter paper when filtered, and if the paper is then inverted the C cannot be washed off by means of water. There exists a combination of colloidal C and paper. (3) A suspension of C in soap solution is characterized by its stability. When filtered all of the C passes through the filter paper. In his experiments the author employed a 2 % soap solution and C from which all oily matter had been removed so that there was no chance for emulsions. It was found that there was an optimum % of concentration for which the C remained in suspension. In a 2 % sol. the C deposited almost as rapidly as in pure water, but in solutions of less than 0. 5 % the deposition was slower. In a 1 % sol. the C remained in suspension about 2 months. All of the soap solutions which had retained C in suspension nevertheless had a sediment. Acid and alkaline solutions of soap were tried with regard to their power of holding C in suspension. The acid solutions became clear rapidly while the alkaline held the C better than pure water does. MeOH and EtOH solutions of soap were also tried. The deposition of C from these took place more rapidly than in the case of water. Soap solutions which deposited C were examined to see whether any soap was dragged down with the C. It was found each time that the % of ash of the sol. which had been agitated with C and then filtered, was greater than the corresponding % of ash of the sol. not so treated, which was run as a comparison. The author concludes that the soap sol. was slightly decomposed by contact with the C into an acid portion which agglutinated with C and into a basic portion which remained in solution. The MeOH and EtOH sols. of soap when examined {{in the same manner as}} above showed less ash. This would mean that the solution underwent no change and that there was no agglutination with the C. This also explains why alc. solutions of soap give inferior <b>detersive</b> effects. The sediment of C deposited from soap solution is different in character from that deposited from pure water. It is oleaginous and viscous. A suspension of C in water was subjected to electrolysis. With a difference of potential of 8 volts cataphoresis is doubtful, but when the sol. is made slightly alkaline the C acts as if charged electropositive and is deposited around the cathode. A 0. 2 % soap solution when electrolyzed gave a white deposit around the anode after several hours. This, when separated from the solution and the ash determined and compared with that of the filtrate, indicates that the deposit at the anode is an acid soap while the soap left in the solution is basic. The author is carrying on experiments to show the action of silicic acid, iron oxide, Al 2 O 3, etc., in soap solutions. Also in Arch. sci. phys. nat. g. acte. en., 27, 229.
