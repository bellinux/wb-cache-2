5|$|Individual {{resistance}} to power can take two <b>diametrically</b> opposed forms: those which indulge {{the impulse to}} power, and {{those who seek to}} quell the impulse to power entirely.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} model for an {{active galactic nucleus}} is based upon an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core region of the galaxy. The radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from the gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the disc. In about 10% of these galaxies, a <b>diametrically</b> opposed pair of energetic jets ejects particles from the galaxy core at velocities close to the speed of light. The mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Per , {{state and}} union governments, as duty, shall make further {{detailed}} policies and laws for implementation considering DPSPs as fundamental policy. In contrary to Article 37, many {{policies have been}} implemented by state and union governments which go against the DPSPs such as using intoxicating drinks as source of major tax revenue instead of implementing prohibition for better health of people, separation of judiciary from executive, uniform civil code for the citizen, etc. When the union government feels that a DPSP is no longer useful to the nation, it shall be deleted from Constitution by bringing {{a constitutional amendment to}} remove ambiguity in policy making / direction. Judiciary can repeal any policy/law devised by the government which is <b>diametrically</b> opposite to any DPSP.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two <b>diametrically</b> opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was <b>diametrically</b> opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E
5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to pitch a movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, the impetus for the movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters shifted their model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's ending to show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the message of the film was <b>diametrically</b> opposed to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, twisting and reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} {{special classes}} of infinite abelian groups with <b>diametrically</b> opposite properties are torsion groups and torsion-free groups, {{exemplified by the}} groups Q/Z (periodic) and Q (torsion-free).|$|E
25|$|Economic {{sociologist}} Karl Polanyi made a case <b>diametrically</b> {{opposed to}} Hayek, arguing that unfettered markets had undermined {{the social order}} and that economic breakdown had {{paved the way for}} the emergence of dictatorship.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, hierarchical protection domains, {{often called}} protection rings, are mechanisms to protect data and functionality from faults (by improving fault tolerance) and malicious behaviour (by providing computer security). This approach is <b>diametrically</b> opposite {{to that of}} capability-based security.|$|E
25|$|Led by Mark Noll, {{a body of}} {{scholarship}} has highlighted {{the fact that the}} American debate over slavery became a shooting war in part because the two sides reached <b>diametrically</b> opposite conclusions based on reading the same authoritative source of guidance on moral questions: the King James Version of the Bible.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these <b>diametrically</b> different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: Mørketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).|$|E
25|$|International {{negotiations}} {{began in}} 2006 {{to determine the}} final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained <b>diametrically</b> opposed {{on the question of}} status itself.|$|E
25|$|Others {{involved}} in this Generals' Protest (which only became known {{to the general public}} many years later) were then Major General Ariel Sharon and Major General Israel Tal. Sharon later became Defence Minister and Prime Minister and held positions then <b>diametrically</b> opposite Peled's. Tal, who later also became a dove, but a less radical one, never entered active politics.|$|E
25|$|Raj Bisaria {{started his}} venture in English {{language}} with Shakespeare’s Othello in 1966, Christopher Fry's poetic play A Phoenix too Frequent and Eugène Ionesco’s absurd play The Lesson in 1967. The selection {{of these two}} plays; <b>diametrically</b> opposite in their form and content, in a single show was an experiment by Raj Bisaria. It was a box office failure.|$|E
25|$|Doyle {{believed}} that {{many cases of}} diagnosed mental illness {{were the result of}} spirit possession. He debated with the psychiatrist Harold Dearden on the subject who was <b>diametrically</b> opposed to Doyle's views. He travelled to Australia and New Zealand on Spiritualist missionary work in 1920, and continued his mission {{all the way up to}} his death, speaking about his Spiritualist conviction in Britain, Europe and the USA.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{hopes for}} a unified, {{independent}} Korea quickly evaporated as {{the politics of the}} Cold War and opposition to the trusteeship plan from anti-communists resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate nations with <b>diametrically</b> opposed political, economic, and social systems. On December 12, 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations recognised the Republic of Korea as the sole legal government of Korea.|$|E
25|$|President {{and co-founder}} of Oop!. Primarily business-minded, {{he has been a}} millionaire three times over with various (eventually failed) projects. He devotes his time to seeking venture capital for the startup company. Ethan's {{personality}} is <b>diametrically</b> opposed to the other characters, in part because of his relative lack of technical knowledge. He suffers from bad dandruff and his skin is pocked by scars from procedures to remove cancerous growths.|$|E
25|$|Expectations are not {{legitimate}} {{when they}} require a public {{authority to act}} in breach of its statutory duty. This applies only when the statutory provisions <b>diametrically</b> conflict with the representation. In other words, the statutory provision will render the courts' fulfilment of the expectation impossible. However, a statutory provision which merely permits, but does not compel the public authority to breach the expectation will not necessarily justify any such breach.|$|E
25|$|Thinkers such as John Fiske {{have looked}} at how audiences use popular media to get their own {{enjoyment}} from them, claiming, in a <b>diametrically</b> opposed fashion to much other media theory, that popular media, and thus the popular culture they are both part of and help create, can actually be progressive as audiences struggle to use these media for their own individual purposes, and the media then shift to accommodate these purposes.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the black}} box is a perfect White Cube. The {{building}} is clearly structured with maximum space devoted to art. The visible exterior of the building corresponds almost exactly to the public exhibition spaces. There are six exhibition rooms arranged around two <b>diametrically</b> opposed staircases. The ground plan, reminiscent of a windmill’s sails, enables diagonal views through the whole building. These exhibition rooms offer art the largest possible freedom through their clarity and precision.|$|E
25|$|A {{strongly}} opposed view has emerged after the war, especially within India, {{based on the}} motivations of the troops who formed the INA, where a predominant view was held, and still holds, of the INA as patriots and revolutionaries. Outside India it is not widely known, and the accounts and views on the INA, especially among the Allied servicemen who served in Burma, are <b>diametrically</b> opposite. However, almost no account of the Indian independence movement ignores the INA.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} sex {{includes}} two fundamental phenomena: the sexual process (fusion of genetic information of two individuals) and sexual differentiation (separation {{of this information}} into two parts). Depending on {{the presence or absence}} of these phenomena, the existing ways of reproduction can be divided into asexual, hermaphrodite and dioecious forms. The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are <b>diametrically</b> opposed. The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it by half.|$|E
25|$|The mission came in {{the wake}} of the Krulak–Mendenhall mission in which United States Marine Corps General Victor Krulak and State Department {{official}} Joseph Mendenhall gave <b>diametrically</b> differing outlooks on the military and political situation in Vietnam. Upon their return, McNamara and Taylor recommended measures intended to restrict the regime of President Ngô Đình Diệm, feeling that Diệm was pre-occupied with suppressing dissent rather than fighting the communists. The measures also sought to pressure Diệm to respect human rights more.|$|E
25|$|William Shakespeare {{wrote his}} play Hamlet {{sometime}} between 1599 and 1602. The Ur-Hamlet {{is thought to}} be his primary source; his version owes but the outline of the story to Saxo. In character, Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet is <b>diametrically</b> opposed to his prototype. Amleth's madness was certainly altogether feigned; he prepared his vengeance a year beforehand, and carried it out deliberately and ruthlessly at every point. His riddling speech has little more than an outward similarity to the words of Hamlet, who resembles him, however, in his disconcerting penetration into his enemies' plans.|$|E
25|$|As {{recorded}} in 1984, 90% of the PCR members were ethnic Romanians, with 7% Hungarians (the latter group's membership had dropped {{by more than}} 2% since the previous Congress). Formal criticism of the new policies regarding minorities had also been voiced by Hungarian activists, including Károly Király, leader of the PCR in Covasna County. After 1980, the nationalist ideology adopted by the PCR progressively targeted the Hungarian community as a whole, based on suspicions of its allegiance to Hungary, whose policies had become <b>diametrically</b> opposed to the methods of Romanian leaders (see Goulash Communism).|$|E
25|$|Geographical and {{cultural}} breadth. Given that the Muslim world encompasses states {{as diverse as}} Albania, Mali and Kazakhstan, diverse interpretations of texts such as the Qur'an are inevitable, although there are also large areas of concordance between the orthodox schools of Islamic thought, both Sunni and Shi'a. The prevalence of cultural customs which are sometimes ascribed to Islam but which have at best a tenuous scriptural basis (and that in fact may be <b>diametrically</b> opposed to {{the teachings of the}} religion) is another element which needs to be recognised.|$|E
25|$|On a {{complete}} curved surface any two points can {{be joined by}} a geodesic. This is a special case of the Hopf-Rinow theorem, which also applies in higher dimensions. The completeness assumption is automatically fulfilled for a surface which is embedded as a closed subset of Euclidean space. However, it is no longer fulfilled if, for example, we remove an isolated point from a surface. For example, the complement of the origin in the Euclidean plane {{is an example of a}} non-complete surface; in this example two points which are <b>diametrically</b> opposite across the origin cannot {{be joined by a}} geodesic without leaving the punctured plane).|$|E
25|$|Elsner {{had been}} born in Silesia and his first {{language}} was German, leading his critics to deny that he was truly Polish and to accuse him of sympathizing with the foreign invaders. The composer had praised some of the partitioning rulers, including Tsar Alexander I of Russia. After the November Uprising of 1830 he adopted a <b>diametrically</b> opposite opinion. For years he defended the Polish language as beautiful and fit for singing. He was an ardent proponent of Polish opera (by his time there were 300 works in the language in existence), particularly in the first ever account of the national tradition - Die Oper der Polen - published in 1812.|$|E
25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a <b>diametrically</b> opposed manner.|$|E
25|$|Deftly {{traversing}} {{between the}} diverse mediums like painting, video, installation and photography, Rashid Rana {{has emerged as}} one of the leading artist of his generation, making his presence felt globally. His work deals with everyday issues encompassing a wide range of themes from urbanization and popular culture to faith and tradition. He often employs video installations and still photography. A case in point is his series of composite photomontages in which each main image is constructed out of countless smaller photos of <b>diametrically</b> opposite subjects. The viewer confronts a moment of sudden withdrawal after moving closer to the picture when one becomes aware of the several tiny images that constitute the larger one.|$|E
25|$|In March 1949, Holloway was {{the junior}} {{member of the}} Stearns-Eisenhower Board, convened to {{consider}} the topic of educational unification among the services. Chaired by University of Colorado president Robert Stearns, the board was initially inclined to recommend that officer candidates from all services study the same core academic curriculum at a single unified academy, as favored by the new Secretary of Defense, Louis Johnson, with Annapolis and West Point being reduced to specialized training campuses. To everyone's surprise, Holloway persuaded the other members to adopt the <b>diametrically</b> opposite recommendation that the existing service academy system be not only preserved but expanded by adding a new service academy for the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|In the double-slit experiment, as {{originally}} performed by Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel in 1827, {{a beam of}} light is directed through two narrow, closely spaced slits, producing an interference pattern of light and dark bands on a screen. If one of the slits is covered up, one might naively expect that the intensity of the fringes due to interference would be halved everywhere. In fact, a much simpler pattern is seen, a simple diffraction pattern. Closing one slit results in a much simpler pattern <b>diametrically</b> opposite the open slit. Exactly the same behavior can be demonstrated in water waves, and so the double-slit experiment was seen as a demonstration of the wave nature of light.|$|E
25|$|According to Talbot and Eaton, a revisionist {{interpretation}} of Prataparudra II himself appeared much sooner, {{within a few}} years of his death, and for broadly similar reasons. A stone inscription dated 1330 mentions a Prolaya Nayaka, who was said to have restored order, as in Prataparudra days. He presented himself as a legitimate successor to Prataparudra, by portraying both of them as righteous monarchs, meanwhile reconstructing Prataparudra's life and career in a favorable way. By 1420, Muslim rulers had become accommodated to the Deccan society, and strong dichotomies between Hindus and Muslims were no longer useful. Muslim rulers were no longer conceived as <b>diametrically</b> opposed to the figure of Prataparudra, but rather as rulers of equal status.|$|E
25|$|Everton F.C. {{were founded}} in 1878 and from 1884 played their home matches at Anfield, which {{was owned by}} club {{chairman}} John Houlding. Several board members of Everton {{were members of the}} Liberal Party who were associated with the National Temperance Federation whilst Houlding was a Conservative Party member and a brewer whose business interests were <b>diametrically</b> opposed to the temperance movement. Politics and disputes over money meant that Houlding was increasingly at odds {{with other members of the}} Everton board. The result was that in 1892 the Everton directors vacated Anfield and purchased a new ground at Goodison Park on the other side of Stanley Park. Houlding responded by founding a new club to use Anfield: Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|The balance {{consisted}} of a circular steel balance wheel with two bimetallic strips attached <b>diametrically.</b> Each bimetallic strip terminated with a screw thread mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to {{the form of the}} balance spring—a coil of smaller radius {{at each end of the}} helical spring, which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the Overcoil balance spring is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.|$|E
25|$|In the novel, {{the story}} of Max Havelaar, a Dutch colonial administrator, is told by two <b>diametrically</b> opposed characters: the hypocritical coffee {{merchant}} Droogstoppel, who intends to use Havelaar's manuscripts {{to write about the}} coffee trade, and the romantic German apprentice Stern, who takes over when Droogstoppel loses interest in the story. The opening chapter of the book nicely sets the tone of the satirical nature of what is to follow, with Droogstoppel articulating his pompous and mercenary world-view at length. At {{the very end of the}} novel Multatuli himself takes the pen and the book culminates in a vocal denunciation of Dutch colonial policies and a plea to the king of the Netherlands to intervene on behalf of his Indonesian subjects.|$|E
