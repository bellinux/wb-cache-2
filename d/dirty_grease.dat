In printing, {{it consists}} of applying bronze blue to the apprentice's penis and testicles, a color made by mixing black printers ink and dark blue printers ink, which {{takes a long time}} to wash off. Similarly, mechanics get their groins smeared with old <b>dirty</b> <b>grease.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... {{invented the}} Grease Guard Bearing System that allows bicyclists to {{completely}} replace with clean grease in seconds the <b>dirty</b> <b>grease</b> that always gets into bicycle bearings...thus extending component life and saving significant {{time and money}} spent overhauling and/or replacing parts. Grease Guard's effect on component longevity conflicted with the bike industry's needs. The industry requires that bike parts wear out, thus necessitating replacement.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1920s, the ever-growing {{dissemination}} of sealed bearings throughout the manufacturing industries {{has made the}} use of grease fittings less common. Sealed bearings are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or <b>dirtied.</b> <b>Grease</b> fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and practical investigation was performed by the EPECentre into the causes of previously unexplained excessive corona on ElectraNet's new 275 kV line at Bungama, South Australia. The corona audible noise occasionally exceeds Australian Environment Protection (Industrial noise) Policy maximum acceptable levels. Surface voltage gradients and corona inception voltages were calculated for the conductor spacing and arrangement. Three pieces of conductor, being used Bungama conductor, new Bungama conductor and new conductor from another manufacturer, were high voltage tested under a range of conditions in the HV laboratory at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Canterbury. Corona discharge magnitudes and counts were recorded for original, cleaned and washed conductor situations. Rain was also simulated. A further test involving polished spheres was performed to determine the surface effect of both clean and <b>dirty</b> conductor <b>grease</b> on the electrical breakdown of air. A site visit to Bungama provided further evidence for {{the causes of the}} excessive corona. The investigation revealed that a combination of <b>dirty</b> surface <b>grease</b> and high surface voltage gradients generates the high levels of corona. Several recommendations to prevent such a situation in the future are provided...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{use of the}} lasers Q-switched Nd:YAG {{to remove}} the dust of the stone monuments {{especially}} sculpture gradually replaces the more abrasive technique of sandblasting. This tendency made us consider the lasers as solution for the cleaning of ceramics and the plasters. Indeed in museums, these materials are often covered with <b>dirty</b> mark (dust, <b>grease,</b> etc.) which is difficult to remove without damaging the object. This paper deals {{with the impact of}} different types of lasers (Nd:YAG first and third harmonic) irradiation on plaster and with the effects on its morphology and its crystallography. Plaster is an interesting material because of its typical acicular crystals altered at low temperature. That is why synthesis samples were prepared, constrained in temperature then analysed by various processes (SEM, XRD, TGA...). These results were compared with samples cleaned by laser. That enabled us to conclude that plasters cleaned by UV-laser (third harmonic of the Nd:YAG) underwent neither yellowing, nor morphological or crystallographic changes. It has to be opposed to the intense yellowing, and sometimes morphological destruction, which appears with an infrared wavelength (first harmonic of the Nd:YAG) ...|$|R
