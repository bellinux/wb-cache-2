40|$|Abstract. The {{authors have}} {{established}} that oribatid mites (Acariformes, Oribatei) are transmitted by birds. More than 2, 100 birds of 150 species from different ecological groups were surveyed. 180 species of live oribatid mites were collected <b>from</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feathers.</b> Some oribatid mite species live in <b>bird</b> <b>feathers</b> constantly. The authors assume that oribatid mites feed {{not on the}} particles of the skin, but on fungi inhabiting <b>bird</b> <b>feathers,</b> as all oribatid mites are mycophagous. Oribatid mites were found in different forms of their lifecycle. It has been established that they reproduce in <b>bird</b> <b>feathers.</b> Transmis-sion of these microarthropods by birds may be a principle cause of their distribution, especially in the remote Arctic areas, on the Oceanic islands, and in the oases of deserts.

50|$|The Feather Book of Dionisio Minaggio, also {{referred}} to in Italian as Il bestiario barocco (The Baroque Bestiary), {{is a collection of}} 156 pictures made almost entirely <b>from</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feathers</b> augmented with pieces of bird skin, feet, and beaks. They were created between 1616 and 1618 by Dionisio Minaggio, the chief gardener of the Duchy of Milan and were originally bound into a book. The majority of pictures in the book are of birds indigenous to the Lombardy region of Italy at the time, but it also contained sets of other images depicting hunters, tradesmen, musicians, and commedia dell'arte characters.|$|R

40|$|Effective DNA {{extraction}} methods <b>from</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feathers</b> have facilitated non-invasive sampling, {{leading to}} the suggestion that feathers are a great source for genetic studies. However, few studies have assessed whether all feathers can be used or provide equal numbers of useful templates. In this study, feathers collected in various ways from Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus were examined to establish the quality of DNA extracted. Individual samples were classified into two categories according to whether they were collected <b>from</b> shot <b>birds</b> or found in the field. DNA was extracted from all samples and genotyped at 19 microsatellite loci. PCR products were analysed on a MegaBACE 1000. A total of 93 % of the ‘shot’ category produced a genotype that was considered successful (i. e. 15 of 18 loci) and 23 % of the ‘collected’ category produced successful genotypes under the same criteria. There {{was a significant difference}} between shot and collected samples in genotyping success and the observed number of missing loci. Recommendations and best practices are discussed along with the utility of <b>bird</b> <b>feathers</b> as a source of DNA for population and conservation biology...|$|R

5000|$|The repeating {{crossbow}} has a {{very simple}} and rugged design. The basic construction of the weapon has remained very much unchanged since its invention, {{making it one of}} the longest-lived mechanical weapons. The bolts of one magazine are fired and reloaded by simply pushing and pulling the lever back and forth. [...] In that one movement, a bolt would be dropped into place, the string tensioned, and then the bolt released. Another bolt would then be ready to take its place from the magazine above. This action, however, put the weapon's string under heavy wear since it had forces straining it from both above and below. The lifting of the magazine especially, put severe pressure on the string. The bow string consists of animal sinew twisted into a cord of suitable strength, often reinforced with quills <b>from</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feathers,</b> preferably those <b>from</b> swans or ducks.|$|R

40|$|Inhibitory {{effect of}} {{incubation}} on microbial growth has extensively {{been studied in}} wild bird populations using culture-based methods and conflicting results exist on whether incubation selectively affects the growth of microbes on the egg surface. In this study, we employed culture-independent methods, quantitative PCR and 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, to elucidate the effect of incubation on the bacterial abundance and bacterial community composition on the eggshells of the Eurasian Magpie (Pica pica). We found that total bacterial abundance increased and diversity decreased on incubated eggs while there were no changes on non-incubated eggs. Interestingly, Gram-positive Bacillus, which include mostly harmless species, became dominant and genus Pseudomonas, which include opportunistic avian egg pathogens, were significantly reduced after incubation. These results suggest that avian incubation in temperate regions may promote the growth of harmless (or benevolent) bacteria and suppress the growth of pathogenic bacterial taxa and consequently reduce the diversity of microbes on the egg surface. We hypothesize that this may occur due to difference in sensitivity to dehydration on the egg surface among microbes, combined {{with the introduction of}} Bacillus <b>from</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feathers</b> and due to the presenc...|$|R

5000|$|Fletching is {{traditionally}} made <b>from</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feathers,</b> but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) {{end of the}} arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though {{as many as six}} have been used. Two makes the arrow unstable in flight. When the arrow is three-fletched, the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes. This fletch is called the [...] "index fletch" [...] or [...] "cock feather" [...] (also known as [...] "the odd vane out" [...] or [...] "the nocking vane"), and the others are sometimes called the [...] "hen feathers". Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision. When an arrow is four-fletched, two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.|$|R
40|$|The newly {{described}} {{technique of}} extracting corticosterone (CORT) <b>from</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feathers</b> {{may serve as}} a less invasive, more integrated measure of a bird’s stress response. Previous work indicated that elevated plasma CORT resulted in poorer quality feathers during molt. We tested the hypothesis that a direct link exists between plasma and feather CORT concentrations. We experimentally increased plasma CORT concentrations using implants and found that the corresponding rise in CORT could be detected in feathers grown during implantation. Furthermore, CORT levels in two feathers grown at the same time <b>from</b> the same <b>bird</b> were very consistent. These results provide evidence that elevated CORT is a causative factor in decreasing feather quality during molt. However, there remain technical details that suggest caution when interpreting data from CORT extracted from feathers. Different portions of a growing feather did not necessarily reflect changes in plasma CORT at the time different parts of the feather were forming, a standard pool of homogenized feathers indicated that sample mass affects measured feather CORT concentration, and different antibodies produced different measured CORT concentrations, leaving in doubt the exact steroid being assayed. In birds, the stress response consists of a suite of behavioral and physiological changes that help animals cope with stressors such as bad weather, predators, food shortages and social instability (Wingfield and Romero 2001, Wingfiel...|$|R

2500|$|The Booted Bantam, {{also called}} the Dutch Booted Bantam and the Sabelpoot, is a bantam breed of chicken.

40|$|Coloration {{is vital}} to birds; it is {{involved}} in mating, territorial display, communication, camouflage, and predation. Birds rely on their environment for the raw materials necessary to make most colors present in their feathers. As a result, habitat quality can have lifetime fitness consequences through the color pathway. Widescale habitat change has affected the quality of habitats accessible to birds worldwide. Consequently, the availability of pigment-containing resources within many altered habitats has shifted, leading to modification in the coloration of some birds’ feathers. I hypothesized that the red pigmentation in the feather shoulders, or epaulets, of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoenicus) may have changed in Connecticut’s population over time. To test this hypothesis, I compared the carotenoid pigments of epaulet feathers from red-winged blackbird specimens collected around 1970 to those of <b>feathers</b> <b>from</b> <b>birds</b> captured in 2016. Historical feathers were sampled from museum specimens and were evaluated relative to new <b>feathers</b> taken <b>from</b> live <b>birds.</b> <b>Feathers</b> were visually scored for pigmentation intensity, and then carotenoids were extracted and identified using high performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry. The pigment profiles of the museum specimens show that the historical birds were able to retrieve and produce the expected pigments in their epaulets whereas the live birds lacked {{one of the two}} major carotenoids that constitute epaulet coloration. The habitat of the modern birds may not have had the adequate resources for the individuals to build all of the expected carotenoids in their epaulets. This observation could indicate the effect of habitat quality on carotenoid pigmentation in <b>birds</b> <b>from</b> 1970 to present day. To better understand this effect, analysis of temporal habitat change must be paired with a robust study of pigmentation change over time...|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. Previous {{studies showed}} that {{the upper reaches of}} the Taaibosspruit {{catchment}} in the north eastern region of the Free State, contains elevated concentrations of mercury in the sediment. Additional laboratory-based bioaccumulation studies with sediment-dwelling Chironomidae larvae revealed that the mercury was in a bioavailable form, but it was uncertain to what extent this mercury was in the methylated organic form. Therefore, a study to assess the extent of inorganic- and methylmercury contamination in the water and sediment, as well as the uptake of this pollutant by aquatic and aquatic associated biota was undertaken. This study tested the hypothesis that bioaccumulation of mercury occurs in the different trophic levels of {{the upper reaches of the}} Taaibosspruit ecosystem. The objectives of this study were to determine the spatial and temporal physico-chemical characteristics of the water and sediment of the Taaibosspruit system; to determine the extent of mercury distribution within the water and sediment of the Taaibosspruit system; to determine the degree of bioaccumulation and possible biomagnification of mercury by the biota from the different trophic levels of the ecosystem in the Taaibosspruit system; to determine the distribution of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese and uranium within the water and sediment of this system, as well as the degree of bioaccumulation of these metals by invertebrates and fish; and to determine whether the aquatic macroinvertebrate community structures change along the mercury pollution gradient in the Taaibosspruit system. Sampling was done bi-annually at five sites during late high- and late low flow periods. The reference site is situated on a tributary of the Taaibosspruit, which is not directly influenced by discharges from the industrial complex. In situ water quality parameters were determined at each site and the following samples were collected: water, sediment, aquatic macroinvertebrates, vertebrates (fish and amphibian species), as well as noninvasive tissue <b>from</b> <b>birds</b> (<b>feathers).</b> The physico-chemical characteristics of the water were determined by measuring the chlorophyll-a concentrations, nutrient levels and suspended solid content. The sediment was analysed for organic content, water content, as well as sediment particle size distribution. The methylmercury concentrations in the water, sediment and biotic components were determined through cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry, whilst inorganic mercury, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese and uranium concentrations in these samples were determined through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. All analyses were subjected to appropriate quality analysis and quality control procedures. The relationship between environmental mercury exposure and biological effects was determined using changes in the macroinvertebrate community assemblage structure as the biological endpoint. The invertebrate samples were retained for enumeration and lower taxonomic identification in the laboratory. Data were subjected to the appropriate univariate statistical analysis (oneway ANOVA and regression), as well as multivariate statistical analyses (redundancy and principal component) to study spatial and temporal trends in mercury distribution and associated biological responses...|$|R
