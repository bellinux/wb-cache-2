40|$|A disc or {{drum brake}} system is very often {{generating}} undesirable and annoying squeal noise that can disturb both driver and passengers. In {{order to prevent}} or reduce brake squeal noise, structural modifications of brake components, <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> and active squeal control methods are commonly proposed and evaluated by car manufacturers using analytical, numerical and experimental approach. Thus, this thesis attempts to investigate the effectiveness of <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> such as pad insulator and clip to reduce disc brake squeal noise. In doing so, existing two (pad model) and four (pad-disc model) degrees-of-freedom (DOF) brake models without <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> are adopted. The mass, stiffness and damping values of these brake models are obtained from the experiments. These two brake models are then validated against a real brake assembly test data and good correlation on the natural and squeal frequency is achieved. Upon obtaining validated brake models, <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> i. e. the clip and insulator are modelled based on its mass, stiffness and <b>damping.</b> The <b>layers</b> later are embedded into the validated pad and pad-disc models. The parameter properties (stiffness and damping) of these <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> are measured from modal testing. Complex eigenvalue (CE) and dynamic transient (DT) analyses are performed using MATLAB software package to predict squeal occurrences. The squeal trigger mechanism used in this work is based on mode coupling effect. The brake models with <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> are simulated at a certain brake parameter range such as friction coefficient, pad-disc contact stiffness and pad wear. From the analysis, {{it is found that}} both CE and DT predict squeal frequency close to the measured data with difference less than 4 %. It is also found that the pad-disc model is successfully predicting squeal or non-squeal occurrences close to the squeal test results for both with clip and clip-insulator models. However, the pad model is seen not capable to completely replicate the squeal test results particularly with the clip model. This shows that the pad-disc model should be used to predict squeal occurrences. From the parametric studies, it is shown that squeal noise can b...|$|R

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the effect of}} unconstrained <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> and an edge-supporting stiffener on the sound power radiated from a mechanically-driven honeycomb sandwich plate. The free wave equations of coupled flexural plate motion are first set up, {{taking into account the}} orthotropic core shear stiffness. Solutions of these equations have been found and computed wavespeed dispersion curves have been presented. The plate boundary conditions at an edge supported on a flexible beam have been established and the response of the plate to a point harmonic force on that beam has been analysed and computed. The sound power radiated from the baffled plate surface has been found from the pre-determined plate response by numerical evaluation of Rayleigh's integral. A computational study has shown that the orientation of the core principal axes of orthotropy relative to the edge beam can profoundly influence the level of the radiated sound power. The sound power reductions obtainable when unconstrained <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> are added to the plate surface have been predicted and explained. Full account has been taken of the effect of the <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> on the radiation efficiencies and total loss factors of the plates. Experiments to validate the theory have been conducted. A supporting rig for sandwich plates has been constructed which simulated three simply-supported and one stiffened edge condition. Response and radiated sound power measurements were made on three different plates. Tests were conducted with and without <b>damping</b> <b>layers</b> on the plates and the results compared favourably with those predicted from the theory and computer programmes. Measurements were made of the damping material properties from tests on solid plates.

The computations are with the 2 D Linearized Euler Equations (LEE) for both a uniform mean flow and a steady parallel jet. The numerical experiments are with algorithms that are third, fifth, seventh and ninth order accurate in space and time. The numerical domain is enclosed in a <b>damping</b> <b>layer</b> boundary treatment. The damping is implemented in a time accurate manner, with simple polynomial damping profiles of second, fourth, sixth and eighth power.

To analyze vibro-acoustic systems, a hybrid model that uses finite elements for the structures and boundary element for the cavity is developed.
