40|$|ABSTRACT: The study {{investigated}} a service learning partnership between mid-career teachers at a primary school in Atteridgeville and newly-qualified, mostly secondary, teachers from Nottingham University. The {{aim was to}} identify benefits and challenges {{with a view to}} optimising <b>future</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Data was gathered through participant observation and interviews, analysed by thematic content analysis and interpreted from a critical/postcolonial perspective. The research found a range of benefits accrued to the various stakeholders, including enhanced literacy teaching and learning, opportunities for shared teaching practice, and the lasting legacy of a functional library. While crosscultural contact was identified as a benefit, it also created some tensions related to equitable power-sharing. Therefore, recommendations for <b>future</b> <b>partnerships</b> include clear and consistent communication between partners regarding expectations, goals, and accountability, closer collaboration between partners, and proactive conflict resolution mechanisms. Finally, the research highlights the viable, yet scarcely tapped, potential of such partnerships to address both pre-service and in-service training needs in teacher education in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Distinguished {{ways are}} used to measure {{hierarchical}} rank between partners in surveys. Aim of this thesis was to study preference for partner of particular hierarchical rank towards respondent 1) according to rating of photographs, 2) according to respondent's ideas about his/her <b>future</b> <b>partnership</b> organization, 3) according to respondent's natural tendency to lead or to yield, and to compare these ways of preference assessment. Questionnaires from 95 female university students aged to 25 years inc. were processed. Respondents, who claimed they will submit their partner or they will take turns in subordination with their partner half and half, were more submissive in ordinary life than respondents, who claimed they will be equal to their partner. Expected connection between idea about <b>future</b> <b>partnership</b> organization or submissiveness in ordinary life and choice of photograph depicting figurant with particular signs of nonverbal dominance was not found. Nevertheless, differences in choices of photographs were found between females using hormonal contraceptives and females not using any hormonal contraceptives.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{patterns of}} social interaction within the organizations working in the Yatenga province of Burkina Faso, and develops purposive partnership framework that can facilitate the scaling up of the action research outputs and outcomes. A diagnostic tool for evaluating group functioning was used to elucidate the current situation of partnership development in this province. Further, partnership and networking was analyzed using the network density which describes {{the portion of the}} potential connections in a network of organizations that are actual connections. The results suggest that the desired partnership as requested/expected by stakeholders is far from working as it could be. The stakeholders therefore agreed that network density need to be increased for <b>future</b> <b>partnership,</b> with clearly defined vision, shared responsibilities in generating knowledge and results, and capacities to monitor, evaluate and communicate on the program impacts. For this purpose, <b>future</b> <b>partnership</b> need to combine scale-based and competency-based frameworks to be beneficial at scale and pulling together organizations’ competencies. Implementing both frameworks would lead to an effective partnership on climate change adaptation in agriculture and food security. However, the successful development of this purposive partnership will require capacity development for the group of partnering organizations...|$|R

40|$|Decision makers tend {{to exhibit}} {{a higher degree}} of impatience when {{considering}} a delay to an immediate reward than when contemplating an identical delay to an <b>equal</b> <b>future</b> reward. This work argues that diminishing impatience originates from the distinction between the certain present and the risky future. A simple functional representation of preferences, exhibiting time inconsistency when the future is uncertain, is derived. Experimental evidence, which is inconsistent with other formulations that account for diminishing impatience, supports the proposed approach. The new theory uncovers a tight relation between diminishing impatience and well-known behavioral regularities in choice under risk and uncertainty. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{conducts a}} {{critical}} analysis of the potential legal basis {{and scope of the}} future European Union (EU) -Ukraine enhanced agreement. Accepting that the most probable and most beneficial possibility for Ukraine is to conclude an association agreement with the EU on the basis of Article 310 EC Treaty (EC), it is argued that the objectives of the enhanced co-operation between the EU and Ukraine - as expected and desired by the Ukrainian political élite - could be achieved by a partnership agreement concluded on the basis of Article 181 a EC. Furthermore, if the new enhanced EU-Ukraine agreement were concluded as a partnership agreement, it might be better suited for the solving of certain political and legal challenges in contemporary EU-Ukraine relations. First, a new enhanced agreement concluded on the basis of Article 181 a EC would not entail unjustified political expectations - on the part of Ukraine - of obtaining the perspective of full EU-membership in the near future. Second, a <b>future</b> EU-Ukraine <b>partnership</b> agreement would be the best option for a “transitional” enhanced agreement before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force. Third, a <b>future</b> <b>partnership</b> agreement between the EU and Ukraine will not undermine the fundamentals of the evolving strategic partnership between the EU and Russia...|$|R
