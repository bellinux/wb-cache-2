50|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} currently used to manage M. phaseolina fungal infections. Often, fungicides {{are used to}} inhibit mycelial growth. These include thiram, iprodione, carbendazim, pyraclostrobin, fluquinconazol, tolyfluanid, and metalaxyl and penflufen + trifloxystrobin. The active ingredients carbendazim and penflufen + trifloxystrobin were shown {{to be the most}} powerful to control M. phaseolina. In this same study, the M. phaseolina isolate showed insensitivity to the active ingredients <b>fluquinconazole,</b> metalaxyl, thiram and tolyfluanid. Thus, fungicides are not necessarily an effective way to manage this fungal pathogen.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} varying doses of fungicides, {{alone or in}} mixtures, on {{selection}} for triazole resistance were examined under field conditions. Two experiments were conducted using the triazole fungicide <b>fluquinconazole</b> with the strobilurin fungicide azoxystrobin as a mixture partner. Inoculated wheat plots with a known ratio of more sensitive to less sensitive isolates of the leaf blotch fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola were sprayed with fungicide and sampled once symptoms had appeared. Selection for <b>fluquinconazole</b> resistance increased {{in proportion to the}} dose, up to one-half of the full dose (the maximum tested) in both experiments. At the higher doses of <b>fluquinconazole,</b> the addition of azoxystrobin was associated with a decrease in selection (nonsignificant in the first experiment) for triazole resistance. Control by low doses of <b>fluquinconazole</b> was increased by mixture with azoxystrobin, but at higher doses mixture with azoxystrobin sometimes decreased control, so that reduced selection was obtained at the cost of some reduction in control. The effects on resistance are not necessarily general consequences of mixing fungicides, and suggest that the properties of any specific mixture may need to be demonstrated experimentally. Selection was inversely related to control in the unmixed treatments in both experiments, but the relationship was weaker in the mixtures with azoxystrobin...|$|E

40|$|Soybean is an {{important}} crop in the economical agriculture of Brazil and it has productive potential compromised {{by a variety of}} diseases affecting the crop such as soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficiency of incorporating <b>fluquinconazole</b> into the soybean seed treatment in the management of the disease, associated with spray of different fungicides on leaves. The work consisted of two trials side by side on the field. The first trial consisted of several fungicides used to control soybean rust (azoxistrobin, cyproconazole, trifloxystrobin, tebuconazole and prothioconazole) and seed treatment with carbendazim + thiram, and <b>fluquinconazole.</b> The second trail was identical to the first, but without the use of <b>fluquinconazole.</b> The experiment was carried out into two localities – Goiânia (GO) and Senador Canedo (GO). In both experiments, fungicides applied on leaves were effective controlling soybean rust, however the incorporation of <b>fluquinconazole</b> on the soybean seed treatment did not increase the control of the disease since neither it delayed the onset of the disease nor significantly increased the productivity of the crop. A soja é uma das principais culturas de exploração econômica no Brasil, mas tem seu potencial produtivo comprometido por uma série de doenças que afetam a cultura. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar a eficiência da incorporação de fluquinconazol ao tratamento de semente de soja, no manejo da ferrugem asiática (Phakopsora pachyrhizi), associado a diferentes fungicidas na parte aérea. O trabalho constou de dois ensaios dispostos lado a lado no campo. O primeiro ensaio constou de vários fungicidas empregados no controle de ferrugem asiática da soja (azoxistrobina, ciproconazol, trifloxistrobina, tebuconazol e protioconazol) e de tratamento das sementes com carbendazim + thiram e fluquinconazol. O segundo ensaio foi idêntico ao primeiro, mas sem a utilização de fluquinconazol. Esse experimento foi realizado em dois locais – Goiânia (GO) e Senador Canedo (GO). Em ambos os locais, os fungicidas aplicados via foliar foram eficientes no manejo da ferrugem da soja, mas a incorporação de fluquinconazol não aumentou significativamente o controle do fungo P. pachyrhizi, uma vez que não retardou o aparecimento da doença nem acarretou ganhos significativos de produtividade...|$|E

These a. i. were: azoxystrobin, carbendazim, difenoconazole, epoxiconazole, <b>fluquinconazole,</b> prochloraz, propiconazole, prothioconazole, pyraclostrobin, spiroxamine, tebuconazole, thiophanate-methyl, triadimenol, and trifloxystrobin. In this study, the potential risk of a. i. on non-target organisms in fungicide application of wheat cultivation was assessed by The Pesticide Occupational and Environmental Risk (POCER) indicators. In this study, the highest human health risk was for <b>fluquinconazole</b> (Exceedence Factor (EF) 1. 798 for human health), whereas the fungicide with the highest environmental risk was propiconazole (EF 2. 000 for the environment). For non-target organisms, the highest potential risk was determined for propiconazole when applied at 0. 1250 kg a. i. ha- 1 (EF 2. 897).

40|$|Leptosphaeria maculans is {{the major}} {{pathogen}} of canola (oilseed rape, Brassica napus) worldwide. In Australia, the use of azole fungicides {{has contributed to the}} 50 -fold increase in canola production in the last 25 years. However, extensive application of fungicides sets the stage for the selection of fungal populations with resistance. A high-throughput in planta assay was developed to allow screening of thousands of isolates from multiple populations. Using this screen, isolates were identified with decreased sensitivity to the fungicide <b>fluquinconazole</b> when applied at field rates as a protective seed dressing: these isolates cause significantly larger lesions on cotyledons and true leaves and increased disease severity at plant maturity. This increased in planta resistance was specific to <b>fluquinconazole,</b> with no cross resistance to flutriafol or tebuconazole/prothioconazole. In a limited set of 22 progeny from a cross between resistant and susceptible parents, resistance segregated in a 1 : 1 ratio, suggesting a single gene is responsible. A survey of 200 populations from across canola growing regions of Australia revealed fungicide resistance was present in 15 % of the populations. Although in vitro analysis of the fungicide resistant isolates showed a significant shift in the average EC 50 compared to the sensitive isolates, this was not as evident as the in planta assays. The development of this novel, high-throughput in planta assay has led to the identification of the first fungicide resistant L. maculans isolates, which may pose a threat to the productivity of the Australian canola industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the relative importance of glutathione S-transferase (GST) mediated herbicide and fungicide detoxification in wheat plants and to functionally characterise GSTs cloned from phytopathogenic fungi. Wheat seedlings treated with and without safeners were used for in vivo and in vitro pesticide metabolism studies with the herbicide fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and the fungicide <b>fluquinconazole,</b> which are both known to undergo glutathione conjugation. Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl underwent rapid detoxification by this route and the rates of metabolism were enhanced in safener treated wheat. In contrast, <b>fluquinconazole</b> was poorly metabolised with only a small proportion detoxified by glutathlonylation irrespective {{of whether or not the}} plants were safener treated. Subsequent studies confirmed that whereas fenoxaprop was a substrate for wheat GSTs, <b>fluquinconazole</b> was not. Similarly, when a diverse range of systemic and contact fungicides was tested, none were found to undergo conjugation mediated by wheat GSTs, even though several compounds underwent conjugation with glutathione in alkaline conditions. Metabolite profiling by HPLC-MS established that the alternative thiol present in wheat, hydroxymethyl glutathione, was used in addition to glutathione in fenoxaprop detoxification. The S-conjugates were then further metabolised by peptidases and glucosyl- and malonyl transferases to yield polar derivatives such as the cysteinyl-malonyl-glucosyl derivative. This rapid processing was in contrast to that determined in herbicide-susceptible and herbicide-resistant black-grass, where the glutathione derivative was the major metabolite of fenoxaprop. Using an informatics approach, GSTs in IVIagnaporthe griseae and Phytoptithora infestans were identified cloned and then expressed in E. coli, with the pure enzymes assayed for glutathione-dependent activities. MgGSTX 1 of Magnaporthe griseae was found to be a member of a novel class of GSTs (termed xi class) and was shown to function as a thioltransferase, with a specific activity of 50. 4 ± 3. 4 nKat mg (^- 1) protein. Unusually, the catalytic mechanism of thiol transfer was insensitive to the alkylating agent iodoacetamide, indicating that free cysteines were not involved in catalysis. MgGSTX 1 did not conjugate any of the experimental xenobiotics tested with GSH. The theta class GST P/GSTT 1 cloned from P. infestans exhibited glutathione peroxidase activity and readily detoxified fungitoxic oxylipins produced by potato as antimicrobial defence by potato through the action of lipoxygenases. Using anti-sera raised against the purified recombinant protein, immunoblotting experiments revealed expression of P/GSTT 1 in the in vitro cultured fungus as well as during colonisation of potato. P/GSTT 1 did not demonstrate GSH conjugating toward any of the xenobiotic substrates tested including herbicides and fungicides. Based on the sequences of GSTs identified in this study an extension of the existing classification system is suggested to include the GSTs of fungal phytopathogen...|$|E

40|$|Azole antifungals, {{known as}} {{demethylase}} inhibitors (DMIs), target sterol 14 α-demethylase (CYP 51) in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway of fungal pathogens of both plants and humans. DMIs remain {{the treatment of}} choice in crop protection against {{a wide range of}} fungal phytopathogens that have the potential to reduce crop yields and threaten food security. We used a yeast membrane protein expression system to overexpress recombinant hexahistidine-tagged S. cerevisiae lanosterol 14 α-demethylase and the Y 140 F or Y 140 H mutants of this enzyme as surrogates in order characterize interactions with DMIs. The whole-cell antifungal activity (MIC 50 values) of both the R- and S-enantiomers of tebuconazole, prothioconazole (PTZ), prothioconazole-desthio, and oxo-prothioconazole (oxo-PTZ) as well as for <b>fluquinconazole,</b> prochloraz and a racemic mixture of difenoconazole were determined. In vitro binding studies with the affinity purified enzyme were used to show tight type II binding to the yeast enzyme for all compounds tested except PTZ and oxo-PTZ. High resolution X-ray crystal structures of ScErg 11 p 6 ×His in complex with seven DMIs, including four enantiomers, reveal triazole-mediated coordination of all compounds and the specific orientation of compounds within the relatively hydrophobic binding site. Comparison with CYP 51 structures from fungal pathogens including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Aspergillus fumigatus provides strong evidence for a highly conserved CYP 51 structure including the drug binding site. The structures obtained using S. cerevisiae lanosterol 14 α-demethylase in complex with these agrochemicals provide the basis for understanding the impact of mutations on azole susceptibility and a platform for the structure-directed design of the next-generation of DMIs...|$|E

Algumas doenças que ocorrem na parte área das plantas podem ser manejadas através do tratamento das sementes com produtos sistêmicos. Essa forma de controle tem sido utilizada há muitos anos, visando o controle de fungos biotróficos em arroz e trigo. A ferrugem asiática da soja é a {{principal}} doença que ataca a cultura, a qual necessita de ferramentas eficientes para seu manejo. O objetivo desta dissertação foi verificar a contribuição do tratamento de sementes de soja com produtos fitossanitários no manejo da ferrugem asiática. Desta forma, produtos fitossanitários foram aplicados às sementes de soja em diferentes doses, a fim de se verificar os efeitos fitotóxicos sobre sementes e plântulas que eventualmente fossem causados pelos mesmos. As maiores doses não fitotóxicas de cada tratamento foram selecionadas, novamente aplicadas às sementes e distribuídas em campo experimental, onde se verificou o efeito do tratamento das sementes isoladamente ou com a aplicação foliar de fungicidas foliares, no manejo da ferrugem asiática da soja. Ciproconazol + azoxistrobina (10, 0 + 25, 0 g i. a. / 100 kg de sementes), difenoconazol (50, 0), epoxiconazol (2, 5), fluquinconazol (50, 0), flutriafol (10, 0), flutriafol TS (5, 0), flutriafol + tiofanato metílico (10, 0 + 50, 0), tebuconazol (10, 0), tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina (10, 0 + 5, 0), tetraconazol (10, 0), triticonazol (25, 0), acibenzolar-S-methyl (50, 0) e pó de rocha (2, 0) não apresentaram fitotoxicidade e foram comparados em campo. Ciproconazol + azoxistrobina (25, 0 + 10, 0 g i. a. / 100 kg de sementes) e epoxiconazol (2, 5) diminuíram a emergência das plântulas de soja em campo.

Quando se integrou a pulverização foliar de fungicidas, fluquinconazol, tebuconazol e tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina, diminuíram a severidade da ferrugem asiática da soja. Apesar de não aumentar o rendimento da cultura, o tratamento de sementes pode contribuir no manejo da ferrugem asiática da soja, mantendo a segurança e o rendimento do produtor. Seed treatment has as traditional objective to eradicate or to reduce fungi associated with seeds {{and to protect}} them from soilborne pathogens. Some diseases that occur in the aerial part of plants may be managed through seed treatment with systemic products. This kind of control has been used for many years, aiming the control of biotrophic fungi in rice and wheat. Soybeanś asian rust is the main disease that attacks the culture, which needs efficient tools for its management. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify the contribution of soybean seed treatment with phytosanitary products in the management of asian rust. In this case, phytosanitary products were applied to soybean seeds in different doses, aiming to verify the phytotoxicity effects onto seeds and seedlings that eventually would be caused by these products. The highest non phytotoxic doses of each treatment were selected, applied again to seeds and these were distributed on experimental field, where it was verified the effect of each seed treatment with and without foliar application of fungicides, in the management of soybeanś asian rust.

40|$|Spore-forming {{bacteria}} {{were investigated}} as potential biological control {{agents of the}} pea root rot fungus, Aphanomyces euteiches (Oomycete). Isolations of the bacteria were made both directly from field soils (558) and from the rhizosphere of peas grown in soil (146). When the 704 isolates were screened for inhibition of A. euteiches mycelial expansion in vitro, a low frequency of suppressiveness was observed in isolates taken directly from field-soil (0. 05 %), whilst 19 % of the bacterial isolates taken from the rhizosphere were suppressive. Mycelial suppressive isolates were subsequently screened for inhibition of zoospore germination and germ tube growth. The seven isolates Bacillus cereus 15 • 80, Paenibacillus polymyxa 18 • 25, P. polymyxa 18 • 94, unidentified bacterium PB 45, Paenibacillus macerans PT 1, Bacillus pumilus PT 10 and Bacillus subtilis PT 69, inhibited growth by 50 % or more. Bacterial isolates were identified using carbohydrate fermentation profiles and, for Bacillus mycoides MW 27 and P. polymyxa 18 • 25, on their 16 S rRNA gene sequences. The seven suppressive isolates identified, and an additional five isolates which had appeared promising in an earlier study (unidentified bacterium MW 9 b, B. cereus MW 10, B. pumilus MW 12, B. pumilus MW 18, B. mycoides MW 27), were tested for disease control in glasshouse trials. Bacillus cereus 15 • 80 and Apron C 70 SD significantly (∝= 0. 05) reduced visual root rot disease in the initial trial. However, {{the presence of other}} root rot pathogens, causing disease with symptoms similar to Aphanomyces root rot, confounded the results. In a subsequent trial, counts were made of oospore numbers per gram of root tissue which allowed specific distinction of A. euteiches disease. Several species of bacteria were able to reduce oospores and root rot symptoms. Paenibacillus polymyxa 18 • 25 was the most effective, reducing oospores from 450 to 160 gram⁻¹ of root. Apron C 70 SD reduced overall root disease but had no effect on oospore counts. On the basis of both in vitro and glasshouse trial results, B. subtilis PT 69, B. pumilus MW 18 and PT 10, B. mycoides MW 27, B. cereus 15 • 80, P. polymyxa 18 • 25 and 18 • 94 were selected for field testing. In the first trial, no significant differences (∝= 0. 05) were found between nil and each of the other treatments. In part, this was due to low overall disease pressure (disease score of 1. 5 in untreated) and inadequate separation I resolution of treatment means (all bacterial treatment means were 1. 0). Bacillus mycoides MW 27 and P. polymyxa 18 • 25 were selected for further field trials. Bacillus mycoides MW 27 significantly (∝= 0. 05) increased the mean pod weight per plant from 2. 39 g (nil) to 2. 71 g, and the average plant root weight from 0. 81 g to 0. 95 g. No benefits were found by applying the two isolates together as opposed to individually, nor was there a benefit by combining them with Apron C 70 SD. Seed coat, prill and granule formulations of B. mycoides MW 27 were evaluated in a field trial. As a seed coat formulation, the isolate significantly (∝= 0. 05) increased plot stand by about 10 %. In a prill formulation, B. mycoides MW 27 had no effect on plot stand (early damping-off disease), but significantly (∝= 0. 05) increased the number of pods per plant and average pod weight per plant. Apron C 70 SD controlled damping-off disease but had no effect on root rot disease. Bacillus pumilus PT 10, B. mycoides MW 27, P. polymyxa 18 • 25 and <b>fluquinconazole</b> were tested as seed treatments for control of another root disease, take-all of wheat. Bacillus pumilus PT 10 significantly (∝= 0. 05) increased plant yield by 77 %. Bacillus mycoides MW 27 had similar efficacy as <b>fluquinconazole,</b> increasing yield by approximately 10 % (not significant at ∝= 0. 05). As a seed coat treatment, B. mycoides MW 27 also effectively controlled damping-off disease. Paenibacillus polymyxa 18 • 25 suppressed a wide range of plant pathogenic fungi in vitro, possibly through production of the cell wall-degrading enzymes chitinase or cellulase, or an antibiotic compound which the bacterium was found to produce. Bacillus mycoides MW 27 was slightly suppressive to only two pathogenic fungi in vitro, and did not degrade chitin or cellulose. The soil bacterium Bacillus mycoides MW 27 has excellent potential for development as a biological control agent of Aphanomyces root rot of pea. A formulation of the bacterium could be marketed on both its ability to increase yields under Aphanomyces disease pressure, and to limit oospore development, thereby limiting disease in continuous cropping situations...|$|E
