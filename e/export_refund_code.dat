40|$|The usual sale of European {{agricultural}} products to Africa using <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> has been heavily discussed in recent decades. At {{the centre of}} the discussion are the consequences on the agricultural producers in Western and Southern Africa. There are two different points of view: On the one hand, the European Union's (EU) export policy reduces the prices on these markets and relieves high burdens on local producers; on the other hand are claims that refunds do not influence local prices significantly. Hence, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has no effect on markets of third countries, besides depressing world market prices. This paper focuses on the effects of EU's export subsidies for beef exports on its market share in several developing countries. Twenty-seven African countries were analysed using a fixed-effects model between 1988 and 2000. The results clearly show a highly significant positive impact of the <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> rate on the market and the import share. With its export policy, the EU raises its market position and edges out other competitors...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) {{consumers}} pay {{almost twice}} the competitive world price for many agricultural products. Agricultural subsidies accounted {{for almost half}} of the EU's total budget (US$ 40 billion on agriculture in 2000) although agriculture represented 1. 7 percent of the EU's GDP and employs 4. 3 % of the EU's population. Domestic policies for citrus and tomatoes include <b>export</b> <b>refunds,</b> product withdraws from the market, intervention thresholds, and direct producer aid. Domestic policies for dairy include <b>export</b> <b>refunds,</b> intervention thresholds, aid for private storage, disposal aid, and milk quotas. The EU's intentions are to enhance agricultural competitiveness by setting product intervention as "a real safety net measure, allowing EU producers to respond to market signals while protecting them from extreme price fluctuations," and promoting market oriented, sustainable agriculture by finishing the transition from product support to producer support, by introducing a "decoupled system of payments per farm" which are not connected to production. The EU wishes to allow flexibility in production, but also guarantee income stability to producers. Within the last 10 years, the EU has reduced price supports and increased direct payments to tomato, dairy, and citrus farmers to compensate them for the reductions.

40|$|Proposals for the EU's {{agricultural}} {{offer in}} the WTO negotiations were {{submitted by the}} European Commission to EU agricultural ministers and the Article 133 Committee on December 16 th 2002. The EU proposal suggests the following actions be taken over a six-year period for developed countries and a ten-year period for developing countries: a 55 % cut in trade-distorting farm subsidies; the rolling back of budget expenditures on <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> by about 45 % on average with the complete dismantling of <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> on cereals oilseeds, olive oil and tobacco, provided that all other forms of export subsidy are also abandoned for these products (in this context the EU is calling for stronger disciplines to be introduced on export credits, state-run trading enterprises and abuses of food aid); a further opening of agricultural markets by reducing agricultural tariffs by 36 % on average, with a cut of at least 15 % per dutiable item. In addition the EU is proposing that: other developed economies and advanced developing countries should introduce 'Everything but Arms' style treatment for LDCS; there should be support for a 'food security box' involving a special safeguard instrument to ensure food security; there should be recognition of its right to protect the European model of agriculture and the EU position on geographical designations of origin. Securing support for the European model of agriculture includes securing acceptance of the exclusion of internal non trade-distorting rural development support measures from the support reduction commitments. It also involves {{an extension of the}} peace clause, which prevents existing support measures from being challenged in the WTO. The EU sees its proposals as a more practical way of moving the agenda forward rather than the 'extreme and unrealistic position' of the USA and the Cairns Group. In response to the EU proposals the Cairns Group felt that they contravened the Doha commitment to 'reductions of, with a view to phasing out' all forms of export subsidies. The Group also pointed out that the EU make no proposals for phasing out the 'blue box', which allows partly de-coupled payments under production limiting programmes. The Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile described the EU offer as 'too little too late'. The US described the EU proposal as 'lacking ambition'. Comment: All of the major elements of the EU proposal demand careful scrutiny. For example what is meant by 'trade-distorting subsidies'? The OECD has raised questions as to whether all of the subsidies which the EU describes as non trade-distorting are in fact trade neutral. Second, the EU's commitments on <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> needs to be seen against the background of the shift to direct aid payments which is allowing the gap between EU and world market prices to be closed. This is doing away with the need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds.</b> During the first round of reform EU export-refund expenditures fell by 45 %. Further reductions in the EU intervention price under the Agenda 2000 reforms have further closed the gap between EU and world market prices. The depreciation of the Euro against the US$ further reduced the need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> (although the recent 10 % appreciation has increased the objective need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> in the last year). It will require detailed calculations based on current price trends and expected exchange rates to determine whether the EU's offer will have any actual impact on the planned level of export-refund expenditures in the coming years Third, the EU's offer to reduce agricultural tariffs by 36 % on average cannot be considered in isolation from the downward trend in EU agricultural market prices driven by the process of CAP reform. With the gap between EU and world market prices closing, the need for tariff protection is diminishing. Here again a detailed consideration of market prices and expected exchange rates is necessary in order to ascertain whether the EU's offer will have any material impact on the agricultural trade position of developing countries. It is possible that the EU is in fact offering very little more than the current trajectory of CAP reform will easily allow, whilst securing benefits in terms of wider recognition of the EU's right to make use of certain support instruments and to secure exclusive use for EU enterprises of some widely recognised geographical labels.

The Commission expressed {{the view that}} it is important to improve preferential market access for sub-Saharan African countries but felt that this required careful scrutiny. The Commission also welcomed the French proposal for a moratorium on all forms of <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> for goods destined for Africa. Comment: In response to this initiative the ACP Group could usefully put together a dossier of specific market-access improvements which ACP states have been seeking under Declaration XXII and other agricultural trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. Such a dossier could be presented to the EU Council of Ministers in the context of further discussions of the French initiative. Possible improvements might include the ending of all quota restrictions on ACP exports of such products as grapes and lamb. It should be borne in mind that the Commission's welcome of a moratorium on <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> to Africa was conditional upon it being applied by all countries to all types of export support including export credits, food aid and the operations of state enterprises.

30|$|Agricultural {{policies}} play an import {{role within}} the dairy industry. The EU dairy industry, for example, {{is subject to}} the CAP. In the past, the CAP focused on maintaining adequate and stable prices for particular dairy commodities, such as butter and SMP. In turn, it was expected that the enhanced returns from these commodities would be transmitted to the farm gate price for milk. This aim was mainly achieved by purchasing to intervention stores, setting production quotas, <b>export</b> <b>refunds,</b> import tariffs and subsidized consumption. These measures resulted in isolating EU dairy commodity prices from lower and more volatile World prices. However, more recent changes to the CAP, and in particular the Luxembourg 2003 agreement, resulted in a greater market orientation with a lower level of price support (intervention buying, 9 import tariffs and <b>export</b> <b>refunds)</b> for EU dairy commodities. To compensate for the resultant losses, the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) was introduced to provide income support at farm level. In addition, the supply quota, introduced in 1984, expired in 2015. This aim of bringing EU dairy prices more in line with World prices was observed in O’Connor and Keane (2011) who reported a convergence of volatility between EU and World dairy commodity prices. A more comprehensive discussion of the CAP policy changes can be found in Keane and O’ Connor (2015).|$|R
40|$|In September 2003 the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service {{released}} its {{annual review of}} the EU poultry sector.

Changes in the market are expected in response to 'the January 2003 announcement by Russia of its tariff-rate quota, which is expected to limit imports of beef, pork and poultry' and in the longer term the implementation of the CAP mid-term review proposals and EU enlargement. Comment: The Russian decision to limit imports of beef, poultry and pork through a TRQ system could leave considerable volumes of EU poultry meat looking for new markets. The impact this could have on ACP poultry sectors, particularly in west and central Africa will be determined by {{the extent to which these}} markets can directly replace former Russian markets. Already in west Africa there are growing complaints over increased EU poultry exports, which have arisen on the back of EU cereals-sector reform (which has substantially reduced EU poultry production costs). The openness of many west African and central African markets to poultry meat exports from the EU may spell severe problems for local poultry producers in a context of reduced EU exports to Russia.

40|$|Another USDA paper {{identifies}} {{three important}} effects of EU export subsidies: they lower {{prices in the}} importing country resulting in a 'decrease in local production, meaning the artificially low price pushes domestic producers out of the market, leaving them unemployed'; they reduce the income of those who continue to produce 'which can be devastating to their livelihoods'; they can 'inhibit market development of infant industries, particularly in developing countries'. The paper reviews {{the situation in the}} dairy sector and notes that skimmed-milk powder is the EU's largest export product to developing and least developed countries. Some 95 % of subsidised skimmed milk powder exports from the EU went to developing countries and some 11 % to LDCs. The paper notes that 'many developing and least developed countries have become dependent on low-priced SMP and other dairy imports from the EU as a primary protein source'. The low cost of imports has displaced local dairy farmers in countries as diverse as South Africa and Sri Lanka. In the rice sector, some 50 % of EU milled-rice exports goes to developing countries, with around 14 % going to LDCs. The report also briefly looks at the impact of export subsidies in the cereals and sugar sectors. Comment: While criticising the export subsidies paid by the EU this USDA paper makes no reference to the impact that CAP reform is having on the need for export subsidies. In the cereals sector, where reform is most advanced, the need for export subsidies had been reduced by around 95 % until the recent increase {{in the value of the}} euro against the US dollar (which saw a fivefold increase in cereals-sector <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> in the 2004 EU budget).

From the end of 1950 s {{to the middle of}} 1960 s the CAP was in fact created, though its operation came into force from 1 July in 1967. The border adjustment measures such as variable import levies and <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> became the key institutional instrument of protection. Furthermore, assuming its framework of solid protection, income-orientated price policy was introduced. With this high price policy, the sufficient safeguard system of the Western Continental European agriculture was established. It was none other than the European rescue of agricultural policy. The CAP symbolized the extreme high level of European integration from the viewpoint of the creation of agricultural internal market (market unity) and common pricing mechanism. Thus, the CAP stood for a SACRED Cow of European integration. Due to the first common policy of EEC, agricultural exceptionalism was institutionalized and farmers came to become the objective of policy protection in contrast to the medium-sized and small producers in non-agricultural sector. 欧文抄録: p. 19...|$|R

This includes production quotas, land set-asides, storage aids, <b>export</b> <b>refunds,</b> output payments, and area payments. Second, the Single Farm Payment (SFP), which provides income support to farmers independently of their current production decisions, should be phased out because it does not serve any societal need. Third, targeted subsidies that reward farmers for providing socially valued services that are not remunerated on the market, such as maintaining scenic landscapes, should be adapted.
