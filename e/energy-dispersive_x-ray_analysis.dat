500|$|In 2011, {{graduate}} student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an Archaeopteryx specimen. Using {{scanning electron microscopy}} technology and <b>energy-dispersive</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>analysis,</b> the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the single-feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant structure was then {{compared to that of}} 87modern bird species and was determined with a highest likelihood to be black. The feather studied was most probably a single covert, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that Archaeopteryx was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In a 2013 study published in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, new analyses of Archaeopteryxs feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex light- and dark-coloured plumage, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tips and outer vanes. In a press release, Carney argued against this interpretation, insisting the wing feather was [...] "matte black with a darker tip" [...] and one of his colleagues also brought up the subject in a review paper however, no new evidence was published.|$|E

40|$|Background/purpose: Although {{the effect}} of {{experimental}} surface modifications on various properties (e. g., fatigue, wear) on coated files have been tested in the past, there is no report for the coating quality of commercially available TiN coated files. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the surface and cross section of TiN coated endodontic files. Materials and methods: TiN coated nickel–titanium endodontic files (EasyShape) were surface and cross-sectionally analyzed via scanning electron microscopy backscattered electron imaging and <b>energy-dispersive</b> <b>X-ray</b> spectroscopy <b>analysis</b> in spot, area, and line scan modes. Results: Surface imaging revealed parallel oblong regions with higher mean atomic contrast, a finding attributed to increased Ni content. Cross-sectional analysis showed that the coating’s average total thickness was 0. 31  μm and consisted of a thin layered film. <b>Energy-dispersive</b> <b>X-ray</b> spectroscopy <b>analysis</b> revealed the presence of Ti, Ni, N, and O in the coating, whereas only Ni and Ti were identified in the bulk of the file. Ti and O showed their peak compositions at the bulk/coating and coating/surface interfaces, respectively, whereas N displayed a rather constant content within the coated region. The N and O contents started increasing inner to the coating/bulk interface, denoting possible diffusion of both elements to the subcoating region.
