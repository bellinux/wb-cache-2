5|$|A {{description}} of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée. Labillardière chose the specific name obovata, {{in reference to the}} leaves of his specimen, which were obovate (egg-shaped, with the narrow <b>end</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base). This leaf shape is often seen in this species. The term obovata derives from the Latin ob- ("inverse") and ovum ("egg"), and has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.|$|E

The divided highway section of M-99 was opened north of Eaton Rapids in 1979.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency.

After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an <b>end</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> direction of President Lyndon B.

5|$|Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse {{was known}} as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for the roller coaster. After its {{relocation}} to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an {{end of the world}} apocalypse theme was added with fire, crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of the roller coaster. As guests go further in the queue line to the <b>end</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station, it mimics an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves as a backdrop to the ride.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin {{was removed}} and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was {{extended}} to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. By the middle of 1960, the US131 was opened {{as far south as}} Martin; the section of M-118 between the new freeway and the old routing was used as a connector until the next section south to Plainwell opened the next year. After this next freeway segment was opened, M-118 was truncated to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> freeway.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, a new US223 bypass {{was built}} around Adrian, {{resulting}} in the relocation of M-34 to end at BUS US223/M-52. Finally, in 1966, when a new alignment of M-99 highway was opened, the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new highway near Osseo. In 2003, the short connector between M-34 and US223 was abandoned and obliterated. Industrial Drive, which is known internally at MDOT as Connector 34, is a new connector between the two highways that was assumed into the state trunkline system at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In {{southeast}} Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike {{crosses the}} county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the north-northeast. It then meets SH-51, {{followed by the}} Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through {{the third and final}} barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> I-44/US-412 interchange, which straddles the Wagoner–Rogers County county line. The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.|$|E

5|$|Laid down {{nearly four}} years after Vittorio Veneto and Littorio, Roma was able to {{incorporate}} a few design improvements. Her bow was noticeably redesigned to give Roma additional freeboard; partway into construction, it was modified {{on the basis of}} experience with Vittorio Veneto so that it had had a finer <b>end</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> waterline. She was also equipped with thirty-two rather than twenty-four /65 caliber Breda guns.|$|E
5|$|M-79 {{was formed}} as a state {{trunkline}} by July 1, 1919 along part of its present routing. At the time, it ran between Hastings and Nashville as it does today. From Nashville, the trunkline turned south and west to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> contemporary M-17 in Battle Creek. By 1927, the southernmost section of M-79 was truncated when M-78 was extended to Battle Creek. In late 1930, the southernmost section was shortened once again as a new M-14 designation replaced M-79 south of Nashville. An eastward extension of M-79 {{at the same time}} carries the highway designation to Vermontville.|$|E
