40|$|SUMMARY Blood 5 -hydroxytryptamine {{levels were}} reduced during {{migraine}} attacks {{in patients who}} had not taken any drugs but the aggregation responses to 5 -hydroxytryptamine of the blood platelets from these patients were similar to responses of platelets from migrainous subjects between attacks. This confirms earlier findings that a permanent difference exists in the behaviour of platelets from migrainous subjects. Blood 5 -hydroxytryptamine levels were reduced during migraine attacks in patients who had taken ergotamine. The aggregation responses of platelets taken from migrainous patients on ergotamine both during and between attacks were inhibited, which is in agreement with results previously found for aggregation responses following the in vitro pre-incubation of control platelets with ergotamine. Blood 5 -hydroxytryptamine levels were maintained during migraine attacks in patients who had taken analgesics {{and there was no}} reduction in the aggregation responses of their platelets. Blood was taken from migrainous patients during acute migraine headache for estimation of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and platelet aggregation studies. Results obtained for patients who had not taken drugs were compared with those for patients who had taken ergotamine or analgesics. Platelet aggregation responses to 5 -HT de-pend on the availability of 5 -HT uptake sites on the platelet membrane (Baumgartner and Born, 1968). When the uptake site is empty, aggrega-tion can occur but if the uptake site is already occupied by a 5 -HT molecule, aggregation can-not take place. A difference has already been noted between the aggregation responses to 5 -HT of platelets from migrainous patients without headache and those of normal control subjects (Hilton and Cumings, 1971). It was anticipated that a further difference might occur during migraine headache, since plasma 5 -HT falls during a migraine attack (Curran, Hinterberger, and Lance, 1965) and in control subjects the platelet aggregation response to 5 -HT is inversely proportional to the blood 5 -HT content (<b>Hilto...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The type of {{work they}} do means that they require a [...] "slip-clutch" [...] which engages when the drill bit jams and {{sufficient}} torque is put onto the [...] "slip-clutch" [...] mechanism. [...] This stops the violent wrenching motion that a drill without a clutch would cause when stopped suddenly from full speed, protecting the drill from damage. [...] The slip-clutch also protects the operator, but does not always prevent injury. [...] Some manufacturers have introduced additional technology to protect the operator. [...] <b>Hilti</b> has a technology called [...] "ATC" [...] or [...] "Active Torque Control" [...] which works by disengaging the drive from the motor when the tool body begins to rotate excessively through the action of a secondary magnetic clutch {{in addition to the}} standard slip-clutch. [...] DeWALT has a related system called [...] "CTC" [...] or [...] "Complete Torque Control" [...] which utilizes a two-position slip-clutch so that the operator can select the lower torque setting for greater safety.|$|E
2500|$|The north face, {{before it}} was climbed in 1931, {{was one of the}} last great big wall {{problems}} in the Alps. To succeed on the north face, good climbing and ice-climbing technique and route-finding ability were required. Unexpectedly it was first climbed by the brothers Franz and Toni Schmid on July 31–August 1, 1931. They reached the summit at the end of the second day, after a night of bivouac. Because they had kept their plans secret, their ascent was a complete surprise. In addition, the two brothers had travelled by bicycle from Munich and after their successful ascent they cycled back home again. The first winter ascent of the north face was made by <b>Hilti</b> von Allmen and Paul Etter on February 3–4, 1962. Its first solo ascent was made in five hours by Dieter Marchart on July 22, 1959. Walter Bonatti climbed the [...] "North Face Direct" [...] solo on February 18–22, 1965. The same year, Yvette Vaucher became the first woman to climb the north face. Bonatti's direct route was not repeated solo until 29 years later, in winter 1994 by Catherine Destivelle.|$|E
