5|$|The {{numbering}} of {{the movements}} shown here is {{in accordance with}} the Novello vocal score (1959), edited by Watkins Shaw, which adapts the numbering earlier devised by Ebenezer Prout. Other editions count the movements slightly differently; the Bärenreiter edition of 1965, for example, does not number all the recitatives and runs from 1 to 47. The division into parts and scenes is based on the 1743 word-book prepared for the first London performance. The scene <b>headings</b> are given as Burrows summarised the scene <b>headings</b> by Jennens.|$|E
5|$|Illegality {{is one of}} {{the three}} broad <b>headings</b> of {{judicial}} review of administrative action in Singapore, the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety. To avoid acting illegally, an administrative body or public authority must correctly understand the law regulating its power to act and to make decisions, and give effect to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{report writer}} is a {{declarative}} facility for creating reports. The programmer need only specify the report layout {{and the data}} required to produce it, freeing them from having to write code to handle things like page breaks, data formatting, and <b>headings</b> and footings.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} August 1994, after a tender had been won by Scandinavian Rock Group (SRG), a {{collaboration}} between Målselv Anlegg, Nor Entreprenør and Peab. The original contract price was NOK 541 million. An average of 388 man-years were expended during construction, and the work involved the removal of 1.62 million tonnes of rock. There were three excavation points (<b>headings),</b> located at Bryn, Starveien on the Oslo–Lørenskog border, and at Stalsberg, outside Lillestrøm.|$|E
5|$|It {{is carried}} out in the manner of an {{informal}} enquiry, using a combination of open and closed questions, supplemented by structured tests to assess cognition. The MSE can also be considered part of the comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in a cursory and abbreviated way in non-mental-health settings. Information is usually recorded as free-form text using the standard <b>headings,</b> but brief MSE checklists are available for use in emergency situations, for example by paramedics or emergency department staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{headpieces}} are decorated, with <b>headings</b> {{written in}} gold and red; in some places nicely decorated initial letters can be found (in red or gold). The Ammonian sections are written in red. The pages are numbered; the Greek quire numbers are still found at the top right of some pages. At the top left of {{the first page of}} most quires in Gospel of Matthew, Arabic quire numbers are found.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge and in Staten Island on July 19. <b>Headings</b> were dug and tunneling shafts were sunk at 68th Street and Shore Road in Brooklyn (the Shore Road Shaft), and underneath the Saint George Terminal in Staten Island (the South Street Shaft), costing a total of $1 million. In addition, {{in preparation for the}} tunnel, the SIRT purchased one hundred ME-1 subway cars built to BMT specifications and electrified its three-passenger branches. The impending completion of the tunnel also sparked real estate interests in Staten Island.|$|E
5|$|Monotype {{licensed}} {{and released}} the font Centaur {{around the same}} time as Bembo. It was drawn by the American book designer Bruce Rogers. Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo, the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 (the so-called Venetian style). Like Bembo, its italic (by Frederic Warde) comes from the 1520s, being again loosely {{based on the work of}} Arrighi from around 1520. Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure, something particularly true in its digital facsimile. Penguin often used it for <b>headings</b> and titles of 'classic' editions, particularly its capitals and italic; its lower-case does not so effectively harmonise with Bembo due to the different letter shapes such as the tilted 'e'.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} topics covered by Banglapedia {{includes}} political geography, religion, literature, art and architecture, folk practices and institutions, indigenous and colonial administration, politics, society, economy, ethnicity, and the sciences. All 64 districts of Bangladesh, as well as 451 upazilas, have been described in details ranging from topographical accounts {{to the number of}} dairy farms and hatcheries. Over 2,000 single- and four-colour illustrations depict Bangladeshi art and architecture, everyday life, cities and villages and personages. It has about 2,100 cross-references, cartographic information, tables and statistics. It is laid out in alphabetical order and is prefaced by an essay by the Chief Editor. There is a section explaining how to use the Banglapedia, which clarifies issues such as date systems, contributors, cross references, and <b>headings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Way {{moved to}} Washington, D.C., in 1949, {{where she went}} to work for the National Bureau of Standards. Four years later, she persuaded the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council to {{establish}} the Nuclear Data Project (NDP), an organization with special responsibility for gathering and disseminating nuclear data, under her leadership. The NDP moved to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1964, but Way remained its head until 1968. Beginning in 1964, the NDP published a journal, Nuclear Data Sheets, to disseminate the information that the NDP had gathered. This was joined the following year by a second journal, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables. She also persuaded the editors of Nuclear Physics to add keywords to the subject <b>headings</b> of articles to facilitate cross-referencing.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary annals {{began to}} be kept in Wessex during the 7th century. The {{material}} compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, South Saxon, Mercian and, particularly, West Saxon history, but, {{with the exception of the}} Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until it comes to the Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards. The Chronicle grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year <b>headings.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1949 the Railway Executive {{decided on}} {{standard}} types of signs {{to be used}} at all stations. Lettering was to use the Gill Sans typeface on a background of the regional colour. Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, very often in capitals-only settings for signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its manual {{for the use of}} signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has described it as a key element of the 'Modernist classical' style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of <b>headings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significant that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter <b>headings</b> that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E
5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the <b>headings</b> of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E
25|$|The column <b>headings</b> (i.e. yaku, ika, etc.) in bold denote pronouns in the absolutive case {{while the}} row <b>headings</b> (i.e. ku, mu, etc.) denote pronouns in the ergative case.|$|E

25|$|So far, these fonts {{have been}} used as design accents on signs or <b>headings,</b> rather than for {{typesetting}} large volumes of body text.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} the 11th edition criticised the lack of {{pagination}} and therefore of an index, {{as well as the}} lack of page <b>headings</b> indicating families.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to using authorized <b>headings</b> {{is the idea}} of access control, where various forms of a name are related without the endorsement of one particular form.|$|E
25|$|R. A. Lafferty was {{strongly}} inspired by El Castillo Interior {{when he wrote}} his novel Fourth Mansions. Quotations from St. Teresa's work are frequently used as chapter <b>headings.</b>|$|E
25|$|New {{paragraphs}} start after {{chapter and}} section <b>headings.</b> Within each section, however, paragraph breaks are {{indicated by the}} traditional Chinese pilcrow, a thin, sans-serif circle {{about the size of}} a Chinese character.|$|E
25|$|From this textual evolution, {{it appears}} that Newton wanted by the later <b>headings</b> 'Rules' and 'Phenomena' to clarify for his readers {{his view of the}} roles to be played by these various statements.|$|E
25|$|Each chapter {{concentrates}} on the third person limited {{point of view of}} a single character; the book presents the perspective of eight main characters. Additionally, a minor character provides the prologue. Chapter <b>headings</b> indicate the perspective.|$|E
25|$|The novel's neo-Victorian setting, {{as well as}} its {{narrative}} form, {{particularly the}} chapter <b>headings,</b> suggest a relation to the work of Charles Dickens. The protagonist's name points directly to Little Nell from Dickens' 1840 novel The Old Curiosity Shop.|$|E
25|$|The League of American Bicyclists has {{designated}} {{a set of}} five criteria for evaluating the friendliness of a town or city to bicycles. These criteria are classified under the <b>headings</b> of: Engineering, Encouragement, Evaluation and Planning, Education, Enforcement.|$|E
25|$|Between 1900 and 1902, with Linotype {{managers}} Arthur Pollen and William Henry Lock, Barr {{also designed}} pantographs {{operating on a}} very different scale, calculating aim for naval artillery based on the positions, <b>headings,</b> and speeds of the firing ship and its target.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps less {{productive}} was {{his work}} on physical anthropology, a topic which fascinated the Victorians. Huxley classified the human races into nine categories, and discussed them under four <b>headings</b> as: Australoid, Negroid, Xanthocroic and Mongoloid types. Such classifications depended mainly on appearance and anatomical characteristics.|$|E
