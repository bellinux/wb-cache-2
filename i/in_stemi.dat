50|$|Anticoagulants {{in acute}} {{coronary}} syndrome are targeted against the coronary blood clot, as well as towards prevention of thrombotic complications, like formation of blood clots in the ventricles, stroke, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. Patients undergoing PCI also need an anticoagulant to prevent catheter thrombosis. Options include unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin), fondaparinux (a pentasaccharide antagonist of factor Xa) and bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor); all the above agents are given parenterally (subcutaneously or intravenously). Unfractionated heparin has the disadvantage of requiring dose adjustment based on a laboratory exam, {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT). <b>In</b> <b>STEMI</b> patients choice depends on the reperfusion strategy used (see below); bivalirudin is used when PCI is employed only, while in the same case fondaparinux is not preferred. Similarly, in Non-STE ACS bivalirudin too is only used when an early invasive strategy is chosen.|$|E
50|$|If PCI {{cannot be}} {{performed}} within 90 to 120 minutes <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> then fibrinolysis, preferably within 30 minutes of arrival to hospital, is recommended. If {{a person has}} had symptoms for 12 to 24 hours evidence for effectiveness of thrombolysis is less {{and if they have}} had symptoms for more than 24 hours it is not recommended. Thrombolysis involves the administration of medication that activates the enzymes that normally dissolve blood clots. These medications include tissue plasminogen activator, reteplase, streptokinase, and tenecteplase. Thrombolysis is not recommended in a number of situations, particularly when associated with a high risk of bleeding or the potential for problematic bleeding, such as active bleeding, past strokes or bleeds into the brain, or severe hypertension. Situations in which thrombolysis may be considered, but with caution, include recent surgery, use of anticoagulants, pregnancy, and proclivity to bleeding. Major risks of thrombolysis are major bleeding and intracranial bleeding. Pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces time to thrombolytic treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries, however it is unclear whether this has an impact on mortality rates.|$|E

The prevalence of CTO in a non-IRA was studied {{and its impact on}} long-term mortality <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> patients with DM was investigated. Methods Between 1997 and 2007 4506 patients with STEMI were admitted and treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with DM were identified. The patients were categorised as having single vessel disease (SVD), MVD without CTO and CTO based on the angiogram before PCI. Results A total of 539 patients (12 %) had DM. MVD with or without a CTO was present in 33 % of non-diabetic patients and in 51 % of diabetic patients. The prevalence of a CTO in a non-IRA was 21 % <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> patients with DM and 12 % <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> patients without DM (p < 0. 01).

Despite {{restoration of}} epicardial flow during primary PCI <b>in</b> <b>STEMI,</b> microvascular obstruction may persist {{as a result of}} both atheromatous and thrombotic embolization and vasospasm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{be fully}} {{activated}} platelets {{are dependent on}} two positive feedback loops; the formation of thromboxane A 2 by cyclooxygenase in the platelets {{and the release of}} ADP. We wanted to evaluate the effect of aspirin on platelet function in patients with acute coronary syndromes and we hypothesized that increased levels of ADP in patients with acute coronary syndromes could contribute to aspirin resistance. METHODS: Platelet activity in 135 patients admitted for chest pain was assessed with PFA- 100. An epinephrine-collagen cartridge (EPI-COLL) was used for the detection of aspirin resistance together with an ADP-collagen cartridge (ADP-COLL). ADP was measured with hplc from antecubital vein samples. Three subgroups were compared: chest pain with no sign of cardiac disease (NCD), NonST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and STEMI. RESULTS: Platelet activation was increased for the STEMI group compared NCD. Aspirin resistance defined as < 193 sec in EPI-COLL was 9. 7 % in NCD, and increased to 26. 0 % (n. s.) in NSTEMI and 83. 3 % (p < 0. 001) <b>in</b> <b>STEMI.</b> Chronic aspirin treatment significantly reduced platelet aggregation in NCD and NSTEMI, but it had no effect <b>in</b> <b>STEMI.</b> Plasma levels of ADP were markedly increased <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> (905 +/- 721 nmol/l, p < 0. 01), but not in NSTEMI (317 +/- 245), compared to NCD (334 +/- 271, mean +/- SD).

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{evaluated}} the potential association between plasma high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) levels and outcome {{in patients with}} ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention. BackgroundThe positive effect of reperfusion after STEMI may be compromised by ischemic/reperfusion injury. HMGB 1 is released by necrotic cells and, in pre-clinical studies, has been implicated {{to play a role}} in myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury. MethodsThe study included 141 STEMI patients, with acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Plasma HMGB 1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay at admission. Forty-two healthy individuals served as control subjects. ResultsAfter a median of 10 months of follow-up, 13 STEMI patients died. There were no significant differences with regard to baseline variables between the group of patients who survived and those who died. Baseline HMGB 1 levels were increased <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> patients when compared with control subjects. Furthermore, the STEMI patients who died had higher HMGB 1 levels than those who survived. After adjusting for age, sex, troponin I, and creatine kinase-myocardial band, we found that a doubling of HMGB 1 concentrations increased the risk of mortality by 75 % (hazard ratio: 1. 75; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1 to 2. 8). ConclusionsPlasma HMGB 1 levels are elevated <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> patients compared with healthy control subjects. Furthermore, after a follow-up period of 10 months, plasma HMGB 1 levels are shown to be independently associated with increased mortality <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> patients treated with PCI. These data suggest that plasma HMGB 1 may be used as a new prognostic biomarker <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> patients...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Naturally-occurring {{regulatory}} T cells (Treg) {{constitute a}} mature T-cell population characterized phenotypically by co-expression of CD 4 and CD 25 (high) surface molecules. We investigated here {{the frequency of}} circulating Treg in patients presenting with <b>STEMI</b> <b>in</b> comparison with subjects without coronary artery disease (CAD). The effect of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with implantation of a bare (BS) or paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) on peripheral Treg distribution was also examined. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 30 consecutive patients presenting with STEMI and from 30 age-matched control subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Treg were detected by flow cytometry according to their characteristic CD 4 + CD 25 (high) membrane phenotype, and their frequency was assessed before PCI and at 48 h and at 6 days after PCI. CD 27 expression identifying a highly suppressive Treg subset was also analysed. RESULTS: The percentages of both (CD 27 +) Treg and (CD 27 -) Treg were significantly lower <b>in</b> patients with <b>STEMI</b> <b>in</b> comparison with controls. In addition, the (CD 27 +) Treg/(CD 27 -) Treg ratio was skewed toward the CD 27 - population. The frequency of both Treg subsets significantly increased 48 h after either BS or PES implantation, remaining elevated for up to at least 6 days after PCI. CONCLUSIONS: Our {{data suggest that the}} percentage of circulating Treg is significantly reduced <b>in</b> patients with <b>STEMI,</b> suggesting that this immunosuppressive T-cell subset is compartmentalized within the acutely ischemic myocardium to limit the ongoing inflammation associated with this condition, and that coronary revascularization is associated with partial reconstitution of peripheral Treg pool...|$|R
