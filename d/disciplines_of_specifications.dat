Currently, RESOLVE programs are written in an imperative style for which a sound and relatively complete proof system has been defined.

40|$|While the <b>discipline</b> <b>of</b> {{interface}} <b>specification</b> {{and design}} has received substantial {{attention in the}} existing body of academic and professional literature, {{there has been little}} research conducted into the <b>specification</b> and design <b>of</b> interfaces that allow users to interact with systems in a secure manner. As the awareness of security issues increases amongst the general user community, together with an apparently ever increasing {{growth in the number of}} information systems security breaches, the <b>specification</b> and design <b>of</b> “secure interfaces ” will become a critical development consideration. This research aims to determine how the specification and design principles identified in the extant body of literature, might be fused with the development practices currently employed within two focus organisations (case study organisations), to synthesise and partially validate a set of interface specification/design guidelines for use when developing interfaces with the ability to raise the security awareness of users. 1...|$|R

The goal of paper is to establish influence of morphological characteristics on situation- motorical abilities of water polo players in early selection period. 85 water polo players, aged 12 - 13, at least 2 years sport experience are investigated. 12 -tests battery is used for morphological characteristics estimation, 6 -tests battery for space situation-motorical and swim abilities. Results are processed by canonical correlation analysis. Results of this research will be significant in candidate selection for water polo and training process improvement...|$|R
40|$|Information Systems (IS), as an {{academic}} discipline, has grown from its early days as data processing {{to where we are}} now, recognized as a true academic discipline, with graduates assuming positions as systems analysts, project managers, applications developers, web designers and more. Business cannot live without quality information. Quality information systems have become the lifeblood that sustains business; but, information systems projects became notorious for being late, over budget and not delivering what was originally promised or worse yet, having no idea about {{the true nature of the}} system requirements at all. A major step to remedying this was the promulgation of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which assessed how effectively software development groups were performing. Recently, Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI) was advanced by Carnegie Mellon as the extension of the CMM concepts to organizations. This panel will explore the combining <b>of</b> academic <b>discipline</b> <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> IS 2002 with the controlled and measured approaches of the CMMI to effectively monitor and deal with IS curriculum change and quality enhancement...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} specification refinement in {{the setting}} of polymorphic type theory and a complementary logic for relational parametricity. The starting point is the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> abstract data types as done in the <b>discipline</b> <b>of</b> algebraic <b>specification.</b> Here, algebras are seen to match the standard notion of data type, i. e., a data representation together with operations on that data representation. An abstract data type is then a collection of data types sharing some well-defined abstract properties. In algebraic specification, these properties are specified algebraically by axioms in some suitable logic. Specification refinement then encompasses the idea that high-level specifications may be stepwise refined to executable programs that satisfy the initial specification; all in the framework of formal language and logic. This makes certain aspects of program development amenable to formal, computer-aided proofs of correctness. On the other hand, the <b>discipline</b> <b>of</b> type theory, lambda calculus, and its semantics is the prime field for research on programming languages. This framework is capable of characterising essentially any existing sequential programming-language feature, also advanced features such as recursive types, polymorphism and class-based object orientation. Furthermore, type theory provides a powerful framework for mechanised reasoning. This thesis is a contribution to lifting the idea <b>of</b> algebraic <b>specification</b> refinement into the more powerful domain of type theory and lambda calculus, thus giving the opportunity to expand in a sensible way a traditionally first order and functional framework to a wider range of programming aspects. We take a particular account <b>of</b> <b>specification</b> refinement and express it in a type-theoretic setting consisting of the polymorphic lambda calculus and a logic for relational parametricity. Key elements <b>of</b> algebraic <b>specification</b> are internalised in the syntax, e. g., data types viz. algebras are inhabitants of existential type, the latter providing essential data abstraction. For data types with only first-order operations, this setting automatically resolves certain issues <b>of</b> <b>specification</b> refinement, such as observational equivalence, stability and input sorts. After establishing a correspondence at first order, thus implanting the idea <b>of</b> algebraic <b>specification</b> refinement into the type-theoretic setting, the scene is set for lifting the idea <b>of</b> algebraic <b>specification</b> refinement to any number of programming features. In this thesis we focus on the generalisations to higher-order functions and to polymorphism. A simulation relation between two data types is a relation between their data representations that is preserved by their respective sets of operations. Using simulation relations is a classical way of explaining data refinement and observational equivalence. This combines with specification refinement to form specification refinement up to observational equivalence. With higher-order operations, however, we encounter in the logic a phenomenon related to what happens on the semantic level, i. e., the standard notion of refinement relation in the form of logical relations does not compose and the correspondence with observational equivalence is lost. In the logic {{it turns out that the}} standard notion of simulation relation fails to take into account a certain aspect of the abstraction barrier provided by existential types. We remedy this by proposing an alternative notion of simulation relation that observes this abstraction barrier more closely. We do this in two related ways; one relates to syntactic models while the other relates to a non-syntactic PER-model more apt for interpretive investigations. In algebraic specification, there is a universal proof method for specification refinement up to observational equivalence. This method can be imported soundly into the type-theoretic setting by asserting certain axioms. At first order, showing soundness for these axioms is straight-forward w. r. t. the standard parametric PER model for the logic. At higher order there are two problems. First, these axioms seemingly do not hold in the standard model. Secondly, the axioms speak in terms of simulation relations. At higher order, it is pertinent to have versions of the axioms featuring the abstraction barrier-observing simulation relations above, and to prove soundness for these poses an additional challenge. We show that the pure higher-order aspect of this problem can be solved by giving a setoid-based semantics. For the remaining task, we continue working from the observation that standard definitions do not observe abstraction barriers closely enough. Hence, we propose an alternative interpretation into the PER-model for data types that captures the abstraction barrier provided by existential types. The main contribution of this thesis is thus in generalising a prominent account <b>of</b> <b>specification</b> refinement to higher order and polymorphism via type theory incorporating relational parametricity. We also shed light on short-comings in the logic, as well as in the standard semantics, regarding the abstraction barrier provided by existential types. Two central contributions, namely abstraction barrier-observing simulation relations and abstraction barrier-observing semantics for data types, are the result of observing these short-comings. Finally, the work in this thesis also lays a foundation on which to adapt specification refinement to an object-oriented setting, because the theoretical concepts underlying object orientation can be seen as extensions of those for abstract data types...|$|R
