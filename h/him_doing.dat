5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, {{who writes}} a popular {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who {{wants to build a}} Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to <b>him,</b> <b>doing</b> and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E

500|$|For The King of Fighters XIII, K's {{design was}} crafted {{so that he}} had a [...] "cool" [...] appearance.
