50|$|Construction of the {{lighthouse}} began in 1905, using the Carl Leick design also {{seen in the}} second Ediz Hook lighthouse and Oregon's Cape Arago lighthouse. It was built of wood, while most other lighthouses of the era were constructed using brick and concrete. The lighthouse became operational in 1906, using a revolving Fresnel lens. In 1927, the original lens was replaced with the fixed (non-rotating) fourth-order Fresnel lens which is still in use. The lighthouse and a modern fog signal were automated in 1979, and in 1981, a remote <b>fog</b> <b>sensor</b> was installed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{research}} of remote sensing for precision farming applications, the data quality of the aerial hyperspectral imaging system suffers from geometric distortions. Some of the distortions are caused by aircraft attitude change during the current pushbroom type image scanning. These distortions must be corrected before image data can be geo-referenced and used for field pattern identifications. Development of methods and algorithms for the correction {{of this type of}} remote sensing data distortion is the objective of this study. Three different approaches, namely manual correction, sensor augmentation, and image processing were developed. A Fiber Optic Gyroscope (<b>FOG)</b> attitude <b>sensor</b> was used on board the airplane to measure the real-time image sensor attitude, a polynomial interpolation algorithm was developed, and a reference straight feature was segmented based on the selected training dataset. The performance of all three methods was evaluated and compared.

40|$|AbstractThrough {{communication}} between vehicles and infrastructure, vehicles can receive real-time warnings on incidents and dangerous situations, and can send own sensor data and observed incident information to other road users. Information between vehicles and infrastructures can be exchanged either using ITS-G 5 or cellular communications.

A hardware-in-the-loop driving simulator has been utilized to test the transmission of vehicle data. Performance measurements of the {{communication between}} vehicles and infrastructure have been made for both ITS-G 5 and LTE. LTE and the future 5 G will provide lower latency, and hence may become the preferred solution especially for road side unit to vehicle communications. Providing seamless connectivity between different network technologies, a mobile IP based solution is utilized with Quality-of-Service (QoS) assisted handovers. Real-time QoS measurements with fast handovers enable the system to react rapidly to changing circumstances.

A common approach to overcome individual sensor drawbacks is the employment of data fusion techniques (Bar-Shalom, 2001).

Moreover, next generation sensors should be able to dynamically adopt to new situations and should have the ability to work in cooperative sensor environments.

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) marks a phase {{transition}} {{in the evolution}} of the Internet, distinguished by a massive connectivity and the interaction with the physical world. The organic evolution of IoT requires the consideration of three dimensions: scale, organization, and context. These dimensions are particularly relevant in Ultra Large Scale Systems (ULSS), of which autonomous vehicles is a prime example. Fog Computing is well positioned to support contextual awareness and communication, critical for ULSS. The design and orchestration of ULSS require fresh approaches, new organizing principles. A recent paper proposed Hierarchical Emergent Behaviors (HEB), an architecture that builds on established concepts of emergent behaviors and hierarchical decomposition and organization. HEB’s local rules induce emergent behaviors, i. e., useful behaviors not explicitly programmed. In this chapter we take a first step to validate HEB concepts through the study of two basic self-driven car “primitives”: exiting a platoon formation, and maneuvering in anticipation of obstacles beyond the range of on-board <b>sensors.</b> <b>Fog</b> nodes provide the critical contextual information required.

40|$|SUMMARY An {{atmospheric}} visibility measurement system capable of quantifying {{the most common}} operating range of onboard exteroceptive sensors is a key parameter {{in the creation of}} driving assistance systems. This information is then utilized to adapt sensor operations and processing or to alert the driver that the onboard assistance system is momentarily inoperative. Moreover, a system capable of either detecting the presence of fog or estimating visibility distances constitutes in itself a driving aid. In this paper, we rst present a review of di erent optical sensors likely to measure the visibility distance. We then present our stereovision based technique to estimate what we call the "mobilized visibility distance". This is the distance to the most distant object on the road surface having a contrast above 5 %. In fact, this de nition is very close to the de nition of the meteorological visibility distance proposed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The method combines the computation of both a depth map of the vehicle environment using the "v-disparity " approach and of local contrasts above 5 %. Both methods are described separately. Then, their combination is detailed. A qualitative evaluation is done using di erent video sequences. Finally, a static quantitative evaluation is also performed thanks to reference targets installed on a dedicated test site. key words: meteorological visibility, <b>fog,</b> contrast, stereovision, <b>sensor,</b> driving assistance, intelligent transportation systems...|$|R
