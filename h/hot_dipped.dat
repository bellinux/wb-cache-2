40|$|Zinc has {{traditionally}} been the metallic material most widely used to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion due to its ability to afford cathodic protection to steel in all types of natural atmospheres. In recent decades, aluminium and zinc/aluminium alloy coatings have been used instead of zinc in certain atmospheric applications. Although these coatings present some advantages over zinc, they {{are not able to}} cathodically protect steel substrates in all types of natural atmospheres. The present paper assesses the cathodic protection afforded by Al (flame spraying), Al/ 13 Si (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> 55 Al/Zn (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn/ 15 Al (flame spraying), Zn/ 5 Al (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn (<b>hot</b> <b>dipping),</b> Zn (discontinuous <b>hot</b> <b>dipping)</b> and Zn (electroplating).

The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> process is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|R

This type of steel has found application in high temperature, oxidizing and corrosive environments. In addition, aluminized steel is more cost effective than stainless steels. The objective {{of the current study}} is to study effect of temperature on the thicknesses and phase morphology of the coating and intermetallic layer that is formed during hot-dip aluminizing of steel at a constant immersion time of 30 minutes. 1040 steel substrates were aluminized by hot-dipping procedure in pure aluminium and in three different Al-Si alloy melts of varying composition. Hot-dipping was done at three different temperatures mainly at 933, 973 and 1023 K. The steel specimens were held in the melts for 30 minutes after which they were withdrawn from the molten aluminium and allowed to cool to room temperature. The coated samples were then sectioned for metallographic sample preparation. The samples were characterized for thickness of the coating and intermetallic phase thickness and phase composition of both the coating and intermetallic layers. The samples were analyzed by optical light microscope, SEM, EPMA, XRD and micro hardness.

40|$|The {{physical}} metallurgy and related process and product performance concepts for the zinc and zinc alloy <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coating of steel wire are briefly reviewed, and are illustrated with a detailed model of aluminum behavior in Galfan ® process technology. Applications to <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> bath management practices are set forth. Background The coating {{of iron and}} steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. <b>Hot</b> <b>dip</b> practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas electrogalvanizing involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of <b>hot</b> <b>dip)</b> processes precede the coating step. Moreover, <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the bath. Modern, in depth presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating. Although traditional galvanized coatings with small (0. 1 %) aluminum compositions are the most popular, the most rapidly growing <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> coating is made with the Galfan ® process, wherein a Zn- 5 % Al coating is applied by <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> (all composition data in this paper are in % by weight).

However, an alternative use of this process might be to improve specific properties.

A possible and alternative route to realize this is by the application of an Al-Si-rich coating on the steel substrate using a hot dipping process, followed by a diffusion annealing treatment in order to distribute the Al/Si more evenly in the steel.
