50|$|Aside {{from the}} Chevrolet Suburban and its GMC/Cadillac {{counterparts}} and the International Harvester Travelall, the Ford Excursion is among {{one of the}} only regular-production sport-utility vehicles produced with four full-length passenger doors (shared with the Super <b>Duty</b> <b>Crew</b> Cab). As with the Expedition, the Excursion received an eggcrate in place of the gray grille seen on its F-Series counterpart. In place of a liftgate, the cargo door of the Excursion was designed with a 3-way door: an upper liftgate paired with two dutch doors (similar to later models of the Chevrolet Astro). In one change from the F-Series, Ford added the larger taillights of the E-Series van to the Excursion.|$|E

50|$|The {{island is}} {{extremely}} isolated and Coast Guardsmen stationed {{on the island}} served one-year tours that were later modified to allow an R&R visit to mainland Japan at the six-month point. At {{the end of this}} isolated tour of <b>duty</b> <b>crew</b> members received an additional 30 days of compensatory leave. While under U.S. administration, on Thursdays a C-130 Hercules from the 345th Tactical Airlift Squadron, Yokota Air Base, Japan, would resupply the island on weekly missions. Often Coast Guardsmen would judge landings by raising placards with large numbers. An unusually long four-hour ground time was scheduled to allow technicians who flew in to perform maintenance on the transmitter and to offload extra fuel from the C-130 to power the island's generator. It also allowed the Coast Guardsmen to read and answer letters while aircrews would snorkel and collect green glass fishing buoys that wash up on the shore. It takes about 45 minutes to walk around the island.|$|E
50|$|Once underway, Moore had his off <b>duty</b> <b>crew</b> awakened and briefed {{and ordered}} the 20 {{lifeboats}} aboard uncovered. He had ropes and ladders readied, lifebelts prepared and posted extra lookouts to aid avoiding the icebergs reported in the area. Initial progress was good but after finding his ship coming upon a large ice field at around 3:00 a.m., the ship slowed until becoming increasingly surrounded by pack ice. Around this time, Mount Temple encountered a single funnel steamer, which went unidentified and caused the ship to take evasive action. At that point, Moore sighted green lights and bright decklights approaching at around 3:20 a.m. This would later prove to be flares fired from Titanics lifeboats and rockets from the , steaming up from the south east. With the amount of ice becoming ever greater, Mount Temple heaved to around 14 miles short of the wreck site. At first light at 5:30 a.m., Moore ordered the ship to resume course at low speed, navigating the ice floe. Once clear, Moore and his crew proceeded to the last known position of Titanic, but found no traces or wreckage. Later on using dead reckoning, he calculated that the given position was incorrect, with the actual location around 8 miles further east.|$|E
40|$|Addressing the Crew Scheduling Problem (CSP) in {{transportation}} {{systems can be}} too complex to capture all details. The designed models usually ignore or simplify features which are difficult to formulate. This paper proposes an alternative formulation using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach to the problem. The optimisation model integrates the two phases of pairing generation and pairing optimisation by simultaneously sequencing trips into feasible duties and minimising total elapsed time of any <b>duty.</b> <b>Crew</b> scheduling constraints in which the crew {{have to return to}} their home depot {{at the end of the}} shift are included in the model. The flexibility of this model comes in the inclusion of the time interval of relief opportunities, allowing the crew to be relieved during a finite time interval. This will enhance the robustness of the schedule and provide a better representation of real-world conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} branch-and-price {{algorithm}} {{to solve the}} integrated multidepot vehicle and crew scheduling problem. An integer mathematical formulation that combines a multicommodity network flow model with a set partionning model is presented. We solve the corresponding linear relaxation using a column generation scheme. Two branching strategies are tested over benchmark instances available in the Internet. Computational results show the effectiveness of our approach. 1. The Integrated Vehicle and Crew Scheduling Problem The vehicle and the crew scheduling problems are important combinatorial optimization problems that arise in the planning process of mass transit companies. Usually, vehicles are scheduled before the crews. During the vehicle scheduling process one has to optimally link timetabled trips producing vehicle blocks, so that each vehicle block forms a feasible schedule for a vehicle. If vehicles are located at different depots, one has to simultaneously construct the vehicle blocks and assign them to the depots. Then, the problem is NP-Hard. On the crew scheduling problem one has {{to ensure that a}} set of crews covers the set of vehicle blocks at minimum cost. Each vehicle block is split into pieces of work, sequences of timetabled trips and deadhead trips, where a change of driver is not allowed. A <b>crew</b> <b>duty</b> is a combination of pieces of work that respects several constraints such as maximum and minimum spread, maximum working time without a break, break duration and a maximum number of changeovers. The vehicle blocks characteristics influence the resulting <b>crew</b> <b>duties</b> and the <b>crew</b> <b>duty</b> set may lead to changes on the original vehicle blocks...|$|R
