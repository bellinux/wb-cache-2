25|$|However, {{the area}} is under {{pressure}} as its mountainous isolated location has attracted illegal loggers, drug traffickers, and kidnappers; the most serious problem is <b>illegal</b> <b>building</b> of homes and communities on conservation land, mostly by very poor people. , the government recognizes the existence of 191 of the settlements, which cause severe ecological damage with the disappearance of trees, advance of urban sprawl, and in some areas, the digging of septic pits. The borough is {{home to one of}} the oldest Mesoamerican sites in the valley, Cuicuilco, as well as several major parks and ecological reserves. It is also home to a number of semi-independent “pueblos” that have limited self-rule rights under a legal provision known as “usos y costumbres” (lit. uses and customs).|$|E
25|$|The post-war period saw a huge {{building}} boom in Palermo. Allied bombing in World War II had left more than 14,000 people homeless, and migrants were pouring {{in from the}} countryside, {{so there was a}} huge demand for new homes. Much of this construction was subsidized by public money. In 1956, two Mafia-connected officials, Vito Ciancimino and Salvatore Lima, took control of Palermo's Office of Public Works. Between 1959 and 1963, about 80 percent of building permits were given to just five people, none of whom represented major construction firms and were probably Mafia frontmen. Construction companies unconnected with the Mafia were forced to pay protection money. Many buildings were illegally constructed before the city's planning was finalized. Mafiosi scared off anyone who dared to question the <b>illegal</b> <b>building.</b> The result of this unregulated building was the demolition of many historic buildings and the erection of apartment blocks, many of which were not up to standard.|$|E

25|$|In Tlalpan, {{settlements}} are in Ajusco Medio, Pedregales and Padierna, {{where the}} mountainous terrain and/or volcanic rock severely limits {{the ability to}} provide services, often leading to residents creating septic pits. Since 2003, illegal settlements in Tlalpan have grown from 148(peligra), to 191 settlements that the government recognizes the existence of. Many settlements have occurred because communal owners of ejidos have illegally sold parts of their land at cheap prices to settlers {{on the outskirts of}} the city proper. Most <b>illegal</b> <b>building</b> is done by the very poor but there are also cases in which those which money illegally take over large sections of land for their own use. Illegal settlements have been made by individual families but increasingly developers are working to build illegal settlements in protected areas as well, by buying land and creating subdivisions with services, hoping to fix things with authorities later. In the early 2000s, the borough conducted over 125 operations to evict illegal settlements, dismantling over 440 housing units, but since 2005, the borough no longer has the authority to do this. Many of these illegal settlements seek and then get court orders prohibiting their removal and demanding services, first potable water then drainage.|$|E
2500|$|The Cerro de la Estrella National Park was {{established}} in 1938 and {{is considered to be}} the most important natural area in the eastern part [...] of the Valley of Mexico. The park covers over [...] and {{was established}} for recreational and cultural purposes. The hill (cerro) was the site of the Aztec New Fire ceremony, last performed in 1507. The park is also culturally important due to the annual Passion Play which is partially conducted on the summit of the cerro each year. The area is managed by the Secretaría de Agricultura y Recursos Hidráulicos, but it lost its original forest cover due to over-cutting of trees. The ecosystem now on the site consists only of planted eucalyptus and Pinus patula trees, along with insects and rodents. There are also problems with <b>illegal</b> <b>building</b> and farming in areas.|$|E
2500|$|Iztapalapa {{and most}} of {{the east side of the}} Federal District was {{historically}} rural and poor up until the mid-20th century. Large-scale urbanization and industrialization began in the 1950s, along with high rates of migration into the borough in the 1970s. Today, it has high population density, limited infrastructure and high levels of socio [...] economic marginalization. [...] Social problems include homelessness, unregulated street vending, <b>illegal</b> <b>building</b> and crimes associated with the sex trade. [...] Many live in rundown housing with deficient municipal services. The exception to this are the areas that border the boroughs of Benito Juárez, Coyoacán and Iztacalco. [...] As of 2010, about 30% of the borough’s buildings still have damage from the 1985 earthquake. Most are located in the Peñon Viejo, Ermita Zaragoza, Santa Martha Acatitla, Santa Cruz Meyehualco, El Molino,San Lorenzo and La Hera areas, with about 150,000 damaged homes. Over 95% of the homes in the borough have electricity, running water and sewerage, and the borough provides sufficient educational services and other services such as sports facilities; however, the high population density means that the five or less percent equals a large number of people without sufficient services.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, Xochimilco {{lost control}} of most of its water supply, taken by the city for its needs. [...] The urban sprawl of Mexico City reached Xochimilco in the mid 20th century and it still affects the borough today. In the 1970s, the federal {{government}} began to replace the lost supply to the canals with treated water from the nearby Cerro de la Estrella. This is most of the water that now flows in the canals. The treated water is clear, but not potable due to bacteria and heavy metals. However, {{it is used to}} irrigate crops grown on the chinampas, even though the canals are further polluted by untreated sewerage and garbage. The biggest threat to the canals and their ecosystem is uncontrolled sprawl, mostly due to <b>illegal</b> <b>building</b> on conservation land. These settlements are polluting canals with untreated garbage and waste, and filling in canals to make “new land.” There are thirty one illegal settlements in the historic center, with 2,700 constructions. Ten of these are in the chinampas of San Gregorio Atlapulco, San Luis Tlaxialtemalco, Santa Cruz Acalpixca and Santa María Nativitas. [...] The borough and UNESCO are at odds over {{what to do about the}} 450 hectares of illegal settlements. UNESCO demands their eviction, but the borough says this would be too difficult and better to legalize the settlements, putting efforts into preventing more.|$|E

50|$|Illegal {{construction}} or building is construction work (or {{the result of}} such) without a valid construction permit. Besides the potential technical hazards on uncontrolled construction sites and in finished buildings, <b>illegal</b> <b>building</b> activity can be a major environmental violation when the works encroach upon preserve areas like nature reserves. Likewise, <b>illegal</b> <b>building</b> can have serious political implications when it is practiced as landgrabbing or for illegal settling in foreign territories (see e.g. International law and Israeli settlements).|$|E
50|$|Sanitation is poor {{owing to}} the {{shortage}} of safe water, due to burst pipes. Piped water rarely reaches the highest floors of apartment buildings. In most of the <b>illegal</b> <b>buildings</b> there is no water supply at all. The sewers in Stolipinovo are mostly dysfunctional and overflowing, forming puddles in the streets. <b>Illegal</b> <b>buildings</b> are not connected at all. Household waste is typically hurled from windows and balconies of apartments onto heaps on the ground below.|$|R

50|$|<b>Illegal</b> <b>building</b> {{can be the}} {{consequence}} {{of a combination of}} urbanization, overpopulation, homelessness and poverty in which case expanding slums, Shanty towns or similar will result. On the other hand, <b>illegal</b> <b>building</b> activity may be due to profitable speculation with and exploitation of valuable real property. Demand for mass tourism accommodation (hotels, etc.) as well as its counterpart, individualistic luxury retreats for the very rich are visible drivers of such speculation. Similar motivation may come from incentives connected with the illegal construction of great shopping malls or similar on greenfield land.|$|E
