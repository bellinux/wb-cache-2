5|$|Youngs's {{career was}} {{abruptly}} cut short in 1926, {{when he was}} diagnosed with the kidney disorder that, at the time, was called Bright's disease. He had been exposed to streptococcal infection in 1924. Too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> play after August 10, 1926, Youngs returned home on McGraw's insistence and received a blood transfusion in March 1927.|$|E
5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> {{return to}} school, but by early 1985 {{he began to}} feel better. His mother asked if he could return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E

5|$|Allen had {{initially}} intended to study {{to become a}} minister, but after his father became too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> work, he instead went into teaching. He {{became a member of}} Fruitful Vale All-Age's teaching staff at age 17. Two years later, and following the death of his father, Allen went to Moneague Teachers' College to receive formal training in teaching. He became a teacher at an All-Age school in Saint Mary Parish after graduation.

5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; {{he was almost}} too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> participate in the battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, {{and not in the}} respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.|$|E
5|$|Hasekura {{was baptized}} on 17 February by the king's {{personal}} chaplain, and renamed Felipe Francisco Hasekura. The baptism ceremony {{was to have}} been conducted by the Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, though he was too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> actually carry this out, and the Duke of Lerma – the main administrator of Phillip III's rule and the de facto ruler of Spain – was designated as Hasekura's godfather.|$|E

5|$|In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was <b>ill,</b> <b>to</b> hospital, {{where he}} died; he was succeeded as ANCYL {{president}} {{by the more}} moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. Mandela disagreed with Mda's approach, and in December 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL, considering their ideology un-African. In 1947, Mandela {{was elected to the}} executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. When Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela {{was one of those who}} forced his resignation.|$|E
5|$|In March and April 1706, George {{was seriously}} ill. There was {{blood in his}} sputum, {{but he seemed to}} recover, {{although}} he was too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral in June for a British victory in the Battle of Ramillies. He missed another thanksgiving service in May 1707, to celebrate the union of England and Scotland, as he was recuperating at Hampton Court.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to avoid future lengthy elections, Gregory X {{introduced}} stringent rules with the 1274 promulgation of Ubi periculum. Cardinals were to be secluded in a closed area and not accorded individual rooms. No cardinal was allowed, unless <b>ill,</b> <b>to</b> be attended by more than two servants. Food was supplied through a window to avoid outside contact. After three days of the conclave, the cardinals were to receive only one dish a day; after another five days, they were to receive just bread and water. During the conclave, no cardinal was to receive any ecclesiastical revenue.|$|E

25|$|Many of Bad Religion's {{songs are}} about {{different}} social ills, although they {{try not to}} ascribe the causes of these <b>ills</b> <b>to</b> any single person or group. Greg Graffin believes that the current political situation in the United States can {{make it difficult to}} voice these concerns, as he doesn't want to feed the polarization of viewpoints.|$|R
5000|$|He {{attributed}} much of society's <b>ills</b> <b>to</b> concupiscence {{which he}} described as inordinate desire for pleasure, the inordinate desire for possessions, and the inordinate desire to rule or to domineer over others. Pius proclaimed that true peace can only be found under the Kingship of Christ as [...] "Prince of Peace", and exhorted bishops to strive for its realization.|$|R
5|$|St. Clair {{continued}} his preparations for invading the northwest {{despite the fact}} that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{searches}} {{while in}} orbit of Angel One. Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) relieves Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) of duty {{after he and}} most of the crew have fallen <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> a random virus on board, that gives the sense of an odd smell to its victims at the time of infection. The Captain leaves Lieutenant Geordi La Forge (Levar Burton) in command (Geordi's first time in Acting Command of a Starship). Shortly after, they find Ramsey and transmit his location to the Away Team, who beam directly to there.|$|E
5|$|The Robins {{released}} Bancroft {{after the}} 1929 season, and {{he returned to}} the Giants as assistant manager and coach, serving under McGraw. He ended his MLB playing career in 1930. He remained as a coach, filling in for McGraw when he was too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> manage. During the 1930 offseason, he led a team of MLB players on an exhibition trip to Cuba. When McGraw retired in 1932, the Giants appointed Bill Terry as player-manager. Surprised and disappointed that Terry was chosen over him, Bancroft left the Giants.|$|E

60|$|Bonnet's {{vessel was}} named the Revenge, which was about as <b>ill</b> suited <b>to</b> the vessel as her {{commander}} was <b>ill</b> fitted <b>to</b> sail her, for Bonnet had nobody to revenge himself upon unless, indeed, it were his scolding wife. But a good many pirate ships were then called the Revenge, and Bonnet was bound to follow the fashion, whatever it might be.|$|R
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} {{around a large}} and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, and the land falls away toward the river <b>Ill.</b> <b>To</b> compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E
5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been too <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than {{everyone else in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Hasan's {{relationship}} with Kartini is souring; both are suspicious {{that the other}} is unfaithful. Eventually, Hasan sees Kartini and Anwar leaving a hotel near the train station and incorrectly assumes {{that she had been}} cheating on him. He immediately divorces her and moves out, but soon contracts tuberculosis. After several weeks, Hasan returns to Panyeredan after hearing that his father is <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> work out their issues. However, his father rejects him as a temptation from the devil. Dejected, Hasan returns to Bandung.|$|E
