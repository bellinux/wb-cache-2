5000|$|In Fundamental {{limitations}} on plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium, Todd Rider {{argues that a}} quasineutral <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasma</b> will lose energy due to Bremsstrahlung at a rate prohibitive for any fuel other than D-T (or possibly D-D or D-He3). This paper is not applicable to IEC fusion, as a quasineutral plasma cannot be contained by an electric field, which is a fundamental part of IEC fusion. However, in an earlier paper, [...] "A general critique of inertial-electrostatic confinement fusion systems", Rider addresses the common IEC devices directly, including the fusor. In {{the case of the}} fusor the electrons are generally separated from the mass of the fuel isolated near the electrodes, which limits the loss rate. However, Rider demonstrates that practical fusors operate in a range of modes that either lead to significant electron mixing and losses, or alternately lower power densities. This appears to be a sort of catch-22 that limits the output of any fusor-like system.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{dispersion}} {{has emerged}} as an extremely important concept in modeling metamaterials, including macro-, micro-, and nano-structured composites. However, the incorporation of spatial dispersion requires a considerable complication of the usual Ohm's law relationship with which students are familiar. In this note, the drift-diffusion equation is shown to be equivalent to the usual form of spatial dispersion in simple <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasmas</b> and metamaterials. It is suggested that the drift diffusion equation is physically clear and intuitive, and, therefore, can be effectively used to help teach concepts of spatial dispersion to beginning graduate students.

40|$|I {{discuss the}} physics of non-Abelian plasmas which are locally {{anisotropic}} in momentum space. Such momentum-space anisotropies are generated by the rapid longitudinal expansion of the matter created in the first 1 fm/c of an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision. In contrast to locally <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasmas</b> anisotropic plasmas have a spectrum of soft unstable modes which are characterized by exponential growth of transverse chromo-magnetic/-electric fields at short times. This instability is the QCD analogue of the Weibel instability of QED. Parametrically the chromo-Weibel instability provides the fastest method for generation of soft background fields and dominates the short-time dynamics of the system. The existence of the chromo-Weibel instability has been proven using diagrammatic methods, transport theory, and numerical solution of classical Yang-Mills fields.
