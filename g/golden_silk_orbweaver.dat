40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the use of colored cocoon silkworm, <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk,</b> as a host for the fruiting body production of Cordyceps mushroom. <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk</b> variety had a shorter larval period than Yangwonjam at 25. 3 oC and 78. 5 % RH: The average larval period of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk</b> was 24 days and 7 hr, and that of the Yang-wonjam was 24 days and 15 hr. In the infection test of I. tenuipes on silkworm, the larval period of normal silk-worms was longer than the silkworms inoculated with I. tenuipes in both <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk</b> and Yangwonjam. The pupae survival percentage of <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk</b> was 94. 4 %, whereas it was 91. 9 % in Yangwonjam. <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk</b> had a higher pupation rate than Yangwonjam. The pupa-tion rate of normal silkworms was about 5 % higher than that of silkworms inoculated with I. tenuipes. Infection rate of I. tenuipes into larvae of 5 th instar newly exuviated silkworm was 93. 8 % in <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk,</b> and 96. 9 % in Yangwonjam. Synnemata production of I. tenuipes was better in Yangwonjam with an incidence rate of 99. 8 % than <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk</b> with 98. 6 %. The aver-age synnemata weight of <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk</b> was 1. 12 g and that of Yangwonjam 1. 29 g. <b>Golden</b> <b>Silk</b> had a lower synnemata weight than Yangwonjam. But no significant difference was observed in synnemata weight varieties. The synnemata of I. tenuipes produced on pupae were white or milky-white in color, and similar in shape and color to wild synnemata collected in Korea...|$|R

50|$|The {{members of}} this tribe wear the ‘klut’ (a {{distinct}} headgear) and the ‘shala'i’ (a black shawl), which was wrapped around the headgear in a specific way. And they wore shoes stitched with <b>golden</b> <b>silk</b> on their feet, which had been the attribute for royal ancestry.

25|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>silk</b> {{orb weaver}} targets many {{different}} organisms as prey, ranging from small flies and beetles to larger cicadas and locusts. As {{a result of}} their strong web structure small birds and bats can also become trapped and fed upon. Whilst most of the captured prey is relatively small compared to Nephila sp the majority of biomass consumed comes from larger more rare prey. Prey larger than 66% of the captors size accounts for just 16.5% of prey captured but 85% of prey consumed, indicating the spider is selective in its feeding habits.|$|R

One species, N. clavipes, {{occurs in the}} United States of America, where it ranges throughout the coastal southeast and inland, from North Carolina to Texas. Spiderlings can be carried by the wind over long distances, and each year, {{a small number of}} golden orb web spiders are found in New Zealand (where they are not endemic) after having been blown across the Tasman Sea; the spiders usually end up in the North Island.|$|R

50|$|The venom of the <b>golden</b> <b>silk</b> orb-weaver is potent but not lethal to humans. It has a {{neurotoxic}} effect {{similar to that}} of the black widow spider; however, its venom is not nearly as powerful. The bite causes local pain, redness, and blisters that normally disappear within a 24-hour period. In rare cases, it might trigger allergic reactions and result in respiratory troubles (in asthmatics) or fast-acting involuntary muscle cramps. As the genus possesses relatively strong chelicerae, the bite could leave a scar on hard tissue (such as fingers).|$|R
5000|$|Mongolarachne jurassica is an extinct spider {{placed in}} the {{monotypic}} family Mongolarachnidae. [...] The species was originally described as Nephila jurassica and {{placed in the}} living genus Nephila which contains the <b>golden</b> <b>silk</b> orb-weavers. Subsequently it was determined to be stem-orbicularian, i.e. a relative of the group Orbiculariae, which contains the family Nephilidae, but also several other families, such as Theridiidae, Theridiosomatidae or Uloboridae. The species is known only from the Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation, part of the Daohugou Beds, near the village of Daohugou in Ningcheng County, northeastern China.|$|R

25|$|Nephila produce large {{asymmetric}} orb webs {{up to one}} and a half {{meters in}} diameter. The hub of the web is not positioned centrally but rather in the upper section; this means {{that the majority of the}} sticky capture strands are found in the lower section of the web.Nephila species remain in their webs permanently and therefore have a higher predation risk. There is a barrier web structure on either side of the main web to mitigate this risk. The <b>golden</b> <b>silk</b> orb weaver is named for the yellow color of the spider silk used to construct these webs.|$|R
