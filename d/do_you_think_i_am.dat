500|$|Batman subdues the Joker {{and tells}} him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and {{suggests}} that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across!" [...] Batman chuckles at the punch line, and the two old foes laugh as the police arrive.|$|E

Later in the show, comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman.
