60|$|This letter put Miss Mackenzie into a twitter. Like {{all other}} single ladies, {{she was very}} nervous about her money. She was quite alive to {{the beauty of a}} high rate of interest, but did not quite {{understand}} that high interest and impaired security should go <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>together.</b> She wished to oblige her brother, and was aware that she had money as to which her lawyers were looking out for an investment. Even this had made her unhappy, as she was not quite sure whether her lawyers would not spend the money. She knew that lone women were terribly robbed sometimes, and had almost resolved upon insisting that the money should be put into the Three per Cents. But she had gone to work with figures, and having ascertained that by doing so twenty-five pounds a year would be docked off from her computed income, she had given no such order. She now again went to work with her figures, and found that if the loan were accomplished it would add twenty-five pounds a year to her computed income. Mortgages, she knew, were good things, strong and firm, based upon landed security, and very respectable. So she wrote to her lawyers, saying that she would be glad to oblige her brother if there were nothing amiss. Her lawyers wrote back, advising her to refer Mr Rubb, junior, to them. On the day named in her brother's letter, Mr Samuel Rubb, junior, arrived at Littlebath, and called upon Miss Mackenzie in the Paragon.|$|E

60|$|Sixth. The grace, and Spirit {{of grace}} of God, is called or {{compared}} to a river, to answer those unsatiable desires, and to wash away those mountainous doubts that attend those that indeed do thirst for that drink. The man that thirsteth with spiritual thirst, fears {{nothing more than that}} there is not enough to quench his thirst. All the promises and sayings of God's ministers to such a man seem but as thimbles instead of bowls (Psa 63:1, 143:6). I mean so long as his thirst and doubts walk <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>together.</b> There is not enough in this promise; I find not enough in that promise to quench the drought of my thirsting soul. He that thirsteth aright, nothing but God can quench his thirst. 'My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God' (Psa 42:2, 63:1, 143:6). Well, what shall be done for this man? Will his God humour him, and answer his desires? Mark what follows: 'When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none,' (and they can find none, when all the promises seem to be dry, and like clouds that return after the rain), 'and their tongue faileth for thirst, I, the Lord, will hear them.' Aye, but Lord, what wilt thou do to quench their thirst? 'I will open rivers,' saith he, 'in high places, and fountains {{in the midst of the}} valleys. I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water' (Isa 41:17,18). Behold! here are rivers and fountains, a pool, and springs, and all to quench the thirst of them that thirst for God.|$|E
60|$|Through all {{the ways}} of our unintelligible world the trivial and the terrible walk <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>together.</b> The irony of {{circumstances}} holds no mortal catastrophe in respect. When I reached the church, the trampled condition of the burial-ground was the only serious trace left to tell of the fire and the death. A rough hoarding of boards had been knocked up before the vestry doorway. Rude caricatures were scrawled on it already, and the village children were fighting and shouting for the possession of the best peep-hole to see through. On the spot where I had heard the cry for help from the burning room, on {{the spot where the}} panic-stricken servant had dropped on his knees, a fussy flock of poultry was now scrambling for the first choice of worms after the rain; and on the ground at my feet, where the door and its dreadful burden had been laid, a workman's dinner was waiting for him, tied up in a yellow basin, and his faithful cur in charge was yelping at me for coming near the food. The old clerk, looking idly at the slow commencement of the repairs, had only one interest that he could talk about now--the interest of escaping all blame for his own part on account of the accident that had happened. One of the village women, whose white wild face I remembered the picture of terror when we pulled down the beam, was giggling with another woman, the picture of inanity, over an old washing-tub. There is nothing serious in mortality! Solomon in all his glory was Solomon with the elements of the contemptible lurking in every fold of his robes and in every corner of his palace.|$|E

We shall have to sell all the land, which Father, for a whole life, has been getting together, again, and that, I am sure, would be the death of him. What am I to do? Farmer Dobson, were I to marry him, has promised to keep our heads above water; and the man has doubtless a good heart, and a true and lasting love for me: yet--though I can be sorry for him--as the good Sally says, 'I can't abide him'--almost brutal, and matched with my Harold is like a hedge thistle by a garden rose. But then, he, too--will he ever be of one faith with his wife? which is my dream of a true marriage. Can I fancy him {{kneeling}} with me, and uttering the same prayer; standing up side by side with me, and singing the same hymn? I fear not. Have I done wisely, then, in accepting him? But may not a girl's love-dream have too much romance in it to be realised all at once, or altogether, or anywhere but in Heaven?

40|$|The Feature Co-occurrence Constraint theory {{proposed}} in this dissertation {{provides a means}} to capture {{the development of the}} language-learning child's segment inventory.

The Feature Co-occurrence Constraint theory builds on a minimal view of phonology, where the inventory is seen as epiphenomenal rather than a mentally ‘real’ object, features are few and monovalent, and the constraint set is limited to no more than two types. The theoretical consequences of the proposal for both feature theory and constraint theory are worked out in detail and a thorough discussion of phonological acquisition is provided, making this book of interest to both theoretical phonologists as acquisitionists...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prediction of {{biological}} behavior in patients {{of prostate cancer}} (CaP) is a major challenge as current parameters only partially meet the need for prognostication. p 53 as a prognostic indicator has been studied in several human cancers, including breast, lung, and colorectal carcinoma. However, its significance as a predictive biomarker for CaP is less well-studied. Materials and Methods: This study included 125 cases of CaP, 27 cases of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 25 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical assessment for p 53 nuclear protein was performed. Assessment for apoptotic index and DNA ploidy status by flow cytometry were also done. Results: p 53 immunoreactivity was low in organ confined CaP cases having Gleason score ≤ 3 (P < 0. 003). More hormone resistant cases 37 (83 %) were aneuploid when compared with hormone sensitive cases 26 (33 %) (P < 0. 005). 93 % of p 53 positive cases {{and none of the}} p 53 negative patient were aneuploid suggesting a significant relation between p 53 immunoreactivity and aneuploidy. p 53 positivity and DNA aneuploidy, independently, were also predictors of progression and relapse. Conclusion: DNA ploidy and p 53 positivity go <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> and <b>together</b> yield additional prognostic information in CaP. p 53 positivity is possibly a late event in carcinogenesis in CaP and a marker of change in biological behavior of CaP...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} these days that {{knowledge}} of different forms of motivation and its implementation in the work environment {{is a prerequisite for}} improving the quality of work results and subsequent achievement of organizational goals. Every head teacher meets this phenomenon. A lack of motivation is behind a number of unfulfilled tasks, unwillingness to look for efficient work practices, absence, disloyalty to their own society, refusing overtime, not accepting necessary changes, ignoring requests for assistance, and more. It is not easy {{to find a way to}} solve these problems. However, theory and practice go <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> and <b>together</b> it creates the perfect symbiosis which looks at the ailments mentioned and gradually finds answers. Where to start in order to be successful in this quest? We should first recognize the meaning and importance of motivation in the work process. The role of the head teacher is to know teachers to have a positive impact on their behaviour and entrust them with such tasks corresponding to their knowledge and skills. Work motivation is focused on carrying out a work obligation and should lead to the required working behaviour. Motivation to work is also connected to the work environment and climate in which teachers work. In general, we can say that teachers’ satisfaction at work determines their personal relationships outside the workplace as well...|$|R

I will believe no man who tells me that he would sooner earn one dollar a day than two--and if two, then two hundred. That is, in {{the very nature of the}} argument, caeteris paribus. When a man tells me that he would prefer one honest loaf to two that are dishonest, I will, in all possible cases, believe him. So also a man may prefer one quiet loaf to two that are unquiet.

[...] I am, as now too late I find, The greatest cully of mankind; The lowest boy in Martin's school May turn and wind me like a fool. How could I form so wild a vision, To seek, in deserts, Fields Elysian? To live in fear, suspicion, variance, With thieves, fanatics, and barbarians? [...] But here my lady will object; Your deanship ought to recollect, That, near the knight of Gosford[1] placed, Whom you allow a man of taste, Your intervals of time to spend With so conversable a friend, It would not signify a pin Whatever climate you were in. [...] 'Tis true, but what advantage comes To me from all a usurer's plums; Though I should see him twice a-day, And am his neighbour 'cross the way: If all my rhetoric must fail To strike him for a pot of ale? [...] Thus, when the learned and the wise Conceal their talents from our eyes, And from deserving friends withhold Their gifts, as misers do their gold; Their knowledge to themselves confined Is the same avarice of mind; Nor makes their conversation better, Than if they never knew a letter. Such is the fate of Gosford's knight, Who keeps his wisdom out of sight; Whose uncommunicative heart Will scarce one precious word impart: Still rapt in speculations deep, His outward senses fast asleep; Who, while I talk, a song will hum, Or with his fingers beat the drum; Beyond the skies transports his mind, And leaves a lifeless corpse behind. [...] But, as for me, who ne'er could clamber high, To understand Malebranche or Cambray; Who send my mind (as I believe) less Than others do, on errands sleeveless; Can listen to a tale humdrum, And with attention read Tom Thumb; My spirits with my body progging, Both <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>together</b> jogging; Sunk over head and ears in matter. Nor can of metaphysics smatter; Am more diverted with a quibble Than dream of words intelligible; And think all notions too abstracted Are like the ravings of a crackt head; What intercourse of minds can be Betwixt the knight sublime and me, If when I talk, as talk I must, It is but prating to a bust? [...] Where friendship is by Fate design'd, It forms a union in the mind: But here I differ from the knight In every point, like black and white: For none can say that ever yet We both in one opinion met: Not in philosophy, or ale; In state affairs, or planting kale; In rhetoric, or picking straws; In roasting larks, or making laws; In public schemes, or catching flies; In parliaments, or pudding pies. [...] The neighbours wonder why the knight Should in a country life delight, Who not one pleasure entertains To cheer the solitary scenes: His guests are few, his visits rare; Nor uses time, nor time will spare; Nor rides, nor walks, nor hunts, nor fowls, Nor plays at cards, or dice, or bowls; But seated in an easy-chair, Despises exercise and air. His rural walks he ne'er adorns; Here poor Pomona sits on thorns: And there neglected Flora settles Her bum upon a bed of nettles. Those thankless and officious cares I used to take in friends' affairs, From which I never could refrain, And have been often chid in vain; From these I am recover'd quite, At least in what regards the knight. Preserve his health, his store increase; May nothing interrupt his peace! But now let all his tenants round First milk his cows, and after, pound; Let every cottager conspire To cut his hedges down for fire; The naughty boys about the village His crabs and sloes may freely pillage; He still may keep a pack of knaves To spoil his work, and work by halves; His meadows may be dug by swine, It shall be no concern of mine; For why should I continue still To serve a friend against his will? ...|$|E

40|$|Leaders’ {{strategic}} thinking, {{or mental}} processes, are the cognitive foundation of business innovation. Business innovation {{is a difficult}} endeavor. For leaders, the path from strategic thinking to effective innovation is complex and full of obstacles. ‘Strategic thinking research’ investigates cognitive factors that foster innovation, focusing mainly on leaders’ deductive or inductive reasoning and their rational choices. However, leaders’ rationality is bounded and their strategic thinking {{is a mix of}} rationality and insight. Therefore, strategic thinking research should investigate both the rationality and intuition that can support business innovation. Given this, the study proposes a theoretical model describing strategic thinking that draws on Peirce’s theory of abduction. Leaders’ strategic thinking is shown to be similar to the cognitive process of hypothesis formation, and to follow both logical rules and intuitive insights. The proposed model provides guidelines that allow rationality and intuition to go <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> and thus <b>together</b> support the real-world processes of leaders’ strategizing. The proposed model is tested by employing the semi-standardized laddering technique on a sample of strategic leaders of service companies...|$|R

To avoid the rapid decrease of nuclear power production at a time where the missing production cannot be covered by other low carbon generation means plant lifetime extensions has to continue as planned by the utilities and more new plants need to be constructed. For keeping nuclear power at that current level and assuming a construction time of 5 to 6 years, utilities' financial decisions and government' approval need to be made frequently from the year 2011 on forward.

40|$|The 1852 Democratic victory {{under the}} {{standard}} of Franklin Pierce is foreseen as a debacle for the Whig party, led by Winfield Scott. Pierce (center) sits on his horse, holding aloft a banner bearing his and running mate William R. King's names. His troops rally around him [...] the party rank and file. Scott's forces are in chaos, routed into Salt River, the figurative stream of political disaster. Holding aloft a shredded banner, Scott (center) rides into the water with supporter William Seward holding tight to his horse's neck. Scott says, "Just as I expected, we relied too much on fuss and smoke, and have lost the battle, yet bravely <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>together,</b> Seaward (Seward) we go, my Friend, my Brother. " To the left, a uniformed man, either William R. King or Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, boots Whig incumbent president Millard Fillmore into the river, saying, "I like consistency & have ever been {{in favor of the}} improvement of Rivers and Harbours. Slide in!" Fillmore laments, "I dont know why they kick me. I'm sure I'm nobody!" In the lower left corner, the feet of abolitionist editor Horace Greeley protrude from the water. In the center, Lewis Cass fires a pistol at Daniel Webster, whose rump, labeled "Chowder" for his New England background, is just disappearing into the water. "Ah what glorious sport," cries Cass, taunting Webster about his diplomatic record, "how now Webster! backing down on guano. fishing for Cod! eh! feel dry! take mine warm. want any powder, give you some ball!" A man to the right of Cass prods at a floating body with a bayonet. Another man, further right, has just forced an unidentified Whig into the water, saying, "There's nothing like water to wash out Stains!" The comic characterizations and style of draftsmanship are unquestionably John L. Magee's, comparing closely with signed works such as "The Game Cock and the Goose" and "A Magnificent Offer to a Magnificent Officer" (nos. 1852 - 18 and 1852 - 27). Drawn by John L. Magee.
