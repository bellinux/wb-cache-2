5000|$|An {{alternative}} assignment {{determines the}} centre of the Land Hemisphere to be at [...] (in île <b>Dumet</b> near Saint-Nazaire, France) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dumet</b> is most {{commonly}} used in seals where lead-in wires pass through the glass bulb wall of standard household electric lamps (light bulbs) among other things.|$|E
50|$|As copper bonds {{well to the}} glass, it {{is often}} used for {{combined}} glass-metal devices. The ductility of copper {{can be used for}} compensation of the thermal expansion mismatch in e.g. the knife-edge seals. For wire feed throughs, <b>dumet</b> wire - nickel-iron alloy plated with copper - is frequently used. Its maximum diameter is however limited to about 0.5 mm due to its thermal expansion.|$|E
50|$|This island, 800 m {{wide and}} 2,500 long, {{stretches}} over two square kilometers. It {{is located in}} the heart of Mor braz, in the Atlantic Ocean, off the south coast of Brittany (Rhuys and Quiberon peninsulas), 13 km east of Belle-Île and 5 km South-east of Houat. It is part of a line of granite crests which also includes the peninsula of Croisic, <b>Dumet</b> Island, Houat, Quiberon and Groix.|$|E
50|$|New fortifications {{were also}} begun in a zone from the Glénan {{archipelago}} {{in the west}} to île <b>Dumet</b> in the east. At the latter a circular battery and barracks were built between 1756 and 1758. On the Quiberon peninsula a new fort was completed in 1760, barring entry at Penthièvre. The fortifications of Houat and Hoëdic were rebuilt between 1757 and 1759 and fort Cigogne was built on the Glénan archipelago in 1755.|$|E
5000|$|The two Fernico alloys both {{consist of}} iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co). Fernico is used at high {{temperatures}} (20 to 800°C) and {{is identical to}} Kovar. Fernico II is used at cryogenic temperatures in the -80 [...]. -180°C range. Both are used to create electrically conductive paths through the walls of sealed borosilicate glass containers. <b>Dumet</b> is used for a similar purpose, but is tailored for seals through soda lime and lead alkali silicate glasses.|$|E
5000|$|FerNiCo I has {{the same}} linear {{coefficient}} of expansion as certain types of borosilicate ("hard" [...] glass), (c6.5 × 10−6°K−1, thus serving as an ideal material for the lead-out wires or other seal structures in light bulbs and thermionic valves. <b>Dumet</b> is also used for this purpose, but for passing through softer soda-lime and lead-alkali glasses. This wire is often coated with a glass-like film of sodium metaborate, (...) , so the molten glass will [...] "wet" [...] and adhere to it. 25% by mass of the finished wire is copper. Cunife exhibits a similar property.|$|E
5000|$|Fernico {{describe}} {{a family of}} metal alloys made primarily of iron, nickel and cobalt. The family includes Kovar, FerNiCo I, FerNiCo II, and <b>Dumet.</b> The name {{is made up of}} the chemical symbols of its constituent three elements. [...] "Dumet" [...] is a portmanteau of [...] "dual" [...] and [...] "metal," [...] because it is a heterogeneous alloy, usually fabricated {{in the form of a}} wire with an alloy core and a copper cladding. These alloys possess the properties of electrical conductivity, minimal oxidation and formation of porous surfaces at working temperatures of glass and thermal coefficients of expansion which match glass closely. These requirements allow the alloys to be used in glass seals, such that the seal does not crack, fracture or leak with changes in temperature.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911 the Dumet-wire seal {{was invented}} {{which is still}} the common {{practice}} to seal copper leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as borating the copper helps prevents over-oxidation when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass-to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel. [...] The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low compression stress. It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why <b>Dumet</b> is only useful for wire diameters lower than about 0.5 mm. In a typical <b>Dumet</b> seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper do not seal vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper.|$|E

The electronic systems must be upgraded to increase confidence level required in production. The Weld Quality Monitor has been used with a recent model solid state power supply to evaluate ability to differentiate between sound and defective weld joints. The Weld Quality Monitor has been evaluated on <b>Dumet</b> and Kovar to interconnect materials Nickel and Alloy 180 in weld joints used on microelectronic module fabrication. Distinct separation was achieved between low strength welds and sound welds by the Quality Monitor. Evaluation performed indicates a drift level at less than 2 percent on a series of 50 consecutive welds. Operation under shop conditions identified need for controlled electrode impact. This was achieved with pneumatic actuation...|$|E
