5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more <b>firmly</b> <b>and</b> has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of this engagement, the trapped Pompée and Hannibal were under heavy fire from the {{anchored}} Formidable {{and an array of}} Spanish batteries and gunboats, both ships taking severe damage without being able to effectively reply as their main broadsides now faced away from the enemy. On Hannibal the situation seemed hopeless: as casualties mounted, the main and mizen masts were shot away and the ship remained <b>firmly</b> <b>and</b> irretrievably grounded. Pompée was in a slightly better position: Sterling's rigging was in tatters, but his masts held and his ship was at least afloat, although totally becalmed. At one stage, Pompées colours were shot away, leading to French claims that the ship had surrendered, although they were quickly replaced. At 11:30, no longer able to contribute to the battle with rigging torn and more than 70 casualties, Saumarez ordered the remainder of the squadron to send their remaining boats to tow Pompée out of danger, the boats coming under heavy fire as they did so, with a number sunk.|$|E

He exacted tribute from {{the king of}} Travancore, suppressed two troublesome chieftains and married the daughter of the Pandya king resulting in the Pandya country being held more <b>firmly</b> <b>and</b> directly by the representatives of the Vijayanagar Empire.|$|E
25|$|Clipless pedals are bicycle pedals {{that require}} a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a {{mechanism}} in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal.

The clipless pedal was invented in 1895 by Charles Hanson of Peace Dale, Rhode Island.|$|E
25|$|Yuan Shao, using a {{great deal}} less than his main strength, {{attacked}} Yu Jin's position at Yan Ford in a probing action. Yu Jin held his ground <b>firmly</b> <b>and</b> Yuan Shao could not take him, thus {{the possibility of a}} rear attack of Xu City was thrashed. To follow up, Yu Jin joined up with Yue Jin and raided Yuan Shao's detached encampments along the Yellow River southwest from Yan Ford with 5,000 infantry and cavalry. They raided up as far as Ji (汲; 25 li southwest of present-day Weihui, Henan), and crossed the river to raid Huojia (獲嘉; southeast of present-day Huojia, Henan) to the north. In all, they had set fire to some 30 enemy camps, decapitated several thousand heads, captured several thousand men alive, and forced the surrender of some 20 generals including He Mao (何茂) and Wang Mo (王摩).|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{reasoning}} that the expedition {{of the previous}} year may have made his plans for Greece obvious, and weakened the resolve of the Greek cities, Darius turned to diplomacy in 491 BC. He sent ambassadors to all the Greek city states, asking for [...] "earth and water", a traditional token of submission. The vast majority of cities did as asked, fearing the wrath of Darius. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well. This <b>firmly</b> <b>and</b> finally drew the battle-lines for the coming conflict; Sparta and Athens, despite their recent enmity, would together fight the Persians.|$|E
500|$|Interpreting this Constitutional {{prescription}} led to {{the question}} of whether the actual office of president devolved upon Vice President Tyler, or merely its powers and duties. The Cabinet met within an hour of Harrison's death and, according to a later account, determined that Tyler would be [...] "Vice-President acting President". However, Tyler <b>firmly</b> <b>and</b> decisively asserted that the Constitution gave him full and unqualified powers of office and had himself sworn in immediately as President, setting a critical precedent for an orderly transfer of power following a President's death. The presidential oath was administered by Judge William Cranch in Tyler's hotel room. He considered the oath redundant to his oath as vice president, but wished to quell any doubt over his accession.|$|E

[...] Jet magazine commented that although the Jackson family's musical legacy had given her an opportunity to tap into an international audience, Control was the turning point at which [...] "her career took off and she became a bona fide superstar.

500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and <b>firmly</b> <b>and</b> unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Crowther places Trial by Jury at {{the centre}} of Gilbert's {{development}} as a librettist. [...] He notes that in some of Gilbert's early libretti, such as Topsyturveydom (1874), the songs simply emphasise the dialogue. [...] In others, such as Thespis (1871), some songs are relatively disconnected from both the story and characterisation, such as [...] "I once knew a chap" [...] or [...] "Little maid of Arcadee", which simply convey a moral lesson. [...] In Trial by Jury, however, each song carries the plot forward and adds depth to the characters. [...] In addition, unlike some of Gilbert's more fantastical early plots, [...] "Aside from the ending, nothing essentially improbable happens." [...] Gänzl agrees, writing that [...] "Gilbert's libretto was superior to any of his previous efforts. [...] It was concise, modern and satirical without being impossibly whimsical. [...] Having no spoken dialogue it was perforce tightly constructed and allowed of no interpolation or alteration." [...] Sullivan's development as a comic opera writer, too, would mature with Trial by Jury. [...] Except for incidental music for productions of Shakespeare, he had not written any music for the stage since Thespis. [...] Gänzl wrote that Trial by Jury [...] "brought Sullivan <b>firmly</b> <b>and</b> finally {{into the world of}} the musical" [...] stage and confirmed, after his previous success with Cox and Box and Thespis, that [...] "Sullivan was a composer of light lyric and comic music who could rival Offenbach, Lecocq and any English musician alive." ...|$|E
