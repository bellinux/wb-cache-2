Indeed the acquisition and inter-cell exchange of such information can be significant overheads in a practical deployment. Random beamforming requires substantially less channel state information than linear zero forcing strategies to schedule transmissions. It is therefore of practical interest despite some limitations in controlling intra-cell interference. We consider how one can use a minimal exchange of information, in a multi-cell multistep pattern of exchanges, to improve the overall performance of random beamforming in a multi-cell environment.
