The small garrison surrendered on 2 June, by which time the frigate Didon had arrived with orders. Villeneuve was instructed to attack and capture the British colonies in the West Indies, before sailing his entire force back to Europe, join Ganteaume at Brest and cover the invasion flotilla.

40|$|Abstract: Syringolides 1 (1) and 2 (2) in {{optically}} pure {{forms were}} prepared from the chiral butenolide 9, {{which in turn}} was obtained from tri-n-butylstannylfuran (8). Attempts are also being made towards the synthesis of sesquiterpenoid lactones making use of 3 -methyl- 4 -trimethylsilylfuran (17) as a pivotal precursor. Syringolide 1 (1) and syringolide 2 (2) are microbial elicitors produced through the action of a avirulence gene (avrD) of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. These unusual metabolites function as speci®c molecular signal molecules {{that are able to}} induce hypersensitive defence response in soybean plants. [1] Scheme 1 indicates the biogenetic association between the syringolides and their relevant metabolites, namely secosyrin 1 (3), secosyrin 2 (4), syributin 1 (5) and syributin 2 (6). It is certain now that the syringolides would experience a retro-Claisen cleavage reaction to furnish the secosyrins, which in turn would lead to the syributins by way of a retro-Michael reaction and a subsequent 1, 3 -acyl migration. The intriguing tricyclic frameworks of 1 and 2 have made them target molecules <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pursuits,</b> as can be shown {{by the fact that the}} total synthesis of 1 and 2 have been recorded in the literature for no less than seven times since 1995 [2 ± 8].
