50|$|Most {{of these}} {{vehicles}} have a clutch and gearbox (or transmission) mounted {{directly on the}} engine, with a <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> leading to a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> in the rear axle. When the vehicle is stationary, the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> does not rotate. Some vehicles (generally sports cars, most commonly Alfa Romeos or Porsche 924s), seeking improved weight balance between front and rear, use a rear-mounted transaxle. This places the clutch and transmission {{at the rear of}} the car and the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> between them and the engine. In this case the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> rotates continuously with the engine, even when the car is stationary and out of gear.|$|R
50|$|These {{evolved from}} the front-engine rear-wheel drive layout. A new form of {{transmission}} called the transfer case was placed between transmission and <b>final</b> <b>drives</b> in both axles. This split the drive to the two axles and may also have included reduction gears, a dog clutch or differential. At least two <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> were used, one from the transfer case to each axle. In some larger vehicles, the transfer box was centrally mounted and was itself driven by a short <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> In vehicles {{the size of a}} Land Rover, the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> to the front axle is noticeably shorter and more steeply articulated than the rear shaft, making it a more difficult engineering problem to build a reliable <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> and which may involve a more sophisticated form of universal joint.|$|R
50|$|As the {{transmission}} brake is mounted inboard of the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> and its reduction gearing, the brake rotates relatively faster, but with less torque, than a wheel brake. The apparently undersized transmission brake thus has more holding ability than its small size might suggest, but is less suitable for driving loads. The braking forces {{would also be}} passed through the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> and axle <b>drive</b> <b>shafts,</b> with possible risk of overloading them.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the use of}} {{front-wheel drive}} layouts, the gearbox and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> are {{combined}} into a single transaxle. There {{is no longer a}} <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> between them and so the notion of [...] "direct drive" [...] isn't applicable. Although [...] "overdrive" [...] is still referred to, this is now mostly a marketing term to refer to any extra-high ratio for efficient cruising, whether it is achieved through the gearbox ratios, or by an unusually high <b>final</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, <b>final</b> <b>drives</b> and band brakes. The gearbox {{was connected to the}} engine by a <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> passing through the vehicle. A gear change lever was mounted directly on the gearbox.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{relative}} weight of the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> the transmission was normally split into two parts: the gearbox and the <b>final</b> <b>drive.</b> The gearbox was normally produced with its highest gear being 1:1, which offers some mechanical advantages. The <b>final</b> <b>drive,</b> in the rear axle, would then reduce this to the most appropriate speed for the wheels. As power is the product of torque and angular velocity, spinning the shaft faster for any given power reduces the torque and allows a lighter shaft construction.|$|R
5000|$|Engine clutch and gearbox {{were held}} {{as a unit}} at three points. There was a single plate clutch, its housing cast in one piece with the gearbox, a four-speed gearbox and an {{enclosed}} <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> taking power to the spiral bevel <b>final</b> <b>drive.</b> The gear lever, adjustable for reach, was positioned by the driver's right hand.|$|R
50|$|The clutch {{and four}} speed gearbox {{were the same}} as those fitted to the MK3 LE but the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> was through a cast {{aluminium}} pivoted fork, with a universal joint to the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> Front suspension was the same as the LE but rear suspension used Woodhead-Monroe springs with hydraulic damping. Two Amal 363 monobloc carburettors fitted to stub inlet manifolds were linked by a balancing tube. The recommended top speed was 60 mph.|$|R
5000|$|In a motor vehicle, {{the term}} {{powertrain}} or powerplant describes {{the main components}} that generate power and deliver it to the road surface, water, or air. This includes the engine, transmission, <b>drive</b> <b>shafts,</b> differentials, and the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> (drive wheels, continuous track as in military tanks or caterpillar tractors, propeller, etc.). More recently in hybrid Powertrains the battery, the electric motor and the control algorithm are also seen as elements of the Powertrain. Usually [...] "powertrain" [...] is {{used to refer to}} simply the engine and transmission, including the other components only if they are integral to the transmission.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 Gmeinder {{introduced}} an {{advancement of the}} Köf 11 design in which the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> of the power transmission had the chain drive replaced with <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> These were given the classification Köf 12 (class 333 after 1968). 250 of this type were made. From 333 102 onwards the external appearance changed due to the installation of an improved cooler. To further lower personnel expenditure cost of shunting services in 1984 the German Railways began experimenting with radio controls for shunting locomotives.|$|R

50|$|Modern light {{cars with}} all-wheel drive (notably Audi or the Fiat Panda) may use {{a system that}} more closely resembles a front-wheel drive layout. The {{transmission}} and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> for the front axle are combined into one housing alongside the engine, and a single <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> runs {{the length of the}} car to the rear axle. This is a favoured design where the torque is biased to the front wheels to give car-like handling, or where the maker wishes to produce both four-wheel drive and front-wheel drive cars with many shared components.|$|R
50|$|Ready for {{production}} in 1964, the Primula featured {{a gear train}} offset from the differential and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> with unequal length <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> The layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting the cooling fan toward fresh air flow. By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layouts disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential torque steer, the tendency for {{the power of the}} engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration.|$|R

40|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is a {{mechanical}} part of transmission system {{which is used}} to transfer the power from engine to the wheel.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{deals with}} the review of {{optimization}} of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> using the Genetic Algorithm and ANSYS. Substitution of composite material over the conventional steel material for <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has increasing the advantages of design due to its high specific stiffness and strength. <b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{the main component of}} drive system of an automobile. Use of conventional steel for manufacturing of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has many disadvantages such as low specific stiffness and strength. Conventional <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is made up into two parts to increase its fundamental natural bending frequency. Two piece <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> increases the weight of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> which is not desirable in today’s market. Many methods are available at present for the design optimization of structural systems and these methods based on mathematical programming techniques involving gradient search and direct search. These methods assume that the design variables are continuous. But in practical structural engineering optimization, almost all the design variables are discrete. This is due to the availability of components in standard sizes and constraints due to construction and manufacturing practices.
