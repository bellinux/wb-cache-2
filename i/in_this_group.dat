5|$|All {{elements}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> are metals. The {{similarity of}} the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is {{an effect of}} the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E

5|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are modestly {{useful in}} reducing aggression and psychosis {{in people with}} Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline.

5|$|Bahamian Olympic coach Keith Parker, {{prior to}} the start of the Olympic track events, said that Derrick Atkins held a strong chance of medaling in his events, having {{considered}} Atkin's unexpected medaling at the 2007 World Championships, tying Jamaica's Asafa Powell and the United States' Tyson Gay for second place. Similar expectations were held for Chris Brown. Henry Rolle, the track coach at Auburn University, traveled to Beijing to train former athletes at Tianjin University.

5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E

The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.|$|E
