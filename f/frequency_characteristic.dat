50|$|The {{central issue}} here is {{frequency}} of the incoming signal. A plasma will simply reflect radio waves below a certain <b>frequency</b> (<b>characteristic</b> electron plasma frequency). This is the basic principle of short wave radios and long-range communications, because low-frequency radio signals bounce between the Earth and the ionosphere and may therefore travel long distances. Early-warning over-the-horizon radars utilize such low-frequency radio waves (typically lower than 50 MHz). Most military airborne and air defense radars, however, operate in VHF, UHF, and microwave band, which have frequencies higher than the characteristic plasma frequency of ionosphere, therefore microwave can penetrate the ionosphere and communication between the ground and communication satellites demonstrates is possible. (Some frequencies can penetrate the ionosphere).|$|E
50|$|Infrared {{vibrational}} spectroscopy (see also near-infrared spectroscopy) {{is a technique}} {{that can be used}} to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a <b>frequency</b> <b>characteristic</b> of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000-400 cm−1, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200 cm−1).|$|E

5000|$|As {{with all}} image filters, it is {{required}} to match each section into a section of identical image impedance if the theoretical filter response is to be achieved. This is a particular difficulty for the end sections of the filter which are often working into resistive terminations which cannot be matched exactly by an image impedance. Hence {{the use of the}} mm'-type as end sections for the filter because of its nearly flat impedance with <b>frequency</b> <b>characteristic</b> in the passband. However, it is not desirable to use it throughout the entire filter. The workhorse of image filters are the k-type sections and these will usually be required somewhere in the filter for good rejection in the stopband well away from cut-off and also because they are the simplest topology and lowest component count. Unfortunately, neither side of a mm'-type can match into a k-type. The solution is to form a composite section from a mm'-type half-section and a m-type section which will match each other on one side if m has the same value for both half-sections. This can, for instance, produce a composite T-section with [...] facing the termination and [...] facing the rest of the filter. The T-section will be matched internally with [...] This has the additional incidental advantage of producing two poles of attenuation in the stopband at different frequencies. This is a consequence of m and mm necessarily being different values.|$|E
50|$|One {{common use}} of closed reading frames (CRF) is as {{one piece of}} {{evidence}} to assist in gene prediction. Long ORFs are often used, along with other evidence, to initially identify candidate protein-coding regions or functional RNA-coding regions in a DNA sequence. The presence of an CRF {{does not necessarily mean}} that the region is never translated. For example, in a randomly generated DNA sequence with an equal percentage of each nucleotide, a stop-codon would be expected once every 21 codons. A simple gene prediction algorithm for prokaryotes might look for a start codon followed by an open reading frame that is long enough to encode a typical protein, where the codon usage of that region matches the <b>frequency</b> <b>characteristic</b> for the given organism's coding regions. By itself even a long open reading frame is not conclusive evidence for the presence of a gene. On the other hand, it has been proven that some short ORFs (sORFs) that lack the classical hallmarks of protein-coding genes (both from ncRNAs and mRNAs) can produce functional peptides. 5’NTR of about 50% of mammal mRNAs are known to contain one or several sORFs. 64-75% of experimentally found translation initiation sites of sORFs are conservative in the genomes of human and mouse that may indicate that these elements have function. However, sORFs can often be found only in the minor forms of mRNAs and avoid the selection; the high conservatism of initiation sites may be connected with their location inside promoters of the relevant genes. Such kind of situation is characteristic of SLAMF1 gene, for example.|$|E

The traditional asynchronous machine third-order transient model excludes not only the stator transient but also the frequency characteristics, thus decreasing the application sphere of the model and resulting in a large error under some special conditions. Based on the physical equivalent circuit and Park model for asynchronous machines, this study proposes a novel asynchronous third-order transient machine model with consideration of the <b>frequency</b> <b>characteristic.</b> In the new definitions of variables, the voltages behind the reactance are redefined as the linear equation of flux linkage.
