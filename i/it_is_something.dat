5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> of a national myth to Americans as a people. This {{is also the case}} for African-American autobiography, which {{has its roots in the}} slave narrative. The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
5|$|Months earlier, before Ellie meets Joel, Ellie's friend Riley (Yaani King) surprises Ellie {{at their}} {{boarding}} school after weeks away. She reveals {{that she has}} joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group, and takes Ellie to explore an abandoned shopping mall. Riley reveals {{that she has been}} assigned to a group of Fireflies in a different city, and broke the rules to see Ellie again. The girls argue, but Ellie eventually tells her that she supports her decision as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that Riley has wanted for a long time. Before parting, Riley plugs Ellie's walkman into the sound system and dances with her. Ellie tearfully begs Riley not to leave. Riley rips her dog tags off and Ellie kisses her. Drawn by the noise, the Infected pursue Ellie and Riley; they run, but are bitten. They consider suicide, but choose to spend their final hours together.|$|E

25|$|Praise {{for him as}} {{a trainer}} was {{slightly}} more muted, but, after the 1871 Grand National victory with The Lamb, a correspondent did comment on him in the following terms: 'Chris Green has not had charge of Lord Poulett's horses more than a twelvemonth, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> in the trainer's favour {{that he was able to}} win a Grand National on the first time of asking'.|$|E
25|$|A {{fabrication}} {{is a lie}} told {{when someone}} submits a statement as truth, without knowing for certain {{whether or not it}} actually is true. Although the statement may be possible or plausible, it is not based on fact. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> made up, or it is a misrepresentation of the truth. Examples of fabrication: A person giving directions to a tourist when the person doesn't actually know the directions. Often propaganda is fabrication.|$|E
25|$|George meets Lennie at the place, their camping spot {{before they}} came to the ranch. The two sit {{together}} and George retells the beloved story of the dream, knowing <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> they'll never share. He then shoots Lennie, with Curley, Slim, and Carlson arriving seconds after. Only Slim realizes what happened, and consolingly leads him away. Curley and Carlson look on, unable to comprehend the subdued mood of the two men.|$|E

25|$|We AAs {{have never}} called {{alcoholism}} a disease because, technically speaking, {{it is not}} a disease entity. For example, {{there is no such thing}} as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E

It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly looks very much like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all right and they are the judges.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers...

I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something,</b> you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
25|$|For many {{classical}} philosophers, {{nature was}} understood teleologically, meaning that {{every type of}} thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even said to have reason. Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal {{part of the human}} mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (psyche), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (thumos) and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He defined the highest human happiness or well being (eudaimonia) as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E
