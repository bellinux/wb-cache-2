For this orbital overlap to occur, the trans, trans conformation is preferred for most heteroatoms, however for the stabilization to occur in <b>dimethoxymethane,</b> the gauche, gauche conformation is about 3-5 kcal/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the trans,trans conformation—this is about two times as big as the effect in sugars because there are two rotatable bonds(hence it is trans around both bonds or gauche around both) that are affected.|$|E

The intermolecular forces are discussed using accepted theories and the more recent conductor-like screening model (COSMO).

40|$|RuO 2 domains {{supported}} on SnO 2, ZrO 2, TiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and SiO 2 catalyze the oxidative conversion of methanol to formaldehyde, methylformate, and <b>dimethoxymethane</b> with unprecedented rates and high combined selectivity (> 99 %) and yield at low temperatures (300 - 400 K). Supports influence turnover {{rates and the}} ability of RuO 2 domains to undergo redox cycles required for oxidation turnovers. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates and rates of stoichiometric reduction of RuO 2 in H 2 increased in parallel when RuO 2 domains were dispersed on more reducible supports. These support effects, the kinetic effects of CH 3 OH and O 2 on reaction rates, and the observed kinetic isotope effects with CH 3 OD and CD 3 OD reactants are consistent with a sequence of elementary steps involving kinetically relevant H-abstraction from adsorbed methoxide species using lattice oxygen atoms and with methoxide formation in quasi-equilibrated CH 3 OH dissociation on nearly stoichiometric RuO 2 surfaces. Anaerobic transient experiments confirmed that CH 3 OH oxidation to HCHO requires lattice oxygen atoms and that selectivities are not influenced by the presence of O 2. Residence time effects on selectivity indicate that secondary HCHO-CH 3 OH acetalization reactions lead to hemiacetal or methoxy-methanol intermediates that convert to <b>dimethoxymethane</b> in reactions with CH 3 OH on support acid sites or dehydrogenate to form methylformate on RuO 2 and support redox sites.

The kinetics of the formaldehyde formation from methanol could be well described with Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics, assuming two different metal oxide sites, one containing adsorbed oxygenates and the other one containing lattice oxygen. The presence of water vapor lowered the formaldehyde formation rate significantly, especially at lower water partial pressures. These results could be well explained in terms of competitive adsorption of water with methanol on the free active catalyst sites.

The rate of CO formation was first order in formaldehyde and the oxygen dependency was the same as that for the formaldehyde formation from methanol. Rate expressions for all reactions were formulated based on the above assumptions and a multivariate Levenberg–Marquardt method was used to fit all the model constants to all the experiments for all reaction rates simultaneously, while additionally accounting for axial concentration profiles in the reactor.

The replacement of 5. 7 % C 2 H 4 by 4. 3 % C 3 H 8 O 2, keeping the equivalence ratio equal to 2. 50, is responsible for a decrease of the maximum mole fractions {{of most of the}} detected intermediate species. If this phenomenon is barely noticeable for C 2 to C 4 intermediates, it becomes more efficient for C 5 to C 10 species. Previously, a reaction mechanism has been validated against a premixed rich C 2 H 4 /O 2 /Ar flame (φ = 2. 50) which describes in detail the formation of soot precursors and more precisely the main pathways involving benzene (V. Dias, C. Renard, P. J. Van Tiggelen and J. Vandooren, European Combustion Meeting, Orléans, France, p. 221, 2003). The aim of this work is to extend this original model by building a sub-mechanism taking into account the formation and the consumption of oxygenated species involved in <b>dimethoxymethane</b> combustion. The new mechanism contains 474 elementary reactions and involves 90 chemical species in order to simulate both ethylene flames with and without methylal addition.

An elementary step model for DMM pyrolysis and oxidation is built with the automatic kinetic model generation software Genesys. To describe the chemistry of small species not directly related to DMM, the AramcoMech 1. 3 mechanism developed by Metcalfe et al. is used. If the more recently extended version of this mechanism, i. e. the propene oxidation mechanism published by Burke et al., was used as alternative base mechanism, large discrepancies for the mole fractions of CO 2, methyl formate and methanol during the pyrolysis of DMM were observed. The validation of the new DMM model is carried out with new experimental data that is acquired in an isothermal quartz jet-stirred reactor at low and intermediate temperatures. Different equivalence ratios, = 0. 25, = 1. 0, = 2. 0 and = ∞, are studied in a temperature range from 500 K to 1100 K, at a pressure of 1. 07 bar and with an inlet DMM mole fraction of 0. 01. The experimental trends are well predicted by the model without any tuning of the model parameters although some improvements are possible to increase quantitative agreement.
