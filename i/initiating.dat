5|$|When the <b>initiating</b> {{computer}} {{sends the}} complete instructions, or job, for processing to the controller, the controller splits the task up into these small instruction packets, known as tasks. The {{design of the}} Xgrid system consists of these small packets being transferred to all the Xgrid-enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by the controller and then return the results. The controller assembles the individual task results into the whole job results and returns them to the <b>initiating</b> computer.|$|E

30|$|Fracture {{morphology}} differed {{when the}} fracture <b>initiated</b> from sandstone or coal. The fracture geometry was simple when the fracture <b>initiated</b> from the sandstone layer; in most cases, the fracture propagated {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the minimum horizontal stress. When the fracture <b>initiated</b> from the coal layer, the fracture morphology was more complex with three main patterns: (1) The hydraulic fracture <b>initiated</b> and propagated alongside the natural fracture, partially diverging due to in situ stress and forming secondary fractures. (2) The hydraulic fracture <b>initiated</b> and propagated in {{the direction of the}} maximum horizontal stress. (3) Multiple fractures <b>initiated</b> and propagated simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|The Dauntless instructor, Four, {{explains}} {{that not all}} Dauntless <b>initiates</b> {{will be allowed to}} enter the faction.

50|$|Immediately {{prior to}} Brotherhood of Steel, the three playable {{characters}} (Cain, Cyrus, and Nadia) {{have joined the}} Brotherhood as new <b>Initiates.</b> After selecting which character to play as (hereafter {{referred to as the}} <b>Initiate),</b> the game opens with the <b>Initiate</b> searching for missing Paladins in the nearby town of Carbon. Minor investigation leads the <b>Initiate</b> to question the Mayor of the town, who demands the destruction of a radscorpion lair before he will reveal any information. Also, the <b>Initiate</b> gains the trust of Jesse, a trader, and Vidaya, the town doctor. Once the radscorpions are defeated, the Mayor informs the <b>Initiate</b> of the direction the paladins were last known to be traveling. The <b>Initiate</b> goes into the Crater near the town to find the Paladins. Unfortunately, the Mayor reveals himself shortly afterward to be a treacherous man, and attempts to murder the <b>Initiate</b> using explosives. However, he only succeeds in causing a rock slide and killing himself. Blocked by the rocks, the <b>Initiate</b> heads back to Carbon to find it being looted by raiders, who must then be defeated. The townsfolk have holed up in the warehouse while the <b>Initiate</b> rescues others who didn't make it to the warehouse. When that is done, the Raider lair is discovered to be the nearby former steel mill. The <b>Initiate</b> (with some inventory help from Jesse) goes in and defeats the Raider Matron. While here, the <b>Initiate</b> meets up with the Vault Dweller (the protagonist from the original game) and get directed to look for the Paladin Rhombus in the ghoul town of Los (formerly the outskirts of Los Angeles).|$|R
5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, physical attributes and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the tempo of the game, as well as <b>initiating</b> team attacks.|$|E
