5|$|During 14April 1912, Titanics radio {{operators}} received six {{messages from}} other ships warning of <b>drifting</b> ice, which passengers on Titanic {{had begun to}} notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50years (which was {{the reason why the}} lookouts were unaware that they were about to steam into a line of <b>drifting</b> ice several miles wide and many miles long). Not all of these messages were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers, with weather reports as a secondary concern.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} of <b>drift</b> in PCM devices at different temperatures and with different memory alloys is presented. It was shown that: <b>drift</b> exponent is reduced with decreasing chalcogenide film thickness, <b>drift</b> is observed to saturate with time, <b>drift</b> exponent rises and time of <b>drift</b> saturation decreases with increasing temperature. In this paper we report {{for the first time}} <b>drift</b> for more conducting alloys, which have <b>drift</b> maxima at intermediate resistance. <b>Drift</b> dependence on programmed resistance, i. e. dependence on d vs. Ro and position of maxima of d vs. Ro. and d absolute value during <b>drift</b> depends dramatically on the composition of the phase change memory alloy material. In this paper we add new data and interpretation on the resistance <b>drift</b> and its nature: a) Not only amorphous parts of device might be responsible for <b>drift.</b> b) <b>Drift</b> might be caused not only by the phase change but also by electrical switching, which in turn is the consequence of electronic high current density filaments appearance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Turnout <b>Drift</b> Operating Envelope Calculation is to {{identify}} the design parameters of the typical turnout <b>drift</b> and advance the preliminary design of the typical turnout <b>drift.</b> The scope of this calculation requires the turnout <b>drift</b> geometry be identified in sufficient detail to provide input to develop a typical turnout <b>drift</b> design. This turnout <b>drift</b> design strategy {{will be used to}} develop a preliminary turnout <b>drift</b> design for each distinct grouping of turnout <b>drift</b> type. The calculation will define the operating envelope of the relevant interfaces such as the turnout <b>drift</b> invert and the ventilation door. This information will be used to describe the space allocation of the turnout <b>drift</b> components and operating equipment. The turnout <b>drift</b> is an elemental component of the subsurface repository design layout. Other elemental components are the emplacement <b>drift,</b> the access mains, the exhaust mains, and ventilation shafts.

A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters.

5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three <b>drifting</b> fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the <b>drifting</b> Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery chasm between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} {{adiabatic}} <b>drift</b> theory are investigated in the regime where the E x B <b>drift</b> velocity is comparable with or {{larger than the}} gyro velocity. Particles undergo five <b>drifts</b> {{in addition to the}} E x B gradient, and line curvature <b>drifts</b> have three more terms in the parallel equation of motion. The case of the rapidly rotating rigid magnetic field configuration is found to be an exception due to the corotating particle with a nearly periodic motion. The guiding center <b>drift</b> velocity and parallel differential equation of motion are obtained, and the <b>drift</b> velocity in the rotating frame is found to consist of the expected field gradient and line curvature <b>drift,</b> plus centrifugal and coriolis force induced <b>drifts.</b> It is shown that the second invariant is conserved in the rotating frame by the four <b>drifts,</b> so that a particle slowly <b>drifts</b> around on its <b>drift</b> shell and returns to its original field line. Thus, there is no long term energy change, and any energy change is periodic on the bounce and <b>drift</b> time scale...|$|R
