40|$|The {{unification}} of isotachophoresis (ITP) and electric field gradient focusing (EFGF) is proposed, based on theoretical considerations and experimental evidence from previous literature. This unification increases the versatility of each EFGF method. A novel isotachophoretic separation method is developed {{which is based}} on one of the EFGF techniques, namely micro/nanofluidic concentration polarization devices, This novel method, coined <b>depletion</b> <b>zone</b> <b>isotachophoresis</b> (dzITP), requires a single electrolyte only, which is a simplification over conventional isotachophoresis. Moreover, positioning of focused analyte zones, selective release of individual analyte zones and continuous filtering based on ionic mobility differences is possible. Furthermore, it is shown that microvalves in PDMS chip devices can act as nanochannels upon closure, giving rise {{to a wide range of}} concentration polarization phenomena. Compounds can be concentrated over 1000 -fold and subsequently be released. These techniques give novel possibilities for bioassays and sample preparation.

40|$|In this thesis, nanochannels {{as well as}} nanofluidic {{phenomena}} {{are used}} to provide new and miniaturized bioanalytical tools for the life sciences. Isotachophoresis performed in nanochannels showed the focusing and separation of analytes in a 0. 4 picoliter volume, which is a volume {{in the order of}} a sample from a single cell. <b>Depletion</b> <b>zone</b> <b>isotachophoresis</b> (dzITP) is demonstrated which uses a nanofluidic phenomenon, concentration polarization, to enable isotachophoresis in a microchannel while using only a single electrolyte. A concept for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensor (SERSOR) is explored; a coating protecting the SERS surface from irreversible adsorption may enable dynamic measurements of biomolecules in solution in minute volumes. Working with nanochannels has led to the discovery of new unexpected fundamental phenomena: the very high surface to volume ratio in nanochannels causes acidification of solutions introduced in them, despite the presence of up to 1 mol/L of buffer. Also, extreme pressures of more than a 1000 bar may be induced in a nanochannel by what we named electrocavitation, an effects shown to impose a limit on further downscaling of ITP.

40|$|Trans-differentiation to a transfer-cell {{morphology}} {{is characterized}} by the localized deposition of wall ingrowth papillae that protrude into the cytosol. Whether the cortical microtubule array directs wall ingrowth papillae formation was investigated using a Vicia faba cotyledon culture system in which their adaxial epidermal cells were spontaneously induced to trans-differentiate to transfer cells. During deposition of wall ingrowth papillae, the aligned cortical microtubule arrays in precursor epidermal cells were reorganized into a randomized array characterized by circular <b>depletion</b> <b>zones.</b> Concurrence of the temporal appearance, spatial pattern, and size of <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> and wall ingrowth papillae was consistent with each papilla occupying a <b>depletion</b> <b>zone.</b> Surprisingly, microtubules appeared not to regulate construction of wall ingrowth papillae, as neither depolymerization nor stabilization of cortical microtubules changed their deposition pattern or morphology. Moreover, the size and spatial pattern of <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> was unaltered when the formation of wall ingrowth papillae was blocked by inhibiting cellulose biosynthesis. In contrast, the <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> were absent when the cytosolic calcium plumes, responsible for directing wall ingrowth papillae formation, were blocked or dissipated. Thus, we conclude that the <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> within the cortical microtubule array result from localized depolymerization of microtubules initiated by elevated cytosolic Ca 2 + levels at loci where wall ingrowth papillae are deposited.

Sillimanite is also an important reactant that supplies Al to garnet, but it is scarce in the matrix.
