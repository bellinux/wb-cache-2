40|$|A {{flow-through}} PQC/DNA biosensor {{system is}} developed by combining sequential flow {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) <b>products</b> <b>denaturing</b> prior to piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) detection via hybridization of ssDNA. The PQC/DNA biosensor is fabricated based on complex formation of neutravidin/biotinylated probe in 0. 2 M NaCl in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7. 5). Results show that the coating fabricated provides a desirable quality with satisfactory performance. Its application for Escherichia coli detection under controlled flow at 0. 02 mL/min for <b>denaturing</b> PCR <b>products</b> and 10 mL/min for transferring solution between reactors and delivering samples to detector to reduce rehybridization leads to significant improvement in repeatability (R. S. D. < 6 %, n = 5) and sensitivity (ΔF = 34 Hz/ 1000 E. coli cells) as compared to existing manual method (R. S. D. = 19 %, n = 5 and ΔF = 26 Hz/ 1000 E. coli cells, respectively). Down to 23 E. coli cells are detected, satisfying the HKEPD requirements for E. coli count in beach water. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Drying {{is one of}} {{the method}} of food preservation. Drying {{preserves}} foods by removing enough moisture from food to prevent decay and spoilage. Drying of foods, the key is to remove moisture as quickly as possible at a temperature that does not seriously affect the flavor, texture and color of the food. If the temperature is too low in the beginning, microorganisms may survive and even grow before the food is adequately dried. Hard coating of fruit is more difficult for moisture to escape and the food does not dry properly. Some of these materials are heat-sensitive and require careful drying. Drying can be detrimental to the retention of bioactive ingredients. High temperature tends to damage and <b>denature</b> the <b>product,</b> destroy active ingredients, cause case hardening and discoloration, etc. This article briefly summarizes some of the innovative drying methods and selected new developments applicable to drying processing. Food preservation can reduce wastage of a harvest surplus, allow storage for food shortages, and in some cases facilitate export to high-value markets...|$|R
40|$|Translation of {{messenger}} RNA {{isolated from}} poly(rI) -poly(rC) -induced human fibroblasts in cell-free ribosomal systems and in Xenopus oocytes {{resulted in the}} production of biologically active proteins that had the properties of human fibroblast interferon. The translation in the oocytes was much more efficient, giving approximately 500 times higher titers of interferon activity than the cell-free systems. A control messenger RNA isolated from noninduced human fibroblasts, did not code for interferon synthesis in these systems. Both messenger RNA preparations stimulated [3 H]amino-acid incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material. The radioactive products and their immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels under <b>denaturing</b> conditions. The <b>products</b> resulting from the translation of the control (uninduced) messenger RNA in oocytes contained a major protein of approximately 45, 000 molecular weight. The messenger RNA isolated from poly(rI) -poly(rC) -induced cells stimulated the synthesis of an additional 25, 000 molecular weight protein that electrophoresed in the same position as human fibroblast interferon. These results suggest that human fibroblast interferon was synthesized by the translation of its messenger RNA in Xenopus oocytes and in cell-free ribosomal systems...|$|R

Mariculture is one solution to the so-called “supply problem ” that often hampers further studies and development of novel compounds from sponges. We report the extended culture (767 days) at sea in depths of 10 and 20 m of three sponge species: Negombata magnifica, Amphimedon chloros and Theonella swinhoei that produce latrunculin-B, halitoxin and swinholide-A, respectively. Since sponge-associated microorganisms may be the true producers {{of many of the}} natural products found in sponges and also be linked {{to the health of the}} sponges, we examined the stability of the bacterial communities in cultured versus wild sponges. Growth rate of the sponges (ranging from 308 to 61 and − 19 (%) (year − 1) in N. magnifica, A. chloros and T. swinhoei, respectively) differed significantly between species but not between the two depths at which the species were cultivated. Survivorship varied from 96 % to 57 %.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirement}} of World Health Organization for zero tolerance of E. coli cell in 100 mL drinking water, a new procedure based on photodeposition of nano-Ag at TiO 2 -coated piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) electrode was developed to fabricate a highly sensitive PQC/DNA biosensor. Enhancement of 3. 3 times for binding of complementary DNA has been shown and attributed to the following effects arising from the nano-Ag coating. First, a large increase in the active surface area and packing density of neutravidin enhances the maximum neutravidin load to 1. 8 times of a normal electrode. Second, the functional activity of neutravidin is enhanced by chemical interaction with nano-Ag to give rise {{to an increase in}} the binding ratio between neutravidin and biotinylated DNA probe from 1. 00 : 1. 76 to 1. 00 : 3. 01. Third, the stronger binding leads to a higher stability of the biotinylated DNA probes bound and increase in hybridization with the complementary DNA. Under the optimized conditions for flow analysis with online PCR <b>product</b> <b>denaturing</b> and hybridization, a detection limit of eight E. coli cells are obtained which require sampling at least 800 mL water to detect a single E. coli cell in 100 mL water. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{induction}} of an immunological antitumor response {{capable of}} eradicating metastatic tumors {{is the ultimate}} goal of immunotherapy. We have recently shown that this can be achieved by interleukin 2 (IL- 2) therapy directed to the tumor microenvironment by a recombinant antibody–IL- 2 fusion protein. It is not known, however, whether this curative treatment is associated with a predominance of T cells carrying specific T cell receptor variable β regions (TCRBV) or the presence of clonally expanded T cells. To address this question, we have used a quantitative reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR method to analyze the TCRBV region repertoire in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of treated and untreated animals. As controls the TCRBV region repertoire was analyzed in blood and skin from disease-free animals. The results indicate an overexpression of TCRBV 5 in the tumors of all treated mice and an additional overexpression of individual regions in each tumor. Direct sequencing of these TCRBV regions did not reveal any evidence of clonal expansions. However, since clonal expansions could exist as subpopulations in highly expressed regions, not detectable by direct sequencing, a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis assay was used for clonal analysis of TCRBV PCR <b>products.</b> <b>Denaturing</b> gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of selected TCRBV regions revealed the presence of clonotypic T cells in tumors from both treated and untreated animals. These data indicate that targeted IL- 2 therapy in this model does not induce clonal T cell responses de novo, rather it acts as an activator for an already existing population of clonotypic T cells...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science Institute, Animal Science and IndustryKaren A. SchmidtYogurt is a {{good source}} of whey proteins, which have been {{reported}} to provide positive health benefits. During yogurt manufacture, the yogurt mix receives a heat treatment which pasteurizes the <b>product,</b> <b>denatures</b> the whey proteins affecting their availability, and enhances quality attributes. Thus the objective of this research was to improve the undenatured whey protein content in yogurt. The study was divided in two parts. The first part focused on the effect of pasteurization treatments of yogurt mixes (65 °C for 30 min vs. 90 °C for 10 min) on the yogurt firmness, G’, L*, syneresis and water holding capacity (WHC), and how these properties change as a function of storage. Nonfat dry milk (NFDM) was reconstituted (~ 11 % w/v) pasteurized, cooled, inoculated with yogurt culture, incubated to pH 4. 5, stored at 5 °C ± 1 and evaluated for various physical and chemical properties on days 1, 15 and 29. The experiment was replicated 3 times and data were analyzed by SAS®. Yogurt samples had a 5 -fold difference in whey protein denaturation (WPD) and the greater the WPD the greater the firmness, G’, L* and WHC but lesser the syneresis. During yogurt storage, L*, G’, syneresis and WHC increased. The second part of this research focused on whey protein concentrate (WPC) addition (3 %) in yogurt mix combined with two pasteurization treatments (70 °C for 30 min vs. 90 °C for 10 min) to determine their effects on the yogurt quality. Yogurt mixes were formulated using 12. 5 % NFDM or 9. 5 % NFDM and 3 % WPC and a procedure similar to the previous study was followed. The WPC addition resulted in a yogurt with decreased firmness, G’, WHC but increased syneresis. Yogurt made from mixes pasteurized at 90 °C for 10 min had ~ 60 % WPD and comparable quality attributes regardless of WPC addition. Thus, additional WPC and less WPD in this study resulted in a yogurt with slightly lesser quality attributes but more undenatured whey proteins in the final yogurt...|$|R
