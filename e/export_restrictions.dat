5|$|Prices {{of several}} rare-earth {{elements}} increased sharply by mid-2010 as China imposed a 40% export reduction, citing environmental concerns {{as the reason}} for the <b>export</b> <b>restrictions.</b> These quotas have been interpreted as an attempt to control the supply of rare earths. However, the high prices have provided an incentive to begin or reactivate several rare-earth mining projects around the world, including the United States, Australia, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|The {{cockatiel}} {{is by far}} the cockatoo species {{most frequently}} kept in captivity. Among U.S. bird keepers that participated in a survey by APPMA in 2003/04, 39% had cockatiels, as opposed to only 3% that had (other) cockatoo species. The white cockatoos are more often encountered in aviculture than the black cockatoos. Black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos due to <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> on Australian wildlife but birds seized by governments have been loaned.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{was also}} sold {{for a while}} in {{duty-free}} shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market.|$|E

Defence technology sharing deals between Japan and Australia, along with the loosening of Japanese defence <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> were seen as preliminary steps towards such a deal. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was also cited {{as a factor in}} the likeliness of such a deal. In response to the rumours of the Japanese deal, unsolicited proposals were made by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (its Type 216 submarine concept), Saab (an enlarged version of the A26 submarine), and Thales and DCNS (a diesel-electric variant of the Barracuda-class submarine).|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} {{took power}} in 1981, the <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{put in place}} by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed. At first, the FX program continued as normal, but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary focus. As a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.|$|E

The likely model for Goldfinger was American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr., who Fleming had met in 1949. Englehard had established a company, the Precious Metals Development Company, which circumvented numerous <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong. Fleming had reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London {{with a list of}} queries about gold, its properties and the background of the industry, including smuggling. Fleming himself liked gold enough to commission a gold-plated typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company, although he never actually used it. In 1995, this machine was purchased by the Bond actor, Pierce Brosnan.|$|E

China became a leader in rare earth industry and has control over 90 percent of globals rare earths supply and production. However, Chinese Government start to restrict rare earths export and use this leverage as a economic instrument that affects the importer countries that depends on its supply, such as United States. The reasons behind <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> was based on environmental problems, to fullfil increasing domestic demands and to sustain its unrenewable resources. The sources that is used on this research are obtained trought the books, journals, reports, documents, websites, online media, and also earlier related researches.

This research is intended to assessing Chinas rare earths policy implications to the United States high-tech products, economic, political, and national security situations.

25|$|The Alpha Jet {{is powered}} by a pair of SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac {{turbofan}} engines. It is a low bypass-ratio, twin-spool engine that uses modular construction methods. The Larzac was a new engine at the time, having only performed its first run a year prior to being selected to power the Alpha Jet. The need for greater thrust to power the aircraft than the original model of the engine could generate led to the development and adoption of the 2,970lb Larzac 04 in February 1972; it was this version of the engine that initially powered the Alpha Jet. Germany was interested in powering the type with the General Electric J85, but France objected to the use of an American engine which would result in US <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> upon the overall aircraft and agreed to assume the cost of developing the French-built Larzac. During the 1980s, an upgraded model of the Larzac engine which increased the thrust by 10 per cent was developed.|$|E
25|$|The global {{conservation}} status of velvet worm species {{is difficult to}} estimate; many species are only known to exist at their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by low population densities, their typically nocturnal behaviour and possibly also as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism. To date, the only onychophorans evaluated by the IUCN are: Mesoperipatus tholloni (Data Deficient), Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis (Near Threatened), Peripatoides indigo (Vulnerable), Peripatoides suteri (Vulnerable), Peripatopsis alba (Vulnerable), Peripatopsis clavigera (Vulnerable), Macroperipatus insularis (Endangered), Tasmanipatus anophthalmus (Endangered), Opisthopatus roseus (Critically Endangered), Peripatopsis leonina (Critically Endangered), and Speleoperipatus spelaeus (Critically Endangered). The primary threat comes from destruction and fragmentation of velvet worm habitat due to industrialisation, draining of wetlands, and slash-and-burn agriculture. Many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges; as a result, relatively small localised disturbances of important ecosystems {{can lead to the}} extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale. There is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and exporting, while in others, such as Australia, only <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection programme that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan, which is tailored to a particular velvet worm species.|$|E
