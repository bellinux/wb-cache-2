Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establish standards for 83 contaminants by June 1989, and at least 25 added standards by January 1991, then 25 more every three years hence. Conceptually, the regulatory process employed by EPA consists of two steps. First, a detailed health risk assessment of a contaminant is performed {{in order to determine}} the Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (nonenforceable health goal) in water that should result in no known or anticipated health effects and allows adequate margin of safety. Second, the results of risk assessment and management (taking best available technology, treatment techniques, cost, and other means into consideration) are combined to derive the Maximum Contaminant Level (<b>enforceable</b> <b>standard)</b> which is set as close to the MCLG as feasible. With this overall regulatory process in mind, a detailed risk assessment process (hazard identification, dose-response assessment, human exposure assessment, and risk characterization) used in setting drinking water standards is discussed. In addition, this article discusses our efforts in exploring new and improved risk assessment methodologies addressing the mechanism of action of toxicants, relative source contribution, weight of evidence, carcinogenic potency, and toxicokinetics...|$|E
40|$|We model merger control {{procedures}} {{as a process}} of sequential acquisition of information and compare US and EU procedures. In the US, the authorities do not have to justify their decision to require further information (issue a second request), whereas in the EU, the authorities face a different (<b>enforceable)</b> <b>standard</b> of proof in phase I relative to phase II. We find that in the absence of remedies, the US procedure is always superior in terms of expected consumer welfare. When we allow for remedies, we find that, compared to the US, merging parties in the EU have more scope to propose remedies in phase I that will preempt the authorities from uncovering unfavorable information in phase II, and this might reduce expected consumer welfare. However, the higher standard of proof in phase I can also in some circumstances act as a commitment not to accept remedies below some threshold and yield a higher expected consumer welfare in the EU. Our model also shows that for global mergers that have the same effect in the two jurisdictions, a decision to trigger a Phase II in the EU yields the same expected consumer welfare as a clearance in Phase I with remedies in the US.

Experts agree that the system of care for vulnerable families in the Czech Republic is {{below the level of}} developed countries. The system is fragmented among several ministries, there is no uniform and <b>enforceable</b> <b>standard</b> of quality work with socially vulnerable families, there is no independent authority to oversee compliance with the Convention on the Rights of Child. Guarantor of help for socially vulnerable families is the state, but there is lack of social workers, who work intensively with the family. The result is the high number of children in institutional care. Experts prepare reform steps to streamline the system of care for socially vulnerable families in the Czech Republic - the numbers of children in institutional care should reduce by preventive programs and work with a family. The public sector should cooperate with nongovernmental organizations in working with socially vulnerable families, and together strive for redevelopment [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Agency (EPA) {{is proposing}} a {{drinking}} water regulation for arsenic, {{as required by}} the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The proposed health-based, non-enforceable goal, or Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG), for arsenic is zero, and the proposed <b>enforceable</b> <b>standard,</b> or maximum contaminant level (MCL), for arsenic is 0. 005 mg/L. EPA is also requesting comment on 0. 003 mg/L, 0. 010 mg/L and 0. 020 mg/L for the MCL. EPA is listing technologies that will meet the MCL, including affordable compliance technologies for three categories of small systems serving less than 10, 000 people. This proposal also includes monitoring, reporting, public notification, and consumer confidence report requirements and State primacy revisions for public drinking water programs affected by the arsenic regulation. In addition, in this proposal the Agency is clarifying compliance for State-determined monitoring after exceedances for inorganic, volatile organic, and synthetic organic contaminants. Finally, EPA is proposing that States will specify the time period and sampling frequency for new public water systems and systems using a new source of water to demonstrate compliance with the MCLs. The requirement for new systems and new source monitoring will be effective for inorganic, volatile organic, and synthetic organic contaminants.

Notably, Enterococci was not {{detected}} in samples from two beaches, Pantai Irama IA and Pantai Irama IB. Apart {{from these two}} beaches, Enterococci counts were comparatively lowest in Paintai Sri Tujuh 1 A and Paintai Sri Tujuh 1 B water samples. Analysis of recorded mean log counts for Enterococci in beach sand samples revealed more beaches with no detection of Enterococci as compared with water samples as Paintai Sri Tujuh 1 A, PCB 1 A, Tok Bali 1 A, Tok Bali 1 B, Kualar Bbesar 1 B, Paintai Irama 1 A and 1 B all yielded negative results during the enumeration of Enterococci in the collected beach sediments. Higher mean log counts however were observed for sand samples collected from Paintai Sri Tujuh 3 beach (1.31 [*]±[*] 0.01 logCFU/ 100 ml). In a few instances, higher Enterococci counts in beach water was recorded than in beach sand particularly for Pantai Sri Tujuh 1 B and Pantai Sri Tujuh 3. Notably, most beach sand samples commonly harboured fewer Enterococci than the beach water samples. This difference however {{was not statistically significant}} as p was found greater than 0.99 for the mean logCFU/ 100 ml comparisons. Currently, there is no <b>enforceable</b> <b>standard</b> available in Malaysia for designated bathing beaches to comply with. Also no enterococci standards exist in Malaysia for the purpose of comparison. Comparing enterococci levels in this study with the tabulated benchmark documented for bathing waters in Barrell et al. (2000) in concert with the Bathing Waters Regulation (1991), counts obtained in this study was in one of the beaches up to two-fold higher than the recommended guide levels.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from September 4, 2015 - September 4, 2017 Ecoroofs have become more prominent in recent years. However, there is currently no <b>enforceable</b> <b>standard</b> or building code for the design and construction of ecoroofs across the United States (Kraupa, 2014). Further {{research is needed to}} determine how ecoroofs respond to roof motion and to develop an appropriate design standard. The work herein attempts to examine the complete ecoroof system and its response when subjected to motion. Direct shear interface testing was performed to determine the coefficient of friction at the interface between each layer of the ecoroof. The interfaces were tested under both dry and submerged conditions for soil depths of 100 mm (4 in), 300 mm (12 in), and 900 mm (36 in) to model both extensive and intensive soil conditions. These coefficients of friction tell at which interface the system is most susceptible to sliding, and at what point this sliding will begin. When root barrier is used, its interfaces are critical to sliding. When root barrier is excluded from the ecoroof system, the insulation board / Tremco drain mat & filter fabric interface is most susceptible to sliding. Additionally, a shake table was designed and built to subject model ecoroofs to linear motion. Model ecoroofs of varying soil densities, moisture conditions, and slopes were subjected to haversine acceleration pulses. The goals of this testing were to access the potential for soil decoupling from the roof, to determine the extent of this decoupling, to determine how decoupling is impacted by roof slope, soil density, and moisture conditions, and to determine which intensity measure or measures best predicted the observed decoupling. It was determined soil decouples from the roof when velocity exceeds a critical threshold. The magnitude of decoupling is greatest under submerged soil conditions, greater for loose than for dense soil placements, and generally increases with increasing roof slope. Such information is paramount in the development of an ecoroof design standard to ensure public safety...|$|E

40|$|Ratmalana-Moratuwa {{industrial}} {{area has been}} subject to heavy pollution from various industries {{for more than a}} decade. This area {{is believed to have been}} polluted with heavy metals that have some drastic adverse impacts on human beings and surrounding ecosystems. Since there has not been a comprehensive study done to get an insight into the degree of contamination so far, an attempt was made in understanding the existing scenario in terms of predominant heavy metals. In Ratmalana-Moratuwa {{industrial area}}, 79 groundwater wells were selected with biased sampling for heavy metal analysis. All wells were sampled for Fe, Mn, Ag, Ni, AI, Cr, Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn and Co. The analysis was carried out with the technique of Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry and the results from well waters revealed that Fe, Mn, Ag, Ni, and Al levels were greater than those stipulated for drinking water by WorId Health Organization. Hence all most all wells were found to be abandoned merely due to the taste and colour problems. Most of the industries tend to discharge untreated or partially treated effluent into the nearby drains and hence there is a likelihood of groundwater being affected. 36 industrial effluents were sampled for heavy metal analysis and the results from industrial effluents revealed that Pb, Cr, Cu concentrations were high compared to Sri Lankan Standards for discharge of effluents into inland surface waters. Similarly the concentrations of Fe, AI, Mn, Ag and Co were found to be comparatively high but no <b>enforceable</b> <b>standard</b> levels are available in Sri Lanka. There is a greater need for cleaner technologies for the treatment of heavy metal contaminated wastewaters. Electrodialysis is one such technique that has many advantages such as avoidance of hazardous sludge production, less area requirement, application of low voltage and operation under ambient pressure. Although few studies have been conducted for heavy metal concentration by electrodialysis, in this study a laboratory fabricated four-membrane, five-compartment, electrodialysis cell was used with commercially available cationic and anionic selective membranes to investigate the effect of current density and permselectivity on selected heavy metal concentration. Initially a NaCl solution was desalinized to confirm the permselectivity and separation efficiency for Na ion. Subsequently experiments were carried out to concentrate heavy metals, from selected ionic solutions containing Al and Ni ions. Although there was no optimization of conditions for desalination, the initial concentration of the feed water decreased by 69 % with an applied current density of 10 m/vcm". For stable operation and a higher current efficiency, a lower current density of 10 mAlcm 2 should be employed for the reactor configuration used to minimize effects such as co-ion transport, anode dissolution and heat loss. The permselectivity of the membrane contribute strongly to the degree of separation of heavy metals. The use of different permselective membranes together with complexation techniques need to be further investigated to improve separation efficiencies for heavy metals...|$|E
