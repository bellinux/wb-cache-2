5|$|In other regions, {{the average}} {{radioactivity}} of surface soil due to residual americium {{is only about}} 0.01picocuries/g (0.37mBq/g).

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of partially competitive inhibition {{is similar to}} that of non-competitive, except that the EIS complex has catalytic activity, which may be lower or <b>even</b> <b>higher</b> (partially competitive activation) than that of the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex.

5|$|Blaine and {{his wife}} and daughters sailed for Europe in June 1887, visiting England, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and finally Scotland, where they stayed at the summer home of Andrew Carnegie. While in France, Blaine {{wrote a letter to the}} New-York Tribune criticizing Cleveland’s plans to reduce the tariff, saying that free trade with Europe would {{impoverish}} American workers and farmers. The family returned to the United States in August 1887. His letter in the Tribune had raised his political profile <b>even</b> <b>higher,</b> and by 1888 Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, both former opponents, urged Blaine to run against Cleveland again. Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{both the}} {{technological}} gap between civilisations and the centuries-long colonial era, Portugal was a driving force {{in the development and}} shaping of all Portuguese Africa since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the territory was totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of Portuguese Mozambique by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an <b>even</b> <b>higher</b> level of economic growth and support from the populace.|$|E

5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be <b>even</b> <b>higher,</b> such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) {{approved}} a follow-on {{class of the}} earlier Project 15 Delhi-class destroyers. The aim was that the follow-on class would incorporate {{a higher level of}} air-defence, land attack, anti-submarine and anti-ship capabilities than the preceding class. However, the Indian Navy did not initially take up the option. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had redesigned the follow-on Kolkata class to incorporate <b>even</b> <b>higher</b> levels of technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A was framed by the navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL).|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt {{to compare the}} manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the letters {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an <b>even</b> <b>higher</b> likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author.

5|$|In {{order to}} achieve <b>even</b> <b>higher</b> power levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent {{in order to reduce the}} federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates <b>even</b> <b>higher</b> than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Resistivity is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material opposes the flow of electric current. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets <b>even</b> <b>higher</b> with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E

Cray {{generally}} set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models.

For the Cray-3, he decided to set an <b>even</b> <b>higher</b> performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.|$|E
