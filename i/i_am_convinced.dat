5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced,</b> Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

Thus, therefore, when I {{had heard}} and {{considered}} what they said, I left them, and went about my employment again, but their talk and discourse went with me; also my heart would tarry with them, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> greatly affected with their words, both because by them <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that <b>I</b> wanted the true tokens {{of a truly}} godly man, and also because by them <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> of the happy and blessed condition of him {{that was such a}} one.|$|R

5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.|$|E

In Rapture Under Attack he wrote:I myself have been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order.

25|$|President Klaus Iohannis is a {{supporter}} of the fight against corruption in Romania. Since coming to power in November 2014, has sent several messages of support to prosecutors investigating sensitive cases against politicians accused of corruption. Making one of its important position was in February 25, 2016 {{at the annual meeting of}} the National Anticorruption Directorate: “From year to year the work of the National Anticorruption Directorate has become more effective as the number of cases investigated and complexity, as well as final decisions on confiscation and recovery of property from crime. You are a model of functional institution and created a performance standard. Through the work and achievements, you've earned the appreciation of the Romanian citizens who want to live in a just society, in a country without corruption, the institutions, elect to represent them and those who perform public functions are actually serving the people. The results obtained by you in fighting corruption, appreciated and beyond Romania's borders are a guarantee that the process of strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Romania are on track. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that we will be increasingly more powerful in applying the constitutional principle that nobody is above the law and to align our established practice in countries with democracies that put the citizen at the center of any policy”, stated Klaus Iohannis.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

Furthermore, substantial repairs on the rigging were needed, and she needed her hull heated to kill worms. La Poype de Vertrieu wrote [...] "it appears that Marseillois shall never be an exceptional sailor, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that she will give satisfaction".|$|E

500|$|In May 1836 Bennett {{travelled}} to Düsseldorf in {{the company}} of Davison to attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival for the first performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio St Paul. Bennett's visit was enabled by a subsidy by the piano-making firm of John Broadwood & Sons. Inspired by his journey up the Rhine, Bennett began work on his overture The Naiads (Op. 15). After Bennett left for home, Mendelssohn wrote to their mutual friend, the English organist and composer Thomas Attwood, [...] "I think him the most promising young musician I know, not only in your country but also here, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> if he does not become a very great musician, it is not God's will, but his own".|$|E
500|$|Visitors to Seeon {{included}} Prince Felix Yusupov, {{husband of}} Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who wrote, [...] "I claim categorically {{that she is}} not Anastasia Nicolaievna, but just an adventuress, a sick hysteric and a frightful playactress. I simply cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this. If you had seen her, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that you would recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar." [...] Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.|$|E

500|$|The Duke and Duchess {{settled in}} France. In May 1939, the Duke was {{commissioned}} by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) {{during a visit to}} the battlefields of Verdun. In it he appealed for peace, saying [...] "I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what I am about to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war." [...] The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America. It was widely seen as supporting appeasement, and the BBC refused to broadcast it. It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.|$|E
500|$|As the {{new century}} began, Shaw became {{increasingly}} disillusioned by the limited impact of the Fabians on national politics. Thus, although a nominated Fabian delegate, he {{did not attend the}} London conference at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street in February 1900, that created the Labour Representation Committee—precursor of the modern Labour Party. By 1903, when his term as borough councillor expired, he had lost his earlier enthusiasm, writing: [...] "After six years of Borough Councilling <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that the borough councils should be abolished". Nevertheless, in 1904 he stood in the London County Council elections. After an eccentric campaign, which Holroyd characterises as [...] " [...] absolutely certain of not getting in", he was duly defeated. It was Shaw's final foray into electoral politics. Nationally, the 1906 general election produced a huge Liberal majority and an intake of 29 Labour members. Shaw viewed this outcome with scepticism; he had a low opinion of the new prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and saw the Labour members as inconsequential: [...] "I apologise to the Universe for my connection with such a body".|$|E
500|$|With {{decreasing}} album {{sales and}} a lack of commercially successful singles, Cher decided to further develop her acting career. While she had previously aspired to venture into film, she had only the critically and commercially unsuccessful movies Good Times and Chastity to her credit, and the Hollywood establishment did not take her seriously as an actress. She moved to New York in 1982 to take acting lessons with Lee Strasberg, founder of the Actors Studio, but never enrolled after her plans changed. She auditioned for and was signed by director Robert Altman for the Broadway stage production Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, playing a member of a James Dean fan club holding a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the film adaptation of the same title. Cher credits Altman for launching her acting career: [...] "Without Bob [...] I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that Bob {{was the only one who}} was brave enough to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|Handed {{complete}} {{managerial control}} following Mudie's resignation in May 1967, Matthews couldn't guide {{the club to}} success – instead, Port Vale were fined £4,000 in February/March 1968 and expelled from the Football League for financial irregularities. He was forced to use his name to plead with the other Football League clubs to re-elect the Vale, which they duly did. He stood down as manager in May 1968, and despite being owed £9,000 in salary and expenses, agreed to stay at Vale Park to continue his work with the youth team. A [...] "final settlement" [...] was reached in December 1970, Matthews was given £3,300, with the other £7,000 he was owed to be written off. Player Roy Sproson later said that [...] "he [...] trusted people who {{should never have been}} trusted and people took advantage of him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> a lot of people sponged off him and, all the while, the club were sliding." [...] The experience [...] "left a sour taste" [...] in his mouth, and was enough to convince him never to try his hand as management in English football again.|$|E
500|$|The {{couple had}} ten illegitimate children—five sons and five daughters—nine {{of whom were}} named after William's siblings; each was given the surname [...] "FitzClarence". Their affair lasted for twenty years before ending in 1811. Mrs. Jordan had no doubt as to {{the reason for the}} break-up: [...] "Money, money, my good friend, has, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> made HIM at this moment the most wretched of men," [...] adding, [...] "With all his {{excellent}} qualities, his domestic virtues, his love for his lovely children, what must he not at this moment suffer?" [...] She was given a financial settlement of £4,400 (equivalent to £ today) per year and custody of her daughters on condition that she did not resume the stage. When she resumed acting in an effort to repay debts incurred by the husband of one of her daughters from a previous relationship, William took custody of the daughters and stopped paying the £1,500 (equivalent to £ today) designated for their maintenance. After Mrs. Jordan's acting career began to fail, she fled to France to escape her creditors, and died, impoverished, near Paris in 1816.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, {{bombings and}} violent demonstrations {{led to a}} {{crackdown}} on dissent; Castro was placed under protective armed guard by supporters, before he and Raúl fled the country.

[...] The Castros and several comrades traveled to Mexico, which had a long history of offering asylum to leftist exiles. Here, Raúl befriended an Argentine doctor and Marxist-Leninist named Ernesto [...] "Che" [...] Guevara, a proponent of guerrilla warfare keen to join Cuba's Revolution. Fidel liked him, later describing him as [...] "a more advanced revolutionary than I was."
