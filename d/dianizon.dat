They {{were analyzed}} and studied by elemental analyses (C, H, N), electrical conductivities, VIS and IR spectroscopy andmagnetic as well as cyclic voltammetric measurements. In [Co 2 (C 6 H 5 COO) 2 tpmc](ClO 4) 2. 3 H 2 O, the benzoate ligands are most probably coordinated as chelates in the trans-position to each Co(II) and the macrocycle adopts a chair conformation. In the complexes [Co 2 (Y) tpmc](ClO 4) 2 ·zH 2 O, (Y = phthalate or i-phthalate <b>dianizon,</b> z = 2; 4), it is proposed that the isomeric dicarboxylates are bonded combined as bridges and chelates. The composition and the assumed geometries of the complexes are compared with the, earlier reported, corresponding Cu(II) complexes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that the compounds are electrochemically stable...|$|E
