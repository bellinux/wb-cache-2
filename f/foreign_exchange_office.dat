50|$|On {{the black}} market, the {{exchange}} rate was about 5 to 10 M to one DM. In the mid-1980s, one could easily visit <b>foreign</b> currency <b>exchange</b> <b>offices</b> in West Berlin and purchase East German banknotes (in denominations of 50 and 100 Mark der DDR) {{at the rate of}} 5 (East) = 1 (West). However, the GDR forbade the import or export of East German currency (as well as currencies of other socialist countries) into or out of the GDR, and penalties for violation ranged from confiscation of smuggled currency to imprisonment. The East German mark could not be spent in Intershops to acquire Western consumer goods; only hard currencies or Forum checks were accepted. As a result, the main purchasers of black market East German banknotes were Allied military personnel entering East Berlin, as they were exempt from East German customs inspection.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{importance}} of emerging stock exchanges has been demonstrated {{by the number of}} market studies. Although some of these stock exchanges such as those of Korea and Taiwan have been investigated extensively, there is only limited research on others including the Turkish stock exchange. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the short- and long-term relationship between Turkish stock prices, and the Turkish lira price of the US dollar. Turkish investors view both of these instruments as investments. The exchange offices in Turkey serve investors who continuously buy and sell foreign currencies. We expect that at least one market would cause the other one, and there could be a feedback relation or in the extreme case, there could even be long-run equilibrium between these two markets. Data for this study are obtained from a <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>office</b> and the Istanbul Stock Exchange for the period January 1988 to December 1994.
