5000|$|Early systems used rotary coolers, {{which were}} {{rotating}} cylinders {{similar to the}} kiln, into which the hot clinker dropped. [...] The combustion air was drawn up through the cooler as the clinker moved down, cascading through the air stream. In the 1920s, satellite coolers became common and remained in use until recently. These consist of a set (typically 7-9) of tubes attached to the kiln tube. They have the advantage that they are sealed to the kiln, and require no separate drive. From about 1930, the <b>grate</b> <b>cooler</b> was developed. This consists of a perforated grate through which cold air is blown, enclosed in a rectangular chamber. A bed of clinker up to 0.5 m deep moves along the grate. These coolers have two main advantages: they cool the clinker rapidly, which is desirable from a quality point of view (to avoid that alite, thermodynamically unstable below 1250 °C, revert to belite and free CaO on slow cooling), and, {{because they do not}} rotate, hot air can be ducted out of them for use in fuel drying, or for use as precalciner combustion air.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of a cement clinker cooler must always be the adequate cooling of the clinker product; however {{from the point of}} view of fuel economy, such coolers are also designed to utilise the sensible heat of the clinker to preheat the secondary air necessary for combustion. In modern, large capacity plant, the efficiency of heat recuperation has assumed a growing importance because of two related economic factors. The first is cutting fuel costs via the well understood benefits of heat recuperation; the second factor is the gradual improvement in fuel economy of cement kilns in general. As kilns become more finely tuned, the air required for combustion is reduced in direct proportion to the fuel usage, i. e. less air is available to cool a unit quantity of clinker. Hence, in order to avoid the situation where more air is supplied to the cooler than is required for complete combustion of the fuel, more efficient heat recuperation is needed. The Fuels and Energy Research Group at the University of Surrey (FERGUS), first became aware of these kiln/cooler problems in the late 1960 's, during the course of their pioneer work on the aerodynamics of rotary cement kilns. Consequently during the last decade, FERGUS has actively investigated the limitations of <b>grate</b> <b>cooler</b> systems, in general. In the initial stages of the research, a perspex water model was constructed at the University, based on some of the largest kilns in the world, those at. Northfleet Works of Blue Circle Industries. These coolers were experiencing "air sliding" of the clinker bed, causing red hot clinker to be dumped onto the rubber belt conveyors. Using suitable flow tracing media under controlled, scaled flow conditions, the aerodynamics of the Fuller <b>grate</b> <b>cooler</b> were studied, thus revealing that the air flow balance through the chambers at the hotter end of the cooler was more significant in its effect on the clinker bed than the balance at the colder end. A solution to this problem could then be achieved by using a three step grate. Water modelling, although giving quick visual solutions to aerodynamics problems, is only qualitative. In order to quantify results, various models of rotary kiln cooler systems have been constructed, in particular a 1 / 24 th scale model of the No. 2 kiln of Rugby Cement's South Ferriby Works. This kiln had for some time suffered from excessive wear rates in the burning zone refractory lining, an expensive problem in terms of down-time and rebricking. Air model pitot static measurements indicated that the air jet (representing the fuel/primary air stream) was exhibiting a peculiar "corkscrewing" effect, which could possibly be the cause of impingement on the refractory lining, leading to premature failure of the refractory coating. Correct kiln firing practice is to promote recirculation of combustion products; these gases, being cooler than the flame, protect the brickwork from overheating. It was already understood that the primary cause of flame impingement was a lack of recirculation due to insufficient burner momentum flux, the solution being a costly change in the firing system. However, the air model results were later verified by full scale plant trials and a solution was proposed to eliminate the "corkscrewing" effect by means of a wedge- shaped bluff body welded along the jet axis. This study has quantified the macro aerodynamic effects of <b>grate</b> <b>cooler</b> systems, through the media of air and water modelling. Considerable information has also been obtained on the dynamic behaviour and heat transfer mechanisms of a particular polysize bed of clinker particles. From this information, putative predictions can be made regarding the general behaviour of clinker in beds. Recommendations have been made for further studies in this area.

The cycle is well adapted to low moderate temperature heat sources such as waste heat from industrial plants and is widely used producing 600 MW of electric power from geothermal and waste heat resources. The ORC technology is applicable to heat recovery of medium size gas turbines and cement plants, and offers significant advantages over conventional steam bottoming cycles.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a thermodynamic model for the Grate-Kiln process. One application of such a process is the thermal treatment of iron ore pellets. The work has been performed in close collaboration with the iron ore producing company LKAB. The model is applied to assess the process in terms of heat and mass flows. The thermodynamic assessment is carried out on an overall basis and {{for each of the three}} main process parts: <b>grate,</b> kiln and <b>cooler.</b> The results reveal that the oxidation of the magnetite, contained in the inlet pellets, to hematite is the main heat source of the process. The heat release during the combustion of coal inside the kiln contributes to the remaining one third of the total heat supply. Half of the provided heat leaves the process as hot off gases. Thus, measures to improve the energy efficiency of the plant should focus on either reducing the mass flow of air that is heated by the process or making better use of the hot off gases. In order to shift the models usability towards quantitative application, different measures could be taken. Among these, improvements in the data for validation, and enhancements in the modelling of the chemical properties of the iron ore pellets promise the greatest benefits...|$|R

The line emission maps of Hubble V show the typical structure of a photo-dissociation region (PDR) where an ionized core, traced by compact He I emission (2. 0587 µm) and Brγ emission (2. 1661 µm), is surrounded by an outer layer traced by molecular hydrogen (H 2) emission. The measured line ratios of H 2 2 − 1 S(1) (2. 2477 µm) / 1 − 0 S(1) (2. 1218 µm) from 0. 2 to 0. 6 and the un-shifted and un-resolved line profiles suggest that the H 2 emission originates purely from a photo-dissociation region (PDR). By comparing the H 2 results with a PDR model, we conclude that Hubble V includes dense (10 4. 5 cm − 3) and warm PDRs. In this environment, most of the H 2 molecules are excited by far-UV photons (with a field strength of 10 2 − 4 {{times that of the}} average interstellar field), although collisional processes de-excite H 2 and contribute significantly to the excitation of the first vibrational level.

High resolution spectra are given of the 3. 29 micron emission feature which were taken with the <b>Cooled</b> <b>Grating</b> Array Spectrometer at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and previously published. These spectra show that the peak wavelength of the 3. 29 micron feature is located at 3. 295 + or - 0. 005 micron and that it is coincident with the peak absorbance of QCC. The peak wavelength of the 3. 29 micron feature appears to be the same in all of the sources observed thus far. However, the width of the feature in HD 44179 and Elias 1 is only 0. 023 micron, which is smaller than the 0. 043 micron width in NGC 7027, IRAS 21282 + 5050, the Orion nebula, and BD+ 30 deg 3639. Spectra of NGC 7027, QCC, and PAHs is shown. QCC matches the 3. 29 micron interstellar emission feature very closely in the wavelength of the peak, and it produces a single feature.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{different}} degradation mechanisms of the stainless steel in a travelling grate in a Grate-Kiln iron ore pellet indurator. The travelling grate is a conveyor belt that transports green-body pellets to a rotary kiln while the pellets are being dried and pre-heated to a temperature of 900 - 1100 °C by recycled hot air. After unloading of the pellets to the rotary-kiln for further sintering, the travelling <b>grate</b> is <b>cooled</b> in room temperature while returning to the loading zone of the wet pellets. The steel was tested during thermal cycling in a test-rig, in order to simulate the influence of thermo mechanical fatigue and oxide spallation. The influence of erosion-deposition was investigated in a modified horizontal industrial combustion kiln at 800 °C, with slag and coal from production used as erosive media and combustion fuel, respectively. The influence of minor alloying additions of Mn, Si and Ti on the microstructure was explored by eight different casted alloy compositions. Isothermal heat treatments were performed at 800 °C during 200 hours on steel immersed in deposits recovered from a travelling grate in production. The three main degradation mechanisms found in this work are thermal spallation, erosion-deposition and deposit induced accelerated corrosion (DIAC). Thermal spallation of the oxide layer {{is caused by the}} thermal expansion difference between the oxide and the metal during heating and cooling. It has been found that Ti improves the spallation resistance while Si reduces it. Spallation of deposits is another cause believed to increase the degradation. Erosion-deposition appears due to simultaneous erosion and deposition of particles on the travelling grate that causes erosion or deposition depending on the amount of alkali metals in the environment. The velocity of the particles also influences erosion and deposition in the way that higher velocities increase erosion. DIAC is proposed to form on the travelling grate due to the concentration of chloride- and sulphate containing alkali metals in the deposits.  Other than these major degrading mechanisms, minor degradation mechanisms such as internal oxidation, sigma formation, carburization and sensitization towards inter-granular attack have been found inside the steel during heating. Thermo mechanical fatigue (TMF) causes intergranular cracks in the material of the travelling grate. Casting issues such as micro-segregation have also been addressed in this thesis. A few different ways to improve degradation resistance have been proposed, such as homogenization heat treatments, optimization of process parameters and inhibitor solutions. ...|$|R

The central wavelength (3. 36 microns) and width (approx. 0. 15 microns) {{of the strongest}} feature coincide with those observed in comet Halley. A weaker emission feature at 3. 52 microns and a strong feature extending shortward of 2. 9 microns were also detected. This brings the number of comets in which these three features have been seen to three, two new (Bradfield, Wilson) and one old (Halley). It seems almost certain that the 3. 4 micron features are emissions by C-H groups in complex molecules. Based on the similarity of the 3. 4 micron features in comets Halley and Wilson, the authors suggest that {{a particular set of}} organic compounds may be common to all comets (Brooke et al. 1988 a). The absence of the feature in some comets could then be due to photodestruction or evaporation of the organics when the comet approaches the sun, in combination with a predominance of thermal emission from non C-H emitting grains. Detection of the 3. 4 micron emission feature in comet Bradfield at 4 = 0. 9 AU provides support for this argument. Complex organics in comets could have been formed by particle irradiation of parent ices in the nucleus or been incorporated as grains at the time the comets formed. Since the most heavily irradiated layers of Halley would have been lost in its hundreds of perihelion passages, the authors believe the more likely explanation is that the 3. 4 micron emitting material was incorporated in comet nuclei at the time of formation. The 3. 4 micron comet feature resembles, but is not identical to, the interstellar 3. 29 micron (and longer wavelength) emission features and the broad 3. 4 micron feature seen in absorption toward the Galactic center. Detailed comparisons of cometary and interstellar organics will require comet spectra with signal-to-noise and spectral resolution comparable to that available in spectra of the interstellar medium. Such observations are currently being planned...|$|R
