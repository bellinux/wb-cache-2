40|$|<b>Flyingfish</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} individual species group in the Martinican fishery, with 370 mt caught in 1987 (11, 3 % of the total). The fishery operates on the west coast of the island, using gillnets and open boats powered by outboard engines. The fishery is seasonal, with virtually no <b>flyingfish</b> catch being landed between august and november, low catches in february and march and relatively high catches {{for the remainder of the}} year. In the Southern landing sites, fishermen saitch their activity between <b>flyingfish</b> and large pelagics. The <b>flyingfish</b> fishery is not limited by the resource, but marketing problems, which leads the fishermen to limit their own catch. As a result, a project has been implemented at a central landing site to improve the landed value of <b>flyingfish</b> through processing (filleting and smoking). (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

50|$|Like {{many other}} <b>flyingfishes,</b> the blacksail flyingfish has a {{cylindrical}} body, and large tail and pectoral fins that it uses for flight. Most adults are roughly 28 cm long and are generally dark iridescent blue above, silvery white below. Pectoral fins {{are black and}} with a yellowish stripe in middle. Pelvic fins have prominent black spot, which can clearly identify the species. Juveniles are different to the adults {{by the presence of}} dark bars on body. There are 13 to 15 dorsal soft rays and 8 to 11 anal soft rays.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} <b>flyingfishes,</b> the Atlantic flyingfish has a {{cylindrical}} body, and large tail and pectoral fins that it uses for flight. To fly, the Atlantic flyingfish {{jumps out of}} the water, uses its pectoral fins to catch air currents and provide lift, and beats its tail back and forth to provide thrust. The longest recorded individual was 32 cm long, but most adults are roughly 25 cm long. Atlantic flyingfish are generally green to blue dorsally, and white or silver ventrally. After reaching a speed of 30 km/h, Atlantic flyingfish can jump {{out of the water and}} glide about 3 to 12 m. This is presumably done to avoid ocean-going predators.|$|E

50|$|The {{order is}} {{sometimes}} divided up into two suborders, the Adrianichthyoidei and the Belonoidei. The Adrianichthyoidei contains {{only a single}} family, the Adrianichthyidae. Originally, the Adrianichthyidae {{were included in the}} Cyprinidontiformes and assumed to be closely related to the killifish, but a closer relationship to the beloniforms is indicated by various characteristics including the absence of the interhyal, resulting in the upper jaw being fixed or nonprotrusible. The Belonoidei may also be further subdivided into two superfamilies, the Scomberesocoidea and the Exocoetoidea. The Scomberesocoidea contains the Belonidae and Scomberesocidae, while the Exocoetoidea comprises the Exocoetidae and Hemiramphidae. However, newer evidence finds that the <b>flyingfishes</b> are nested within the halfbeaks, and the needlefish and sauries are nested within the subfamily Zenarchopterinae of the family Hemiramphidae, which has been recognized as its own family. The sauries are also nested within the family Belonidae.|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. To {{investigate}} jaw {{evolution in}} beloniform fishes, we reconstructed the phylogeny of 54 species using fragments of two nuclear (RAG 2 and Tmo- 4 C 4) and two mitochondrial (cytochrome b and 16 S rRNA) genes. Our total molecular evidence topology refutes the monophyly of needlefishes (Belonidae) and half-beaks (Hemiramphidae), but supports the monophyly of <b>flyingfishes</b> (Exocoetidae) and sauries (Scombere-socidae). <b>Flyingfishes</b> are nested within halfbeaks, and sauries are nested within needlefishes. Optimization of jaw characters {{on the tree}} reveals a diverse array of evolutionary changes in ontogeny. During their development, needlefishes pass through a ‘‘halfbeak’ ’ stage that closely resembles the adult condition in the hemiramphid halfbeaks. The reconstruction of jaw transitions falsifies the hypothesis that halfbeaks are paedomorphic derivatives of needlefishes. Instead, halfbeaks make up a basal paraphyletic grade within beloniforms, and the needlefish jaw morphology is relatively derived. The parallel between needlefish on-togeny and beloniform phylogeny is discussed, and clades amenable to future morphological analysis are proposed...|$|E
40|$|The flyingfish family Exocoetidae is {{a diverse}} group of marine fishes that are {{widespread}} and abundant in tropical and subtropical seas. <b>Flyingfishes</b> are epipelagic specialists that are easily distinguished by their enlarged fins, which are used for gliding leaps over the surface of the water. Although phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed for flyingfish genera based on morphology, no comprehensive molecular studies have been performed. In the present study, we describe a species-level molecular phylogeny for the family Exocoetidae, based on data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1137 bp) and the nuclear RAG 2 gene (882 bp). We find strong support for previous morphology-based phylogenetic hypotheses, as well as the monophyly of most currently accepted flyingfish genera. However, the most diverse genus Cheilopogon is not monophyletic. Using our novel flyingfish topology, we examine previously proposed hypotheses for the origin and evolution of gliding. The results support the progressive transition from two-wing to four-wing gliding. We also use phylogenetic approaches to test the macroecological effects of two life history characters (e. g. egg buoyancy and habitat) on species range size in <b>flyingfishes.</b>  © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 102, 161 – 174...|$|E

40|$|Larval catch data {{after the}} oil spill {{is being used to}} improve our {{understanding}} of the causes of temporal variability {{as it relates to the}} Deep Water Horizon oil spill (DWHOS). Bongo and neuston net tows were conducted at 48 stations in both June and July, 2015 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Cruise data collected at each site included latitude/longitude, date, time and environmental data (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen). The occurrence and density of selected epipelagic (e. g., billfishes, tunas, dolphinfishes, <b>flyingfishes)</b> and deep pelagic (e. g., lanternfishes, bristlemouths, marine hatchetfishes) fish larvae were quantified and are being used to extend the pre- and post-DWHOS time series to better understand the drivers of natural variability in abundance for these taxa.

40|$|The 40 life history, myological, and osteological {{characters}} that Tibbetts (1992) {{used in his}} study of the hemiramphids are evaluated for both saury genera (Cololabis and Scomberesox) to determine if the Scomberesocidae are more closely related to the Zenarchopteridae, to the needlefishes (Belonidae), or to the halfbeaks (Hemiramphidae) and <b>flyingfishes</b> (Exocoetidae). Data were analyzed using PAUP*, and eight equally parsimonious trees were found (70 steps, CI 0. 814, RI 0. 938). This analysis indicates that sauries are most closely related to needlefishes, supporting the historical concept of the superfamily Scomberesocoidea as a monophyletic assemblage. A caudal displacement of the origin of the retractor dorsalis muscle is a tentative additional synapomorphy for all four saury species. Zenarchopteridae is strongly supported as a valid family sister to the Scomberesocoidea (decay index = 19, bootstrap = 100).
