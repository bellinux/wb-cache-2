40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{electrostatic}} precipitator and a <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> on size resolved fly ash particle concentration and composition were studied in a 6 MW biomass combustion unit, fired with moist forest residue. The boiler was of moving grate type. The fly ash particles were sampled upstream and downstream of the electrostatic precipitator and <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser,</b> respectively. Fine particle number size distributions were measured using an electric mobility spectrometer (SMPS) and coarse particle number size distributions were measured using a time-of-flight instrument (APS). The mass size distributions were measured using a multi-jet low pressure cascade impactor (DLPI). For chemical analyses of the impactor substrates particle induced X-ray emission analysis (PIXE) was used. After the flue gas passed the electrostatic precipitator (ESP), the fly ash particle concentration was reduced by approximately 96 % by number and 83 % by mass. After the particles passed the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser,</b> particle number concentration was only marginally altered, whereas the mass concentration was reduced by half. Both the ESP and the condenser showed, size dependent particle separation efficiency. The main elements (Z > 12) in the fine fly ash fraction were K, S, and Cl, whereas the main elements in the coarse fraction were Ca, K, S, and Cl. After passing the ESP the mass ratio of Ca decreased in the coarse fraction, while the ratios of K, S, and Cl increased, indicating transference of fly ash material from the fine to the coarse particle fraction.

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{executed}} as an assignment by Sundsvall Energi AB {{with the purpose of}} increasing the efficiency of the flue gas condenser by cooling the incoming district heating return before the flue gas condensing exchanger. The <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> is part of the heat production. The first production unit is the waste boiler where the steam can be distributed between production of electricity and heat production, depending on how large the costumers needs of electricity and heat are. When the customers’ needs are less than Korstaverkets maximum production, an addition of heat from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> means that a larger portion of the steam can go to the turbine and increase the production of electricity. When the customer’s needs are larger than Korstaverkets maximum capacity, a contribution from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> means that Korstaverket can purchase less heat from SCA (Ostrand and Ortviken). The benefit of cooling the district heating return is that more heat and electricity can be produced. In {{the early stages of the}} project, literature and the Internet were used to get a basic understanding of the assignment. The supervisor and the staff at Korsta have given drawings and data of the power plant process, and also given advice regarding the process. Product data sheets from suppliers have been used for doing calculations and for getting information about the construction. Scientific articles and literature were used to get facts and formulas. The study has shown that the additional cooling of the district heating return has contributed to an increased efficiency of the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser,</b> from 0. 9 % with an average flow of the deionized water to 17. 2 % with a maximum flow of the deionized water.   The exam work has shown how complicated an energy system can be. The process can be more complicated then what the drawings show, because a profitable solution in one part of the process can lead to deterioration in another part of the process. The calculations show that the major factor that’s influencing the cooling is the deionized waters flow into the new heat exchanger. The repayment period can get short. High flows generate a profit after only a couple of months, while low flows of 1 liter/second take up to 3. 5 years with KE Therms brazed heat exchangers and 2. 5 years with Tranters gasketed heat exchangers. ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} use of biofuels for heat and energy generation there is a growing concern about emissions from their combustion. It has been shown that biofuel furnaces emit relatively high quantities of particulate matter in comparison to natural gas and light fuel oil furnaces. Majority of the emitted particulates are smaller than 10 μm with high contribution of fine (12) contributed to 21 – 34 % of PM 1 mass, of which K, S, Cl and Ca contributed to 18 – 33 % of PM 1 mass, and Zn, Mn, Fe, Cr, Pb and Cd to 1 – 3 %. Emitted concentrations of heavy metals depended on type of the fuel and operating load. Forest residues gave relatively high emissions of Zn, Cr, Cd and Pb, while pellets gave high emissions of Zn and Cd. The lowest emissions of heavy metals came from the combustion of sawdust. Particulate organic (OC) and elemental (EC) carbon contribution to PM 1 ranged from 1 - 19 % and 0 - 56 %, respectively. Particulate OC concentrations strongly depended on the operation load regardless the type of the fuel, while EC concentrations seemed to depend both on load and the type of the fuel. Both ESP and <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> showed size dependant particle separation efficiency. ESP proved to remove 96 % of particle number concentration and 83 % of mass concentration, whereas <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> did not alter the particle number concentration to a significant degree but reduced the mass concentration by half. Obtained results characterise particle emission from combustion of commonly used solid biofuels. This type of data is useful for assessment of biofuels combustion impact on environment and human health. It can also be used, together with the presented results on collection efficiencies of ESP and <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser,</b> for optimisation of combustion technologies and development of efficient and cost effective emission control measures...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize fine particle emissions with a view to pinpoint parameters influencing the emissions. Additionally effectiveness of used flue gas cleaning techniques was assessed. The results show that large quantities of fine particles are emitted to the atmosphere from both boilers. From 1 MW boiler equipped only in multicyclone 4. 8 * 107 of particles/cm 3 (particles with diameter smaller than 0. 6 μm) are emitted to the atmosphere. From 6 MW boiler equipped in multicyclone, ESP and <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> 1. 7 * 106 of particles/cm 3 (< 0. 6 μm) end up in the atmosphere. Significant fluctuations in the coarse mode (1 - 10 μm) number concentration over time were observed in 1 MW boiler (between 100 and 10000 particles/cm 3) and these were much higher than in 6 MW boiler (between 6000 and 11000 particles/cm 3).

40|$|Biomass boiler houses {{face some}} typical {{problems}} and a task {{of this work}} is to recognize these problems, {{to find out the}} causes and solutions how to decrease its influence for boiler house operation. Main tasks of the first tests were to perform operating parameters measurements when feeding furnace with average moisture content fuel and dry fuel, to calculate boiler efficiency and to analyze boiler behavior combusting various moisture content fuel. Different grate movements cycles ratio values was noticed. This ration influence in fuel layer thickness on grate, and the higher the ratio, the thicker fuel layer is. Primary air pressure dependence on fuel layer thickness confirms this statement. Different movement of first and second grate part causes fuel layer to fracture. As fuel moisture increases, grate movements cycles ratio should be increased as well. Biomass combustion from bottom to top was noticed. Thin hot coal layer covers the grate and primary air works as catalyst. Hot <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> dries wet fuel as it flows thru it. Possibilities to improve combustion process were determined. Increasing primary air amount would speed up fuel drying process. Combustion air-preheating acts as catalyst not only for drying, but also for ignition and intensification of combustion process. Recirculation <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> flow will dry fuel more quickly if it will not be mixed with primary air. Mixing hot <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> with cold air, mixture temperature drops below water vapor saturation temperature and excess moisture condensates. Increasing grate movements cycle’s ratio improves combustion of wet fuel, however primary air flows has to be redistributed as well. There was no need to change any settings to combust biomass with 54 % moisture content, existing regime card was enough. Feeding wet fuel causes boiler water outlet temperature to decrease, i. e. boiler load decreases. In order to increase boiler load, fuel feeding was increased manually. After increasing fuel amount, secondary and tertiary air fans speed increased automatically, causing higher air excess ratio. Tertiary air set value was decreased manually to maintain lower air excess ratio. Combustion process has stabilized after increasing primary air first and second fan load and decreasing third primary air fan load. Wet fuel contained high amount of conifers spikes, which has ~ 1, 8 % fuel nitrogen content, therefore higher nitrogen oxides emissions were measured. Fuel moisture content has a highest influence for thermal capacity of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condensing</b> economizer, moreover the higher moisture content is the more significant effect on economizer capacity it has. <b>Flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature after economizer and air excess ratio also has significant effect. To increase <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condensing</b> economizer efficiency, air excess ratio must be kept as low as possible. Continuously CO measurement would help to decrease air excess ratio. <b>Flue</b> <b>gas</b> inlet temperature has low effect to the thermal capacity of condensing economizer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOxyfuel {{combustion}} is {{a leading}} potential CO 2 capture technology for power plants. As the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> (FG) consists of mainly H 2 O and CO 2, a simpler and more energy-efficient CO 2 purification method can be used instead of the standard amine-based chemical absorption approach. For the system of oxyfuel combustion with cryogenic CO 2 purification, decreasing the oxygen purity reduces the energy consumption of the Air Separation Unit (ASU) but increases the energy consumption for the downstream cryogenic purification. Thus there exists a trade-off between the energy consumption of the ASU and that for cryogenic purification. This paper investigates the potential efficiency improvement by optimizing this trade-off. The simulated results show that there exists an optimum <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condensing</b> pressure for the cryogenic purification, which {{is affected by the}} <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> composition. In addition, decreasing the oxygen purity reduces the combined energy consumption of the ASU and the cryogenic purification, and therefore can improve the electrical efficiency. In summary, prior oxyfuel combustion analyses have assumed a high oxygen purity level of 95 mol% or 99 mol% for the combustion air, which achieves a high CO 2 concentration in the <b>flue</b> <b>gases.</b> In this Paper, we demonstrate that a lower level of oxygen purity, such as 80 mol%, in conjunction with a more extensive cryogenic purification of the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> can lower the total energy consumption, thereby yielding a significant benefit. However, for oxygen purity levels lower than 75 mol%, it may not be possible to still use the two-stage flash system shown here to achieve a CO 2 purity of 95 mol% and a CO 2 recovery rate of 90 % simultaneously...|$|R

The heat exchanger is composed of a spiral finned tube bank having 3 rows and 8 tubes per row with a staggered arrangement. The fin spacings considered are 2. 85 and 6. 10 mm. The theories of thermodynamics and heat transfer are used for analyzing the performance of this system. In this experiment, the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature of 200 ºC from combustion having 0. 35 kg/s mass flow rate flows along outside surface of the heat exchanger and transfers heat to the 25 ºC cooling water having 0. 15 kg/s mass flow rate flowing in the tube side.

50|$|Each {{unit had}} two large Forced Draught (FD) Fans. For {{efficiency}} these fans drew warm air from an intake {{at the top}} of the station. This combustion air was passed through the Air Heater which increased its temperature. Dampers were used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace and direct some of the air to the Primary Air (PA) Fans.There were also two large Induced Air (ID) Fans on each unit. These drew the hot gases from the Boiler, through the Air Heater where the heat is transferred to the incoming combustion air. The gases were then exhausted up the chimney. The exhaust flow of these fans was also controlled by dampers in the ducting.Working in tandem the Draught plant ensured the boiler was always under a slight vacuum. This created a draw of combustion air into the boiler and an exhaust to the chimney.

The positive impact on the direct contact heat exchanger by the decreased district heating (DH) network return temperature shows that introduction of the 4 th generation DH system increases the energy efficiency of the heat exchanger. In order to make an assessment, the methodology suggested in the paper can be used in each particular situation...|$|R

The author recently published the first combustion efficiency charts for the combustion of biofuels, namely biodiesel and yellow grease. The charts give values of efficiency down to a stack temperature of 250 F. At this temperature no condensation of water vapour in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> occurs. <b>Condensing</b> boilers, water heaters, and hot air furnaces are increasingly being utilized. In order to easily measure the performance of these devices or to do analysis {{of the effect of}} various changes (particularly important is the effect of stack oxygen content) one must utilize combustion efficiency charts for condensing equipment. This paper describes the development of charts for this application and gives charts for two important biofuels: biodiesel and yellow grease. Since these charts are the first publication of results of this type, the paper represents an important milestone in two areas that are evolving in mankind’s quest to secure a renewable energy supply and to reduce harmful emissions by operating equipment on biofuels at maximum efficiency (i. e. utilizing latent heat in stack gases through condensation). dc 201...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} {{investigated}} a multi-pollutant {{flue gas cleaning}} concept based on oxidation using chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) gas with subsequent absorption. The chlorine dioxide gas converts the relatively insoluble nitric oxide (NO) to the more soluble nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). This makes a downstream wet scrubbing process feasible for simultaneous removal of sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). An experimental evaluation of the proposed process using chlorine dioxide gas has been performed on a laboratory scale. The experimental setup, designed and built by Akzo Nobel, consists of a reactor for oxidation, a <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> and a wet scrubber. The results show that ClO 2 gas oxidises NO with high efficiencies under {{a wide range of}} process conditions, also in the presence of sulphur dioxide (SO 2). The more ClO 2 gas is added, the higher the degree of NO oxidation and the total nitrogen oxides (NOx) removal efficiency becomes. The results also show that the presence of water strongly increases the removal of SO 2, which is believed to be an effect of liquid phase nitrogen-sulphur interactions. The absorption solution, sodium carbonate and sodium sulphite, is efficient in removing NOx (especially NO 2) from the oxidised flue gas. The total NOx reduction at 0. 6 ClO 2 :NO mole ratio and subsequent wet scrubbing is between 79 % and 94 %, depending on the process conditions used. The total SO 2 reduction in the scrubber is between 97 % and 100 % independent of ClO 2 gas addition. Furthermore, the total NOx balance shows that the major part of the NOx is converted to nitrate in the condensate liquor and as nitrite in the absorption solution. A higher ClO 2 gas addition and a higher reactor temperature convert more of the NOx to nitrite in the absorption solution...|$|E
40|$|A {{short and}} medium term method to {{decrease}} {{carbon dioxide emissions}} is carbon capture and storage. This method captures carbon dioxide from point sources of emissions and then stores the carbon dioxide in geological formations. The aim of this thesis is to analyse and compare {{two different types of}} combined cycles that are well suited for carbon capture and storage. The cycles are the Graz cycle and the Semi Closed Oxy-fuel Combustion Cycle (SCOC-CC). The power output of the cycles analysed here is around 100 MW, which is in the mid-size power output range. The two cycles are compared to a conventional cycle that has a net efficiency of 56 %. Two different layouts of the Graz cycle have been compared in this thesis. The first is a more advanced layout that incorporates a second bottoming cycle, which utilizes the heat of condensation from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser.</b> The second layout is a simplified version of the Graz cycle that does not incorporate the second bottoming cycle, and is as such more comparable to the layout of both a conventional combined cycle and the SCOC-CC. The more advanced Graz cycle has around 48 % net efficiency, while the simplified Graz cycle and the SCOC-CC has around 46. 2 % efficiency. Another aim was to develop tools that are able to design the gas turbines that are used in oxy-fuel combustion cycles. The combustion products are mainly steam and carbon dioxide. This influences the properties of the working media in the gas turbines used in the cycles. Traditional design tools for the gas turbine therefore need modification. The thesis describes the conceptual design tool used to design the compressor part of the gas turbines. The tool is based on a one dimensional model that uses empirical data to compute losses. The thesis also describes the development of a two dimensional compressor design method. The Graz cycle has a high water content while the SCOC-CC has a high carbon dioxide content. This difference in the working fluid will result in the turbomachinery being smaller for the Graz cycle compared to the SCOC-CC. A twin-shaft gas turbine was concluded to be better suited than a one shaft for the two oxy-fuel combustion cycles. However, the first stage of the power turbine needs to be cooled...|$|E
40|$|The use of biomass-based {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP) plants {{is considered by}} the EU administration to be an effective way to increase the use of renewables in the energy system, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to alleviate the dependency on imported fossil fuels. At present in Sweden, most of the CHP plants are operated in part-load mode because of variations in heat demand. Further use of the potential heat capacity from CHP plants is an opportunity for integration with other heat-demanding processes. Retrofitting the conventional CHP plants by integration with bioethanol and pellet production processes is considered a feasible and efficient way to improve the plants’ performances.   Modeling and simulation of the CHP plant integrated with feedstock upgrading, bioethanol production and pellet production is performed to analyze the technical and economic feasibility. When integrating with bioethanol production, the exhaust flue gas from the CHP plant is used to dry the hydrolysis solid residues (HSR) instead of direct condensation in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> (FGC). This drying process not only increases the overall energy efficiency (OEE) of the CHP plant but also increases the power output relative to the system using only a FGC. Furthermore, if steam is extracted from the turbine of the CHP plant and if it is used to dry the HSR together with the exhaust flue gas, pellets can be produced and the bioethanol production costs can be reduced by 30 % compared with ethanol cogeneration plants.   Three optional pellet production processes integrated with an existing biomass-based CHP plant using different raw materials are studied to determine their annual performance. The option of pellet production integrated with the existing CHP plant using exhaust flue gas and superheated steam for drying allows for a low specific pellet production cost, short payback time and significant CO 2 reduction. A common advantage of the three options is a dramatic increase in the total annual power production and a significant CO 2 reduction, in spite of a decrease in power efficiency.   The retrofitted biomass-based CHP plants {{play a crucial role in}} the present and future regional energy system. The total costs are minimized for the studied energy system by using wastes as energy sources. Analyses of scenarios for the coming decades are performed to describe how to achieve a regional fossil fuel-free energy system. It is possible to achieve the target by upgrading and retrofitting the present energy plants and constructing new ones. The conditions and obstacles have also been presented and discussed through optimizing the locations for proposed new energy plants and planting energy crops. REMOWE, CS...|$|E

40|$|The {{operational}} eco-intensity of a {{heat supply}} system {{is dependent upon}} the interaction of its elements and their common performance. It is of special importance to gain insight into possibilities to reduce chip fuel consumption in the case when an additional element − a <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> – is installed in a boiler house. The efficiency of a system's operation is estimated by its eco-intensity; such estimates concern the influence exerted by technological parameters on the reduction in natural resource consumption, allowing this problem to be thoroughly analysed by means of definite factors promoting the eco-intensity rise. Based {{on the results of}} commercial experiment, the authors have found the independent variables for the case of <b>gas</b> <b>condenser</b> without packing. The eco-intensity of a boiler house operation decreases as the outdoor temperature falls and therefore the boiler’s load should be increased. This aspect could be due to several causes, among which the most important are: the deviations of the operating parameters of the <b>gas</b> <b>condenser,</b> the increase in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> velocity, and temperature. Analytical treatment of the influence exerted by a boiler’s specific load on the operational efficiency of its energy has shown that as this former grows, the efficiency decreases and therefore less heat energy could be derived from the <b>gas</b> <b>condenser.</b> This should be taken into account at simulation of the control over a gas condenser’s operation...|$|R
