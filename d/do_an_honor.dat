Recently, during a peer critique session in which I was helping the students review each other’s résumé drafts, I noticed that a student had listed <b>a</b> number of <b>honors</b> program activities and scholarships. She had not taken honors freshman composition with me, so I mentioned to her that I noticed she was in the honors program. Her immediate, rapid-fire, and completely unsolicited response took me by surprise: “Yeah, but the scholarship only lasts four years, and I have to do another year because I have to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> senior project for my major, and I don’t want to <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>honors</b> thesis on top of that, so I won’t be in the honors program anymore. ...|$|R

[...] The Citadel ring is 10 karat gold with no gem stone; the design does not change with each class {{with the exception of the}} class year. One of the core values of The Citadel is <b>a</b> <b>Honor</b> Code that mandates that all students, both cadets and civilians, not lie, cheat, steal or tolerate those who <b>do.</b> <b>A</b> cadet-run <b>Honor</b> Court investigates all alleged violations and conducts trials. The penalty may result in expulsion, although recommendations for leniency may be forwarded to the President of the College for consideration.|$|R

Giovanni Fontana took over the building of the aqueduct, which was completed by June 1587. A fountain was constructed by architect engineer Domenico Fontana {{in the form of an}} ancient Roman triumphal arch. It featured, as ancient Roman fountains <b>did,</b> <b>an</b> inscription <b>honoring</b> its builder, Pope Sixtus. beneath angels holding the papal coat of arms. Within each of the three arches were sculptures on Old Testament subjects. The central arch featured a large statue of Moses, made in 1588 by Leonardo Sormani and Prospero da Brescia. To the left is Aaron, sculpted by Giovanni Battista della Porta and to the right is Joshua sculpted by Flaminio Vacca and Pietro Paolo Olivieri. Water flows from the statues into basins, where four lions are spouting water.|$|R

40|$|Much {{has been}} written {{over the last several}} years about the {{increase}} in the number of students who come to our campuses with behavioral disorders and under medication. While honors students are certainly not immune to these conditions, the more frequent emotional trauma we see them suffer is their first encounter with failure. Luckily, we can address this trauma successfully if we are prepared to <b>do</b> so. <b>As</b> <b>honors</b> faculty, we encourage intellectual risk, knowing from our own experience that failure may very well result but confident in the fact that learning also happens despite other outcomes, good or bad. Armed with this knowledge, one of the most important lessons we can teach our students is how to fail. Our high-achieving students, as they emerge from their pre-baccalaureate education and childhood experience, typically reach us ill-equipped to fail. They have always had cheerleaders, parachutes, ribbons, and rewards to the extent that they consider even good performance inadequate. The first “B” grade can send such students into a tailspin, leading them to question their abilities and their very identities, which are often wrapped up in their definitions of success. Along with teaching our disciplines, then, we need to teach students a few lessons on how and why to fail...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} a mathematics classroom {{where students}} are taught mathematics through problem solving. Weekly observations of two different classrooms were <b>done.</b> One was <b>an</b> <b>Honors</b> of Math 10 class {{and the other was}} a Math 11 class. In addition to the observations, student interviews were conducted throughout the semester with the intent of speaking to a number of students with a broad range of ability levels and diverse attitudes about mathematics. The aim was to explore whether or not students will buy in. Is it possible to create this dynamic, problem solving environment consistently within a classroom? Can it be done {{within the context of the}} current curriculum? How does teaching through problem solving affect low achieving students? And how does this pedagogy influence students 2 ̆ 7 relationships with mathematics? The findings show that creating this environment is possible even within the current provincial curriculum and moreover, that this pedagogy generally led students to experience a deeper engagement with mathematical ideas...|$|R

That Professor Kidane found seeds for scholarly discourse within a book intended primarily for nonacademics is a testament to his comprehensive understanding of U.

First, I examine Professor Kidane’s claim that current U. S. immigration policy operates more like a unilateral or adhesion contract than a bilateral one. Second, I explore the notion that due process is at risk when one views immigration policy through a contract prism...|$|R
