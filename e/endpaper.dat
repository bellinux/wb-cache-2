5|$|Originally Allen & Unwin {{planned to}} {{illustrate}} the book only with the <b>endpaper</b> maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two <b>endpaper</b> maps. The illustrated scenes were: The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water, The Trolls, The Mountain Path, The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate, Beorn's Hall, Mirkwood, The Elvenking's Gate, Lake Town, The Front Gate, and The Hall at Bag-End. All {{but one of the}} illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} {{one of the}} {{important}} peritextual features of picturebooks - the <b>endpapers.</b> In order to represent the rich diversity of form and function displayed by <b>endpapers,</b> we group examples along two dimensions: whether the <b>endpapers</b> are illustrated or unillustrated, and whether the front and back end papers are identical or dissimilar. Within the four categories delineated by these two dimensions, we further articulate the various roles that <b>endpapers</b> can play in the construction of meaning from picturebooks. We present quotations from young children that show how they use <b>endpapers</b> as resources for literary and aesthetic interpretation, and provide suggestions for the integration of talk about <b>endpapers</b> within classroom literature discussions...|$|R

25|$|A {{series of}} {{changes to the}} book suggest Houghton Mifflin printed the first edition several times. The {{earliest}} copies show the same bowing hobbit emblem on the title page as is visible on the cover, but in outline. At some point, however, the publisher replaced the emblem on the title page with a seated flautist. This earliest printing also has no half-title page. The first two printings mistakenly identify Chapter VII as Chapter VI on page 118, a defect corrected in the third. While generally similar in all the variants, the binding's cloth changes in color and texture in step with other changes. The first printing's table of illustrations lists Thrór's map as the front <b>endpaper,</b> {{in accordance with the}} text (page 30) but contradicting the actual order. The later printings of the first edition list the Wilderland map as the front <b>endpaper,</b> in accordance with the actual order but contradicting the text. This mess was not fully straightened out until the second edition.|$|E
25|$|Corrections to {{the text}} block as {{described}} above account for three distinct printings. A strong {{case can be made}} for at least one more. Some books with third printing characteristics come bound in one of three tan book cloths that differ from those used in the other printings. The earlier bindings contain a yellowish-green pall that two of these later bindings lack completely. Another difference from earlier printings {{can be found in the}} <b>endpaper</b> maps. They are printed on stock that has not been calendered as smoothly as the earlier printings. Lastly, slight deterioration of the printing plates betrays their age. Type defects apparently unique to this last printing are found in the table below as broken A.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{have been}} found with the maps as free leaves, rather than pasted down. Invariably these have been a library edition. Most of those seen have been bound in orange cloth. The front cover mimics the first edition dust jacket, silk-screened in black. Because several {{identical}} examples of the library edition have been reported, and because the <b>endpaper</b> maps show no evidence of having been glued down originally, {{it would not have}} come about as ad hoc rebinds by libraries. Rather, a major bindery is assumed to have sourced the text block directly from the publisher. Not enough specimens have been examined to know if library bindings were supplied for all the printings. This library edition trimmed a full 5mm from the text block's outside margin and a combined 3mm vertically.|$|E
50|$|Before mass {{printing}} in the 20th century it {{was common}} for the <b>endpapers</b> of books to have paper marbling. Sometimes the <b>endpapers</b> are used for maps or other relevant information. They are the traditional place to put bookplates, or an owner's inscription.|$|R

500|$|During {{the course}} of the tale's development, Warne {{proposed}} launching Mr. Tod as the first in a new series of tales in slightly larger formats with elaborate bindings to accommodate wider spines. Potter objected. She did not want to become involved in a new series; her eyesight was failing, and she had grown weary of writing. She complained of having difficulty in producing [...] "fresh short stories", and believed children preferred little change in the books. Nonetheless, Mr. Tod, and the next book, The Tale of Pigling Bland were published in a larger format with elaborate bindings as [...] "Series II, New Style". Potter disliked the new <b>endpaper</b> depicting Samuel Whiskers sticking up a giant poster while watched by other animal characters, thinking it too like a railway advertisement. Eventually, the larger format and new designation were dropped, and the ordinary binding adopted for reprints.|$|E
500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{contains}} {{allusions to}} many works, including those loved by Juster {{in his own}} upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including The Wind in the Willows, had <b>endpaper</b> maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, {{going so far as}} to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style. Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of puns, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio. According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to radio serials helped inspire The Phantom Tollbooth, as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on sidekick Jim Fairfield from Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit. As a child, Juster had synesthesia, and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. [...] "One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the Lone Ranger [...] they would say, 'Here come the Injuns!' and I always had an image of engines, of train engines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seuss {{reportedly}} had {{misgivings about}} The Seven Lady Godivas before its publication; the {{drawing on the}} <b>endpaper</b> contains a small bucket of sap labeled [...] "Bennett Cerf," [...] the name of Seuss's publisher at Random House. Seuss, by calling Cerf a sap, was apparently implying that Cerf was being too nice in allowing the book to be published. The initial 1939 publishing had a print run of 10,000 copies, but only around 2,500 sold. (One authority states that only 50 were sold.) Seuss himself called it his [...] "greatest failure" [...] and [...] "a book that nobody bought". To another interviewer he said [...] "It was all full of naked women, and I can't draw convincing naked women. I put their knees in the wrong places." [...] It became {{one of only two}} Dr Seuss books, along with The Cat in the Hat Songbook, to be allowed to go out of print. The remaining copies were remaindered in the chain of Schulte's Cigar Stores for twenty-five cents, though original editions now have been reported as selling at prices as high as $300.|$|E
