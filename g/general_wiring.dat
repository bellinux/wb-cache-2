40|$|Managing cloud {{applications}} {{running on}} IaaS is complicated and error prone. This is why DevOps tools and application description languages have been emerging. While these tools and languages enable {{the user to}} define the application and communication structure based on application components, they lack the possibility to define sophisticated communication patterns including the wiring on instance level. This paper details these shortcomings and presents approaches to overcome them. In particular, they we propose (i) adding boundaries to wiring specifications and (ii) introducing a higher-level abstraction—called facet—on top of the application. The combination of both concepts allows specifying wiring on basis of logical units and their relations. Hence, the concepts overcome <b>general</b> <b>wiring</b> problems that currently exist in cloud orchestration tools. In addition to that, the introduction of facets improves the re-use of components across different applications...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time a {{comprehensive}} methodology has been applied to the pre-physical design of hierarchical interconnect wiring with consideration of the limitations of both the device and the wiring technologies (Fig. 1). The overall goal is an optimized distribution of power supplies and clocks, inclusive with a histogram-based decision algorithm for <b>general</b> <b>wiring</b> [2, 3]. The specific goal is the use of a minimum number of wiring levels, with wiring sizes that achieve the performance requirements. Decision criteria are established for the insertion of repeaters by means of a normalized comparison of trombone-staged drivers, singlestage inverting repeaters, and two-stage non-inverting repeaters (Fig. 3), as well as for Al vs. Cu options. When the repeaters are optimized to minimize delay, the MOSFET r 0 and c 0 device parameters are no less than equally important to the per unit wiring length values for RL and CL. The fundamental delay inhibitors are the MOSFET Isat/Cgate slew rate (V/s) and the nodal wire length L...|$|E

Basic questions related to cell types, input localization, and connectivity are being re-visited and tackled with significantly more accurate and higher resolution experimental approaches. A major goal of this e-Book is thus to highlight in one place the impressive range of available techniques, even as these are fast becoming routine. This is not meant as a technical review, however, but rather will project the technical explosion as indicative of a field now in a vibrant state of renewal. Thus, contributions will be mainly research articles using the newer techniques. A second goal is to showcase what has become the conspicuous interdisciplinary reach of the field: neuroanatomical standards and the close association of structure-function and underlying circuitry mechanisms are increasingly relevant to investigations in development, physiology, and disease. Another feature of this Research Topic is that it includes a breadth of cross-species contributions from investigators working with rodent, nonhuman primate, and human brains. This is important since most of our current knowledge of brain structure has been obtained from experimental animals. However, recent technical advances, coupled with researcher willingness to use the human tissue available, will undoubtedly lead to major advances {{in the near future}} regarding human brain mapping and connectomes.

40|$|Ever since Cajal {{hypothesized}} that the structure of neurons is designed {{in such a way}} as to save space, time and matter, numerous researchers have analyzed wiring properties at different scales of brain organization. Here we test the hypothesis that individual pyramidal cells, the most abundant type of neuron in the cerebral cortex, optimize brain connectivity in terms of wiring length. In this study, we analyze the neuronal wiring of complete basal arborizations of pyramidal neurons in layer II, III, IV, Va, Vb and VI of the hindlimb somatosensory cortical region of postnatal day 14 rats. For each cell, we search for the optimal basal arborization and compare its length with the length of the real dendritic structure. Here the optimal arborization is defined as the arborization that has the shortest total wiring length provided that all neuron bifurcations are respected and the extent of the dendritic arborizations remain unchanged. We use graph theory and evolutionary computation techniques to search for the minimal wiring arborizations. Despite morphological differences between pyramidal neurons located in different cortical layers, we found that the neuronal wiring is near-optimal in all cases (the biggest difference between the shortest synthetic wiring found for a dendritic arborization and the length of its real wiring was less than 5 %). We found, however, that the real neuronal wiring was significantly closer to the best solution found in layers II, III and IV. Our studies show that the wiring economy of cortical neurons is related not to the type of neurons or their morphological complexities but to <b>general</b> <b>wiring</b> economy principles...|$|E

40|$|The exact Markov {{modeling}} {{analysis of}} erasure networks with finite buffers {{is an extremely}} hard problem due to {{the large number of}} states in the system. In such networks, packets are lost due to either link erasures or blocking by the full buffers. In this paper, we propose a novel method that iteratively estimates the performance parameters of the network and more importantly reduces the computational complexity compared to the exact analysis. This is the first work that analytically studies the effect of finite memory on the throughput and latency in <b>general</b> <b>wired</b> acyclic networks with erasure links. As a case study, a random packet routing scheme with ideal feedback on the links is used. The proposed framework yields a fairly accurate estimate of the probability distribution of buffer occupancies at the intermediate nodes using which we can not only identify the congested and starving nodes but also obtain analytical expressions for throughput and average delay of a packet in the network. The theoretical framework presented here can be applied to many wired networks, from Internet to more futuristic applications such as networks-on-chip under various communication and network coding scenarios.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{falls in}} the area of survivable {{topology}} design where the goal is to design robust network topologies that anticipate link or node failures. While some survivable networks are designed from scratch, others must be built by augmenting existing networks with sufficient resources to enable survivability. The general topology augmentation problem addresses the general question: what additional resources are required to build upon an existing network to enhance its survivability? A typical such problem involves finding the fewest links to add to a topology to make the topology 2 -edge-connected. This paper considers a costconstrained variation of that problem: given a topology, a set of potential links each with a cost, and a limited budget, find links that can be added to enhance the topology’s biconnectivity. We also consider an extension to optical networks in which fiber and wavelength resources are part of the problem. We present several different heuristics for both <b>general</b> <b>wired</b> networks and for optical networks. The main result of this work is that no single heuristic alone is effective but that a combination of them find near-optimal solutions when compared with simulated annealing.

40|$|Transmission {{lines with}} {{rectangular}} cross sections are usually used in integrated circuit (IC) and computer chip problems. In this paper, a full-wave method is proposed {{based on an}} efficient wire model to analyze transmission-line circuits, where the cross sections of wires can be arbitrary. Comparing the existing wire models in the method of moments, {{it has been shown}} that the best performance occurs when the current is assumed to flow along the electrical axis of a wire and the testing is on the whole surface if two wires are very close. The physical significance of such modeling implies that the surface current on a wire is equivalent to a current filament along the electrical axis. For a single round wire, the electrical axis is exactly the same as its geometrical axis. For two parallel round wires, the electrical axis of each wire is located at the image position of the other wire. In this paper, a <b>general</b> <b>wire</b> model is proposed to determine electrical axes of wires with arbitrary cross sections by solving a static problem. Then, full-wave formulations are derived for wire structures with rectangular cross sections, which are the most important for IC and computer-chip problems.

To achieve this goal, we present in this thesis the related work on QoS and resource reservation. We also design a simulation environment to perform our improved network routing algorithm which realizes the QoS routing and resource reservation with good network transmission performance. Since QoS parameters are the focus of QoS research, we begin the study QoS parameters and their management. We specify a few concepts and formulae for basic parameters and some fundamental functions for QoS management. Then, we discuss various routing algorithms implemented in existing networks. We pay particular attention to QoSRBF algorithms. Based on it, we propose our new schemes. According to our simulation results, the new algorithm can not only find a route, if it exists, to satisfy the desired QoS constraints, but also consume minimum resources and reduce all blocking probability as well. In this thesis, we also address the issues concerning QoS routing and resources reservation in wireless networks. The issues are more complex than in <b>general</b> <b>wired</b> network not only because of wireless networks' special features such as high latency, temporary disconnection, etc., but also due to mobile users' move and uncertainty for this movement.

We also set efficient reservation mechanism to guarantee seamless connection during handoff procedures. All these strategies make our algorithm provide good network transmission performance under QoS constraints in our simulation environment.
