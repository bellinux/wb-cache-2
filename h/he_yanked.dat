500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as <b>he</b> <b>yanked</b> off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E

5000|$|Andrew O'Hehir, {{writing in}} Salon, sees the film's title as its {{essential}} theme: If {{you want to}} understand Snyder's central narrative gambit, it's {{right there in the}} title. He gives us what we want (or what we think we want, or what he thinks we think we want): Absurdly fetishized women in teeny little skirts, gloriously repetitious fight sequences loaded with plot coupons, pseudo-feminist fantasies of escape and revenge.

60|$|Ranse {{turned his}} horse {{into the small}} pasture and went to his own room. He opened the lowest drawer of an old bureau {{to get out the}} packet of letters that Yenna had written him one summer when she had gone to Mississippi for a visit. The drawer stuck, and <b>he</b> <b>yanked</b> at it savagely--as a man will. It came out of the bureau, and bruised both his shins--as a drawer will. An old, folded yellow letter without an {{envelope}} fell from somewhere--probably from where it had lodged in one of the upper drawers. Ranse took it to the lamp and read it curiously.|$|E
6000|$|The morning, {{after the}} sun got up, was {{exceedingly}} delightful. And this camp was such a contrast to the others, so pleasant and attractive, that {{even if we had}} not arranged to meet Lee Haught and his sons here I would have stayed a while anyway. Haught was a famed bear hunter who lived in a log-cabin somewhere up under the rim of the mesa. While Lee and Nielsen rode off up the trail to find Haught I gave Romer his first try at rainbow trout. The water of the creek was low and clear, so that we could see plenty of good-sized trout. But they were shy. They would not rise readily to any of our flies, though I got several strikes. We searched under the stones for worms and secured a few. Whereupon Romer threw a baited hook to a trout we plainly saw. The trout gobbled it. Romer had been instructed in the fine art of angling, but whenever he got a bite he always forgot science. <b>He</b> <b>yanked</b> this ten-inch rainbow right out. Then in another pool he hooked a big fellow that had ideas of his own as well as weight and strength. Romer applied the same strenuous tactics. But this trout nearly pulled Romer off the rock before the line broke. I took occasion then to deliver to the lad a lecture. In reply he said tearfully: [...] "I didn't know he was so--so big." ...|$|E

Gromit ties a knot in its suction hose, causing the rear end to burst and shower dirt all over both Wallace and {{the area of the}} room around him.

50|$|The myth is {{that the}} {{powerful}} priest Daksha made a great yagna (ritual sacrifice) but did not invite his youngest daughter Sati and her husband Shiva, the supreme ruler of the universe.

5000|$|Dunne met John Thomas Sweeney, {{a cooking}} {{hand at the}} {{restaurant}} Ma Maison, {{at a party in}} 1981. After a few weeks of dating, they moved into a one-bedroom house on Rangely Avenue in West Hollywood together. The relationship quickly deteriorated because of Sweeney's possessiveness and jealousy. The couple fought frequently and Sweeney began physically abusing Dunne. According to one account, <b>he</b> <b>yanked</b> handfuls of her hair out by the roots during an argument on August 27, 1982. She fled to her mother's house where Sweeney showed up and began to bang on the door and windows, demanding to be let in. Dunne's mother told him to leave and threatened to call the police. A few days later, Dunne returned to their home and continued their relationship. During another argument at their home on September 26, 1982, Sweeney grabbed Dunne by the throat, threw her on the floor, and began to strangle her. A friend who was staying with the couple heard [...] "loud gagging sounds" [...] and ran into the room where Dunne was being attacked. Dunne told the friend that Sweeney had tried to kill her, but Sweeney denied the claim and told Dunne to come back to bed. She pretended to comply, but sneaked out of the bathroom window instead. When Sweeney heard Dunne start the engine of her car, he ran out and jumped on the car's hood. Dunne stopped the car long enough for Sweeney to jump off the hood and then drove away. For the next few days, she stayed with her mother and at the homes of her friends. She later called Sweeney and ended the relationship. After he moved out, she had the locks changed and moved back into the Rangely Avenue home.|$|E

5000|$|Schroeder's other {{distinguishing}} mark {{as a character}} is his constant refusal of Lucy's love. Lucy is infatuated with Schroeder, and frequently lounges against his piano while he is playing, professing her love for him. However, Beethoven was a lifelong bachelor, and Schroeder feels he must emulate every aspect of his idol's life, {{even if it is}} insinuated that he reciprocates Lucy's feelings. In a story arc where she and the rest of her family have moved out of town (also seen in the TV special Is This Goodbye, Charlie Brown?), Schroeder becomes frustrated with his music and mutters disbelievingly that he misses her, realizing that, despite his animosity towards her, Lucy has unwittingly become Schroeder's muse and he cannot play without her (he parodies Henry Higgins by saying, [...] "Don't tell me I've grown accustomed to THAT face!"). Sometimes, he gets so annoyed with Lucy that <b>he</b> outright <b>yanks</b> the piano out from underneath her to get her away from him which became a running gag; on one occasion both Lucy and Frieda lounge on Schroeder's piano, until <b>he</b> <b>yanks</b> it from beneath them both after Frieda mistakenly thinks Beethoven is a drink rather than a composer (she says [...] "All right but I'll just have a small glass"). However, he does allow Charlie Brown to lounge against the piano, because of their solid friendship. How Lucy keeps getting into Schroeder's house is never addressed; presumably Lucy or Schroeder's unseen parents do not take his annoyance for her very seriously.|$|R

[...] "The name of John Noble first became known to me throughan early portrait which George Luks painted of him, called"Whiskey Bill." [...] The thin, sensitive face was so unlike the Noblewhom I knew many years later, {{when he returned from}} abroad.He came to see me, wearing his inevitable white sombrero andflowing Windsor tie; a powerfully built man with the seriousface of a cleric under his hat, reminding me of Franz Liszt.Noble was a fine athlete. With George Luks, he played in thefirst professional baseball game in Paris. Alone, he rode hiswhite horse into the cafes of Paris, a veritable rough rider, theidol of the French kids. Essentially, however, he was a religiousmystic.The white horse went into his pictures as a poetic symbol.His religious processions of Brittany, as well as his boats off theBreton coast, were enveloped in a religious fog. In me Johnfound something—I know not what—that appealed to him;perhaps it was something in my work that was attuned to hisidea of art, making me an exception in his almost wholesalecondemnation of his contemporaries.John's violent encounters at the Salmagundi Club arewritten large in the memory of that institution—outburstswhich were impelled by a fanatic devotion to art. At theirdinner, <b>he</b> <b>yanked</b> off the table cloth, carrying all the disheswith it―an indirect though forcible criticism of Salmagundi'sart. Towards the end, a tragic brooding came over him. So greatwas the interior struggle between the John Noble who oncefought off five policemen and the artist who paintedProvincetown bathed in moonlight, that at last it wore away hisresistance. Pathetically, desperately, he grasped at the grandillusion of art that was his life. He truly died for a cause—andthat cause was the art of John Noble." [...] " ...|$|E
5000|$|... ‘You’re {{not very}} good at it, are you?’ said Gust, ‘they ought to have sent heavies in.’ He thought the man very likely could have got a job playing Hess in this new TV series they were doing on the war, and he would have had a word with a few {{directors}} he knew in Soho if he had been a mate of his. But, as he wasn’t, Gust kicked him in the stomach as he tried to drag himself up on one leg {{with the help of the}} bar-rail, then turned back to the other man. ‘You all right?’ he said. ‘How are you feeling now? Chipper?’ He took one of the man’s ears in his thumb and forefinger; the ear was tiny, considering the size of his head, and it had little hairs inside it. Gust picked up a cocktail stick out of a dirty glass on the bar and jabbed it down into the eardrum as far as he could; when he pulled it out the stick was half-way red, and there was some grey stuff in it as well. He shouted down his ear: ‘I think I just broke your foot!’ but the man wasn’t making sense any more; he was wailing with his hand clapped to the side of his head, swaying up and down from the waist like a bereaved widow, or else perhaps he just didn’t hear, or maybe the music was too loud. Gust realised then that he had pushed the stick in too far and that the man would probably die. Dirty cocktail-stick in the brain? What a bleeding way to go! Now the man with the broken leg tried another naughty stroke; although he only had one hand free because he was using the other one to hold onto the rail, he still managed to smash a glass and try putting it in Gust’s face. ‘This is just self-defence after all,’ Gust said to himself. He stamped on the man’s feet again; this time he definitely felt bones go and the man screamed, dropped the glass and let go of the rail; but instead of letting him fall Gust took him round the waist, ripped his fly open and searched inside his pants until he found his testicles, which <b>he</b> <b>yanked</b> right out into his hand. Their owner can’t have been much into baths because they smelled like something tepid from a canteen counter. Gust wrung them like the devil having a go at a set of wedding bells with all the grip he had, until the man was shrieking on the same D minor as the music. ‘It’s nothing personal,’ said Gust, ‘but I’m afraid you’re going to have to learn to fuck all over again.’ He wiped the blood off the man’s prick down his face, then pulled the face towards him and drove his nose into his brain with his head. The music boosted into E major on a key change, and the man doubled up under a bar-stool, leaving a lot of blood behind him while Gust receded into the half darkness towards the black drapes on the walls. —Brand New Dead, pp. 86-87 ...|$|E
