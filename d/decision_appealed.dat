25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war Xavier was engaged in {{assisting}} Zita and Karl following their deposition. In 1919 together with Sixte he travelled to England and contacted king George V; the British support materialized as a liaison officer, dispatched to the republican Austria to assist the unhappy couple on their route to exile. However, it soon turned {{out that it was}} his own business which attracted most of Xavier’s attention. Following wartime financial turmoil and expropriations of some family estates, economic prospects of both brothers seemed rather bleak. As a counter-measure, they decided to challenge the French state, which in 1915 seized Chambord as property of Élie, the Austrian officer; the Versailles Treaty stipulations allowed to conclude the seizure legally if combined with paying compensation fee. Sixte and Xavier sued; they claimed that the family-agreed 1910 partition, based on the Austrian concept of an indivisible , was not applicable in the French law, and that the Chambord property should be divided; they claimed also that as volunteers to the French and Belgian armies, they should be exempted from expropriation procedure. Centred on fortune-worth Chambord property, in fact the lawsuit was directed against Élie. In 1925 the court accepted brothers’ point of view, the decision immediately appealed by their half-brother. In 1928 the case was overturned in favor of Élie, the <b>decision</b> <b>appealed</b> by both brothers. In 1932 the Court of Cassation upheld the 1928 decision, which eventually left Xavier and Sixte frustrated in their bid.|$|E

5000|$|At trial, plaintiff’s counsel {{objected to}} Professor Miller’s {{qualifications}} {{an expert in}} the areas of discrimination against gays and lesbians and gay and lesbian political power, contending in particular that Miller lacks sufficient expertise to offer an opinion on the relative political power of gays and lesbians. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker permitted Miller to testify. In his decision http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2009cv02292/215270/708/0.pdf?ts=1280974805 filed August 4, 2010, however, Walker wrote that, “while Miller has significant experience with politics generally, he is not sufficiently familiar with gay and lesbian politics to offer opinions on gay and lesbian political power.” [...] In his opinion, Judge Walker further ruled that “Miller’s opinions on gay and lesbian political power are entitled to little weight and {{only to the extent that}} they are amply supported by reliable evidence.” Walker’s opinion went on to declare Proposition 8 unconstitutional, a <b>decision</b> <b>appealed</b> to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel upheld the decision 2-1 in Perry v. Brown, but on a narrower constitutional reasoning that did not address expert testimony. In December 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the lower court decisions in the case, now titled Hollingsworth v. Perry.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to de facto renunciation through apostasy, or heresy, the Roman Catholic Church envisaged from 1983 to 2009 {{the possibility of}} formal defection from the Church through a decision manifested personally, consciously and freely, and in writing, to the competent church authority, who was then to judge whether it was genuinely a case of [...] "true separation from the constitutive elements {{of the life of}} the Church ... (by) an act of apostasy, heresy or schism." [...] A formal defection of this kind was then noted in the register of the person's baptism, an annotation that, like those of marriage or ordination, was independent of the fact of the baptism and was not an actual [...] "debaptism", even if the person who formally defected from the Catholic Church had also defected from the Christian religion. The fact of having been baptized remains a fact and the Catholic Church holds that baptism marks a person with a lasting seal or character that [...] "is an ontological and permanent bond which is not lost by reason of any act or fact of defection." [...] Nonetheless, formal requests for debaptisms are made; in France, a man sued the French Catholic church for [...] "its refusal to let him nullify his baptism." [...] He had been [...] "un-baptized" [...] in 2000, and ten years later he demanded to have his name stricken from the baptismal records, a request granted by a judge in Normandy, a <b>decision</b> <b>appealed</b> by the church.|$|E

40|$|Extinguishment {{has been}} a key issue in native title cases {{following}} the 1992 High Court decision in Mabo v Queensland (No 2). In 2015, the High Court in Queensland v Congoo was equally divided in determining whether extinguishment of native title had occurred. Congoo involved an appeal from the Full Federal Court which had held that certain military orders made during the Second World War did not extinguish native title. Accordingly, the Full Federal Court <b>decision</b> <b>appealed</b> from was affirmed. This article reviews the developing doctrine of common law extinguishment of native title law prior to the High Court’s decision in Congoo. The article then critically examines the High Court’s reasoning in Congoo regarding {{the interpretation of the}} common law doctrine of extinguishment and also considers the interpretation of common law extinguishment rules post-Congoo. Given the divergence of opinion in Congoo, it is possible that these extinguishment principles will again be revisited in future cases concerning extinguishment...|$|E
