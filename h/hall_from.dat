5|$|Settlement in {{the area}} was slow, though Caversham Valley was a {{preferred}} route south out of the city. The Central Otago Gold Rush of 1861 led to rapid changes when thousands of people began using the road {{on their way to}} and from the gold fields. The suburb began to expand rapidly at about this time, and the first public house, the Edinburgh Castle Hotel, was erected in 1861. By the end of the decade, Caversham had its own school, post office, drill <b>hall</b> (<b>from</b> the Southern District Rifles), and Anglican and Presbyterian churches. A third church, for the Baptist denomination, followed in 1872.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} again {{served as}} a library in March 1937, when Romney's community library was relocated {{to the first floor}} of Literary <b>Hall</b> <b>from</b> its previous facility {{in the basement of the}} Hampshire County Courthouse. The library had been established on April 11, 1935 as a project by the American Legion Auxiliary, and was housed in a room of the courthouse basement where it was staffed by volunteers and open from 2pm to 4pm on Saturday afternoons. When the library's collection of both purchased and donated books outgrew its space in the courthouse basement, the Clinton Lodge Masons granted permission to the library to house its collection at Literary Hall in 1937. Following its move to Literary Hall, the library expanded its hours, and expanded them again, to five afternoons a week, through the assistance of the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration.|$|E

5|$|The priory prospered {{until the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, {{when it was}} {{abolished}} along with England's other monastic communities. The priory buildings were demolished and the stone re-used in other buildings in Guisborough. The east end of the priory church was left standing with its great window forming a distinctive arch, a well-known landmark used as a symbol for Guisborough. It {{became part of the}} estate of the Chaloner family, who acquired it in 1550. The east window was preserved by them as part of a Romantic vista adjoining their seat, Gisborough <b>Hall,</b> <b>from</b> which the priory takes its idiosyncratically spelled name.

David then became a writer for and cast member of ABC's Fridays from 1980 to 1982, and a writer for NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL) from 1984 to 1985. During his time at SNL, he was able to get only one sketch on the show, which aired at 12:50 AM, the last time slot on the show.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Literary Hall in 1870, the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized {{the first floor of}} the building as a meeting space, while the Romney Literary Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library. Between its various periods of dormancy, the Clinton Lodge and the associated Order of the Eastern Star, which was organized in July 1919, utilized Literary Hall as a meeting space, and following the Romney Literary Society's disestablishment, the Masons and Eastern Star continued their use of the building. In 1973, prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased Literary <b>Hall</b> <b>from</b> the Clinton Lodge Masons and provided the lodge with a land lot for the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney. Following his purchase of Literary Hall, Haines used the historic building as a law office building and private museum. Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979.|$|E
