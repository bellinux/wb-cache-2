5000|$|Estimating methods {{may vary}} by type and class of estimate. The method used for most {{definitive}} estimates is to fully define {{and understand the}} scope, take off or quantify the scope, and apply costing to the scope, which can then be summed to a total cost. Proper documentation and review are also important. Pricing transforms the cost estimate into what the firm wishes to charge for the scope. Early estimates may employ various means of cost modeling. The basic characteristics of effective estimating include: clear identification of task, broad participation in preparing estimates, availability of valid data, standardized structure for the estimate, provision for program uncertainties, recognition of inflation, recognition of <b>excluded</b> <b>costs,</b> independent review of estimates, and revision of estimates for significant program changes. Application of best practices helps ensure a high-quality estimate. “Certain best practices should be followed if accurate and credible cost estimates are to be developed. These best practices represent an overall process of established, repeatable methods that result in high-quality cost estimates that are comprehensive and accurate {{and that can be}} easily and clearly traced, replicated, and updated.” ...|$|E

40|$|Dengue poses a {{substantial}} economic and disease burden in Southeast Asia (SEA). Quantifying this burden {{is critical to}} set policy priorities and disease-control strategies. We estimated the economic and disease burden of dengue in 12 countries in SEA: Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, East-Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. We obtained reported cases from multiple sources [...] surveillance data, World Health Organization (WHO), and published studies [...] and adjusted for underreporting using expansion factors from previous literature. We obtained unit costs per episode through a systematic literature review, and completed missing data using linear regressions. We <b>excluded</b> <b>costs</b> such as prevention and vector control, and long-term sequelae of dengue. Over the decade of 2001 - 2010, we obtained an annual average of 2. 9 million (m) dengue episodes and 5, 906 deaths. The annual economic burden (with 95 % certainty levels) was US$ 950 m (US$ 610 m-US$ 1, 384 m) or about US$ 1. 65 (US$ 1. 06 -US$ 2. 41) per capita. The annual number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), based on the original 1994 definition, was 214, 000 (120, 000 - 299, 000), which is equivalent to 372 (210 - 520) DALYs per million inhabitants.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the cost-effectiveness of treatment with caffeine compared with placebo for apnea of prematurity in infants with birth weights less than 1250 g, from birth through 18 to 21 months' corrected age. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective economic {{evaluation of the}} cost per survivor without neurodevelopmental impairment by using individual-patient data from the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity clinical trial (N = 1869). We included direct medical costs either to the insurance payer or the hospital but <b>excluded</b> <b>costs</b> to parents and society, such as lost productivity. We used a price of $ 0. 21 /mg of generic caffeine citrate for our base-case analysis. All costs were expressed in 2008 Canadian dollars and discounted at 3 %. The time horizon for this analysis extended through 18 to 21 months' corrected age to match the clinical trial. RESULTS: The mean cost per infant was $ 124 466 in the caffeine group and $ 133 505 {{in the placebo group}} (difference: $ 9039 [- 14 749 to - 3375]; adjusted P =. 014). Cost-effectiveness analysis showed caffeine to be a dominant or "win-win" therapy: in > 99 % of 1000 bootstrap replications of the analysis, caffeine-treated infants had simultaneously better outcomes and lower mean costs. These results were robust to a 1000 % increase in the individual resource items, including the price of caffeine citrate. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with placebo, caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity in infants weighing less than 1250 g is economically appealing for infants up to 18 to 21 months' corrected ag...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this project}} was to model {{clinically}} important events experienced by lung transplant patients (from the day after transplant to 5 years or death) and costs associated with these events, and to assess {{the economic impact of}} different immunosuppression therapies. Methods: The population comprised 356 lung transplant patients (223 heart-lung, 102 single lung and 31 double lung) transplanted between April 1984 and December 1997. AU patients received a cyclosporine-based triple-immunosuppression protocol. We designed a Markov model that included 3 time periods (0 to 6, 7 to 12, and 13 to 60 months), 5 clinical states (well, acute rejection, cytomegalovirus infection, non-cytomegalavirus infection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome), and death. For the well state, cost elements were immunosuppression, prophylaxis, and routine clinic visits. For all other states, cost elements were diagnosis, treatment, and bed days/visits. We <b>excluded</b> <b>costs</b> of the procedure. Results: The monthly costs associated with the well state decreased over time, from pound 1, 778 ($ 2, 658) in the first 6 months to pound 503 ($ 752) in months 7 to 12 and pound 350 ($ 523) after the first 12 months. The cost per event of the acute states remained reasonably constant over the 3 periods: pound 1, 850 ($ 2, 766) for rejection, pound 3, 380 ($ 5, 053) for cytomegalovirus, and pound 2, 790 ($ 4, 171) for other infections. The average cost per patient, discounted at 6 %, over 5 years was pound 35, 429 ($ 52, 966) (95 % range, pound 1, 435 [$ 2, 145] to pound 67, 079 [$ 100, 283]). This estimate is most sensitive to changes in immunosuppression. Substituting tacrolimus for cyclosporine increased 5 -year costs by 5 %; substituting mycophenolate mofetil for azathioprine increased 5 -year costs by 26 %.

The purpose of this cohort study {{was to assess the}} health care utilization and costs of chronic constipation in a Swedish population using health care claims data. Methods: Data were compiled on health care costs, drug costs, and mortality for Västra Götaland, Sweden (2005 – 2009). These data were used to identify patients aged 18 years or older with chronic constipation, defined as: at least two health care contacts with a primary diagnosis of constipation within 12 months or at least one care contact with a primary diagnosis of constipation and two dispatches of laxatives 6 months before and 12 months after the index date. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome or taking opioids, both of which can cause constipation, were <b>excluded.</b> <b>Costs,</b> resource use, comorbidities, and laxative use were assessed during a 12 -month follow-up period. Results: In total, 4, 043 patients with chronic constipation were identified. They had a mean (SD) age of 67 ± 18 years. Mortality was 7 % during the 12 -month follow-up period and the most common comorbidity was hypertension (22 %). In the 12 -month follow-up period, patients with chronic constipation had a mean (SD) of 2. 3 ± 7. 5 constipation-related health care contacts and a mean (SD) of 15. 2 ± 19. 5 other health care contacts. Annual costs, adjusted for sex, age group, mortality, and comorbidities, were € 5, 388, of which € 951 were for constipation-related care. Conclusion: Patients with chronic constipation constituted an elderly population with a high disease burden in Sweden between 2005 and 2009. Mean annual constipation-related health care costs, adjusted for potentially confounding factors, were € 951 per patient. Keywords: cohort study, chronic constipation, costs, Swede...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} a number of {{questions}} that are highly important for the ex ante evaluation of the safety impacts of transport policy options, from the perspective of ethical theory: (1) Is it morally OK to express prevention on acceptance of fatalities or risks in monetary terms? (2) How useful is the concept of the value of a statistical life (VOSL) for ex ante evaluations of transport policy options? (3) What are {{the pros and cons of}} pricing protection of lives or prevention of risks in ex ante evaluations? (4) Which methods are available for expressing (protection of) human lives in monetary terms, and what are the main related methodological discussions? (5) Are all safety-related costs generally included in ex ante evaluations of the safety impacts of transport policy options, and if not: what is the relevance of <b>excluded</b> <b>costs</b> categories from an ethical perspective? (6) How important is the distribution of safety effects from an ethical perspective? The answer to the first question highly depends on the ethical theory that is used. With respect to question 2 we think that the VOSL is a useful concept, but that its application is not straightforward, for several reasons. Thirdly we think that probably pricing safety improves the quality of decision making, but to the best of our knowledge there is no research to underpin this expectation. The answer to question 4 is that several methods exist to estimate the value of a statistical life (VOSL), willingness-to-pay (WTP) methods being the most common category of methods. However, several methodological issues arise that make estimates of VOSL less straightforward. With respect to question 5 we conclude that behaviour-related avoidance costs are often overlooked and that these costs are relevant from an ethical perspective because the freedom to move and the freedom to participate in activities are challenged. Finally the answer to question 6 is that from an ethical perspective, in terms of the evaluation of policy measures, it might matter which groups of the population are the victims of the transport system, or are at risk. Egalitarian theories as well as sufficientarianism are useful theories to discuss distribution effects. Different theories conclude differently. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeTrauma {{and complex}} cardiac surgery are {{associated}} with a high risk of bleeding complications. The difference in costs between patients who require bleeding control measures {{and those who do not}} is poorly understood. Our goal was to assess the cost of care and outcomes for patients in these settings. MethodsPatients > 18 years of age, who were discharged between January 2010 and December 2012, were retrospectively identified in the Premier Hospital Database based on International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision codes. These patients were categorized as having received blood products (“bleeding patients”) or not (“nonbleeding patients”). Patients with costs and length of stay (LOS) of zero were excluded. Differences in treatment costs and outcomes were assessed using univariate analysis and multivariate modeling. FindingsBleeding trauma patients (n = 8800) had a 150 % higher total cost of care (P < 0. 001; 146 % after <b>excluding</b> <b>costs</b> of agents used for bleeding control, P < 0. 001), an 81. 3 % longer hospital LOS (P < 0. 001), and a 65. 2 % longer intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (P < 0. 001) than nonbleeding patients (n = 53, 727). Bleeding complex cardiac surgery patients (n = 82, 832) had a 133. 2 % higher total cost of care (P < 0. 001; 128. 7 % after <b>excluding</b> <b>costs</b> of agents used for bleeding control, P < 0. 001), a 155. 6 % longer hospital LOS (P < 0. 001), and an 89. 3 % longer ICU LOS (P < 0. 001) than nonbleeding patients (n = 380, 902).
