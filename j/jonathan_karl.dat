5000|$|... "The {{story is}} classic Bob Woodward: fly-on-the-wall {{descriptions}} of super-secret discussions, details missed by every other reporter, a juicy scoop" [...] writes The Wall Street Journals <b>Jonathan</b> <b>Karl.</b> The book [...] "is replete with typical Woodwardian reporting: secret meetings recounted in vivid detail, complete with lengthy, verbatim quotations of what key players said {{to each other}} as the story unfolded. Once again, it all reads as if Bob Woodward was lurking in the background as the meetings happened, taking exceptionally detailed notes. But of course he was not there. We learn not only what the president and all his men said but also what unspoken thoughts raced through their minds. But Mr. Woodward wasn't inside their heads either, it is safe to say." [...] Concluding that [...] "Mr. Woodward attempts to write like a novelist, not a journalist," [...] Karl adds that [...] "As more than a few people have noted over the course of Mr. Woodward's long career, his narratives are propelled in part by who talks to him and, just as important, who gives him the best, most detailed and colorful descriptions of what went on in all those secret meetings." ...|$|E
5000|$|On May 10, 2013, ABC News' <b>Jonathan</b> <b>Karl</b> {{reported}} that Stephen Hayes had [...] "obtained 12 {{different versions of}} the talking points that show they were extensively edited as they evolved from the drafts first written entirely by the CIA to the final version distributed to Congress and to U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice before she appeared on five talk shows." [...] The changes made to the talking points, according to the report, appear to directly contradict what White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said about them in November 2012. Afterwards, Carney stated the reports did not contradict what he said and that it was the CIA's task to review the talking points. The White House then released copies of various emails that were sent to various administration officials shortly after the attack took place to prove that there was no cover up. On the May 12 episode of ABC News' This Week, Karl said that when then-CIA Director David Petraeus saw the final talking points the Saturday before Rice went on the Sunday talk shows he said they were [...] "essentially useless". Karl went on to quote from an e-mail in which Petraeus said of the talking points: [...] "I would just as soon not use them, but it's their White House's call." ...|$|E
