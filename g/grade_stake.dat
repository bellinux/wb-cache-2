50|$|After {{moving the}} panel {{to the proper}} {{deployment}} location as indicated on the Panel Layout Diagram for the project, the panel is unfolded or unrolled from the shipping pallet. The pallet is usually on a front-end loader or forklift which moves backwards to facilitate unfolding or unrolling of the panel. Pulling the geomembrane panel off the pallet or the roll by a chain is not recommended because it may damage the geomembrane. Deployment personnel are then positioned approximately 4.6 m apart {{along the edges of}} the panel to unfold and move the panel into the proper location. If the edge to be gripped is to be subsequently welded or bonded, the panel edge is folded back about 0.6 to 1.0 m, creating a fold. The fold is gripped using the 0.3 m long by 10 mm (1-foot long by 2 inch) diameter smooth wooden dowel or a smooth <b>grade</b> <b>stake</b> rather than the edge itself. This is to avoid stretching the panel edge where it is to be bonded to another panel. As the panel is pulled out, it is necessary to maintain air under the geomembrane to reduce friction with the ground surface. This can be accomplished by holding the panel edge and advancing at a rate fast enough to create air under the geomembrane as it is unfolded. Another method is to “fan” air under the geomembrane by raising and lowering the edge of the panel to create a wave-like action across the liner as it is being spread. After the panel is set in the exact position, it is welded or bonded to adjacent panels.|$|E
