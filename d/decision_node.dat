40|$|Abstract—The {{evacuation}} {{of a building}} is a challenging problem, since the evacuees {{most of the times}} do not know or do not follow the optimal evacuation route. Especially during an ongoing hazard present in the building, finding the best evacuation route becomes harder as the conditions along the paths change {{in the course of the}} evacuation procedure. In this paper we propose a distributed system that will compute the best evacuation routes in real-time, while a hazard is spreading inside the building.

50|$|A {{decision}} tree {{is a simple}} representation for classifying examples. For this section, assume {{that all of the}} input features have finite discrete domains, and there is a single target feature called the classification. Each element of the domain of the classification is called a class.A {{decision tree}} or a classification tree is a tree in which each internal (non-leaf) node is labeled with an input feature. The arcs coming from a node labeled with an input feature are labeled with each of the possible values of the target or output feature or the arc leads to a subordinate <b>decision</b> <b>node</b> on a different input feature.

For example, since subgames cannot cut through information sets, a game of imperfect information may have only one subgame - itself - and hence subgame perfection cannot be used to eliminate any Nash equilibria. A perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) is a specification of players’ strategies and beliefs about which node in the information set has been reached {{by the play of}} the game. A belief about a <b>decision</b> <b>node</b> is the probability that a particular player thinks that node is or will be in play (on the equilibrium path). In particular, the intuition of PBE is that it specifies player strategies that are rational given the player beliefs it specifies and the beliefs it specifies are consistent with the strategies it specifies.|$|E
50|$|If the entrant enters, {{the best}} {{response}} of the incumbent is to accommodate. If the incumbent accommodates, the best {{response of the}} entrant is to enter (and gain profit). Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent accommodates if the entrant enters and the entrant enters if the incumbent accommodates is a Nash equilibrium. However, if the incumbent {{is going to play}} fight, the best response of the entrant is to not enter. If the entrant does not enter, it does not matter what the incumbent chooses to do (since there is no other firm to do it to - note that if the entrant does not enter, fight and accommodate yield the same payoffs to both players; the incumbent will not lower its prices if the entrant does not enter). Hence fight can be considered as a best response of the incumbent if the entrant does not enter. Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent fights if the entrant does not enter and the entrant does not enter if the incumbent fights is a Nash equilibrium. Since the game is dynamic, any claim by the incumbent that it will fight is an incredible threat because by the time the <b>decision</b> <b>node</b> is reached where it can decide to fight (i.e. the entrant has entered), it would be irrational to do so. Therefore this Nash equilibrium can be eliminated by backward induction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Finding {{the best}} {{evacuation}} path during an emergency situation inside a {{building is a}} challenging task, due to the dynamically changing conditions and the strict time constraints.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of {{classification}} problems, algorithms that generate multivariate trees are able to explore multiple representation languages by using decision tests based {{on a combination of}} attributes. In the regression setting, model trees algorithms explore multiple representation languages but using linear models at leaf nodes. In this work we study the effects of using combinations of attributes at <b>decision</b> <b>nodes,</b> leaf nodes, or both nodes and leaves in regression and classification tree learning. In order to study the use of functional nodes at different places and for different types of modeling, we introduce a simple unifying framework for multivariate tree learning. This framework combines a univariate decision tree with a linear function by means of constructive induction. Decision trees derived from the framework are able to use <b>decision</b> <b>nodes</b> with multivariate tests, and leaf nodes that make predictions using linear functions. Multivariate <b>decision</b> <b>nodes</b> are built when growing the tree, while functional leaves are built when pruning the tree. We experimentally evaluate a univariate tree, a multivariate tree using linear combinations at inner and leaf nodes, and two simplified versions restricting linear combinations to inner nodes and leaves. The experimental evaluation shows that all functional trees variants exhibit similar performance, with advantages in different datasets. In this study there is a marginal advantage of the full model. These results lead us to study the role of functional leaves and nodes. We use the bias-variance decomposition of the error, cluster analysis, and learning curves as tools for analysis. We observe that in the datasets under study and for classification and regression, the use of multivariate <b>decision</b> <b>nodes</b> has more impact in the bias component of the error, while the use of multivariate decision leaves has more impact in the variance component...|$|R
