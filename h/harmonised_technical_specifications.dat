40|$|<b>Harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> <b>specifications</b> {{are needed}} to create a single European market. Although many test methods were {{available}} to assess the reaction to fire performance of building products, no set of existing test methods was both politically and technically acceptable. As a result the Single Burning Item (SBI) test method has been developed. For about 80 % of the building products on the European market this assessment will be, and partly is already, compulsory. The paper describes the development process of the SBI test method, including {{the result of the}} second recently finalised round robin exercise.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} role of international standards in the rules governing the internationalisation of the service economy. It analyses on a cross-institutional basis patterns of authority in the institutional setting of service standards in the European and Amercian context. The entry into force of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995 gave international standards {{a major role in}} <b>harmonising</b> the <b>technical</b> <b>specifications</b> of goods and services traded on the global market Despite the careful wording of the WTO, a whole range of international bodies still have the capacity to define generic as well as detailed <b>technical</b> <b>specifications</b> affecting how swelling offshore services are expected to be traded on worldwide basis. The analysis relies on global political economy approaches to identify constitutive patterns of authority mediating between the political and the economic spheres on a transnational space. It extends to the area of service standards the assumption that the process of globalisation is not opposing states and markets, but a joint expression of both of them including new patterns and agents of structural change through formal and informal power and regulatory practices. The paper argues that service standards reflect the significant development of a form of transnational hybrid authority, that blurs the distinction between private and public actors, whose scope spread all along from physical measures to societal values, and which reinforces the deterritorialisation of regulatory practices in contemporary capitalism. It provides evidence of this argument by analysing the current European strategy regarding service standardization in response to several programming mandate of the European Commission and the American views on the future development of service standards...|$|R
50|$|The Regulation {{provides}} that where a <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> standard exists for a construction product {{as defined by}} the Regulation, that product must be tested and certified to that standard by a notified body in order to qualify for a CE Mark. Since EN 54 is the <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> standard for fire detection and alarm products, it appears to follow that products in that field which are brought to market in the European Union must be tested against the provisions of EN 54 and certified accordingly.|$|R

The proposed change would remove valve component lists and references to the lists from the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> (TS). The information contained in the deleted tables would be relocated to the HCGS Technical Requirements Manual (TRM). The proposed change is consistent with Generic Letter 91 - 08, "Removal of Component Lists from <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications,</b> " which provides guidance for preparing license amendment requests to remove component lists from the TS. This request meets all conditions outlined in the Generic Letter. Additionally, the revision does not alter the requirements for component operability currently in the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications.</b> The Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) and Surveillance Requirements will be retained in the revised <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> and the proposed change will not affect the meaning, application, and function of the current <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b> requirements for the components.
