Vocally she also wanted to produce something that could {{come as a surprise to}} those who hadn't heard her [...] "full range before". The title of the album derives from a track of the same name from the album. The song [...] "Cinderella's Eyes" [...] was written in the early stages of the album recording, with lyrics telling a story similar to several fairy tale characters. Roberts described [...] "Cinderella's Eyes" [...] as [...] "a song on my album that I wrote about a year ago… It's about a girl called Sleeping Beauty who wakes up and wonders what life has instore [...] for her… “Will she meet any baddies or goodies and will she lay with any Princes or Hoodies”… She asks Cinderella [...] "Are you happy with your fella and your nice home", and tells girls “They have to do it for themselves as cards are so randomly dealt.” I think it represents my views on happy endings." ...|$|E

Talking of Girls Aloud, Roberts stated she was used to releasing a song after around six weeks of promotion, including radio, television and press promotion, and commented that it was [...] "very scary" [...] to release a song without this publicity. She also noted the effect of this kind of release against chart positions, she said, [...] "I think it's harder for the public now because it's always been about the chart position. I also think it takes the excitement out of the charts because it's not a competition anymore." [...] The album artwork and track-listing were confirmed on 22 August 2011 on Roberts official website, the announcement came with confirmation that fans who pre-ordered the album on Play.com would receive a signed poster, and those who pre-ordered the song from digital store iTunes would have an exclusive highlight video montage of her webisode series Through Nicola's Eyes.
