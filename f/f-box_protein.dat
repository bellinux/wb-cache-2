40|$|AbstractF-box {{proteins}} are {{an expanding}} family of eukaryotic proteins {{characterized by an}} approximately 40 aminoacid motif, the F box (so named because cyclin F {{was one of the}} first proteins in which this motif was identified) [1]. Some <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> have been shown to be critical for the controlled degradation of cellular regulatory proteins [2, 3]. In fact, <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> are one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligases called SCFs. The other three subunits are the Skp 1 protein; one of the cullin proteins (Cul 1 in metazoans and Cdc 53 or Cul A in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae); and the recently identified Roc 1 protein (also called Rbx 1 or Hrt 1). SCF ligases bring ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (either Ubc 3 or Ubc 4) to substrates that are specifically recruited by the different <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins.</b> The need for high substrate specificity and the large number of known <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> in yeast and worms [2, 4] suggest the existence of a large family of mammalian <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins.</b> Using Skp 1 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen and by searching DNA databases, we identified a family of 26 human <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins,</b> 25 of which were novel. Some of these proteins contained WD- 40 domains or leucine-rich repeats; others contained either different protein–protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. We have named the <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> that contain WD- 40 domains Fbws, those containing leucine-rich repeats, Fbls, and the remaining ones Fbxs. We have further characterized representative members of these three classes of <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

We have identified 687 potential <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> in rice (Oryza sativa), the model monocotyledonous plant, by a reiterative database search. Computational analysis revealed the presence of several other functional domains, including leucine-rich repeats, kelch repeats, F-box associated domain, domain of unknown function, and tubby domain in <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins.</b> Based upon their domain composition, they have been classified into 10 subfamilies.

An analysis of a complete set of <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> in rice is presented, including classification, chromosomal location, conserved motifs, and phylogenetic relationship. It appears that the expansion of F-box family in rice, in large part, might have occurred due to localized gene duplications. Furthermore, comprehensive digital expression analysis of F-box protein-encoding genes has been complemented with microarray analysis. The results reveal specific and/or overlapping expression of rice F-box protein-encoding genes during floral transition as well as panicle and seed development.

FBXO31-mediated loss of MDM2 leads to elevated levels of p53, resulting in growth arrest. In cells depleted of FBXO31, MDM2 is not degraded and p53 levels do not increase following genotoxic stress.

Apart from being a component of the ubiquitin (Ub) / 26 S proteasome pathways, their regulatory roles in other cellular and developmental pathways have also been reported. One interesting feature of the genes encoding the proteins of this particular family is their variable selection patterns across different lineages. This resulted in the presence of lineage specific <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> across different species. Findings: In this study, 48 non-redundant <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> in E. siliculosus have been identified by a homology based approach and classified into three classes based on their variable C-terminal domains. A greater number of the <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins</b> have domains similar to the ones identified in other species. On the other hand, when the proteins having unknown or no C-terminal domain (as predicted by InterProScan) were analyzed, it was found that some of them have the polyglutamine repeats. To gain evolutionary insights on the genes encoding the <b>F-box</b> <b>proteins,</b> their selection patterns were analyzed and a strong positive selection was observed which indicated the adaptation potential of the members of this family. Moreover, four lineage specific F-box genes were found in E. siliculosus with no identified homolog in any other species.

Both the F-box and LRR regions of ARABIDILLO 1 appear to enable this turnover to occur. Application of known lateral root-regulating signals has no effect on ARABIDILLO 1 stability. In addition, plants that lack or overexpress ARABIDILLO proteins respond normally to known lateral root-regulating signals.
