5|$|In 1867, {{three years}} after the first performance, Rossini discreetly orchestrated the Petite messe solennelle, partly for fear that others would <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway</b> after his death. As he disliked the sound of cathedral boys' choirs, he {{requested}} permission from the pope to perform the work with female voices at a church. When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer preferred the chamber music version anyway.|$|E
5|$|At Goerdeler's insistence, Stauffenberg {{is ordered}} to assassinate both Hitler and SS head Himmler at the FÃ¼hrer's command bunker, the Wolf's Lair. At a final briefing, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim instructs the {{committee}} {{members in the}} use of pencil detonators. Stauffenberg also persuades General Fellgiebel, who controls all communications at Wolf's Lair, to cut off communications after the bomb blast. On July15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf's Lair with the bomb in his briefcase, but with Himmler not present at the meeting, Stauffenberg does not get the go-ahead from the committee leaders, and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway,</b> the meeting is over. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht, unbeknownst to Fromm, to stand by. With no action taken, Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker, and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down, believing that the mobilization was a drill. Back in Berlin, Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that if they try to control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler, who has been selected to be chancellor after the coup. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.|$|E
25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, {{no one in the}} group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, he had to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway,</b> even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E

50|$|Johnny appears {{again in}} the evening. As Daniel asked for his Christmas gift, Johnny says {{to him that he}} forgot Rike and Tom and that he shall give them his new guitar. At first, Daniel disagrees with him, but then he <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway,</b> whereupon the three of them become best friends.|$|R
25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading that cast market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the prospectuses written by the mutual fund companies strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> So, the problem was not with the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on fundamental analysis of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, those decisions involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E
500|$|Douglas adopted Boddy's [...] "Tricky Dick" [...] {{nickname}} for Nixon, and {{also referred to}} him as [...] "pee wee". Her name-calling {{had an effect on}} Nixon: when told she had called him [...] "a young man with a dark shirt" [...] in an allusion to Nazism, he inquired, [...] "Did she say that? Why, I'll castrate her." [...] Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that {{it would be difficult to}} do, and Nixon replied that he would <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> Nixon returned the attacks; at friendly gatherings and especially at all-male events, he stated that Douglas was [...] "pink right down to her underwear".|$|E
500|$|... "Steve Burdick" [...] {{scored a}} Nielsen rating of 9.7, equating to {{approximately}} 9.5 million viewers, and a 17 share, meaning that 17% of all television {{sets in use}} during its time period were tuned to the episode. NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it. And if you choose to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway,</b> you better count on losing money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>anyway.</b> And I have a {{right to}} feel hurt, and I do feel hurt, to have you treat me so. It seems to me that when a person goads, and crowds, and in a manner forces another person to talk, it is neither very fair nor very good-mannered to call what he says clack." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} study singing", Hayworth complained, [...] "but Harry Cohn kept saying, 'Who needs it?' and the studio wouldn't pay for it. They had me so intimidated that I couldn't have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> They always said, 'Oh, no, we can't let you <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> There's no time for that; {{it has to be}} done right now!' I was under contract, and that was it." ...|$|R
60|$|Who {{shot the}} arrow nobody knew, and nobody ever will know. Some thought {{it must be}} a knight, named Walter Tyrrell, to whom the king had given three long good arrows that morning. He rode {{straight}} away to Southampton, and went off to the Holy Land; so it is likely that he knew something about the king's death. But he never seems to have told any one, whether it was only an accident, or a murder, or who <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Anyway,</b> <b>it</b> was a fearful end, for a bad man to die in his sin, without a moment to repent and pray.|$|R
500|$|Matt Pryor {{continued}} {{as part of}} The New Amsterdams, an acoustic alt-country group he had formed in 2000, expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving-door lineup. In 2007 he formed The Terrible Twos, a children's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records. Regarding the decision to make a children's album directly after the split, Pryor said [...] "I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway</b> because I have kids and I want to write songs for them, but {{nobody is going to}} be like 'this isn't as good as the old stuff.' It's immune to punk criticism." [...] In July 2008, he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of Confidence Man, an alt-country release similar in sound to The New Amsterdams. After his second album, May Day, Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding The New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career, concluding the band's tenure with the release of Outroduction, a B-sides recording.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} returned on a {{more permanent}} basis from June 2006. Abra confessed to old friend Diane he had been run out of Ghana by {{the father of a}} woman he had a fling with. He was offered a permanent position at Holby by Christopher Sutherland, however this was almost immediately retracted when Abra defied new protocol by utilising the designated emergency theatre for a minor gall stone operation. Edmondson explained of the storyline: [...] "Abra promises a patient he'll operate on her immediately, but the hospital rules say he can't book the operating theatre for the same day. So Abra decides to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> He has a knee-jerk reaction to any kind of authority." [...] Initially this plot strand was set to crossover with Holby's sister show, Casualty, with Sutherland's role instead filled by Casualty manager Nathan Spence, however this was abandoned prior to broadcast. After clashing with colleague Nick Jordan in the following episode, [...] "Invasion", Abra made a favourable impression on Lord Byrne, an old family friend. He then left Holby again briefly for a research project recommended by Lord Byrne.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, {{a report}} by {{consultancy}} EC Harris found that Saudi Arabia is the cheapest country in the Middle East to build in, half as expensive as Bahrain, and 34% cheaper than the United Arab Emirates, where Burj Khalifa is located. The future towers' site is located in very close proximity to King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, whose runways nearly align with the towers' site, which will {{have an effect on}} the airspace. While skyscraper experts have stated that towers well over one kilometre, even two kilometres (6,562 feet) high, are technically buildable, physical sustainability and practicality issues come into play in towers of this height. From a real estate perspective, it is considered virtually impossible to create enough demand to justify such a tower, but that at some point someone with a great excess of money will likely <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> As for physical restraints, Bart Leclercq, head of structures for WSP Middle East recently said, [...] "I truly believe that 1 mileâ1.6 kilometresâis within range. Over that, it may be possible if there are improvements in concrete quality. But 2km is too big a figure âit's just a step too far at the moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{documentary}} Last of the Gladiators, Knievel discussed {{the crash of}} a 1970 Pepsi-Cola sponsored jump in Yakima, Washington. Knievel knew the jump was very questionable, but stated, [...] "I went ahead and <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> When you give your word to somebody that you're going to do something, you've gotta do it." [...] In the 1971 biopic, George Hamilton (as Evel) emphasizes in the opening monologue that a man does not go back on his word.|$|R

500|$|According to Van Peebles, {{during the}} first day of shooting, {{director}} of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> When he saw the rushes, Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a period of 19 days {{in order to avoid the}} possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as [...] "globs," [...] where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a stunt man, he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, [...] "Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again." [...] Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted gonorrhea when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the Directors Guild in order to get workers' compensation because he was [...] "hurt on the job." [...] Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.|$|E
