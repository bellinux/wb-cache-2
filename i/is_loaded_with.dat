5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

5000|$|Flintlock muskets {{were the}} {{mainstay}} of European armies between 1660 and 1840. A musket was a muzzle-loading smoothbore long gun that <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> a round lead ball, {{but it could also}} <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> shot for hunting. For military purposes, the weapon <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> ball, or a mixture of ball with several large shot (called buck and ball), and had an effective range of about 75 to 100 metres. Smoothbore weapons that were designed for hunting birds were called [...] "fowlers." [...] Flintlock muskets tended to be of large caliber and usually had no choke, allowing them to fire full-caliber balls.|$|R

25|$|The Ball 4.6×30mm {{cartridge}} weighs 7g and <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> a 2.7g Full Metal Jacket projectile with a PbSb – alloy {{core and}} a steel copper plated jacket that achieves 600m/s (2,000ft/s) muzzle velocity.

The muzzle velocity V0 and V100 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.171 to 0.187 (BC's are somewhat debatable). At the stated effective range of 200m the 2.7g Ball projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.36 (463m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ρ=1.225kg/m3).|$|E

The muzzle velocity V0 and V50 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.112 to 0.119 (BC's are somewhat debatable).

25|$|Cold fusion {{researchers}} (McKubre since 1994, ENEA in 2011) {{have speculated}} that a cell that <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> a deuterium/palladium ratio lower than 100% (or 1:1) will not produce excess heat. Since most of the negative replications from 1989–1990 did not report their ratios, this has been proposed as an explanation for failed replications. This loading ratio is hard to obtain, and some batches of palladium never reach it because the pressure causes cracks in the palladium, allowing the deuterium to escape. Fleischmann and Pons never disclosed the deuterium/palladium ratio achieved in their cells, there are no longer any batches of the palladium used by Fleischmann and Pons (because the supplier uses now a different manufacturing process), and researchers still have problems finding batches of palladium that achieve heat production reliably.|$|E

His one significant criticism was that dialogue was difficult to hear, with no option to display text for it.
