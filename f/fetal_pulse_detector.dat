40|$|Transabdominal <b>fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry is an {{approach}} to measure oxygen saturation of the unborn child non-invasively. The principle of pulse oximetry {{is applied to the}} abdomen of a pregnant woman, such that the measured signal includes both, the maternal and the <b>fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> curve. One of the major challenges is to extract the shape of the <b>fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> curve from the mixed signal for computation of the oxygen saturation. In this paper we analyze the principle kind of connection of the <b>fetal</b> and maternal <b>pulse</b> curves in the measured signal. A time varying finite element model is used to rebuild the basic measurement environment, including a bulk tissue and two independently pulsing arteries to model the fetal and maternal blood circuit. The distribution of the light fluence rate in the model is computed by applying diffusion equation. From the detectors we extracted the time dependent fluence rate and analyzed the signal regarding its components. The frequency spectra of the signals show peaks at the fetal and maternal basic frequencies. Additional signal components are visible in the spectra, indicating multiplicative coupling of the <b>fetal</b> and maternal <b>pulse</b> curves. We conclude that the underlying signal model of algorithms for robust extraction of the shape of the <b>fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> curve, have to consider additive and multiplicative signal coupling...|$|R

40|$|The fetal oxygen {{saturation}} {{is an important}} parameter to determine the health status of a fetus, which is until now mostly acquired invasively. The transabdominal, <b>fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry is a promising approach to measure this non-invasively and continuously. The <b>fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> curve has to be extracted from the mixed signal of mother and fetus to determine its {{oxygen saturation}}. For this purpose efficient algorithms are necessary, which have to be evaluated under constant and reproducable test conditions. This paper presents the improved version of a phantom which can generate artificial pulse waves in a synthetic tissue phantom. The tissue phantom consists of several layers that mimic the different optical properties of the fetal and maternal tissue layers. Additionally an artificial vascular system and a dome, which mimics the bending of the belly of a pregnant woman, are incorporated. To obtain data on the pulse waves, several measurement methods are included, to help understand {{the behavior of the}} signals gained from the pulse waves. Besides pressure sensors and a transmissive method we integrated a capacitive approach, that makes use of the so called “Pin Oscillator” method. Apart from the enhancements in the tissue phantom and the measurements, we also improved the used blood substitute, which reproduces the different absorption characteristics of fetal and maternal blood. The results show that the phantom can generate pulse waves similar to the natural ones.

40|$|Abstract—The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is the prediction of fetal acidemia based on the Very Low Frequency (VLF) components of the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) and <b>Fetal</b> <b>Pulse</b> Oximetry (FspO 2) recordings during labor. In order to perform the spectral analysis, we applied the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and the adaptive approximation technique using the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm. The evaluation of FspO 2 was based on calculating the time duration in which the FSpO 2 was less than 30 % (TSpO 2 < 30 %). We demonstrate that the oscillating activity of the FHR of about 0. 01 Hz identified by the MP method and the TSpO 2 < 30 % parameter, show an adequate sensitivity (90 %) in predicting fetal acidemia, whereas the combination of these two variables shows a very good specificity (94 %).

40|$|Transabdominal <b>fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry is {{a method}} to monitor the oxygen supply of the unborn child non-invasively. Due to the {{measurement}} setup, the received signal of the detector is composed of photons coding purely maternal and photons coding mixed fetal-maternal information. To analyze the wellbeing of the fetus, the fetal signal is extracted from the mixed component. In this paper we assess source-detector configurations, such that the mixed fetal-maternal components of the acquired signals are maximized. Monte-Carlo method is used to simulate light propagation and photon distribution in tissue. We use a plane layer and a spherical layer geometry to model the abdomen of a pregnant woman.

We focus on the values of the standard deviation of the wavelet components (up to scale index 5) and we apply Self-Organizing-Map in order to investigate the relationship between the fetal heart rate variability in different scales and FSpO 2 (taking as a threshold for the FSpO 2, the 30 % level and considering the minimum value of FSpO 2 during a 10 -minute segment) for normal and acidemic fetuses during the second stage of labor, which can be used to discriminate acidemic fetuses from normal ones. A total accuracy of 91 % has been achieved, enabling us to correctly classify all the normal cases (but one) as belonging in the normal group and all pathologic cases (but two) as belonging in the acidemia group, therefore providing a clinically significant measure for the discrimination of the different groups. <b>Fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry seems to be an important additional source of information...|$|R

40|$|A robust {{cellular}} counter {{could enable}} synthetic biologists to design complex circuits with diverse behaviors. The existing synthetic-biological counters, {{responsive to the}} beginning of the pulse, are sensitive to the pulse duration.

As biological events do not follow precise timing, use of such a <b>pulse</b> <b>detector</b> would enable the design of robust asynchronous counters which can count the completion of events.

Design Retrospective off-line analysis of cardiotocogram and FSpO(2) recordings. Setting The Maternity Unit of the 2 nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Aretaieion Hospital, University of Athens. Population Sixty-one women of more than 37 weeks of gestation were monitored throughout labour. Methods Multiresolution wavelet analysis was applied in each 10 -minute period of second stage of labour focussing on long term variability changes in different frequency ranges and statistical analysis was performed in the associated 10 -minute FSpO(2) recordings. Self-organising map neural network was used to categorise the different 10 -minute fetal heart rate patterns and the associated 10 -minute FSP 02 recordings. Main outcome measures Umbilical artery pH of < 7. 20 and Apgar score at 5 minutes of {{less than or equal to}} 7 formed the inclusion criteria of the risk group. Results After using k-means clustering algorithm, the two-dimensional output layer of the self-organising map neural network was divided into three distinct clusters.

We applied the new procedure in non-reassuring CTG patterns, in which cesarean section was performed, and tested its accuracy in the diagnosis of the intrapartum fetal compromise. Methods: At the 'Aretaieion' University Hospital labor ward, 318 women with term fetuses in the cephalic presentation entered the trial during labor. They all were monitored with external CTG and <b>fetal</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry. In the cases that cesarean section was applied, because of abnormal CTG tracings, we applied a method based on the multiresolution wavelet analysis and a self-organized map neural network on {{the first and second}} stage of labor. The main outcome parameter was the rate of cord metabolic acidosis at birth (pH 7. 05, while in 11 Apgar scores at 5 min were < 7, while none of those neonates were transferred to NICU. In the rest 20 cases cord pH was < 7. 05; in all of these cases Apgar scores at 5 min were < 7, while four neonates were transferred to NICU. In one of them, neonatal encephalopathy was diagnosed. After the offline application of wavelet analysis and neural networks to the pulse oximetry and FHR variability readings of the 50 cases, statistics calculated that the system showed a sensitivity of 85 % and a specificity of 93 %, while false negative and false positive rates were 15 % and 7 %, respectively.
