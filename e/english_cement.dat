5000|$|English rule {{expanded}} in the 16th century by the Tudor conquest of Ireland, leading the Gaelic order to collapse {{at the start}} of the 17th century. The Flight of the Earls in 1607 paved the way for the Plantation of Ulster and a deepening of the English language culture in Ireland. The Cromwellian Plantation and suppression of Catholicism, including both native Irish and the [...] "Old English" [...] (those of Anglo-Norman descent), further <b>cemented</b> <b>English</b> influence across the country.|$|R
5000|$|Settlement {{from which}} modern Beočin {{developed}} was mentioned first in 1702. In {{the beginning it}} was only a village, and its basic economic activity was vine production (even today, the oldest part of Beočin is known as Beočin Selo, i.e. [...] "Beočin village" [...] in <b>English).</b> After the <b>cement</b> factory was opened (in 1871), Beočin developed into a modern town, which over time became the centre of the northern Syrmia. The cement factory in Beočin {{is one of the largest}} cement factories in Europe. New, urban part of the town, started to develop as worker's colony and it was known as Fabrika ("factory"), Beočin Fabrika ("Beočin factory") and Beočin Grad ("Beočin town").|$|R

5000|$|Central City Stone Works was {{established}} by Bassett Brothers in 1864. They were succeeded by M. G. Fields & Company in 1867 who expanded the firm and opened a manufacturing facility on January 15, 1877. The company produced goods from <b>English</b> imported Portland <b>Cement</b> such as chimney, well, drain, sewer and culvert pipe. They also manufactured ornamental building stone, step stone and cement sidewalks, lawn vases [...] "of which there are many samples in our local parks and cemeteries." [...] The company office and works were located on South Onondaga Street and the branch office was located at James Finegan's Stone Yard {{on the corner of}} Olive and Fulton Streets.

50|$|Mignolet {{made his}} Sunderland debut in a 2-2 draw against Birmingham City on 15 August 2010, {{and was named}} man of the match for his performance. In the next home game, a 1-0 victory against Manchester City, Mignolet kept his first clean sheet for Sunderland, {{following}} an excellent reaction save to deny Emmanuel Adebayor a goal. Mignolet put in another fine performance against Arsenal, as Sunderland drew 1-1 after Darren Bent equalised in the 95th minute. Craig Gordon would replace Mignolet in goal several weeks later however, and remained first choice thereafter. Mignolet did not feature again until 8 January 2011, when Sunderland suffered a loss at home to Notts County {{in the third round}} of the FA Cup. Mignolet would become first choice keeper again after a knee injury to Gordon in February, and earned a string of rave reviews for his performances. Following the draw, manager Steve Bruce hailed the young keeper's fine start to life in <b>English</b> football. Mignolet <b>cemented</b> his position as first choice keeper the following season, being preferred to new signing Keiren Westwood in goal. On 29 October 2011, Mignolet was injured during a 2-2 draw with Aston Villa, suffering a broken nose following a collision with Emile Heskey.|$|R
40|$|Cemented total-joint {{arthroplasty}} {{has been}} increasingly {{used in the}} treatment of end stage arthritis of the thumb trapeziometacarpal joint. Evidence supporting its use {{in the treatment of}} trapeziometacarpal disorders in the literature is very limited. Most hand surgeons agree that there are concerns about the methodological quality of the limited literature available. In this study, we analysed the methodological quality of the outcome studies on cemented total-joint arthroplasty of the thumb. We included all the outcome studies published in the <b>English</b> literature on <b>cemented</b> total-joint arthroplasty of the trapeziometacarpal joint of thumb. We analysed these studies for methodological deficiencies and quality of outcome reporting based on the recommendations given by Coleman et al. Our study revealed that there were no uniform standards of outcome reporting. The mean Coleman score for the studies dealing with cemented total-joint arthroplasty of the thumb was 42. 9. Major deficiencies were identified in areas like subject selection criteria (0 / 15), type of study (5. 7 / 15), description of surgical procedure (3. 7 / 5), description of the rehabilitation protocol (2 / 10), outcome measures (4. 4 / 10) and outcome assessment (3. 9 / 15). The methodological quality of the studies published within the last 10 years (49. 9 ± 9. 7) was found to be slightly better than the studies published over 10  years ago (39. 7 ± 7. 8). Our study highlights the need for more evidence in the form of randomised controlled prospective studies conducted with good methodological quality, comparing the cemented total-joint arthroplasty of the thumb to other procedures available for the treatment of disorders of the thumb. Further, to improve the standards of reporting, journal editors should try to standardise the outcome of the reporting by following the surgical procedures on the thumb...|$|R
