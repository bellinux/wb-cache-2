5|$|Gossip, {{with his}} long, flowing beard, {{looks like one}} of the old-time monks. He has a good-shaped cranium, bald at the top, and is a little above the medium height.... He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E

5|$|On August 28, Michaels and Diesel {{captured}} the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The {{next day at}} SummerSlam, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ramon when Michaels accidentally superkicked Diesel. This triggered a split between Michaels and Diesel, a storyline that was drawn out until Survivor Series that November. Michaels {{went on to win}} the Royal Rumble in 1995, which set up a championship grudge match at WrestleMania XI against Diesel (who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Bob Backlund). As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited Sid as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match and was attacked by Sid the following night. After this, Michaels took time off because Vince McMahon wanted Michaels to become a fan favorite.|$|E

25|$|Producer David Mullich joined Cyberdreams {{shortly after}} Ellison and Sears drafted their {{treatment}} and Sears <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> {{a position at}} another software company.

Mullich decided to complete the design himself, having created a 1980 computer game based upon The Prisoner television series which, like this adventure, involved a surreal environment, metaphorical story elements, and rewards for ethical behavior. After several months, he produced an 800-page game design document containing more than 2000 lines of additional dialogue.|$|E
