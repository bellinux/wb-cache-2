5|$|The missionaries {{were forced}} to proceed slowly, and could not <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{eliminating}} pagan practices, or destroying temples or other sacred sites, unlike the missionary efforts {{that had taken place}} in Gaul under St Martin. There was little fighting or bloodshed during the mission. Paganism was still practised in Kent until the 630s, and it was not declared illegal until 640. Although Honorius sent Felix to the East Angles, it appears that most of the impetus for conversion came from the East Anglian king.|$|E

But the UFW now had too few resources and membership to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. The UFW deployed its best strategic weapon, the boycott, and kept up the push for a national boycott of grapes, wine and lettuce. The Teamsters reiterated their pledge to uphold their contracts in November.|$|E
25|$|Having escaped prosecution, Clodius {{attained}} the aedileship for 57 BC. He {{then started}} proceedings against Milo for inciting violence, the same charge Milo had brought against him. He {{did not expect}} conviction as Milo had many powerful allies, including Cicero and Pompey. He used this to attack both his followers and Pompey. He got his supporters to taunt Pompey in the assemblies. Pompey could not <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. He also continued his attacks on Cicero. The latter claimed that his transitio ad plebem was illegal and so were the laws he had passed, including the one that sanctioned his exile. Clashes between the two factions continued.|$|E

25|$|During the Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) the Lucanians and Bruttii {{sided with}} Pyrrhus and {{provided}} contingents which fought with his army. When Pyrrhus landed in Italy {{the people of}} Rhegion were worried about their safety and asked Rome for protection. The Romans sent soldiers from Campania to garrison the city. Coveting {{the wealth of the}} city, the soldiers killed its prominent men, sent away the rest and seized their property. The Romans could not <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it because they were engaged in the war. A few {{years after the end of}} the war, in 271 BC, the Romans retook the city, arrested the soldiers and took them to Rome, where they were executed. After Pyrrhus was defeated, to avoid Roman revenge, the Bruttii submitted willingly and gave up half of the Sila, a mountainous plateau which was valuable for its pitch and timber. The timber here was sold all over Italy and the resin of the area was of the highest quality.|$|E
500|$|After McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge {{supported}} a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, {{which would have}} created a federal board to lend money to farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass. In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it. In his veto message, he expressed {{the belief that the}} bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy. Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it. [...] "Farmers never have made much money," [...] said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son. [...] "I do not believe we can <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell {{was drafted}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. [...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes me about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's been hard for me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. [...] I think it's better for me to play a lot, but then again I'm not the coach." ...|$|E

[...] Page then told The New York Times that he was [...] "fed up" [...] with Plant's refusal to play, stating [...] "I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, {{to be honest with}} you.
