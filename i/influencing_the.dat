The study was conducted at a stretch of Atlantic Forest, in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil. Five hummingbird species were registered as floral visitors. The average visitation rate (± standard deviation) of hummingbirds was 2 (± 0. 56) visits per hour per clustering. The amount of inflorescences per clustering positively <b>influenced</b> <b>the</b> visitation rate of hummingbirds, but it negatively <b>influenced</b> <b>the</b> amount of fruits produced per inflorescence. According to the results obtained, we suggest that the density of inflorescences in a clustering may negatively <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> number of flowers visited per inflorescence, due to an increased amount of inflorescences included in the foraging routes...|$|R
