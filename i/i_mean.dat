5|$|Yeah, I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> I mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> I still, I {{do the same things}} that I did before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E
5|$|By {{meditation}} <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> prolonged reasoning {{with the}} understanding, in this way. We begin by {{thinking of the}} favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son; {{and we do not}} stop there but proceed to consider the mysteries of His whole glorious life.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
50|$|For example: The verb hıb {{means to}} love, Bahıb <b>means</b> <b>I</b> love, Bthıb <b>means</b> you love, Bahıbo <b>means</b> <b>I</b> love him, Bıthıbha means she loves her, Bahıbhom <b>means</b> <b>I</b> love them, Bahıbhālí <b>means</b> <b>I</b> love myself.|$|R

5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> I'm really proud of it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E
5|$|The moral {{systems of}} religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our {{kids in a}} {{religious}} way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> it's at least a moral belief.|$|E
5|$|David Cameron (Conservative {{leader and}} Prime Minister) said:... {{he was an}} {{extraordinary}} man: a great writer, a brilliant speaker, extraordinary in Parliament, and a great life of public and political and parliamentary service. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> I disagreed with most of what he said. But he was always engaging and interesting, and you were never bored when reading or listening to him, and the country a great campaigner, a great writer, and someone who I'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many, many years to come.|$|E

5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E

5|$|How, indeed, he {{presided over}} the Church which is among us, and saved that sacred ship, in storm, and in wave, and billow; and what a bold front he showed to the emperor, and how he lay down his life for the sheep and {{underwent}} that blessed slaughter; these things and such as these, we will leave to the elder among our teachers, and to our common father, to speak of. For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many things as happened lately, and within our lifetime, these, I a young man will relate to you, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> those after death, those after the burial of the martyr, those which happened while he remained {{in the suburbs of}} the city....|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
5|$|My lords, the law {{of nature}} moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, {{considering}} I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring {{from the bottom of}} my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.|$|E
5|$|Since our blessed Lord, {{instead of}} a rich and honourable station in this world, was pleased to choose his lot among men of the lower condition; let not those, on whom the bounty of Providence hath {{bestowed}} wealth and honours, despise the men who are placed in a humble and inferior station; but rather, with their utmost power, by their countenance, by their protection, by just payment of their honest labour, encourage their daily endeavours {{for the support of}} themselves and their families. On the other hand, let the poor labour to provide things honest in the sight of all men; and so, with diligence in their several employments, live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world, that they may obtain that glorious reward promised in the Gospel to the poor, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> the kingdom of Heaven.|$|E

5|$|The Kind of Blue musicians {{appeared}} {{together in}} further recorded ventures through the 1960s. Davis {{had made a}} rare post-1953 sideman appearance in 1958 on Adderley's Somethin' Else album; Evans and Adderley collaborated on the latter's LP Know What <b>I</b> <b>Mean?</b> from 1961. Kelly and Chambers backed Hank Mobley on Soul Station in 1960, and Evans and Chambers played on the sessions for The Blues and the Abstract Truth by Oliver Nelson in 1961. The rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb backed Coltrane for Coltrane Jazz and one track on his landmark Giant Steps, which featured Chambers throughout. That trio stayed with Davis for the recordings Someday My Prince Will Come and the live sets at the Blackhawk and at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006.

Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E
