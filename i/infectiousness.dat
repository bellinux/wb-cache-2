5|$|The viral load of an {{infected}} person {{is an important}} risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission. During the first 2.5months of an HIV infection a person's <b>infectiousness</b> is twelve times higher due to this high viral load. If the person is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.|$|E
25|$|The term {{infectivity}} {{describes the}} ability of an organism to enter, survive and multiply in the host, while the <b>infectiousness</b> of a disease agent indicates the comparative ease with which the disease agent is transmitted to other hosts. Transmission of pathogen can occur in various ways including physical contact, contaminated food, body fluids, objects, airborne inhalation, or through vector organisms.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonable}} guideline is {{to treat}} people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter {{the course of the}} illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. Antibiotics when used early decrease the duration of <b>infectiousness,</b> and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between virulence and transmission is complex, and has important {{consequences for the}} long term evolution of a pathogen. Since it takes many generations for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve, an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher <b>infectiousness</b> if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing and coughing create infectious aerosols).|$|E
500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} performance, critical {{reactions to}} the song were mixed to positive. Jon O'Brien of Allmusic, {{in a review of}} Megalomania, viewed [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] as one of the highlight songs of the album saying, [...] "The sweeping strings, inspired sound effects, and driving country-pop melodies of the lushly produced opener 'Playmate to Jesus', [...] shows the reunion hasn't been completely without merit." [...] Time said the song [...] "has the dubious distinction of sounding vaguely like a Lady Gaga track that didn’t pass quality control," [...] but was [...] "relatively catchy, boasting the kind of musical <b>infectiousness</b> that causes you to hum it under your breath on the subway." ...|$|E

Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "If Madonna is wishing {{to pass on}} her 'Material Girl' title, Gwen Stefani is happy to wear it proudly", but noted that [...] "hings are wearing a little thin, and this song doesn't have the striking impact of 'Rich Girl' or 'Hollaback Girl'." [...] Sam Shepherd of musicOMH agreed, writing that [...] "'Luxurious' {{is by no means}} a bad song, but it is pretty ordinary when compared to the songs that have preceded it." [...] PopMatters' Jason Damas found the track uninteresting and stated that Rossdale's appearance [...] "sounds like a blinged-out Saint Etienne". Alex Lai from Contactmusic.com called Stefani's performance [...] "as seductive as ever, and the production extremely polished, but it lacks the <b>infectiousness</b> of her other releases"; he found Slim Thug's remix unnecessary and viewed the single's release as [...] "a money-spinning exercise".|$|E
500|$|In the UK, BBC DJ John Peel called [...] "Ding Dong" [...] "repetitive and dull" [...] {{and accused}} Harrison of complacency, while the NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Dark Horse as [...] "Just stuff and nonsense", adding: [...] "You keep looking for saving graces, for words of enthusiasm {{to pass on}} – 'Ding Dong', you begin to think, for all its inane lyrics, has some spirit, {{but it really is}} very slight." [...] Harrison's {{standing}} there was not helped by the presence of [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] on the B-side, due to its casual delivery and the literal message in the song title. In a more favourable review, for Melody Maker, Chris Irwin wrote of the single: [...] "We’ve come to expect something with more substance than this glorified nursery rhyme from {{one of the most important}} musicians of the decade. True, it’s catchy with a full chunky sound to bounce it along, but with an undeniable <b>infectiousness</b> of the sort normally associated with chicken pox or measles ... Curiously, records of such banality have a habit of selling in their zillions and this is bound to be a biggie. Hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of measles include four-day fevers (the 4 D's) and the three C's—cough, coryza (head cold, fever, sneezing), and conjunctivitis (red eyes)—along with fever and rashes. Fever is common and typically lasts for about one week; the fever seen with measles is often as high as [...] Koplik's spots seen inside the mouth are pathognomonic (diagnostic) for measles, but are temporary and therefore rarely seen. Recognizing these spots before a person reaches their maximum <b>infectiousness</b> can help physicians reduce the spread of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{development}} of the larvae in the egg stops at temperatures below 15.5°C, and eggs cannot survive temperatures much above 38°C. If the temperature is around 25°C, the <b>infectiousness</b> occurs after nearly 10 days of incubation. Finally, after 2 to 4 weeks in moist soil at optimal temperature and oxygen levels, the embryo develops into an infective larva, named [...] "second-stage larva".

2500|$|Rutter's {{music is}} very popular, {{particularly}} in the USA. In the UK many hold him in high regard, {{as illustrated by the}} following quotation from a review in the London Evening Standard (25 September 2005): [...] "For the <b>infectiousness</b> of his melodic invention and consummate craftsmanship, Rutter has few peers". [...] Sue Lawley referred to Rutter as [...] "the most celebrated and successful composer of carols alive today" [...] and Sean Rafferty heralded Rutter as [...] "a creator of not just carols, but wonderfully great things for the human voice." [...] One British composer, David Arditti, didn't regard him as a sufficiently [...] "serious" [...] composer, saying that Rutter is [...] "hard to take seriously, because {{of the way in which}} his sheer technical facility or versatility leads to a superficial, unstable crossover style which is neither quite classical nor pop, and which tends towards mawkish sentimentality in his sugarily-harmonised and orchestrated melodies." [...] The Guardian remarked that [...] "it is as a writer of carols that he has really made his mark … His larger-scale works – particularly the Gloria (1974), Requiem (1985) and Magnificat (1990) – are also well established in the choral repertoire." [...] David Willcocks considered Rutter [...] "the most gifted composer of his generation." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{silkworm}} {{has long}} been known to be subject to a very fatal and infectious disease called the Muscardine. Audouin transmitted it by inoculation. This disease is entirely due {{to the development of a}} fungus, Botrytis Bassiana, in the body of the caterpillar; and its contagiousness and <b>infectiousness</b> are accounted for in the same way as those of the fly-disease. But, of late years, a still more serious epizootic has appeared among the silkworms; and I may mention a few facts which will give you some conception of the gravity of the injury which it has inflicted on France alone.|$|E

It is true, of course, that, {{in the end}} of ends, {{nothing but}} the right conquers; the {{prevalent}} thorns of wrong, at last, crackle away in indiscriminate flame: and of the good seed sown, one grain in a thousand some day comes up--and somebody lives by it; but most of our great teachers, not excepting Carlyle and Emerson themselves, are a little too encouraging in their proclamation of this comfort, not, to my mind, very sufficient, when for the present our fields are full of nothing but darnel instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley; and none of them seem to me yet to have enough insisted on the inevitable power and <b>infectiousness</b> of all evil, and the easy and utter extinguishableness of good. Medicine often fails of its effect--but poison never: and while, in summing the observation of past life, not unwatchfully spent, I can truly say that I have a thousand times seen patience disappointed of her hope, and wisdom of her aim, I have never yet seen folly fruitless of mischief, nor vice conclude but in calamity.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{yet another}} way in which {{specifics}} which have no merits at all, either direct or incidental, may be brought into high repute by statistics. For a century past civilization has been cleaning away the conditions which favor bacterial fevers. Typhus, once rife, has vanished: plague and cholera have been stopped at our frontiers by a sanitary blockade. We still have epidemics of smallpox and typhoid; and diphtheria and scarlet fever are endemic in the slums. Measles, which in my childhood was not regarded as a dangerous disease, has now become so mortal that notices are posted publicly urging parents to take it seriously. But even in these cases {{the contrast between the}} death and recovery rates in the rich districts and in the poor ones has led to the general conviction among experts that bacterial diseases are preventable; and they already are to a large extent prevented. The dangers of infection and the way to avoid it are better understood than they used to be. It is barely twenty years since people exposed themselves recklessly to the infection of consumption and pneumonia in the belief that these diseases were not [...] "catching." [...] Nowadays the troubles of consumptive patients are greatly increased by the growing disposition to treat them as lepers. No doubt there is a good deal of ignorant exaggeration and cowardly refusal to face a human and necessary share of the risk. That has always been the case. We now know that the medieval horror of leprosy was out of all proportion to the danger of infection, and was accompanied by apparent blindness to the <b>infectiousness</b> of smallpox, which has since been worked up by our disease terrorists into the position formerly held by leprosy. But the scare of infection, though it sets even doctors talking as if the only really scientific thing to do with a fever patient is to throw him into the nearest ditch and pump carbolic acid on him from a safe distance until he is ready to be cremated on the spot, has led to much greater care and cleanliness. And the net result has been a series of victories over disease.|$|E

50|$|Climate {{and living}} area. Rainfall (number of rainy days being more {{important}} than total precipitation), mean of sunshine daily hours, latitude, altitude are characteristic agents to take in account when assessing the possibility of spread of any airborne infection. Furthermore, some infrequent or exceptional extreme events also influence the dissemination of airborne diseases, as tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons, or monsoons. Climate conditions determine temperature, winds and relative humidity in any territory, either all year around or at isolated moments (days or weeks). Those are the main factors affecting the spread, duration and <b>infectiousness</b> of droplets containing infectious particles. For instance, influenza virus, is spread easily in northern countries (north hemisphere), because of climate conditions which favour the <b>infectiousness</b> of the virus {{but on the other}} hand, in those countries, lots of bacterial infections cannot spread outdoor most of the year, keeping in a latent stage.|$|E

50|$|While latent or {{latency period}} may be synonymous, a {{distinction}} is sometimes made between incubation period, {{the period between}} infection and onset of the disease, and latent period, the time from infection to <b>infectiousness.</b> Which is shorter depends on the disease.

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, leprosy ranks lowly {{in terms of}} <b>infectiousness</b> and is not congenital.

As nerve damage is permanent, {{even those who have}} recovered can not feel pain.

Since seed dispersal is such that the highest density of seeds is around the parent with density decreasing with distance from the parent, the reproduction rate of a disease infecting seeds and seedlings will be highest around the parent and decrease with distance. Thus, seedlings close to the parent are likely to die due to the disease prevalence. However, seedlings farther away are less likely to encounter the disease and therefore will more likely grow into adults.|$|E
