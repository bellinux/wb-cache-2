25|$|The Balloon Corps was {{eventually}} {{assigned to the}} Army Corps of Engineers and put under the administrative purview of one Captain Cyrus B. Comstock, who did not appreciate a civilian (Lowe) being paid more than <b>he.</b> <b>He</b> reduced Lowe's pay from $10 gold to $6 currency (equal to $3 gold) per day. Lowe posted a letter of outrage and threatened to resign his position. No one came to his support, and Comstock remained unyielding. On 8 April 1863, Lowe left the military service {{and returned to the}} private sector. Direction of the Balloon Corps defaulted to the Allen brothers, but they were not as competent as Lowe. By 1 August 1863, the Corps was no longer used.|$|E
25|$|In 242, Sun Quan {{designated}} {{his third}} and eldest surviving son, Sun He, {{as the new}} crown prince to replace Sun Deng, {{who died in the}} previous year. In the same year, he also enfeoffed his fourth son, Sun Ba, as the Prince of Lu. At the time, Shi Yi served as a tutor (傅) to Sun Ba. When he saw that Sun Ba received equal treatment as Sun <b>He,</b> <b>he</b> felt that it was highly inappropriate because according to Confucian rules of propriety, Sun He, as the Crown Prince, should be accorded greater honours and privileges as compared to Sun Ba. He wrote memorials to Sun Quan on a number of occasions, recommending the emperor to let Sun Ba assume greater responsibilities and groom him to become an important pillar of the state. As Sun Ba's tutor, he gave proper advice to the prince and performed his role in a professional manner. At the same time, he also carried out his other duties diligently and treated everyone respectfully.|$|E
25|$|Around the time, Sun Quan's heir apparent, Sun Deng, who was {{stationed}} in Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), was actively networking with many people. He wrote to Bu Zhi, seeking his advice on whom he should talk to first because he knew little about the officials in Eastern Wu. In his reply to Sun Deng, Bu Zhi named 11 notable officials serving in Jing Province – Zhuge Jin, Lu Xun, Zhu Ran, Cheng Pu, Pan Jun, Pei Xuan (裴玄), Xiahou Cheng (夏侯承), Wei Jing (衞旌), Li Su (李肅), Zhou Tiao (周條) and Shi Gan (石幹) – and appraised them individually. He also advised Sun Deng to refrain from micromanaging, and instead learn from great rulers such as Duke Huan of Qi and Emperor Gao of Han, who delegated the task of governing their empires to their premiers (e.g. Guan Zhong, Xiao <b>He).</b> <b>He</b> also urged Sun Deng to attract as many talents as possible to join him.|$|E

25|$|In the 2016 {{video game}} , the {{character}} Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing {{a car accident}} which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, {{to the day after}} this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancee, Ellen Wyatt, {{as a result of this}} disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin's feelings towards her to coming across as distant and cold. As the storyline continues, however, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancee, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists inside of him every day, due to his disorder. It is also noticeable in that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every minuet detail of every day after his sister's death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitution to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook to become aware each time he wakes up of the fact that <b>he</b> <b>he</b> his condition, what the current date apparently is, and everything important that have apparently occurred on every day since he first developed the condition. The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt's trial as to whether Sorin's journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Danger's imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin's journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into mental collapse that any of his other memories and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else's manipulation.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for the Melbourne, Australia newspaper, The Age, Larry Schwartz {{selected}} the documentary as [...] "Critic's Choice". Schwartz {{was critical of}} Theroux's lack of detachment from his subject matter, [...] "He repeatedly distances himself from the church, expressing his disapproval of their views. But so concerned is <b>he,</b> <b>he</b> seems almost evangelical in his determination to show them the error of their ways." [...] The documentary was highlighted in The Sydney Morning Herald among [...] "The week's best", and critic Greg Hassall characterised it as, [...] "Disturbing, perplexing and very entertaining." [...] The Australia newspaper MX highlighted the documentary favorably, in its column, [...] "Best in show". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun selected The Most Hated Family in America as his [...] "Top Choice" [...] recommendation. Adams wrote, [...] "A truly disturbing, disgusting and sad documentary. The repellent Shirley Phelps is the outspoken nutbag who got publicity by calling Heath Ledger a 'fag enabler' after his death. This jaw-dropping doco infiltrates Phelps' only-in-America church where her 11 spooky kids regularly picket funerals of US soldiers killed in Iraq – they believe God killed them to show his hatred of how 'depraved' America now is." ...|$|E
500|$|Comparing Jack's {{relationship}} with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states [...] "I think [...] different sorts of love or lust, {{as it might}} be, and I think that's an ongoing thing ... At the moment, I think there's two different sorts of love going on there." [...] He also states that he feels that Ianto's {{relationship with}} Jack is his first same-sex relationship, and doesn't feel that Ianto would be a [...] "labelist", but were <b>he,</b> <b>he</b> would identify as bisexual, but that he [...] "wouldn't regard himself {{the same way as}} Jack does because they're from different times." [...] Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as [...] "serious and committed", as seen in [...] "A Day in the Death" [...] where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity". Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as {{this is the first time}} that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew. The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying [...] "You do know he's ...", which Ianto finishes [...] "Just a shag?" [...] before adding [...] "Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual." [...] In radio play [...] "The Dead Line", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real. When asked if the relationship will continue in series three, executive producer Julie Gardner replied, [...] "Yes, I like seeing them as a couple", while director Euros Lyn stated that [...] "the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [...] to unfold" [...] in the third series. While Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved, which is [...] "part of the tragedy", the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David-Lloyd to be [...] "happy to walk away from it." ...|$|E
