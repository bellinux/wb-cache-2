FOP settlement involves delivery of the securities without a simultaneous transfer of funds - hence 'free of payment'.

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the {{influence}} of <b>free</b> <b>delivery</b> and <b>free</b> returns on the purchasing and return behaviour of real e-customers in the marketplace. To accomplish this goal, we conducted the study as a fully randomised and controlled experiment in cooperation with nelly. com, a Nordic e-commerce site that specialises in fashion and beauty. Our results suggest that a lenient delivery policy is associated with increased order frequency, decreased average value of purchased items, increased probability of return, and increased average value of returned items. In addition, a lenient return policy was found to be associated with increased order frequency, a decrease in the average value of orders, a decrease in the average value of purchased items, and increased probability of return. However, the effect sizes are generally small, and we conclude that factors such as legislation and competition often force e-tailers to offer <b>free</b> <b>delivery</b> and <b>free</b> returns even though such offers probably would not have been profitable otherwise...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the general}} {{election}} in 1841 Cobden was returned for Stockport, Cheshire, and in 1843 Bright was the Free Trade candidate at a by-election at Durham. He was defeated, but his successful competitor was unseated on petition, and at the second contest Bright was returned. He was already known as Cobden's chief ally, and was received in the House of Commons with suspicion and hostility. In the Anti-Corn Law movement the two speakers complemented each other. Cobden had the calmness and confidence of the political philosopher, Bright had the passion and the fervour of the popular orator. Cobden did the reasoning, Bright supplied the declamation, but mingled argument with appeal. No orator of modern times rose more rapidly. He was not known beyond his own borough when Cobden called him to his side in 1841, and he entered parliament {{towards the end of}} the session of 1843 with a formidable reputation. He had been all over England and Scotland addressing vast meetings and, as a rule, carrying them with him; he had taken a leading part in a conference held by the Anti-Corn Law League in London had led deputations to the Duke of Sussex, to Sir James Graham, then home secretary, and to Lord Ripon and Gladstone, the secretary and under secretary of the Board of Trade; and he was universally recognised as the chief orator of the Free Trade movement. Wherever [...] "John Bright of Rochdale" [...] was announced to speak, vast crowds assembled. He had been so announced, for the last time, at the first great meeting in Drury Lane Theatre on 15 March 1843; henceforth his name was enough. He took his seat in the House of Commons as one of the members for Durham on 28 July 1843, and on 7 August delivered his maiden speech in support of a motion by Mr Ewart for reduction of import duties. He was there, he said, [...] "not only as one of the representatives of the city of Durham, but also as one of the representatives of that benevolent organisation, the Anti-Corn Law League." [...] A member who heard the speech described Bright as [...] "about the middle size, rather firmly and squarely built, with a fair, clear complexion and an intelligent and pleasing expression of countenance. His voice is good, his enunciation distinct, and his <b>delivery</b> <b>free</b> from any unpleasant peculiarity or mannerism." [...] He wore the usual Friend's coat, and was regarded with much interest and hostile curiosity on both sides of the House.|$|E

40|$|By {{using the}} {{biological}} methods developed by Kahlson and Chang & Gaddum, free choline {{content of the}} blood was determined in newborn infants, {{as well as their}} mothers at the time of <b>delivery.</b> <b>Free</b> choline content of the blood of mothers at the time of delivery was 0. 043 mg/dl on an average, which was markedly lower than 0. 28 mg/dl, the average value for normal adults. In free choline content of the cord blood, mature newborn infants 2 ̆ 7 average was 0. 21 mg/dl, while premature newborn infants 2 ̆ 7 was 0. 24 mg/dl, both values being markedly higher than normal infants 2 ̆ 7 0. 14 mg/dl. In mature infants, free choline content of the blood suddenly began to fall within 24 hours after birth (down to 0. 06 mg/dl), but it showed an early improvement, rising to 0. 13 mg/dl on the 7 th postnatal day. In premature infants, it began to fall about the 7 th postnatal day and reached the lowest level on the 14 th postnatal day (0. 05 mg/dl). It took considerably long to improve, rising to 0. 1 mg/dl on about the 21 st postnatal day. Oral administration of choline chloride in a dose of over 40 mg per kg bodyweight per day had the effect of preventing the lowering of blood free choline levels in premature infants. Adequate doses ranged from 60 to 80 mg per kg bosdyweight per day. It seems that administration of choline chloride has favorable effect on the increase of bodyweight in premature infants...|$|E
40|$|Within East Asia, the outward-oriented Philippine {{economy is}} a latecomer to using free trade {{agreements}} (FTAs) as a trade policy instrument and has relied heavily on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for regional liberalization. While negotiating FTAs has consumed scarce time and other resources, limited attention has been hitherto given to evaluating the impact of FTAs [...] particularly the 15 -year-old ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) [...] on business activity in the Philippines. Using a survey of 155 manufactured goods exporters from three sectors (machinery and transport equipment, processed foods, and electronics), this study deals with three questions: (1) Do firms use AFTA and why and how are firms responding to AFTA and other FTAs? (2) What impedes firms from using either AFTA or other FTAs? (3) What {{can be done to}} improve FTA use at the firm level in the future?The study finds that utilization of AFTA is higher than expected from existing studies and is set to double in the future. A lack of information has been identified as the biggest barrier to FTA use. Other impediments include the availability of export-processing zone incentive schemes, low most-favored-nation rates, delays in origin administration, rent-seeking behavior, and nontariff measures in partner country markets. The paper concludes by making the case for better mainstreaming of FTAs into Philippine national trade policy, effectively encouraging the use of FTAs, and putting in place support mechanisms to Philippine firms.

40|$|Background: The {{thyroid hormone}} milieu is of crucial {{importance}} for the developing fetus. Pregnancy induces physiological changes in thyroid homeostasis that {{are influenced by the}} iodine status. However, longitudinal studies addressing thyroid function during pregnancy and after delivery are still lacking in mild-to-moderate iodine-deficient populations. Here we characterize the serum parameters of thyroid function throughout pregnancy, and until 1 year after delivery, in a population of pregnant women whom we have previously reported to be iodine deficient (median urinary iodine levels below 75 mg/L). Methods: One hundred eighteen pregnant women were studied. Clinical data were recorded and serum was collected. Serum total and free thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3), thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine-binding globulin, and thyroglobulin were measured. Results: Mean total T 4 ranged from 159 at the start of gestation to 127 nmol/L at 1 year after <b>delivery,</b> <b>free</b> T 4 from 14. 2 to 17. 8 pmol/L, total T 3 from 2. 4 to 2. 1 nmol/L, free T 3 from 6. 7 pmol/L to 6. 4 pmol/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone from 1. 2 to 1. 4 mIU/L, T 4 -binding globulin from 62. 0 to 26. 9 mg/L, and thyroglobulin from 11 to 10 mg/L. Conclusion: The pregnant women in this study had an absence of the usual free T 4 spike and a smaller than expected increment in total T 4, described during pregnancy in iodine-sufficient populations. A greater number of women had subclinical hypothyroidism compared with iodine-sufficient populations. This hormonal profile, most likely due to iodine insufficiency, may result in inadequate thyroid hormone supply to the developing fetus. We conclude that care should be taken when reviewing the results of thyroid hormone tests in iodine-insufficient populations and when no gestation-specific reference values have been established. In addition, we recommend iodine supplementation in our population and populations with similar iodine status, particularly during pregnancy and lactation...|$|E

40|$|Nisin is a {{naturally}} occurring food antimicrobial that inhibits many Grampositive pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterial pathogen responsible for ~ 500 {{deaths in the}} U. S. annually. Factors known to counteract the nisin activity in a food matrix include: antimicrobial interaction with food components, insolubility, protease inactivation, and target cell-driven envelope modifications. Encapsulating nisin in liposomes can help protect nisin functionality by regulating its introduction to the external environment. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the encapsulation efficiency (%EE) of nisin within liposomes as a function of encapsulation method and the capacity of liposomal nisin to inhibit L. monocytogenes in fluid milk. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphotidyl-DL-glycerol (PG) were used to prepare three lipid molar formulations: PC, PC/PG 7 : 3, and PC/PG 6 : 4 (mol. %). Liposomes were formulated to entrap the self-quenching fluorophore calcein and nisin. Unencapsulated analyte was removed via size-exclusion chromatography, and percent EE was determined. To determine antilisterial activity of liposomes, fluid milk samples containing L. monocytogenes (4 log 10 CFU/mL) in combination with liposomal or unencapsulated nisin at 50 IU/mL were mixed and aerobically stored at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Surviving L. monocytogenes were enumerated via plating on a non-selective microbiological medium after 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours of incubation. Encapsulation of nisin via extrusion resulted in a mean EE% of 84. 20 %, 77. 33 % and 80. 78 % for PC, PC/PG 7 : 3, and PC/PG 6 : 4 liposomes, respectively. Freeze-thaw cycling formed liposomes without detectable fluorophore entrapment. L. monocytogenes populations grew to 5 log 10 CFU/mL after 72 hours at 5 degrees C and 8 log 10 CFU/mL at 20 degrees C after 48 hours. Unencapsulated nisin exerted statistically greater inhibition of Listeria in skim milk compared to liposomal nisin, regardless of incubation temperature. No statistically significant differences in Listeria populations exposed to free or encapsulated nisin in whole milk were observed at either incubation temperature. Results indicate storage temperature and presence of milk fat exert greater influence then nisin <b>delivery</b> (<b>free</b> vs. encapsulated) over Listeria inhibition. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and develop more effective means of liposome entrapment of nisin for the inhibition of foodborne bacterial pathogens...|$|E
