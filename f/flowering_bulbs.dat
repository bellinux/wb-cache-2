5|$|To {{the south}} of the church there are the {{remnants}} of a stone preaching cross. The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's. Only the two circular steps into which the original structure was set remain; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the gnomon was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a small garden of remembrance. The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other <b>flowering</b> <b>bulbs</b> in early springtime.|$|E
500|$|Hippeastrum is a genus in {{the family}} Amaryllidaceae (subfamily Amaryllidoideae, tribe Hippeastreae, and {{subtribe}} Hippeastrineae) The name Hippeastrum, given to it by William Herbert, means [...] "Knight's-star-lily", although precisely what Herbert meant by the name is not certain. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result {{of which is that}} the common name [...] "amaryllis" [...] is mainly used for cultivars of this genus, often sold as indoor <b>flowering</b> <b>bulbs</b> particularly at Christmas in the northern hemisphere. By contrast the generic name Amaryllis applies to bulbs from South Africa, usually grown outdoors. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas from Argentina north to Mexico and the Caribbean.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> have a {{life cycle}} of a year or more, {{flowering}} either in spring or in summer. Nevertheless, year-round production of cut flowers has become common practice in horticulture. To control flowering, which {{is necessary for the}} year-round production of <b>flowers,</b> <b>bulbs</b> are exposed to specific temperature regimes to affect their growth and development. When storage or planting conditions are not properly chosen, physiological disorders in bulb development may occur. Flower bud abortion and aberrant leaves are examples of such physiological disorders. Disorders in the bulbs are usually not visible externally. They become apparent after planting even though they are often induced during storage. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain a better insight in the processes underlying physiological disorders in <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs,</b> induced by improper storage conditions. Changes in the water status are expected to be often involved in the development of the induced aberrations. The water status of stored <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> was therefore assessed using both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, known from the medical applications) as well as classical water status measurements. It was assessed whether the obtained parameters might serve as ‘early indicators’ of an impaired <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> quality and thus as indicators for the internal quality of stored bulbs. This might lead to a tool to detect the presence of disorders at an early stage of development. Such an application could avoid further cost of storage and planting of impaired bulbs and potentially increases the chances to minimize the damage. Furthermore, it would enable optimization of storage conditions of new <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> genera more easily. In addition, flower quality can be better guaranteed. The possibilities of MRI to assess non-invasively the internal quality of <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> appear extensive. T 2 -weighted imaging appeared to be a suitable application to visualize morphological changes like the growth of the shoot and the development of daughter bulbs. Aberrant developments of the floral parts in tulip bulbs after storage at high temperatures and the presence of aborted buds in Hippeastrum (amaryllis) bulbs could well be observed. Water concentration and T 1 and T 2 relaxation times were successfully used to assess the water status in the bulbs and to monitor water status related disorders like bud abortion in tulips after long-term cold and dry storage and freezing injury and water-soaking in lily bulbs. Thus, MRI has a great potential for the evaluation of the internal quality of <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> and horticultural products in general. However, currently the technique is still too expensive for routine, high-throughput applications, but on-line applications will become more feasible in the future...|$|R
40|$|Soft rot {{is causing}} {{increasing}} {{damage in the}} <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> industry. Bulbous ornamentals such as Hyacinthus, Dahlia, Iris, Muscari, Freesia and Zantedeschia can be infected. Soft rot in <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> is mainly caused by Dickeya spp. (Dickeya spp.) and Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (Pectobacterium carotovorum spp. carotovorum). To identify and detect these soft rot bacterial species in several bulbous ornamentals, standard PCR methods were used. During the last four years, research was directed to optimalize cultural practises in especially Hyacinthus to avoid or minimize bacterial soft rot. To evaluate the incidence and infection route of Erwinia spp. in the production chain of hyacinth bulbs, field plots were infected by planting diseased hyacinth, iris and Zantedeschia bulbs. Subsequently, crop rotation with different <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> species was applied on these field plots during two growing seasons. Harvested bulbs were analysed during the handling and storage of the bulbs for Erwinia spp. by assessing symptoms {{as well as by}} using bacterial culturing- and PCR techniques. The survival of Erwinia in water and on materials, used in <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> handling, was studied. Results concerning the optimalization of bulb handling during the production chain to avoid or to minimize the incidence of bulb soft rot are also presented...|$|R

40|$|In Farming with a Future (FwF) farmers, {{together}} with extension officers and researchers, work towards sustainable production systems for arable crops, open air vegetables, <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> and ornamental trees. Systematic measurements of water quality on the participating farms are conducted by RIVM; {{for the first}} time in 2002. The results of these measurements are presented and discussed in this report. Special attention is paid to the concentration of several forms of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), and the relationships with land use and the physical environment. The groundwater of 15 of the 37 farms investigated presented nitrate concentrations (farm averages) below the boundary value of 50 mg/l (as NO 3). Groundwater of the farms with arable crops on clay soils and of those with <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> presented the lowest nitrate concentrations as compared to groundwater of the other farm sectors. The highest concentrations were found in groundwater of farms with open air vegetables, followed by the farms with ornamental trees. These differences are partly explained by differences in the physical environment. Farms on 'wet' soils, including all <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> farms and arable farms on clay, present lower concentrations than farms on naturally well-drained soils with a deep groundwater table. However, when physical environments appear to be comparable (sandy soils), farms with open air vegetables generally present higher groundwater nitrate concentrations than farms with arable crops. With respect to groundwater P-concentrations, among the participating farms, the ones with <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> clearly present the highest values, (average farm average total-P = 7, 4 mg/l), followed by those with arable crops on clay soils (average 0, 61 mg/l) and a few farms with arable crops on sandy soils. The most important factors determining the high groundwater P-concentrations on the farms with <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> seem to be the small phosphate retention capacity of the sandy dune soils where <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs</b> are produced; heavy applications of manure and fertilisers (especially in the past); the shallow groundwater level and the practice of deep tillage. Ditch water samples were taken on 5 farms with arable crops on clay and 3 farms with <b>flower</b> <b>bulbs.</b> In all cases, farm average total-N concentrations exceeded the FwF goal for surface water (2, 2 mg/l). With respect to total-P, farm average concentrations where within the FwF goal (0, 15 mg/l) on 3 of the farms with arable crops on clay, but exceeded this goal on all <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> farms investigated. It is questioned however, to which extent the FwF goals for surface water may be applied to each farm individually. Differences between the quality of groundwater, drain water and ditch water seem to be primarily related to the period of sampling, as well as to the residence time of the water in the soil...|$|R
