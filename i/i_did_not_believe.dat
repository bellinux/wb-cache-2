2500|$|When Burton {{returned}} to the British Army, he sat for examination as an Arab linguist. The examiner was Robert Lambert Playfair, who disliked Burton. As Professor George Percy Badger knew Arabic well, Playfair asked Badger to oversee the exam. Having been told that Burton could be vindictive, and wishing to avoid any animosity should Burton fail, Badger declined. Playfair conducted the tests; despite Burton's success living as an Arab, Playfair had recommended to the committee that Burton be failed. Badger later told Burton that [...] "After looking [...] over, I [...] sent them back to [...] with a note eulogising your attainments and ... remarking on the absurdity of the Bombay Committee being made to judge your proficiency inasmuch as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that any of them possessed a tithe of the knowledge of Arabic you did." ...|$|E

Within {{forty-eight hours}} {{after the death of}} the late King, two {{relatives}} of Seni Pramoj, first his nephew and later his wife, came to the Legation and stated categorically their conviction that the King had been assassinated at the instigation of the Prime Minister (Pridi Phanomyong). It was of course clear that they had been sent by Seni. I felt it necessary to state to both of them in the strongest terms, {{in order to make it}} perfectly clear that this Legation could not be drawn into Siamese political intrigues, that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> these stories and that I considered the circulation at this time of fantastic rumors un-supported by a shred of evidence to be wholly in-excusable.
