30|$|For Grid dataset, {{there are}} 17 [*] 000 {{sentences}} spoken by 34 speakers (18 males and 16 females). In our experiment, the sampling rate of speech signals was 8 [*]kHz. For the given speech signals, we employed every window of length 8000 samples (1 second) and time duration 20 samples (2.5 milliseconds) and 36 gammatone filters were selected. We calculated the projection matrix in spectrotemporal domain using NTPCA after {{the calculation of}} the average firing rates in the inner hair cells. 170 sentences (5 sentences <b>each</b> <b>person)</b> <b>were</b> selected randomly as the training data for learning projection matrices in different subspaces. 1700 sentences (50 sentences <b>each</b> <b>person)</b> <b>were</b> used as training data and 2040 sentences (60 sentences <b>each</b> <b>person)</b> <b>were</b> used as testing data.|$|R
25|$|Ultimately, {{a person}} should not ask what {{the meaning of}} their life is, but rather must {{recognize}} that it is they themselves who are asked.

25|$|Disparities in life {{expectancy}} are {{often cited as}} demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> counted equally, {{life expectancy}} is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).

25|$|Since {{dead bodies}} are {{deposited}} in the grave, tradition and other sources have tended {{to use the word}} 'grave' to refer to the life of Barzakh. Thus, grave is used synonymously for Barzakh. Muslims believe that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> interrogated in the grave by two terrifying angels appointed by God. After the burial, the two angels, called Munkar and Nakir, come to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue.|$|E
25|$|Bahá'u'lláh, {{the founder}} of the religion, never {{specified}} any particular form of meditation, and thus <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> free to choose their own form. However, he specifically did state that Bahá'ís should read a passage of the Bahá'í writings twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it. He also encouraged people to reflect on one's actions and worth {{at the end of each}} day. During the Nineteen Day Fast, a period of the year during which Bahá'ís adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset fast, they meditate and pray to reinvigorate their spiritual forces.|$|E

25|$|Some clinicians {{believe that}} {{psychological}} characteristics alone determine mental disorders. Others speculate that abnormal {{behavior can be}} explained by a mix of social and psychological factors. In many examples, environmental and psychological triggers complement one another resulting in emotional stress, which in turn activates a mental illness <b>Each</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> unique in how they will react to psychological stressors. What may break one person may have little to no effect on another. Psychological stressors, which can trigger mental illness, are as follows: emotional, physical or sexual abuse, loss of a significant loved one, neglect and being unable to relate to others.|$|E
25|$|According to this doctrine, God is not {{divided in}} the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to be fully God (see Perichoresis). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being eternal yet begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit 'proceeding' from Father and (in Western theology) from the Son. Regardless of this apparent difference in their origins, the three 'persons' are each eternal and omnipotent. This is thought by Trinitarian Christians to be the revelation regarding God's nature which Jesus Christ came to deliver to the world, and is the foundation of their belief system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Each</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> served once. The {{first person}} to receive the 'ava is the highest chief of the visiting party, and he is {{followed}} by the highest chief of the host party or village. The leading orator of the visiting party is then served followed by the leading orator of the village and so on. Objections are quickly raised if a chief or orator is served out of turn as it is considered an affront by the man who should have received the cup and serious disputes have frequently arisen as a result of careless or deliberately wrong distribution. The distribution of the 'ava requires tact and skill, depending on the circumstances and each particular ceremony, although it is also an honour to be served last.|$|E

25|$|The {{demand for}} seats always exceeds the number available. Members {{of the public}} are {{admitted}} to the College through the main gate on King's Parade from 7:30 am (though some start queueing the night before), and <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> given an information leaflet which must be retained and shown to the duty porter for re-entry {{if he or she}} desires to leave the queue temporarily. People joining the queue before 9:00 am will usually gain admission to the Chapel, but this is not guaranteed. Porters monitor the number of people joining the queue, and once there are as many people as there are seats available, the others are advised that it is unlikely {{they will be able to}} attend the service. Members of Collegium Regale (the Choral Scholars of King's College Choir) usually sing Christmas carols to entertain the people who are queueing.|$|E
25|$|Another {{instance}} of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought {{is found in}} the Gathas of Zarathustra, composed between 1,000BCE600BCE in Greater Iran. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic god or Great Architect of the Universe was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that <b>each</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life. This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu.|$|E

2500|$|California {{criminal}} law is somewhat representative of other jurisdictions.

2500|$|The {{principle}} of the commandment is extended to the duty to honour others in direct authority, such as teachers, and employers.
