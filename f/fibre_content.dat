40|$|Natural fibre-reinforced {{plastics}} (NFRP) with renewable polymers as matrices {{are expected}} to be an increasing market in the future. In this context the quantification of natural <b>fibre</b> volume <b>content</b> in composites is an important parameter for manufacturers to check the laminate quality. This paper reports a new time and cost efficient method for the determination of natural <b>fibre</b> volume <b>content</b> with a good reproducibility. The measurement of the natural <b>fibre</b> volume <b>content</b> is attributed to the quantification of the total carbon content of the composite as sum parameter determined by chemical ultimate analysis never used for fibre-reinforced plastics before. The differentiation of resin matrix and natural fibre is possible by accounting the different carbon fractions of both components. The <b>fibre</b> weight <b>content</b> can be determined from the detected total carbon of the test samples after the measurement of a calibration line from mix standards. Based on the known densities of the natural fibre and of the resin matrix, the <b>fibre</b> weight <b>content</b> is converted into the corresponding volume <b>content.</b> The <b>fibre</b> volume <b>content</b> of porous and also compact composite parts can be calculated by this approach. The <b>fibre</b> volume <b>content</b> can be measured by this method {{with a standard deviation of}} ± 1 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{quality of}} {{concrete}} used in any construction {{work is a}} function of its compressive strength. In this paper, structural models are formulated to predict the compressive strength of coconut fibre-reinforced concrete mix 1 : 2 : 4 at water-cement ratios of 0. 55 and 0. 60 using three-dimensional elasticity equations. The results obtained using the formulated models were compared with the measured values and were found to be very close (correlation coefficient = 0. 9011). For both the measured and predicted values, the compressive strength of concrete mix (1 : 2 : 4) were found to decrease as the coconut <b>fibre</b> <b>contents</b> increased.

Due to the variable <b>fibre</b> <b>content,</b> the fibre yields vary between 0.2 and 7 dt / ha, but the yields are normally in the range between 2 and 4 dt / ha. Fibre varieties are normally cloning varieties and therefore planted from vegetative propagated plantlets. Direct seeding is possible, but leads to great heterogeneity in maturity.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{cracks and}} {{shrinkage}} in soil affects its geotechnical properties in various ways. Permeability of soil changes due to cracks in clay barriers {{which lead to}} development of preferential flow paths for transportation of contaminants. Development of cracks may also lead to decrease in bearing capacity of soil. In case of earth embankments, cracks reduce strength and lead to seepage and percolation problems. Integrity and stability of landfill liners are affected by surface cracks, apart from leachate infiltration. Alignment of embedded pipes can be changed due to the surface shrinkage. They can cause slope instability and can contributes to the land slides in hilly areas. Hence, knowledge of surface cracks and the shrinkage behaviour of soil is essential to improve the understanding and prediction of changes of unsaturated hydraulic properties in heterogeneous and non-rigid soils. This paper {{is an attempt to}} introduce a novel methodology for quantifying surface cracks and shrinkage that appears in soil after desiccation under atmospheric conditions using image analysis technique. ImajeJ software has been used for image processing and Matlab for the calculation of surface cracks and shrinkage area. The samples used for the study is synthetic soil obtained by mixing bentonite and fly ash in various proportions. The effect of variable parameters like sample thickness, moisture content, fly ash <b>content</b> and <b>fibres</b> <b>content</b> on the surface cracks and shrinkage of the bentonite-fly ash mix have been studied.

One {{of the natural}} fibres considered is oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) fibres which offer advantages such as availability, renewability, low cost and the established technology to extract the fibres. This study investigates the properties of cement block incorporated with large amount of oil palm EFB fibres. The blocks were mixed with 10 to 30 % oil palm EFB fibres based on cement weight into the block. A total of 60 block samples of dimensions 100 mm x 200 mm x 400 mm were manufactured in this study using a high density operated block making machine with a cement-sand ratio of 1 : 6. Among the tests conducted was compressive strength, density, water absorption, drying shrinkage and prism tests. It was found that high EFB <b>fibres</b> <b>content</b> lead to lower strength, higher absorption and drying shrinkage.

40|$|Background and Aim: Despite the {{pharmacological}} {{relevance of}} Water leaf (Talinum triangulare), there is paucity {{of information in}} literature {{on the effect of}} boiling on its pharmacopotency as well as nutritional properties. Methodology: The total chlorophyll, carotenoids, proximates, phytochemicals, minerals, vitamins and antioxidant assays of the leaves of the vegetable were performed using standard techniques. Results: The raw leaves of water leaf (Talinum triangulare) possessed considerable amounts of proximates, phytochemicals, minerals, vitamins, chlorophyll as well as antioxidant activity but had low levels of carbohydrates and energy value. Cooking of the raw leaves of the vegetable for 5 minutes resulted in insignificant (P> 0. 05) losses of proximates, phytochemicals, Ca, Fe, Zn, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and tocopherol, but significant (P< 0. 05) losses of vitamin C, carotenoids, Mg, P, chlorophyll and antioxidant activity with a corresponding increase in moisture, proteins and crude <b>fibre</b> <b>contents.</b> Conclusion: The conventional method of cooking of the raw waterleaf in Nigeria leads to an increase in its protein and crude <b>fibre</b> <b>contents</b> which justifies the usage of the cooked vegetable in the management of obesity, stroke and diabetes mellitus in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|Research {{focused on}} {{improving}} physical and mechanical properties of LLDPE composites reinforced with hemp fibres. As the previous studies show, {{due to their}} polar and hydrophilic nature, natural fibres show poor compatibility with hydrophobic polymers. This incompatibility could lead to weak interfacial adhesion {{as well as to}} the non-uniform dispersion of fibres within the composite. To overcome incompatibility several strategies have been tested to enhance the adhesion between the lignocellulosic fillers and the polymer matrix. These strategies generally involve fibres modifications by physical or chemical methods. Chemical modification of natural fibres used in this study involves various chemical treatments in order to reduce the content of hydroxyl groups and/or introduce cross-linking between the filler fibres and the polymeric matrix. 2 % sodium hydroxide treatment, grafting with 5 % maleic anhydride in combination with the sol-gel [1 - 2] fibers pre-processing were used to obtain twelve composite variants.
