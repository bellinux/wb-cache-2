5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven stones {{remaining}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> At {{the time there}} were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the stones perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded stones had been removed but that three additional stones had been found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine stones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty stones, of which three had fallen and twenty-seven remained standing. Originally it may have included around a hundred stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 inches) apart.|$|E
5|$|Credited as Lucille LeSueur, {{her first}} film was Lady of the Night in 1925, {{as the body}} double for MGM's most popular female star, Norma Shearer. She also {{appeared}} <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Circle</b> and Pretty Ladies (both 1925), starring comedian ZaSu Pitts. This was soon followed by equally small and unbilled roles in two other 1925 successes, The Only Thing and The Merry Widow.|$|E

5|$|In 1964 {{the stones}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> were {{disturbed}} by agricultural activity. It was then {{decided that the}} site would be excavated, a project which was ordered by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and carried out in May 1965 under the directorship of Geoffrey J. Wainwright. The 28 stones were moved from the site using a crane to permit the archaeologists to excavate the area beneath them.|$|E
5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As he stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> he had two thoughts: that people would {{be talking about this}} in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|The Lion King {{tells the}} story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's uncle Scar (Mufasa's jealous younger brother), murders Mufasa, Simba is {{manipulated}} into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Circle</b> of Life as the rightful King.|$|E
5|$|The stones {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (one foot) in width, and 0.1 metres (4 inches) thick. The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all the stones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E

In addition to showing me the process she used in her class, Katie also shared with me an evaluation handout which <b>the</b> students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>circle</b> {{would be asked to}} fill out while observing the discussion taking place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>circle.</b> Each student <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>circle</b> is put in charge of carefully observing one student <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>circle,</b> filling out <b>the</b> evaluation handout, and giving their partner feedback and tips for further development.|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} incorporated {{many modern}} features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating, {{and it was}} also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting. It had a seating capacity of 1,400 in the stalls and 600 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> with a further 146 seats in the café area. When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, but this was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young Julie Andrews. It also played host to the Hallé Orchestra after the orchestra's own home, the Free Trade Hall, was bombed and severely damaged during the Manchester Blitz of 1940.|$|E

25|$|Connecticut Avenue was widened in {{the late}} 1920s, and {{increased}} traffic in the neighborhood caused {{a great deal of}} congestion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> making it difficult for pedestrians to get around. Medians were installed in 1948, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> to separate the through traffic on Massachusetts Avenue from the local traffic, and traffic signals were added. In 1949 traffic tunnels and an underground streetcar station were built under the circle as part of the now-defunct Capital Transit project. The tunnels allowed trams and vehicles traveling along Connecticut Avenue to pass more quickly past the circle. When streetcar service ended in 1962, the entrances to the underground station were filled in and paved over, leaving only the traffic tunnel.|$|E
