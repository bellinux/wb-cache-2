40|$|The {{effects of}} a thin {{ferromagnetic}} layer covering a magnetically <b>hard</b> <b>grain</b> on the coercivity were calculated based on micromagnetic theory. Antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between this thin ferromagnetic surface layer (SF layer) and the <b>hard</b> <b>grain</b> was found to prevent nucleation of reverse domains at {{the surface of the}} <b>hard</b> <b>grain</b> and to increase the coercivity. This was effective for <b>hard</b> <b>grains</b> with a layer of reduced magnetic anisotropy on their surfaces whose thickness is comparable with the exchange length. It was also found that a SF layer thickness of several nanometers is suitable. The effects were simulated for a <b>hard</b> <b>grain</b> with SF layers coupled both ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically.

The testing was conducted in the following fine agricultural-ecological areas in FR Yugoslavia (R Serbia) : Bačka, Banat, eastern Serbia, Sumadija, western Serbia. According to the testing conducted, it can be stated that {{the weight of the}} 1000 grains mass ranged from 5 - 4 (1992) to 9. 2 (1997) grams, the average for 1992 / 97 being 6. 5 grams Seed viability ranged from 33, 4 % (1994) to 51, 2 % (1992), the average for 1992 / 97 being 41, 13 % and depended on the percentage of <b>hard</b> <b>grains</b> and agricultural-ecological conditions in the years of testing. Seed viability decreases with the increase in the percentage of <b>hard</b> <b>grains.</b> The <b>hard</b> <b>grain</b> content was 42, 5 % at the average in 1992 / 97. and ranged from 39. 2 - 46. 4 %. The grain hardness is the property of this variety and species, and variation by year of testing depended on agricultural-ecological conditions of battening. The ratio between seed viability and <b>hard</b> <b>grains</b> is 1 : 1, namely, the reduction of <b>hard</b> <b>grain</b> contents increases the percentage of seed viability and vice versa.

40|$|Puroindoline (Pina and Pinb) genes control grain texture or {{hardness}} in wheat. Wild-type/soft alleles lead to softer grain while a {{mutation in}} {{one or both of}} these genes results in a <b>hard</b> <b>grain.</b> Variation in hardness in genotypes with identical Pin alleles (wild-type or mutant) is known but the molecular basis of this is not known.

RNA-Seq analysis was used to determine the variation in the transcriptome of developing grains of thirty three diverse wheat genotypes including hard (mutant Pin) and soft (wild type) and those that were hard without having Pin mutations. This defined the role of pin gene expression and identified other candidate genes associated with hardness. Pina was not expressed in hard wheat with a mutation in the Pina gene.

Two genes, Pina-D 1 and Pinb-D 1, have a major effect on this trait, so for wheat breeding programs it is important to identify the alleles of these genes present in elite germplasm. This study was conducted to identify the alleles present in southern Australian germplasm, and to determine if they affected quality characteristics other than grain hardness. Only 3 genotypes were identified. These were Pina-D 1 a/Pinb-D 1 a producing soft grain, Pina-D 1 a/Pinb-D 1 b producing moderately <b>hard</b> <b>grain,</b> and Pina-D 1 b/Pinb-D 1 a producing very <b>hard</b> <b>grain.</b> WW 15 was the probable source of Pina-D 1 a/Pinb-D 1 b in most cultivars; however, Halberd represented another source. An important source of Pina-D 1 b/Pinb-D 1 a was the CIMMYT line Pavon, with sources from the old Australian cultivars Gabo and Falcon probably still present in modern germplasm. In an analysis of grain quality data from the Victorian Institute for Dryland Agriculture breeding program, the Pina-D 1 b/Pinb-D 1 a genotype had a significantly higher water absorption and significantly lower milling yield than the Pina-D 1 a/Pinb-D 1 b genotype, which indicates that these genes will impede the development of hard-grained cultivars that combine high water absorption and high milling yield.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{mechanistic}} basis of the load shedding phenomenon that occurs under the dwell fatigue loading scenario. A systematic study was carried out using a discrete dislocation plasticity (DDP) model to investigate the effect of crystallographic orientations, localised dislocation behaviour and grain combinations on the phenomenon. Rate sensitivity in the model arises from a thermal activation process at low strain rates, which is accounted for by associating a stress- and temperature-dependent release time with obstacles; the activation energy was determined by calibrating an equivalent crystal plasticity model to experimental data. First, the application of Stroh's dislocation pile-up model of crack nucleation to facet fracture was quantitatively assessed using the DDP model. Then a polycrystalline model with grains generated using a controlled Poisson Voronoi tessellation was used to investigate the soft-hard-soft rogue grain combination commonly associated with load shedding. Dislocation density and peak stress at the soft/hard grain boundary increased significantly during the stress dwell period, effects that were enhanced by dislocations escaping from pile-ups at obstacles. The residual stress after dwell fatigue loading was also found to be much higher compared to standard fatigue loading. Taylor (uniform strain) and Sachs (uniform stress) type assumptions in a soft-hard grain combination have been assessed with a simple bicrystal DDP model. Basal slip nucleation in the <b>hard</b> <b>grain</b> was found to be initiated by high stresses generated by strong pile ups in the soft grain, and both basal and pyramidal slip nucleation was observed in the <b>hard</b> <b>grain</b> when the grain boundary orientation aligned with that of an active slip system in the soft grain.
