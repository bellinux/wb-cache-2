40|$|This article {{presents}} the first {{findings of a}} qualitative empirical study of caregivers 2 ̆ 7 attentiveness in hospital oncology care. It takes a care ethical perspective, in which attentiveness is considered an indispensable element of good care. The data are derived from participant observation at the oncology department of a general hospital in the Netherlands. The analysis shows a descriptive exploratory model <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness,</b> which comprises a coherent set of the clusters perception (A), object finding (B), and space for attentiveness (C). The methodological output {{of this article is}} an important one: the presented descriptive model <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> promotes further research into the characteristics and functioning <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> in care. It is a fundamental step towards a grounded theory, as it enables a comparison of different cases prior to thematic analyses. The substantive outcomes of the study offer caregivers a tool for understanding and analyzing care practices from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks into}} {{whether there are}} any {{differences}} in demonstration <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> between different generations and different cultures. By attentiveness I mean a demonstrator’s preemptive response to a beneficiary’s verbal/non-verbal cues or situations surrounding a beneficiary and a demonstrator, which {{takes the form of}} offering. When and how often one would demonstrate attentiveness may vary according to such factors as generation and culture. Three groups of people from different generations and different cultural backgrounds (Japanese and Americans) served as the participants (280 people for the questionnaire data and 18 people for the interview data). It was investigated whether there were any differences among the participants in demonstration <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness,</b> in the reasons for demonstration <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness,</b> and in rating degree of imposition to demonstrate attentiveness. It was also examined whether there was any relationship between degree of imposition to demonstrate <b>attentiveness</b> and demonstration <b>of</b> attentiveness; and in which relationship (the relationship between a demonstrator and a beneficiary <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> varied from very familiar to not very familiar at all) attentiveness was demonstrated. The data were collected using a questionnaire with six situations, based on field notes; and the interviews were conducted using the same six situations. The results show that in most situations there were no major differences among the participants in the choice <b>of</b> demonstration <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> and the reasons for it. The participants chose to demonstrate attentiveness in four situations in the questionnaire, because they wanted to be of help to the other party. There was a relationship between degree of imposition to demonstrate <b>attentiveness</b> and demonstration <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> in four situations. Overall, the interview data confirmed the questionnaire data...|$|R

40|$|The Aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>Attentiveness</b> is the {{conceptualization}} and articulation of art-making and aesthetics {{as a form}} of understanding born out of mindful attention: an apophatic, epistemological, small humble gesture. Artists create in the contested interstitial spaces between embodied awareness, sense perception, imagination and reason; enthusiasm, dream, and disaster; affect, intuition, and intellect; wordless, timeless, experiences of unknowing and those ‘known’ through our embodied existence. I conceptualize the Aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>Attentiveness</b> as an active philosophical performative practice of inquiry. I articulate the importance of the stop, the necessity of paying attention, the fecundity of self-emptying, the risk of liminal flow, and the surprise of surfacing into wide-awakeness. Through these chapter-headings I proclaim the Aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>Attentiveness</b> as a generative pedagogical process. I articulate the three stages of creative liminality: a recognition that to come to the act of making requires three stages of embodied engagement; the rituals of self-emptying; the liminal space of creation; and the reflective act of seeing again what the artist has come to understand through creating. This dissertation is a philosophical poetic performative inquiry into art-making practices and aesthetics as conducted in my studio. Fueled by my art-making, research and teaching practices, I understand art as enacted by an embodied maker, made manifest through the material experiential realm and as received through another body, creating a web of culturally mediated affective, sensory and intellectual encounters. Art expresses and fosters insight in materialized experiential rather than propositional language; art enacts meaning and negotiates insight by plunging into the oceanic unknown, trusting the apophatic abyss, the liminal silent gap. The Aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>Attentiveness</b> understands art as a practice of self-emptying paying attention; active receptivity and opening oneself to awareness that stops hasty conceptualization, incomplete categorization, premature conclusions: the habits of thought that blind us. Embodied self-emptying attention {{is at the heart of}} the relationship between aesthetics and ethics, releases energy to fuel the making, and is celebrated as key to being wide awake...|$|R
40|$|<b>Attentiveness,</b> a {{variable}} <b>of</b> communication, primarily serves a stylistic {{function in the}} communicative process by providing behavioral evidence that an individual is actively involved in message reception. Past research suggests that while both verbal and nonverbal behaviors signal attentiveness, nonverbal cues are more closely associated with this construct. Among the many nonverbal behaviors of individuals in interactions, postural positions have been deemed highly indicative <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness.</b> At present however, most of the empirical evidence attesting to this notion has been established {{through the use of}} self-report measures. As a result of the felt need by this author to improve upon the methodology used in substantiating the construct <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness,</b> this investigation was conducted in order to apply a multiplicity of methods to testing this relatively new construct. This research is believed to be significant as it adds to the existing knowledge on the communication process in general and assists in theory-building a construct to which considerable attention of late has been given by communication theorists...|$|R
40|$|Aging <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> affects {{cognitive}} functions like perception and working memory, which can seriously impact communication between dogs and humans, potentially hindering training and cooperation. Previous studies {{have revealed that}} aged laboratory beagles and pet Border collies (BC) show a decline in selective attention. However, much less {{is known about the}} aging <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> in pet dogs in general rather than in specific breeds. Using 185 pet dogs (75 BC and 110 dogs of other breeds) divided into three age groups [late adulthood (6 - < 8 year), senior (8 - < 10 year) and geriatric (≥ 10 year) ], we assessed the progress of aging of attentional capture, sustained and selective attention in older dogs in order to explore if prior results in BC are generalizable and to evaluate the influence of lifelong training on measures of attention. Each dog’s lifelong training score (ranging from 0 to 52) was calculated from a questionnaire filled in by the owners listing what kinds of training the dog participated in during its entire life. Dogs were tested in two tasks; the first, measuring attentional capture and sustained attention toward two stimuli (toy and human); and the second, measuring selective attention by means of clicker training for eye contact and finding food on the floor. In the first task, results revealed a significant effect of age but no effect of lifelong training on latency to orient to the stimuli. Duration of looking decreased with age and increased with lifelong training. In the second task, while lifelong training decreased the latency of dogs to form eye contact, aged dogs needed longer to find food. BC did not differ from other dogs in any measures of attention except latency to find food. In conclusion, aged dogs showed a decline in attentional capture and sustained attention demonstrating that these tests are sensitive to detect aging <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> in older pet dogs. Importantly, selective attention remained unchanged with age and lifelong training seemed to delay or reduce the aging <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness,</b> further highlighting the importance of lifelong training in retaining general {{cognitive functions}}...|$|R

40|$|From urban capitals {{to rural}} countryside, and every {{locality}} in between, homelessness {{is a national}} phenomenon that affects every community. Each locality responds to it differently through the variety of homeless programs and services it offers. By doing such, each locality displays a certain level <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> to their homeless population. This article explores how 10 small southeastern cities respond to their local homelessness and seeks to compare the homeless <b>attentiveness</b> <b>of</b> Bowling Green, Kentucky to similar localities. An evaluative measure <b>of</b> municipal <b>attentiveness</b> based {{on a range of}} homelessness program areas is used to score each city’s response to its homelessness.

However, an analysis of the descriptive statistics reveal the strengths and weaknesses of Bowling Green’s response to homelessness, identifying prevention and emergency services as areas needing more attention. This research and its following discussion serve as a starting point for the ten localities examined, as well as other similar localities, to examine their own response to local homelessness...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{has developed a}} novel method which uses an easy to deploy single dry electrode wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) collection device as an input to an automated system that measures indicators <b>of</b> a participant’s <b>attentiveness</b> while they are watching a short training video. The results are promising, including 85 % or better accuracy in identifying whether a participant is watching a segment of video from a boring scene or lecture, versus a segment of video from an attentiveness inducing active lesson or memory quiz. In addition, the final system produces an ensemble average <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> across many participants, pinpointing areas in the training videos that induce peak <b>attentiveness.</b> Qualitative analysis <b>of</b> {{the results of this}} research is also very promising. The system produces attentiveness graphs for individual participants and these triangulate well with the thoughts and feelings those participants had during different parts of the videos, as described in their own words. As distance learning and computer based training become more popular, it is of great interest to measure if students are attentive to recorded lessons and short training videos. This research was motivated by this interest, as well as recent advances in electronic and computer engineering’s use of biometric signal analysis for the detection of affective (emotional) response. Signal processing of EEG has proven useful in measuring alertness, emotional state, and even towards very specific applications such as whether or not participants will recall television commercials days after they have seen them. This research extended these advances by creating an automated system which measures attentiveness towards short training videos. The bulk of the research was focused on electrical and computer engineering, specifically the optimization of signal processing algorithms for this particular application. A review of existing methods of EEG signal processing and feature extraction methods shows that there is a common subdivision of the steps that are used in different EEG applications. These steps include hardware sensing filtering and digitizing, noise removal, chopping the continuous EEG data into windows for processing, normalization, transformation to extract frequency or scale information, treatment of phase or shift information, and additional post-transformation noise reduction techniques. A large degree of variation exists in most of these steps within the currently documented state of the art. This research connected these varied methods into a single holistic model that allows for comparison and selection of optimal algorithms for this application. The research described herein provided for such a structured and orderly comparison of individual signal analysis and feature extraction methods. This study created a concise algorithmic approach in examining all the aforementioned steps. In doing so, the study provided the framework for a systematic approach which followed a rigorous participant cross validation so that options could be tested, compared and optimized. Novel signal analysis methods were also developed, using new techniques to choose parameters, which greatly improved performance. The research also utilizes machine learning to automatically categorize extracted features into measures <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness.</b> The research improved existing machine learning with novel methods, including a method of using per-participant baselines with kNN machine learning. This provided an optimal solution to extend current EEG signal analysis methods that were used in other applications, and refined them for use in the measurement <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> towards short training videos. These algorithms are proven to be best via selection of optimal signal analysis and optimal machine learning steps identified through both n-fold and participant cross validation. The creation of this new system which uses signal processing of EEG for the detection <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> towards short training videos has created a significant advance in the field <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness</b> measuring towards short training videos...|$|R

Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal [57] argue rapport arises when participants exhibit mutual attentiveness, positivity and coordination. In this paper, we investigate how these factors relate to perceptions of rap-port when users interact via avatars in virtual worlds. In this study, participants told a story to what they believed was the avatar of another participant. In fact, the avatar was a computer program that systematically manipulated levels <b>of</b> <b>attentiveness,</b> positivity and coordination. In contrast to Tickel-Degnen and Rosenthal’s findings, high-levels <b>of</b> mutual <b>attentiveness</b> alone can dramatically lower percep-tions of rapport in avatar communication. Indeed, an agent that attempted to maximize mutual attention performed as poorly as an agent {{that was designed to}} convey boredom. Adding positivity and coordination to mutual attentiveness, on the other hand, greatly improved rapport.

METHODS: In 1979 - 81 a standardised neurological examination was made of 115 patients with asbestosis who carried {{a high risk of}} occupational cancer and their cancer morbidity was analysed 15 years later. RESULTS: Slight <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> unknown aetiology were found in the central nervous system (CNS) of 33 and in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of 41 patients. Of these 17 had <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> both the CNS and PNS. This cohort was followed up to the end of 1994. During this time 47 of the patients developed cancer.
