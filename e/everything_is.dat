5|$|The {{band was}} formed by Scogin shortly after he left his {{position}} of vocalist in Norma Jean. In 2004, a record deal was signed with Solid State Records and a debut album was released, titled <b>Everything</b> <b>Is</b> Alive, <b>Everything</b> <b>Is</b> Breathing, Nothing Is Dead, and Nothing Is Bleeding. The band toured constantly after that. The Chariot released the Unsung EP in 2005, which was then followed by three successful studio albums: The Fiancée in 2007, Wars and Rumors of Wars in 2009, and Long Live in 2010. The band entered the studio in May 2012 to record their fifth full-length album titled One Wing which was released August 28, 2012. The Chariot disbanded following a farewell tour in late 2013.|$|E

Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F.

Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media.

5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{note the}} similarities between the táltos of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans, but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including boszorkány ("witch"), elbűvöl ("to charm"), and the ancient Hungarian word for holy (igy or egy), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: búcsú (indulgence), bűn (sin), gyón (confess), isten (god), and ördög (devil). According to Gyula László, a Hungarian children's verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves the memory of a pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. The refrain of another children's verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief in the existence of an afterlife world where <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> upside-down.|$|E
5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only {{the execution of the}} three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of Rewrites story {{takes place in the}} fictional city of Kazamatsuri in Japan, where treeplanting and {{afforestation}} have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and vegetation. The protagonist Kotarou and his friends in the occult research society attend a high school in Kazamatsuri, and the characters also spend time in the society's clubroom. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the forest around Kazamatsuri and Kotarou's house. Throughout the story, Kotarou encounters an alternate dimension of Kazamatsuri where <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> silent and the sky is gray. There are many entrances to this dimension throughout the city. In this secret world developed by Gaia, a sustainable environment exists to support life. When on the Moon, a hill where daisies grow is prominently shown amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where the night is eternal. This hill appears again later on Earth in the forest of Kazamatsuri.|$|E

5|$|These {{non-human}} antibodies {{are recognized}} as foreign by the human immune system and may be rapidly cleared from the body, provoke an allergic reaction, or both. To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed chimeric and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three loops of amino acid sequences at the outside of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may have to remain non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production. Thus, the human/mouse chimeric antibody basiliximab ends in -ximab just as does the human/macaque antibody gomiliximab. Purely human antibodies used -u-.|$|E
5|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{tasked with}} taking the cover {{photo of the}} summer catalog, and convinces Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider) to pose for photos at a {{community}} park. Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that she looks miserable and asks that the pictures not be used. Mark appears concerned that Ann's unhappiness {{is a reflection of}} their relationship. She insists <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> fine, but he is unconvinced. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can go to another bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy. Later, the summer catalogs arrive, with a photo on the cover of April and Andy appearing happy together at the picnic.|$|E
5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E
