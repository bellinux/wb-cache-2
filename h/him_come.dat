That night, Archer dreams {{that he is}} attacked by Reptilians, and Hernandez tries to help <b>him</b> <b>come</b> {{to terms with his}} memories and new-found adulation.

Returning to Starfleet Command, Archer is able to keep his emotions in check, and ultimately receives an unexpected thanks from Soval.

After having his {{assistant}} Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth.

5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped <b>him</b> <b>come</b> up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, {{the world}} price of cocoa rose from £150 to £450 per ton.

25|$|Kent {{was chosen}} to tour England in 1981. Greg Chappell elected not to tour and Kim Hughes thought at the {{beginning}} that Kent was the most likely candidate to replace him at number three.

Eventually Chappell was selected, with Kent relegated to 12th man.|$|E

25|$|Huard {{acted as}} {{a link between the}} 19th century {{scientific}} period and the scientific revival of early 20th century Quebec, and was a model for those of his days. His major contribution was the publication of his natural history books, who were needed to replace the existing ones who, imported from France, adapted poorly for Canadian realities. He was also instrumental in keeping the work of Provancher from being too harshly misjudged. No biography of Huard has been published, although Conrad Laforte's MLSc Thesis, a bio-bibliography of <b>him,</b> <b>come</b> close.|$|E

With four races remaining in the season Todd was fourth in the standings, a dismal 256 points behind leader Ted Musgrave.

Had {{it not been for the}} rain delaying play on day five, England would have almost certainly won the match. This was seen as further improvements being heralded under the regime of Moores.|$|E
