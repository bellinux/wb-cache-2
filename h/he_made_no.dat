5|$|Chekhov had {{at first}} written stories only for {{financial}} gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which {{have influenced the}} evolution of the modern short story. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{had been}} {{listening}} to music from other cultures, particularly Eastern Europe since the mid-1970s. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> attempt to notate what he heard, but absorbed it and let it find its way later into his own music. On Gravity Frith mixed up all these different musical styles to make new songs out of them.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} in Bowling Green on August 26. Because {{of his age}} and ill health, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> more than one speech per week. Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, questioning the sincerity of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would have supported the events that took place there. He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an oligarchy. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E

5|$|Due in part {{to these}} {{personal}} trials, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> momentous contributions to Congress beyond his reliable positions representing Virginia's interests, with a consistent Jeffersonian Republican voting record. He did serve {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War. There are notable disparities between Tucker's more statist voting record and the nationalism predominant in his writings during this period and later. In his essay On Instructions to Representatives, he provides an explanation in political theory—an inevitable obligation to think one way and yet vote another, in compliance with constituent preferences.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade did {{not appear}} again until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, {{for which he was}} made 4/1 second {{favourite}} despite O'Brien expressing concern over the soft ground.

Following in 2007 with the Friends Provident Trophy, beating Hampshire by 125 runs, Collingwood picking up 22 runs and bowling figures of 3/33.

5|$|Allen was {{selected}} by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the fourth round of the 1988 CFL Draft with the 29th overall pick. He played in 17 regular season games during his rookie season, in which <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> tackles but contributed heavily on special teams. Allen recovered three blocked punts for touchdowns throughout the season, including one that was returned 30 yards to the endzone against the Ottawa Rough Riders. The Blue Bombers went on to defeat the BC Lions 22–21 to win the 76th Grey Cup, making Allen a Grey Cup champion in his rookie season.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of}} the Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably {{well in his}} classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E

5|$|Frederick's childrenWilhelm in particularheld various {{political}} positions and greatly influenced Europe. Unlike his father, Wilhelm had not personally experienced {{the horrors of}} war, and he enthusiastically embraced his family's military heritage, coming under Bismarck's tutelage. The Chancellor, who disapproved of Frederick's and Victoria's liberal ways, felt bound to increase the tensions between Wilhelm and his parents. Wilhelm grew up full of disdain for their opinions on government, and shortly after his father's death, proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> reference to Frederick III. William II abandoned all of his father's policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.|$|E
5|$|In 1173 Henry {{faced the}} Great Revolt, an {{uprising}} by his eldest sons and rebellious barons, supported by France, Scotland and Flanders. A number of grievances underpinned the revolt. Young Henry was unhappy that, despite {{the title of}} king, in practice <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> real decisions and was kept chronically short of money by Henry. Young Henry had also been very attached to Thomas Becket, his former tutor, and may have held his father responsible for Becket's death. Geoffrey faced similar difficulties; Duke Conan of Brittany had died in 1171, but Geoffrey and Constance were still unmarried, leaving Geoffrey in limbo without his own lands. Richard was encouraged to join the revolt as well by Eleanor, whose relationship with Henry, as previously described, had disintegrated. Meanwhile, local barons unhappy with Henry's rule saw opportunities to recover traditional powers and influence by allying themselves with his sons.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> effort to integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz {{was not able to}} support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.|$|E

5|$|Moss was {{the founder}} and {{director}} of Moss Electrical Co Ltd, and owned 950 of the 1,000 available shares. In September 1986 he said that Hunter, the finance director, could have 50 of these shares as part of his employment. Crucially, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> statement or trust involving the other 900 shares. This gift of 50 shares was never implemented because of tax concerns, the risks of a takeover, and mainly because Moss changed his mind. Hunter brought a case against Moss claiming his 50 shares, which rested on two issues. First, whether the language used was sufficient to create a trust, and second, whether or not the trust failed to provide the three certainties {{because of the lack of}} segregation between the shares.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector AM Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated {{much of what}} Chintanda {{had said}} {{regarding}} Clark's claims to represent the Company. Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and {{had told him to}} have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma said that he would not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part in the kind of scheme he had suggested if the Company wished. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|A {{father and}} {{daughter}} rollerblading in Central Park stumble across {{the body of a}} woman with several lacerations hidden in a bush. Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) learn Peter Harrison (Nick Stahl), who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman, left work early with a cut thumb {{around the time of the}} murder. Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E

5|$|Between 1999 and 2002, Robinson made 14 {{appearances}} for the England under-21s. He {{was first}} {{included in the}} full international squad by Peter Taylor in a friendly against Italy on 15 November 2000, where he was an unused substitute. His next appearance on the England bench came two years later, under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, who selected him for a friendly match against Portugal on 7 September 2002, where he once again remained an unused substitute. He won his first cap in a 3–1 defeat against Australia on 12 February 2003, a match notable for the entire England team being substituted at half-time (at which point Robinson was brought on in place of David James). He won three more caps that year, all in friendlies, and on all occasions he was brought on at half-time. He made his first international start in a 6–1 victory over Iceland on 5 June 2004, with the match being England's final match before the UEFA Euro 2004 finals. Robinson was part of England's Euro 2004 squad, selected as an understudy to David James, although <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> appearances in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would have made no difference to the royal line of succession.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the ecclesiastic see to a dynastic realm ruled by a Protestant prince challenged the principle of ecclesiastical reservation, which was intended to preserve the ecclesiastical electorates from this very possibility. The difficulties of such a conversion had been faced before: Hermann von Wied, a previous prince-elector and archbishop in Cologne, had also converted to Protestantism, but had resigned from his office. Similarly, Gebhard's predecessor, Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau had indeed married in 1577, but had resigned from the office prior to his marriage. Furthermore, {{the reason for his}} marriage—to perpetuate his house—differed considerably from Gebhard's. The House of Waldburg was in no apparent danger of extinction; Gebhard was one of six brothers, and only one other had chosen an ecclesiastical career. Unlike his abdicating predecessors, when Gebhard converted, he proclaimed the Reformation in the city of Cologne itself, angering Cologne's Catholic leadership and alienating the Catholic faction in the Cathedral Chapter. Furthermore, Gebhard adhered not to the teachings of Martin Luther, but to those of John Calvin, a form of religious observation not approved by the Augsburg conventions of 1555. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> move to resign from his position as Prince-elector.|$|E
