Goldy suggested a wager on the game with this tweet: [...] "Hey @FauxPelini, how about a friendly wager for this weekend's game? Team that gets the most points gets a conference win? Seem fair?" [...] Faux Pelini responded [...] "OK <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>if</b> we Nebraska win you give me $5, if you Minnesota win I get to smash a wooden chair over your back". This prompted Goldy to start crowdsourcing Twitter followers and the community at Reddit's college football section to design the [...] "$5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy". Many designs were quickly presented and eventually Goldy created a real trophy, which {{was brought to the}} 2014 game in Lincoln. Minnesota won 28-24 to take the trophy, their first victory in Lincoln since 1960; it also gave Minnesota their first winning streak against Nebraska since their 3-game streak from 1951-54. It received widespread acceptance from both fanbases, and has since been subsequently displayed at Minnesota's spirit events with other trophies such as Floyd of Rosedale and the Little Brown Jug. The trophy changed hands {{for the first time on}} October 17, 2015 after Nebraska defeated Minnesota 48-25 in Minneapolis.|$|E

Through oral history, {{this study found}} that the coming of Hadrami in the early 20 th century in Karimunjawa was solely motivated for economic reasons. They lived and improved their quality of life by working as laborers in the Chinese traders. The economic limited access caused Hadrami in Karimunjawa were not play ed an important role both in economic and Islamic teaching. For economic reasons as well, their numbers had dwindled in the mid of 19 90 s 20 th century. Most of them moved to Semarang and Jepara while the small group still survived in Karimunjawa. As a sayyid family, the Arabs in Karimunjawa did intermarriage mixed marriages [WU 1] (between sayyid and non-sayyid).

40|$|Many {{teachers}} have used {{or at least}} heard about webquests. These online activities are great for bringing authentic materials into the classroom and for encouraging students to draw {{on a range of}} language skills at the same time. Here I will describe an alternative to online webquests, in an attempt to encourage out-of-class learning in the ‘real’ world. What are podquests? Podquests are out-of-class language learning activities that encourage interaction with people and objects in authentic contexts. Podquests use Ipods for instructions, language input, and to give feedback to the learner. Imagine the following scenario: as a teacher you want to encourage your students to use the language outside the classroom and to use a range of different skills. One option would be to send students on a ‘tour’ around the city to get information about various sites. They could then report back in class. But how will students know they are on the right track? And would it not be more interesting if they could access relevant information about the sites as they were visiting them? And <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>if</b> they could answer questions at the same time, and if their answers would change what would happen next? This is exactly what podquests are designed to do...|$|E
40|$|Most {{performance}} analysis {{boils down to}} finding bottlenecks. In our context, a bottleneck is any event (e. g., branch mispredict, window stall, or ALU operation) that limits performance. Bottleneck analysis is critical for an architect’s work, whether the goal is tuning processors for energy efficiency, improving the effectiveness of optimizations, or designing a more balanced processor. Yet, despite its importance, bottleneck analysis methodology has lagged behind processor technology. While increasing supplies of transistors have been successfully converted into increasing performance, the resulting complexity has made bottleneck analysis much more challenging. Instructions are re-ordered and executed in parallel; processor events such as store-buffer stalls and BTB misses occur at the same time; and speculative computation is occasionally squashed with control redirected. This complexity and fine-grain parallelism {{makes it difficult to}} know what the bottlenecks actually are. For example, when two cache misses occur in the same cycle, we may need to optimize both to increase performance. <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>if</b> a multiply and window stall occur simultaneously? Is one of them the “true” bottleneck, or do we again need to optimize both? In general, there may be dozens of events occurring simultaneously in a single cycle on a modern machine. Does that mean we need to optimize all of them to remove the cycle? Or can we get by with just a subset...|$|E

40|$|Can {{linguistic}} semantics affect neural processing in featurespecific visual regions? Specifically, {{when we hear}} {{a sentence}} describing a situation that includes motion, do we engage neural processes {{that are part of}} the visual perception of motion? <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>if</b> a motion verb was used figuratively, not literally? We used fMRI to investigate whether semantic content can “penetrate” and modulate neural populations that are selective to specific visual properties during natural language comprehension. Participants were presented audiovisually with three kinds of sentences: motion sentences (“The wild horse crossed the barren field. ”), static sentences, (“The black horse stood in the barren field. ”), and fictive motion sentences (“The hiking trail crossed the barren field. ”). Motion-sensitive visual areas (MT+) were localized individually in each participant as well as faceselective visual regions (fusiform face area; FFA). MT+ was activated significantly more for motion sentences than the other sentence types. Fictive motion sentences also activated MT+ more than the static sentences. Importantly, no modulation of neural responses was found in FFA. Our findings suggest that the neural substrates of linguistic semantics include early visual areas specifically related to the represented semantics and that figurative uses of motion verbs also engage these neural systems, but to a lesser extent. These data are consistent with a view of language comprehension as an embodied process, with neural substrates as far reaching as early sensory brain areas that are specifically related to the represented semantics. ...|$|E
40|$|Information {{communication}} {{technology is the}} key to agricultural development if least developed countries (LDCs) are to optimize agricultural management (Di Bella, 2004). Many systems have been developed that collect vast amount of vital electronic data, perform data analysis and disseminate information. However, due to limited accessibility to these ICTs, LDCs still lag behind in exploiting technologies for timely decision making in agricultural management (Elisabetta Carfagna, 2005). Agricultural management in Africa is hampered by among other parameters the uncertainties that surround the following questions: when is the next rainy season? How long are the next rains expected to take? What is the likely intensity of these rains? Are they sustainable? What if we planted now? Are we likely to gain if we waited for two more months? How do we determine the disease or pest attaching our plants? <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>if</b> we used the other chemical/fertilizer? Although remote sensing technologies are not popularly used in Africa, in this paper we explore available advanced remote sensing technology that can be exploited to the advantage of agricultural sustainability and modernization in Africa region.

In collecting data, the writer uses documentation method. The data were the written text of love expression utterance used in The Last Promise novel. The data of variations of linguistic form were analyzed by Marcella Frank, the illocutionary meanings were analyzed by Austin, and the politeness strategies were analyzed by Brown and Levinson. The result of the study shows that, (1) there are three variations of linguistic form for love expressions, they are declarative sentence (I wanted to do something special for you), interrogative sentence (<b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>if</b> we just hug?), and imperative sentence (promise me you will never leave me again). (2) there are six illocutionary meaning of love expressions, namely showing affection (I love you Eliana, with all my heart I love you), showing care (but, be careful), showing engagement (I will always love you), showing persuasion (have you ever seen a moon like that?), showing eagerness (I want to be alone with you), expressing compliment (you have beautiful hands).
