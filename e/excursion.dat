Target of my studie thesis {{is to create a}} model of science <b>excursions</b> with use the opportunity of nature around the town Kladno. Another target is create work sheets and their practical use, to know how the students can improve their knowledge before and after the <b>excursions.</b> Dissertation contains field research all visited places. <b>Excursions</b> took place on Vinařická horka, Libušín castle former place, Educational centre of scientic training in Kladno Čabárna and rescue station Aves. During <b>excursions</b> we used the educational work sheets. Later we compared the results of pupils knowledge. The results we compare in diagrams and charts. Getting off the disertation is processing and adaptation three forms of these <b>excursions</b> including methods, using these methods and photographs.

5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic <b>excursion,</b> amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an <b>excursion,</b> it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E

Fieldtrips {{associated with the}} International Geographical Congress in Paris are examined with respect to theme, leadership, and message. Leadership was entrusted to proven geographers holding doctorates, and to geologists working close to physical geography. Despite eight <b>excursions</b> being planned, opportunities were not offered to visit large sections of France. This pattern of activity reflected areas where regional monographs had been completed, and where annual inter-university <b>excursions</b> for French geographers had been run. Patronage by De Martonne (Sorbonne) or by Blanchard (Grenoble) was another important explanatory factor for who led <b>excursions</b> and where they took place. Les <b>excursions</b> offertes à l’occasion des congrès internationaux donnent des possibilités importantes pour la transmission des savoirs géographiques. Dans cet article on essaie d’analyser le contenu, la direction et les communications des <b>excursions</b> associées avec le Congrès International de Géographie à Paris. Malgré la préparation de huit <b>excursions,</b> de larges sections de l’Hexagone restaient fermées aux congressistes. Cette situation s’explique par la localisation et des études monographiques achevées, et des <b>excursions</b> interuniversitaires.

The research population consisted of 60 teachers from both rural and urban schools across Victoria. The findings of this study showed that teachers conduct on average one to two <b>excursions</b> per class per year, teachers understand the importance of <b>excursions</b> in geography education and they find planning difficult, but work collaboratively with other teachers to overcome these issues. Other barriers include transportation, student behaviour and cost. With a firm grounding in the conceptual theories and state-level policies of geography education, the conduct of <b>excursions</b> was found to be both difficult and rewarding by teachers in Victoria. <br /...|$|R

5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone <b>excursion.</b> Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high <b>excursion,</b> at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E

This condition holds for C [to the power of 1, alpha] -domains ([alpha] > 0), {{but there is a}} C [to the power of 1]-domain for which it fails.
