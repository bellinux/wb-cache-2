Dele Fadele of the NME called it [...] "the poppermost pop single ever invented", {{adding that it}} {{contained}} [...] "a brilliant line <b>in</b> <b>nonsense</b> lyrics. As such it is the Spice Girls' message of peace to the world". The Reading Eagle reviewer, David Bauder, said that it [...] "sounds like {{it was written by}} a focus group who told them to add a Latin flavor". The Telegram & Gazette commented that its lyrics were [...] "concerned more with shaking hips than moving social consciousness". Larry Flick of Billboard magazine was mixed on the track. Although he described it as [...] "insanely catchy and devilishly fun", he also felt {{that it was not a}} real song, saying that it is [...] "just a festive cha-cha groove and a lyrical command to add some 'spice' to your life by way of countless dance moves. A runaway hit." [...] The Hartford Courant music critic Roger Catlin, believed that the song [...] "recognizes and embraces the group's worldwide audience with savvy Latin rhythms and a self-promoting lyric of dizzy Esperanto". Chicago Sun-Times critic Jim DeRogatis was unimpressed with the lyrics, yet when comparing it to Aqua's [...] "Barbie Girl", he found that its [...] "unifying sentiment is more admirable".|$|E
2500|$|Sound poetry {{emerged in}} this period as a {{response}} to the war. For many Dadaists, including German writer Hugo Ball and New York poet and performer Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, sound poems were protestations against the sounds of war. [...] As Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo write, “Born as the trench warfare intensified, phonetic poetry was the language of trauma, a new language to counter the noise of the cannons”. The Baroness’s poem “Klink-Hratzvenga (Death-wail)”, written in response to her husband’s suicide after the war’s end, was “a mourning song <b>in</b> <b>nonsense</b> sounds that transcended national boundaries”. Working from a confrontational feminist and artistic agenda, the Baroness asserted a distinctly female subjectivity in the post-World War I era.|$|E

60|$|It is {{somewhat}} absurd {{to imagine that}} any one who has not read a play by Mr. Shaw will be reading a book about him. But {{if it comes to}} that it is (as I clearly perceive) absurd to be writing a book about Mr. Bernard Shaw at all. It is indefensibly foolish to attempt to explain a man whose whole object through life has been to explain himself. But even <b>in</b> <b>nonsense</b> there is a need for logic and consistency; therefore let us proceed on the assumption that when I say that all Mr. Shaw's blood and origin may be found in John Bull's Other Island, some reader may answer that he does not know the play. Besides, it is more important to put the reader right about England and Ireland even than to put him right about Shaw. If he reminds me that this is a book about Shaw, I can only assure him that I will reasonably, and at proper intervals, remember the fact.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Johnson {{tells us}} that that only is good poetry which may be {{translated}} into sensible prose. I greatly doubt whether any very profound emotion can be so rendered.

Translate passion into sensible prose and it becomes absurd, because subdued to workaday associations, to that level of common sense and convention where to betray intense feeling is ridiculous and unmannerly.

60|$|And the {{philosophers}} and distinguished men of science with whom of late he had frequently enjoyed {{the opportunity of}} becoming acquainted, what were their views? They differed among themselves: did any of them agree with him? How they accounted for every thing except the only point on which man requires revelation! Chance, necessity, atomic theories, nebular hypotheses, development, evolution, the origin of worlds, human ancestry--here were high topics, on none of which was there lack of argument; and, in a certain sense, of evidence; and what then? There must be design. The reasoning and the research of all philosophy could not be valid against that conviction. If there were no design, why, {{it would all be}} nonsense; and he could not believe <b>in</b> <b>nonsense.</b> And if there were design, there must be intelligence; and if intelligence, pure intelligence; and pure intelligence was inconsistent with any disposition but perfect good. But between the all-wise and the all-benevolent and man, according to the new philosophers, no relations were to be any longer acknowledged. They renounce in despair the possibility of bringing man into connection with that First Cause which they can neither explain nor deny. But man requires that there shall be direct relations between the created and the Creator; and that in those relations he should find a solution of the perplexities of existence. The brain that teems with illimitable thought, will never recognize as his creator any power of Nature, however irresistible, that is not gifted with consciousness. Atheism may be consistent with fine taste, and fine taste under certain conditions may for a time regulate a polished society; but ethics with atheism are impossible; and without ethics no human order can be strong or permanent.|$|E
