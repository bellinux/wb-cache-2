50|$|The <b>gelatin</b> <b>process</b> {{produced}} print runs of {{somewhere between}} 20 and 80 copies, {{depending upon the}} skill of the user {{and the quality of}} the original. At least eight different colors of hectographic ink were available at one time, but purple was the most popular because of its density and contrast.|$|E
50|$|Dry plate, {{also known}} as <b>gelatin</b> <b>process,</b> is an {{improved}} type of photographic plate. It was invented by Dr. Richard L. Maddox in 1871, and by 1879 it was so well introduced that the first dry plate factory had been established. With much of the complex chemistry work centralized into a factory, the new process simplified the work of photographers, allowing them to expand their business.|$|E

50|$|The {{daguerreotype}} had shortcomings, {{notably the}} fragility of the mirror-like image surface and the particular viewing conditions required to see the image properly. Each was a unique opaque positive that could only be duplicated by copying it with a camera. Inventors set about working out improved processes that would be more practical. By the end of the 1850s the daguerreotype had been replaced by the less expensive and more easily viewed ambrotype and tintype, which made use of the recently introduced collodion process. Glass plate collodion negatives used to make prints on albumen paper soon became the preferred photographic method and held that position for many years, even after the introduction of the more convenient <b>gelatin</b> <b>process</b> in 1871. Refinements of the <b>gelatin</b> <b>process</b> have remained the primary black-and-white photographic process to this day, differing primarily in the sensitivity of the emulsion and the support material used, which was originally glass, then a variety of flexible plastic films, along with various types of paper for the final prints.|$|E
50|$|Cephas {{was also}} {{credited}} with photographing the Borobudur temple complex after its hidden base {{was discovered in}} 1885 by the union's first chairman. The base was briefly uncovered in 1890 to be photographed and then covered again in 1891. Because Cephas only received one-third of the original subsidy from the government, {{he was not able}} to complete the 300 photographs calculated to be needed for the project. Each photographic plate would have required one-half hour to develop with the dry <b>gelatin</b> <b>process</b> for a total of 150 hours. In all, only 160 segments of the base's reliefs were photographed, and an additional four photographs were made to provide a general overview for the site. The series was published 30 years later by the Royal Institute in a collotype collection.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{making of}} Parasites, DeSieno {{combined}} classical and cutting-edge photographic techniques. He captured images of microscopic organisms that dwell {{in the human}} body obtained through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), microscopy laboratories at the University of South Florida, and Etsy. DeSieno first dehydrated the dead organisms and viewed them under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). He then used images collected from the SEM to print a digital negative, which was exposed to a dry plate <b>gelatin</b> <b>process</b> ferrotype. The ferrotype was scanned, enlarged, and printed at four-foot length prints. In an interview with National Geographic's Proof, DeSieno articulates his belief that [...] "photo and science have had an intrinsic relationship since its conception—the founding mothers and fathers of photo were all scientists themselves. My practice is really driven by curiosity, which {{is at the heart of}} scientific inquiry. I’d like to hope that my work can light an inquisitive spark in my viewer that allows them to explore their own wonders and fears”.|$|E

30|$|Aqueous PVA {{solutions}} {{with different}} concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 wt%) were heated at 90  °C for 1  h. The solutions were then cooled {{to room temperature}} and subsequently left at − 20  °C for 12  h. After the freezing, the solutions were allowed to thaw at 4  °C for another 12  h. The freezing–thawing cycle was performed to reinforce of the PVA solution via densification of the macromolecular structure. Moreover, after the freezing–thawing treatment of the PVA solution, a porous structure arises due to <b>gelatin</b> <b>processes</b> [28].|$|R
40|$|Gelatin was {{extracted}} from the skin of tilapia (Oreochromis urolepis hornorum) and characterized according to its physical and chemical properties. It had pH 4. 66, which is slightly higher than the values reported for <b>gelatins</b> <b>processed</b> by acid solubilization. In general, the ionic content was low, and the average yield of the process was 5. 10 g/ 100 g. The proximal composition of the gelatin {{was similar to that}} of the commercial gelatins, with slightly higher moisture content. The tilapia skin gelatin had whitish-yellow color and average turbidity of 67 NTU...|$|R
40|$|The {{lubrication}} {{effect of}} three long-chain polymers - mucin, methylcellulose and Ficoll - on ciliary propulsion in tubes {{is measured by}} plotting the relative velocities of swimming cilitates {{as a function of}} the tube bore diameter. Mucin shows the most unequivocal lubrication, which is found at concentrations between 0 % and 9. 1 % (w/v). This observation, coupled with viscometric measurements which show that ciliary tip shear rates are sufficient to solate mucin, serve as the groundwork for a model of mucin lubrication which explains the optimized lubrication behaviour of thixotropic gelating polymers as an expression of the response to shear by the various stages of polymer clustering during the <b>gelatin</b> <b>process.</b> In addition to the lubricative effect, another wall drag reduction effect by mucin was measured in the clearance region beyond the lubrication layer. This apparent viscosity reduction is optimized in the concentration range between 1. 7 % and 4. 1 % mucin and may also be explained in terms of the properties of gel clustering...|$|E

5000|$|The term {{alternative}} process {{refers to}} any non-traditional or non-commercial photographic printing process.

5000|$|Digital negatives can be {{enlarged}} {{and printed}} using the standard analog <b>gelatin</b> silver <b>process.</b> However, since printers cannot spray small enough drops of ink to ensure {{detail in the}} smaller traditional sizes such as 35 mm, a larger format such as 4x5" [...] is normally used.|$|R
50|$|Jim Schwall {{is also a}} {{professional}} photographer, and has done {{many different types of}} photography. In recent years he has worked at creating art prints that combine human figures and natural landscapes.

50|$|He {{improved}} the <b>gelatin</b> silver <b>process</b> developed by Richard Leach Maddox, first in 1873 by {{a method of}} hardening the emulsion, making it more resistant to friction, and later in 1878 Bennett discovered that by prolonged heating {{the sensitivity of the}} emulsion could be greatly increased. This increased sensitivity resulting enabled shooting at 1/25 second, paving the way for the snapshot.|$|R
50|$|Maddox Peak is a peak {{standing}} at {{the south side of}} the mouth of Carbutt Glacier, east of Flandres Bay, on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. The peak appears on an Argentine government chart of 1954. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960 for English physician and pioneer of photography Richard L.

30|$|Two {{types of}} {{sprayable}} media were made: an agar-based and a gelatin-based. The agar-based was mixed in batches containing 0.48  g malt, 0.06  g agar, and 24  mL of distilled water. Each batch was autoclaved {{in a separate}} Mason canning jar (Bernardin, Canada) for 15  min, then allowed to cool in a laminar flow hood overnight. After cooling, jars were inoculated {{with one of the}} chosen test fungi, and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10  days. Gelatin jars were mixed in 24  mL batches containing 0.48  g malt and 0.36  g <b>gelatin,</b> and <b>processed</b> as above. Both the gelatin and agar media existed in a semi-solid state, which turned liquid upon agitation.|$|R
40|$|Laura Aguilar, John Coplans, and Carla Williams explore, through {{photographic}} self-portraiture, {{the representation}} of unconventional bodies. Even though the images produced by these artists are quite different in style, they all reflect an interest in {{a representation of the}} nude human body that challenges the traditional concepts of beauty so prevalent in a Western society obsessed with physical perfection. Even though the three artists produced their photographic self-portraits at roughly the same time, using the traditional <b>gelatin</b> silver <b>process</b> and responding to standards of classical beauty, their divergent life experiences, education, and social backgrounds have led them to question an almost universal vision of the perfect body from a broad spectrum of perspectives...|$|R
50|$|Frank Gohlke {{was raised}} in Wichita Falls, Texas. He bought his first camera as a {{teenager}} {{and was a member}} of the Wichita Falls camera club during high school, eventually purchasing an enlarger and learning to <b>process</b> <b>gelatin</b> silver prints. His early subjects included family members and models hired by the camera club. Late in high school, Gohlke’s interest in photography waned; he sold his enlarger and, save for family snapshots, stopped taking pictures altogether.|$|R
40|$|Foods and {{pharmaceutical}} industries {{all over the}} world attend an increasing demand for gelatin, a biopolymer derived from collagen. Gelatins are widely used due to their biocompatibility, biodegradation, physical and functional properties. Porcine and bovine gelatins, the most commonly used, are subject to major constraints and skepticism among consumers, this is due to socio-cultural and health-related issues. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for alternative sources. The by-products generated by fish-processing industries are a potential source for the production of gelatins. Fish gelatin possesses interesting characteristics and may thus be considered as an alternative to mammalian gelatin for use in food, pharmaceutical and photographic products. This review enumerates <b>gelatin</b> preparation <b>processes,</b> as well as, their physical properties, and their potential applications in many fields, such as food, pharmacy and photography industries. ...|$|R
40|$|In one of {{the stages}} of the <b>gelatin</b> {{production}} <b>process,</b> a highly concentrated solution of gel is cooled and extruded to form gelatin noodles, which are then laid on a drying belt. Gelatin is a molecular colloid that is not porous under these drying conditions, and as a consequence, water migration occurs solely by diffusive processes. To achieve a commercial standard of dryness, the dependence of the diffusion coefficient {{as a function of}} temperature is used. This set of circumstances favors the appearance of sharp concentration gradients inside the gel. In a numerical simulation of the drying process these characteristics create difficult conditions for use of the traditional methods for solution of time-dependent partial differential equation models. This paper evaluates an implementation of the boundary element method to determine surface conditions of the gelatin particle...|$|R
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the <b>gelatin</b> silver <b>process,</b> photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|R
50|$|Other prestigious clients {{included}} Mark Twain, and Annie Oakley. In {{some ways}} Eisenmann {{can be considered}} a kind of Annie Leibovitz of the Victorian Bowery district. His career suffered a downturn with the introduction of <b>Gelatin</b> silver <b>process</b> photography which made photographs more inexpensive and available for mass consumption. Also, Vaudeville overtook circuses in popularity at this time as well. In 1898 Eisenmann closed his studio and was succeeded by Frank Wendt. Frank was a sort of intern of his. For a few years, he sold photographic equipment and took conventional portraits in Plainfield, New Jersey but by 1907 he had disappeared from the public record, some believing he went to Germany. This was the second time he went off the radar, the first time being when his first wife died. At that time he was believed to have gone to Asia.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{optimization}} of the calcimine deliming process during production of food grade <b>gelatin.</b> This <b>process</b> {{is the most}} important step from chemical engineering and environmental protection standpoint during production of food gelatin. The main objective of the paper is to provide a suitable mathematical description of the chemical deliming process. The proposed model is subsequently used for optimization of the deliming process to minimize the operating costs and environmental burden. The experimental part follows two main aims: determination of the effective diffusion coefficient of calcium sulfate during deliming with ammonium sulfate based on experimentally measured data, and computer simulations of the operating costs from the viewpoint of various soaking numbers, degree of the deliming and strength of the bond of calcium hydroxide to collagen. The results give ground for further optimization and exact transfer of laboratory data into real industrial operations...|$|R
40|$|Effects of pretreatments with {{different}} alkali and acid concentrations, and extraction temperatures on fish gelatin extraction and properties was studied. The resultant fish gelatins were evaluated {{in terms of}} extraction yield, viscosity, gel strength, and pH. The combination of higher acid pretreatment concentrations and extraction temperatures removed the noncollagenous protein and provided proper pH extraction condition which resulted higher gelatin extraction yield. However, the gel strength decreased {{with the increase of}} acid concentration. The gel strength and pH of gelatin increase proportionally to the increase in alkali concentration and extraction temperature. No significant effects of the three treatments on the gelatin viscocity. The recommended <b>gelatin</b> extraction <b>process</b> conditions was using alkali concentration (NaOH) of 0. 55 N, acid (HCl) of   0. 95 N, and a temperature of 60 °C.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study of a}} <b>gelatin</b> headend <b>process</b> for feed from silicon- containing aluminum fuels and plant salvage solutions is described. The optimum conditions for the gelatin treatment of fuel solutions were to boil a 0. 1 to 0. 5 N nitric acid solution with 100 milligrams of gelatin per liter for 30 minutes. This treatment improved filtration rates and decreased the surface activity of the filtrate for TBP extraction. A number of possible flowsheets for fuel solutions are presented using gelatin treatment and filtration. An adequate treatment was not found for salvage solutions of unknown composition because a gelatin dosage which was satisfactory for all solutions could not be selected. The optimum treatment for a salvage solution which was grossly contaminated with zirconium, soluble and colloidal silica, and dibutyl phosphate was to boil a 1 N acid deficient solution with 600 milligrams of gelatin per liter, filter, and use a Hexone extraction system. A silicic colloid in fuel processing solutions was characterized as a surface active material by this study. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Multiple-mode lasing at {{the band}} edge of dye-doped planar {{structures}} in dichromated gelatin film with gradient spacing, obtained by differential {{swelling of the}} <b>gelatin</b> during developing <b>process,</b> was demonstrated. The lasing intensity at λ = 560 nm, increases nonlinearly respect to the pumping energy at 532 nm laser light. Asymmetric fluorescence emissions, from gelatin side and substrate side, and one-sided mirrorless lasing were achieved. The polarization of lasing beam is linear which follows the polarization of the pumping beam. The spatial lasing profile was also recorded. The band edge is not well defined for a differential spacing layer structure compared with the periodic case. The density of states (DOS) near the band edge of the structure and its relation with the multiple lasing modes will be discussed...|$|R

The skin of male Bligon goat age ?? 1. 5 - 2. 5 years of old and acetic acid (CH 3 COOH 0. 5 M) were used as material. The experiment was run according to completely randomized design (CRD) with factorial pattern of 2 x 3 and three replications for each treatment. Two processing time (48 and 96 hours) as first factor and three concentrations levels of acetic acid (3, 6 and 9 %, v/v) as the second factor. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance. Yields, gel strength and viscosity were used as parameters. The results of this study showed that the processing time up to 96 hours and level of concentration up to 9 % significantly affected (P< 0. 01) gel strength, but no significantly on the yields and viscosity. The combination of processing time of 96 hours with concentration level of 3 % gave the best results compared to others...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As {{a kind of}} {{functional}} material, gelatin gel is widely used in controlled drug release, biological tissue engineering, photographic and food industries.

Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|R
