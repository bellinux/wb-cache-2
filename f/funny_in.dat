25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> them, but, trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, never would have let the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E

25|$|De Camp {{began his}} {{education}} at the Trinity School in New York, then spent ten years attending the Snyder School in North Carolina, a military-style institution. His stay at the Snyder School was an attempt by his parents, who were heavy-handed disciplinarians, to cure him of intellectual arrogance and lack of discipline. He was awkward and thin, an ineffective fighter, and suffered from bullying by his classmates. His experiences at the school taught him to develop a detached, analytical style considered cold by all but his closest friends, though he could, like his father, be disarming and <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> social situations. He would later recall these challenging childhood experiences in the semi-autobiographical story, Judgment Day (1955).|$|E
500|$|The faux {{trailers}} {{before the}} film also received mixed reviews.

[...] Christy Lemire, writing for the Associated Press, called the trailers [...] "...the {{best part of the}} trip." [...] Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice was critical, saying that the trailers' comedy [...] "...resides {{in the land of the}} obvious, easy chuckle." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's ending was unusual, as many {{episodes of}} South Park tend {{to resolve the}} episode's events; in [...] "Fatbeard", the main {{characters}} don't return home and are shown at the end still in Somalia. An alternate ending {{made it to the}} animatic stage, in which Cartman, in a self-referential manner, congratulates the show on the conclusion of the season and invites the season's celebrity parodies (among those the Jonas Brothers and Kanye West). The ending, which Parker likened to that of a variety show, was something he felt was <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> writing but didn't succeed visually.|$|E

500|$|Speaking of {{the fifth}} season and Castiel's more {{frequent}} interactions with humans, Collins commented, [...] "Obviously the big joke is that he doesn't understand human beings and how they behave. And there is something inherently <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> that, especially if he's the straight man." [...] The actor noted {{he was a little}} hesitant at making the character into [...] "the funny guy", and was apprehensive about some moments in the early episodes of the season. However, he believes the writers have found [...] "the line", allowing for the jokes to be [...] "more subtle" [...] and [...] "a little more believable".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} universal critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 15 {{reviews of}} the episode and judged 100% {{of them to be}} positive, with an average score of 8.5 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] "'The North Remembers' underscores Joffrey's capacity for cruelty and Tyrion's development as a key player in a compelling sophomore season opener." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10. The A.V. Club gave it B+. Alan Sepinwall, who reviewed the episode for HitFix, called it [...] "a great beginning. <b>Funny</b> <b>in</b> spots, scary in others, never blinking away from the cruelty of this world and this war." ...|$|E
500|$|With a {{background}} in comedy, Thompson's performances are typically delivered with an ironic touch. Ang Lee, director of Sense and Sensibility stated that Thompson's comedic approach may be her greatest asset as an actress, remarking, [...] "Emma is an extremely funny lady. Like Austen, she's laughing at her own culture while she's a part of it." [...] Thompson has stated that the [...] "most moving things are often also <b>funny,</b> <b>in</b> life and in art" [...] which is present in her film work.

500|$|Dunn {{then moved}} {{onto the scene}} during the funeral, when the child trembled from seeing her mother's lips sewn shut. Described by her {{as one of the}} most troubling shots in {{mainstream}} music videos, the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother lying in her wake. The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair, that she remembered that her mother's lips looked <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> the funeral. When she got closer, she saw that Madonna Sr's lips had been sewn together. This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years, and led her to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex. The singer further explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Professor Layton's London Life {{was also}} {{viewed as a}} {{worthwhile}} extension to the game, with 1UP.com stating that the main game was [...] "almost a side diversion" [...] in comparison. Critics often compared the gameplay to the popular Animal Crossing franchise. Response to the game was mixed. IGN felt it [...] "surprising the game was included as a mere bonus" [...] and GamePro praised the dialogue, calling it [...] "clever and genuinely <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> ways that few other games are." [...] However, Game Revolution said that the game soon [...] "becomes a chore" [...] to play, and some reviewers were unhappy with the decision to remove the game from European versions of Professor Layton and the Last Specter.|$|E
500|$|Ian Ogilvy as Richard Marshall. Ogilvy {{had been}} a friend of Reeves since they were teenagers, and the actor had {{appeared}} {{in many of the}} director's amateur short films. Ogilvy had also starred in both of Reeves's two previous feature films, Revenge of the Blood Beast and The Sorcerers, and was the natural first choice for the role of Witchfinders heroic lead. Describing his working relationship with Reeves, Ogilvy noted that [...] "his mastery of the technical aspects was absolute", but added [...] "Mike never directed the actors. He always said he knew nothing about acting, and preferred to leave it up to us." [...] Ogilvy enjoyed working with Price, finding him to be [...] "very <b>funny,</b> <b>in</b> a 'queeny' sort of way." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to the broadcast, Dusty Saunders previewed {{the episode}} for Rocky Mountain News, calling Futurama [...] "under-appreciated" [...] {{and that this}} episode had [...] "Lots of fun and fantasy {{at the expense of}} the noted sci-fi series." [...] Zack Handlen, while writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode an 'A' grade. He said that the storyline could have been seen as [...] "pretty mean-spirited if there wasn't such a clear thread of Trek love running through the episode". He felt that having the framing device set during the event rather than {{afterwards}} as [...] "delightful", and that the Star Trek references were both [...] "relevant to the story and <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> their own right". Andy Wilson reviewed the episode for BigShinyRobot, calling it the [...] "greatest animated homage to Trek ever" [...] and [...] "one of the best episodes of Futurama".|$|E
500|$|... "Promos" [...] {{was written}} by {{consulting}} producer Tim McAuliffe, his first writing credit for the series. It was directed by former series writer, director, and co-showrunner Jennifer Celotta, her third such credit for the series. The episode features Philadelphia Phillies star Ryan Howard playing himself. This marks the second time a major sports star has played themselves for the season, as former Philadelphia 76ers star Julius Erving portrayed himself in the episode [...] "Lice". Robinson later said that Ryan [...] "killed it" [...] and that [...] "He's pretty damn <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> real life, which doesn't always translate to TV". He also joked that Howard is [...] "definitely a better actor than John Krasinski. Without a doubt." [...] The titular promos are composed of stock footage from The Office, primarily from early seasons of the series. They feature the departed characters Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak).|$|E

Executive producer David Mirkin thought {{it was difficult to}} make Abe funny because he is a [...] "boring and tedious" [...] character. He thinks that even though [...] "Abe's doing all these complaints, what makes him funny is that the things he says are actually <b>funny</b> <b>in</b> the context of the boring and tedium." [...] Mirkin thought this was a [...] "big challenge, and Bill and Josh pulled it off very well." ...|$|E

500|$|The troops under Patton's command {{received}} the speech well. The general's strong reputation caused considerable excitement among his men, and they listened intently, in absolute silence, as he spoke. A majority indicated they enjoyed Patton's speaking style. As one officer recounted {{of the end}} of the speech, [...] "The men instinctively sensed the fact and the telling mark that they themselves would play in world history because of it, for they were being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words, and the men well knew it, but they loved the way he put it as only he could do it." [...] Patton gave a humorous tone to the speech, as he intentionally sought to make his men laugh with his colorful delivery. Observers later noted the troops seemed to find the speeches very <b>funny.</b> <b>In</b> particular, Patton's use of obscene humor was well received by the enlisted men, as it was [...] "the language of the barracks".|$|E

[...] The poem Pinsky reads in the episode was picked by the Simpsons writing staff, [...] "The poem has two jokes in it," [...] Pinsky said, [...] "and when I say jokes I don't mean witty remarks. It's more like an optician, the pope and a zebra go into the bar and then there's a punch line at the end." [...] He stated that the poem was [...] "an elegy for {{a friend of mine who}} liked jokes". He added that his appearance on the show gave him [...] "a lot more prestige" [...] when visiting high schools and colleges.

BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl said that [...] "the insubordination of Stanley was a necessary plot point to cover" [...] because [...] "without it, too much Stanley being Stanley becomes unbelievable". Furthermore, he wrote that there [...] "was a lot of really funny stuff tonight" [...] and highlighted [...] "the scene between Darryl and Michael" [...] due to Robinson's acting. Aubry D'Arminio from Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "Mike's embarrassment, and his unwillingness at first to admit he is disliked, was very very well played on Carell's part." [...] Furthermore, D'Arminio praised several of the episode's lines of dialogue and wrote [...] "I cannot even come near to picking a favorite quote [...] for this episode" ...|$|E
40|$|According to comic moralism, moral flaws make comic works less funny or not <b>funny</b> at all. <b>In</b> contrast, comic immoralism is {{the view}} that moral flaws make comic works <b>funnier.</b> <b>In</b> this article, I argue for a {{moderate}} version of comic immoralism.
