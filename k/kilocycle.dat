40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a bridge detector designed to operate between 2 <b>kilocycles</b> and 100 <b>kilocycles</b> per second. The detector is an electronic device which beats the incoming signal {{with a local}} oscillator signal. This effect {{is due to the}} heterodyne principle. The local oscillator is of the Wein Bridge type which utilizes a Wein Bridge C-R feedback circuit to produce stable harmonic-free oscillations. The beat-frequency signal is filtered by a two-section tuned amplifier tuned to 1000 cycles per second. The amplifiers are of the parallel-T feedback type which use a C-R degenerative feedback network to produce selective amplification. The output signal is detected by means of earphones. Good sensitivity is obtained by the use of high gain throughout the circuit. Several capacitors were measured at frequencies up to 20 <b>kilocycles</b> on a Schering bridge using the instrument. Balances of five significant figures were easily obtained...|$|R

40|$|A plain {{spherical bearing}} design {{with a ball}} {{diameter}} of 28. 6 mm, a race length of 12. 7 mm, and a 1. 7 -mm-thick, molded composite liner was evaluated.

40|$|In {{previous}} {{work on the}} alternating current impedance of Arbacia punctulata egg suspensions (Cole and Cole, 1936 b), {{it was found that}} the unfertilized egg had a static membrane capacity of 0. 73 /~f. /cm. ~ which was independent of the frequency. On fertilization, the low frequency membrane capacity increased to 3. 1 /~f. /cm. 2 and at intermediate frequencies there was evidence of another capacity element. It was suggested that the fertilization data could be interpreted either by an increased plasma membrane capacity which varied with frequency or by an added high capacity of the fertilization membrane. The latter picture was considered the more probable one, and diagrams of the current flow were subsequently published (Cole, 1937). The present work was undertaken to determine whether or not this explanation was correct. Measurements The impedance of the suspensions was measured over the frequency range from 1 kc. (<b>kilocycle</b> per second) to 10 me. (megacycles per second) with an alternating current Wheatstone bridge which has been described (Cole and Curtis, 1937).
