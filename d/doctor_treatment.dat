40|$|Background Despite {{empirical}} evidence demonstrating {{the effectiveness of}} collaborative stepped care program (SCP) in Western countries, such programs have not been evaluated in the east, which has a different services system structure and cultural nuances in seeking help for mental illness. Furthermore, only {{a few studies have}} used SCP for depression and anxiety prevention. We conducted a trial to test its effectiveness in preventing major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder among primary care patients with subthreshold depression and/or anxiety in Hong Kong. Methods Subthreshold depression and/or anxiety patients were randomized into the SCP group (n= 121) or care as usual (CAU) group (n= 119). The SCP included watchful waiting, telephone counseling, problem solving therapy, and family <b>doctor</b> <b>treatment</b> within one year. The primary outcome was the onset of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder in 15 months. The secondary outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life and time absent from work due to any illness.

The objectives of this study were to find out health care access (Supply-side effect) in the garments factory for the women workers and their relation to the productivity. A total of 300 women garment workers were included in this study. Most (60. 0 %) of the respondents were adolescents, unmarried and having only primary level education (5 years of school education). Their average take home monthly salary was 1791. 7 taka which was spent mostly on food. They passed a tight work schedule from 6 AM to 11. 30 PM without any rest. Hundred percent of female workers had no previous idea about garments nor had any formal training, but they produced on an average 1016 garment pieces a day. They did not get any vaccine, health education or health related knowledge from the garments factory. There was no provision of health care centre or <b>doctor,</b> <b>treatment</b> for fire burn (other than gas), medicine and support in chronic, severe illness for themselves or their family members. More than half (63. 0 %) of the respondents mentioned about loss of time due to illness. There was a strong correlation (r= 0. 858) between sickness and production loss, between hour loss and production loss (r= 0. 9283), between production loss and percentage loss (r= 0. 871). Though there was loss due to illness, no health access or facility for women workers in the garments factory was available.

Kadłubka 10 - 11, 71 - 521 Szczecin Abstract Hypothyroidism is a common form of endocrinopathy, it can be a problem for up to 10 % of population. Women are five times more likely to suffer from thyroid diseases, and the frequency of morbidity raises with age. Family doctor in Poland is able to perform TSH, FT 3, FT 4 examination, and thyroid ultrasound when it comes to thyreology. It allows to treat patients with hypothyroidism, however it does not allow to precisely determine the cause. In order to determine the cause, family doctor needs to consult endocrinologist. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not specific and rarely make patients inclined to visit the <b>doctor.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of hypothyroidism consists of L-thyroxine substitution in a certain dose. It is recommended to treat subclinical hypothyroidism with small doses of L-thyroxine when level of TSH > 10 mIU/L. When concentration level of TSH is lower than 10 mIU/L it is vital to individually assess risk factors and patients clinical situation. Decision whether to start the treatment should be made on those grounds. Key words: Hypothyroidism, hashimoto diseas...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Biokinetics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Professional rugby {{union has}} grown to become the third most popular team contact sport in the world. The {{physical}} nature of the game results in a high prevalence of injuries on all levels of play. Injury prevalence as high as 83. 9 injuries per 1000 playing hours has been reported for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. Although research indicates schoolboy rugby union to be safer than professional rugby, injury rates as high as 65. 8 injuries per 1000 playing hours have been reported. These injuries are mostly caused by the tackle situation, with the knee– and shoulder–joints being the most injured site. The risk of injuries in rugby union is heightened by professionalism, previous injuries, higher training demands, intrinsic factors and psychological issues. Due to the professional nature the game has taken on, the management of rugby union injuries has become increasingly more important. This should include prehabilitation or injury prevention programs, rehabilitation up until the final, sport specific phase as well as structured return to play testing. Another important aspect of injury management is the education of coaches, players and other persons involved in the sport. Objectives The first objective {{of the study was}} to observe the prevalence and nature of injuries in South African schoolboy rugby union players. Secondly, the treatment of these injuries was observed as well as the return to play criteria used to determine readiness to return to play after injury. The association between the treatment of injuries and the severity of injuries was then obtained. Lastly re–injury prevalence was compared to treatment received and return to play criteria used to determine readiness. Methods Ten schools from across South Africa partook in the study. The schools were all identified by the NWU–PUK as elite schools due to performances in the previous year (2008). Only the first team squad of each school was participated, amounting to a total number of 194 boys answering questionnaires conducted by the researcher for each of their injuries. The questionnaires included injury severity and site, recurrence of injury, cause of injury, treatment procedures and criteria used for return to play. Severity was defined in terms of game and training days missed due to injury and are describe as slight (0 – 1 day), minimal (2 - 3 days), mild (4 - 7 days), moderate (8 - 28 days) or severe (> 28 days). The results were then analyzed and presented through descriptive statistics. Statistical significance was indicated by p = 0. 5. Results A total number of 118 injuries were reported amounting to 78. 51 injuries per 1000 playing hours. New injuries accounted for 68. 64 % (n= 81) while recurrent injuries was reported to be 31. 36 % (n= 37). The most frequent site of injury was the knee (n= 26), followed by the shoulder (n= 21). The event leading to injury that was most frequently reported, was the tackle (including making the tackle and being tackled) (n= 49). Most injuries were slight (48 %) but a high rate of moderate and severe injuries (39 %) were reported. These moderate to severe injuries resulted in a minimum total of 360 days missed. Severe injuries were more likely to be treated by a <b>doctor.</b> <b>Treatment</b> by a doctor for severe injuries indicated the only significance in the study (p = 0. 7). No fixed return to play protocol was in place for deciding if a player should be allowed to return to play. Thirteen of the injuries were however investigated through further testing (either through isokinetic or on–field testing). Conclusion Injury prevalence amongst top teams in South African schoolboy rugby union is very high. Rehabilitation does not follow a structured program or guidelines and there is no definite return to play protocols available. Re–injury rates are high, possibly due to the lack of structured rehabilitation and return to play protocols. Master...|$|E

2500|$|The Lake Wobegon effect, {{a natural}} human {{tendency}} to overestimate one's capabilities, was coined by Professor David G Myers {{in honour of}} the fictional town.
