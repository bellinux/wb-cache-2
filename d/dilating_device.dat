40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study was designed}} to compare two single-dilator percutaneous tracheotomy techniques, the Ciaglia BlueRhino and the Percutwist technique. One hundred and ninety adult patients were included, 166 with the BlueRhino, a conical shaped, flexible rubber dilator, and 24 with the Percutwist, a screw like <b>dilating</b> <b>device.</b> The procedure was performed under fiberscopy {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU). Age, body mass index (BMI), indication for tracheotomy, surgical landmarks, duration of the procedure and surgical complications were recorded. Median age and indications were similar for the two groups. Dilation was successful in all patients. The mean time for surgery was shorter with the Ciaglia technique: 8 +/- 3 versus 12 +/- 5 min with the Percutwist technique (P = 0. 004). There was no significant difference related to weight, BMI, duration of tracheotomy and complications between both groups. One posterior tracheal wall puncture was observed with the Ciaglia technique and four with the Percutwist technique. No serious complications were noted with either technique. The Percutwist technique represents an alternative to the more established Ciaglia BlueRhino technique. The Ciaglia technique is a safe and more rapid procedure for bedside tracheotomy...|$|E
40|$|Benign esophageal {{obstruction}} {{is virtually}} always responsive to dilation therapy. Dilation therapy should, therefore, be the initial approach. The {{introduction of the}} Savary-type dilating equipment and of balloon dilation systems are, or will become, standard practice. These systems will increasingly be preferred over the Eder-Puestow metal olives and the mercury-filled bougies in the near future, although the latter 2 will retain some distinct indications. All currently available <b>dilating</b> <b>devices</b> have advantages and shortcomings. The overall symptomatic and objective success rate of dilation therapy is acceptable. Perforation remains the major complication. Nonsurgical therapy of perforation is possible provided perforation site has occurred. Future controlled comparative studies are perforation site has occurred. Future controlled comparative studies are required to determine the usefulness and efficacy of the various dilation system...|$|R
40|$|Getting an {{effective}} and safe percutaneous access is the cornerstone in performing a successful and uneventful PCNL. The choice of the puncture site, according to our experience, {{is one of the}} most important factors that may influence the outcome of the procedure Preoperative imaging has a preliminary role in choosing the kind of approach but the most important role has to be given to intraoperative retrograde pyelography following occlusion balloon catheter placing. Ultrasound-guided renal puncture as well may show adequate anatomic details of the collecting system if a retrograde dilation is performed We routinely perform a single subcostal lower pole access. In our opinion, when the skin incision is located into the four-sided space between 12 thrib, spine muscles, iliac crest and posterior axillary line, the risk of most non-haemorrhagic complications may be reduced. When the needle is proceeding towards its target, some radiological sign may confirm its correct insertion Dilation and operative sheath placing are the last steps of the percutaneous tract creation. Amongst the wide offer of <b>dilating</b> <b>devices,</b> our choice usually goes to the Amplatz fascial dilators associated to the "one-shot" technique and to the balloon hydraulic dilators...|$|R

Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective case review of patients undergoing cataract surgery from August to November 2015. Of the 641 eyes of 389 patients who underwent cataract surgery, 260 eyes were administered phenylephrine 1. 0 %/ketorolac 0. 3 % and 381 eyes received Epi in the irrigation solution intraoperatively. All patients received a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug regimen (bromfenac 0. 07 %, nepafenac 0. 3 %, or ketorolac 0. 5 %) for 3 days before surgery and topical tropicamide 1. 0 %, cyclopentolate 1. 0 %, and phenylephrine 2. 5 % on the day of surgery. Results: Mean length of surgery (LOS) was 15. 4 ± 0. 6 minutes. Although a positive correlation was noted between patient age and LOS (p< 0. 001), P/K was associated with a decrease in the LOS, when controlled for age quartiles. A statistically significant lower incidence of complications (1. 1 %) was observed with P/K use than Epi (4. 5 %; p= 0. 018). Among surgeons who used mydriatic-assist devices more frequently, P/K use was associated with a reduction in the use of these devices (p< 0. 001). When controlling for age quartile, patients of age groups 69 – 76 and 76 – 92 years who received P/K had significantly better uncorrected visual acuity at postoperative day 1 than those receiving Epi (p= 0. 003). Conclusion: Intracameral use of phenylephrine 1. 0 %/ketorolac 0. 3 % during cataract surgery may be effective in maintaining mydriasis. It appears to be superior to intracameral Epi at reducing intraoperative and postoperative complications, need for pupillary <b>dilating</b> <b>devices,</b> and surgical time.

40|$|Abstract-We derive an {{objective}} function which instead of mapping/placing application task graphs in a compact manner onto reconfigurable <b>devices,</b> <b>dilates</b> the mappings {{as much as}} the available latencies on critical connections allow. The objective function is then optimized using simulated annealing. The main advantage of the dilated placement of the task graphs is that the unused resources between an application’s configured components can be used to provide additional flexibility when the configuration needs to change. We present results of applying the dilated placement to one synthetic case and one real case. The presented results show successful and meaningful graph dilation. I...|$|R
