These principles remain timely because the fundamental causes of the instability of the international monetary system are as valid today as they were in the early Forties. The new international money would be created against domestic earning assets of the Fed and the ECB. The quantity of this supranational bank money would be demand driven and thus would differ from the helicopter-money Special Drawing Rights. NICU would not hold open positions in assets denominated in national currency and consequently would not bear exchange rate risk. NICU would be more than an office where to record credit and <b>debit</b> <b>entries</b> of the supranational bank money.

50|$|An {{error of}} {{original}} entry is when {{both sides of}} a transaction include the wrong amount. For example, if a purchase invoice for £21 is entered as £12, this will result in an incorrect <b>debit</b> <b>entry</b> (to purchases), and an incorrect credit entry (to the relevant creditor account), both for £9 less, so the total of both columns will be £9 less, and will thus balance.|$|E

5000|$|A bank {{transaction}} tax {{is a tax}} levied on <b>debit</b> (and/or credit) <b>entries</b> on bank accounts. In 1989, at the Buenos Aires {{meetings of}} the International Institute of Public Finance, University of Wisconsin-Madison Professor of Economics Edgar L. Feige proposed extending the tax reform ideas of John Maynard Keynes, James Tobin [...] and Lawrence Summers, [...] to their logical conclusion, namely to tax all transactions.. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax (APT tax) proposed taxing the broadest possible tax base at the lowest possible tax rate[...] [...] Since all transactions must ultimately {{be paid for by}} a final means of payment, namely via a transfer from a bank account or by settlement with currency, Feige proposed collecting his tax by levying the tax automatically on the <b>debit</b> and credit <b>entries</b> to bank accounts thereby splitting the tax between the buyer and seller of every transaction. The APT tax is a uniform flat rate tax on all transactions, assessed and collected automatically whenever there is a <b>debit</b> or credit <b>entry</b> to a bank account. As such, it is {{can be viewed as a}} bank transaction tax. Since financial transactions account for the greatest component of the APT tax base, and since all financial transactions are taxed, the proposal eliminates substitution possibilities for evasion and avoidance. The goal of the APT tax is to significantly improve economic efficiency, enhance stability in financial markets, and reduce to a minimum the costs of tax administration (assessment, collection, and compliance costs). The Automated Payment Transaction tax proposal was presented to the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform in 2005. It can be automatically collected by a central counterparty in the clearing or settlement process.|$|R

5000|$|After {{a certain}} period, {{typically}} a month, each column in each journal is totalled {{to give a}} summary for that period. Using the rules of double-entry, these journal summaries are then transferred to their respective accounts in the ledger, or account book. For example, the entries in the Sales Journal are taken and a <b>debit</b> <b>entry</b> is made in each customer's account (showing that the customer now owes us money), and a credit entry might {{be made in the}} account for [...] "Sale of class 2 widgets" [...] (showing that this activity has generated revenue for us). This process of transferring summaries or individual transactions to the ledger is called posting. Once the posting process is complete, accounts kept using the [...] "T" [...] format undergo balancing, which is simply a process to arrive at the balance of the account.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{financial}} transaction is recorded {{in at least}} two different nominal ledger accounts within the financial accounting system, so that the total debits equals the total credits in the General Ledger, i.e. the accounts balance. This is a partial check that each and every transaction has been correctly recorded. The transaction is recorded as a [...] "debit entry" [...] (Dr) in one account, and a [...] "credit entry" [...] (Cr) in a second account. The <b>debit</b> <b>entry</b> will be recorded on the debit side (left-hand side) of a General ledger account, and the credit entry will be recorded on the credit side (right-hand side) of a General ledger account. If the total of the entries on the debit side of one account is greater than the total on the credit side of the same nominal account, that account is said to have a debit balance.|$|E
50|$|In double <b>entry</b> bookkeeping, <b>debits</b> and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers {{to record}} changes in value {{resulting}} from business transactions. Generally speaking, the source {{account for the}} transaction is credited (that is, an entry is made {{on the right side}} of the account's ledger) and the destination account is debited (that is, an entry is made on the left side). Total debits must equal total credits for each transaction; individual transactions may require multiple <b>debit</b> and credit <b>entries</b> to record.|$|R

25|$|In double <b>entry</b> bookkeeping, <b>debits</b> and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers {{to record}} changes in value {{resulting}} from business transactions. Generally speaking, the sources for spending money in transaction account is credit (that is, an entry is {{made on the}} right side of the account's ledger) and what the money obtained with the credits is destined as debit in transaction accounts (that is, an entry is made on the left side). The credits here could be share capital, revenues, etc. and The debits here could be assests, dividends, etc. From a technical point of view the sides refer to the balance sheet placement of accounts. Total debits must equal total credits for each transaction; individual transactions may require multiple <b>debit</b> and credit <b>entries</b> to record.|$|R
2500|$|When medieval Europe moved {{towards a}} {{monetary}} {{economy in the}} 13th century, sedentary merchants depended on bookkeeping to oversee multiple simultaneous transactions financed by bank loans. One important breakthrough took place around that time: the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping, which is defined as any bookkeeping system {{in which there was}} a <b>debit</b> and credit <b>entry</b> for each transaction, or for which the majority of transactions were intended to be of this form. The historical origin of the use of the words [...] "debit" [...] and [...] "credit" [...] in accounting goes {{back to the days of}} single-entry bookkeeping, which had as its chief objective keeping track of amounts owed by customers (debtors) and amounts owed to creditors. Debit in Latin means [...] "he owes" [...] and credit in Latin means [...] "he trusts".|$|R
40|$|Balance of {{payments}} accounts {{are constructed using}} a double-entry accounting principle such that total credits equal total <b>debits.</b> Modelling each <b>entry</b> independently will not guarantee this equality. It is therefore important to identify the counterpart entries or 'accommodating' items that ensure that total credits equal total debits. This short paper identifies the accommodating item for the UK by presenting institutional evidence on the means of payment for international transactions. The paper contributes to the debate about whether the net overseas assets of banks {{are determined by the}} non-bank private sector or by the banks themselves.

40|$|Impact of the Swedish CIP on the Balance of Payments: From {{the balance}} of {{payments}} accounting system point of view, grant CIPs have a neutral effect on the BOP balances. This {{is because of the}} netting-off effect of the <b>debit</b> and credit <b>entries.</b> From the economic point of view, however, grant CIPs {{have a positive impact on}} the BOP. This is because grant CIPs make it possible for a country to import goods and services over and above what the country can afford without increasing its debt obligations. To this extent the Swedish CIP, which is wholly grant, has a positive effect on the BOP to the extent of the actual value of the CIP plus the interest burden that would have been incurred if the CIP were a loan facility. Effects of the CIP on the Broadening and Reorienting of Zimbabwe's Trade Links with Special Reference to Diverting Trade away from South Africa: The effect of the CIP on this particular issue can be viewed in two ways. Firstly, it leads to a widening of the sources of Zimbabwe's imports to include Swedish imports which hitherto were not being sourced from that country. The idea is that the greater the number of trading partners the greater the stability and the more competitive the trade flows. Secondly, it encourages the reorientation of Zimbabwe's imports away from South African sources to Swedish and other sources. This second aspect is in line with the Government's stated policy of endeavouring to de-link from South Africa. With respect to the first view the CIP has managed to do this to the extent that 23 companies out of the 31 in our sample (i. e. 74...|$|R
