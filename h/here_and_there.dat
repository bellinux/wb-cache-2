Not all the singers Manne accompanied were even primarily jazz artists. Performers as diverse as Teresa Brewer, Leontyne Price, Tom Waits, and Barry Manilow included Manne in their recording sessions.|$|E

5|$|There is extant also an epistle of his to the Emperor Philip, {{and another}} to Severa his wife, with several others to {{different}} persons.

5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there.</b> But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
5|$|The {{consciousness}} accelerated until in the 1840s {{two academic}} groups, the Oxford Society and the Cambridge Camden Society both pronounced {{that the only}} suitable style in which to design a church was Gothic. The critic John Ruskin was an ardent advocate of all things medieval and popularised these ideas. The architect Augustus Welby Pugin, who designed mainly for the growing Roman Catholic Church, set himself to recreate not only the structural appearance of medieval churches, but also the richly decorated and colourful interiors that had been almost entirely lost, existing only as a painted screen <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> a few tiled floors such as those at Winchester and Canterbury and the intricate painted wooden ceiling of Peterborough Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> her nostrils twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E
5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there.</b> In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E
