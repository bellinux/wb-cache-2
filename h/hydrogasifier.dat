40|$|A {{technical}} {{assessment of}} the following advanced coal gasification processes is presented: high throughput gasification (HTG) process; single stage high mass flux (HMF) processes; (CS/R) hydrogasification process; and the catalytic coal gasification (CCG) process. Each process is evaluated for its potential to produce synthetic natural gas from a bituminous coal. Key similarities, differences, strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements to each process are identified. The HTG and the HMF gasifiers share similarities with respect to: short residence time (SRT), high throughput rate, slagging, and syngas as the initial raw product gas. The CS/R <b>hydrogasifier</b> is also SRT, but is nonslagging and produces a raw gas high in methane content. The CCG gasifier is a long residence time, catalytic, fluidbed reactor producing all of the raw product methane in the gasifier...|$|E
40|$|This report {{represents}} a technical {{assessment of the}} following advanced coal gasification processes: AVCO High Throughput Gasification (HTG) Process; Bell Single-Stage High Mass Flux (HMF) Process; Cities Service/Rockwell (CS/R) Hydrogasification Process; Exxon Catalytic Coal Gasification (CCG) Process. Each process is evaluated for its potential to produce SNG from a bituminous coal. In addition to identifying the new technology these processes represent, key similarities/differences, strengths/weaknesses, and potential improvements to each process are identified. The AVCO HTG and the Bell HMF gasifiers share similarities with respect to: short residence time (SRT), high throughput rate, slagging and syngas as the initial raw product gas. The CS/R <b>Hydrogasifier</b> is also SRT but is non-slagging and produces a raw gas high in methane content. The Exxon CCG gasifier is a long residence time, catalytic, fluidbed reactor producing all of the raw product methane in the gasifier. The report makes the following assessments: 1) while each process has significant potential as coal gasifiers, the CS/R and Exxon processes are better suited for SNG production; 2) the Exxon process is the closest to a commercial level for near-term SNG production; and 3) the SRT processes require significant development including scale-up and turndown demonstration, char processing and/or utilization demonstration, and reactor control and safety features development...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} an {{integrated energy system}} that combines the production of substitute natural gas through coal hydrogasification with an algae process for beneficial carbon dioxide (CO 2) use and biofuel production (funded under Department of Energy (DOE) contract DE-FE 0001099). The project planned to develop, test, operate and evaluate a 2 ton-per-day coal hydrogasification plant and 25 -acre algae farm at the Arizona Public Service (APS) 1000 Megawatt (MW) Cholla coal-fired power plant in Joseph City, Arizona. Conceptual design of the integrated system was undertaken with APS partners Air Liquide (AL) and Parsons. The process engineering was separated into five major areas: flue gas preparation and CO 2 delivery, algae farming, water management, hydrogasification, and biofuel production. The process flow diagrams, energy and material balances, and preliminary major equipment needs for each major area were prepared to reflect integrated process considerations and site infrastructure design basis. The total project also included research and development on a bench-scale <b>hydrogasifier,</b> one-dimensional (1 -D) kinetic-model simulation, extensive algae stressing, oil extraction, lipid analysis and a half-acre algae farm demonstration at APS?s Redhawk testing facility. During the project, a two-acre algae testing facility with a half-acre algae cultivation area was built at the APS Redhawk 1000 MW natural gas {{combined cycle power plant}} located 55 miles west of Phoenix. The test site integrated flue gas delivery, CO 2 capture and distribution, algae cultivation, algae nursery, algae harvesting, dewatering and onsite storage as well as water treatment. The site environmental, engineering, and biological parameters for the cultivators were monitored remotely. Direct biodiesel production from biomass through an acid-catalyzed transesterification reaction and a supercritical methanol transesterification reaction were evaluated. The highest oil-to-biodiesel conversion of 79. 9 % was achieved with a stressed algae sample containing 40 % algae oil. The effort concluded that producing biodiesel directly from the algae biomass could be an efficient, cost-effective and readily scalable way to produce biodiesel by eliminating the oil extraction process...|$|E
40|$|Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important alternative fuel that can help to achieve a number of national goals related to the reduction of fossil fuels and to the reduction in carbon dioxide emission. RNG can be produced from various carbonaceous materials such as biomass and organic wastes via a gasification process. The CE-CERT steam hydrogasification technology combines hydrogen with steam under pressurized conditions to convert a wet feedstock to a methane enriched syngas which can be upgraded to RNG and used for electric power and as an alternative transportation fuel. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a new process configuration of the steam <b>hydrogasifier</b> (SHR) using a water gas shift (WGS) reactor for the increased production of RNG in an economical manner. The producer gas from the SHR consists of H 2, CH 4, CO, CO 2 and steam. The WGS process converts CO using the existing steam in the product stream from the SHR to H 2 and CO 2. This results in a self-sustainable internal source of hydrogen that can be generated internally and of sufficient quantity to be recycled back to the SHR. In this study, a mixture gas comparable to the composition of the producer gas from the SHR when using biosolids comingled with green waste was used as the input gas to the WGS reactor. A lab-scale WGS reaction system using a commercially available high temperature shift (HTS) catalyst was designed and built. The influence of temperature, space velocity, gas composition and particle size of catalysts on the conversion of CO using this system was investigated. It was found that at optimum conditions approximately 65 % of the CO can be converted using the HTS catalyst operating at 350 o C and atmospheric pressure. The hydrogen produced at this condition was sufficient to be recycled back to the SHR. Also, the overall change of CH 4 production was negligible. A mixture gas containing a wide range of H 2 S was carried out in the shift reactor using a Sour Gas Shift (SGS) catalyst to determine the influence of sulfur impurities. The conversion of the mixture gas with 350 ppm of sulfur was 55 % at the reaction temperature of 450 o C and a space velocity of 2500 h - 1, compared to 65 % with no sulfur. The percent conversion of CO could be improved if the composition of CO 2 was decreased. A larger scale HTS reactor was designed and built using the data from the experiments mentioned above. This was integrated into a bench scale Process Demonstration Unit (PDU) of the SHR with a capacity of 0. 1 TPD of dry feed. This process configuration demonstrated the production of high levels of RNG based for the CE-CERT technology using co-mingled biosolids and woody biomass as the feedstock. The reaction temperature of the SHR and WGS reactor were set at 750 o C and 350 o C, respectively, with an operating pressure at 150 psi. A carbon conversion of 42 % for the SHR and CO conversion of 60 % of WGS were achieved at those conditions. The final product gas contained over 85 % of CH 4 after gas cleanup in which 85 MJ/day or 32. 6 MJ/m 3 of energy was produced. This result clearly shows the viability of the process and provides critical design information to upscale to a pilot facility in the near future...|$|E
