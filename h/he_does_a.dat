5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E

Tusk reveals {{that he has}} been influencing Walker's decisions all along and convinced him to cancel the original agreement, and explains he will influence Walker to nominate Underwood for vice president if <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> favor benefiting Tusk's interests. Underwood counter-proposes to Tusk that they work together to fulfill both their interests, which Tusk accepts. Meanwhile, after Underwood ends their affair, Zoe begins piecing together clues about Underwood's various plots. The season ends when Underwood accepts the nomination for vice president.|$|E

25|$|Back in Hong Kong, Chan's films {{began to}} reach a larger {{audience}} in East Asia, with early successes in the lucrative Japanese market including The Young Master (1980) and Dragon Lord (1982). The Young Master went on to beat previous box office records set by Bruce Lee and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema's top star. With Dragon Lord, he began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences, including the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even these}} {{seemingly}} conciliatory gestures did not quell unease by his critics at his election. Some {{have pointed out}} that he qualified his statements on the constitution with the statement that this is a personal suggestion. Furthermore, it is widely believed in Taiwan that some of these gestures were essentially forced on him again by pressure from the United States and the PRC. The PRC has stated many times that it cares little about what Chen says, but will watch closely {{in the next few months}} to see what <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>a</b> standard sentence that Communist China continues to quote.|$|E

500|$|There {{are fewer}} reviews from {{newspapers}} outside the United Kingdom and United States, but those available are generally positive. Writing for Australia's The Sydney Morning Herald Alexander Downer, {{who served as}} Foreign Minister in the Government of John Howard gave A Journey a favourable review: [...] "His [...] commitment to humanity is sincere and convincing, and his personality infectiously amiable with a delightful sense of self-deprecating humour." [...] Konrad Yakabuski, a senior political writer for Canada's The Globe and Mail was also positive: [...] "If Tony Blair has not continued to agonize over the tough decisions of his prime ministership, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> {{pretty good job of}} persuading otherwise in A Journey." [...] India's English language daily The Hindu said of the book, [...] "It {{is by no means a}} confessional memoir but a brave attempt with only patchy success at self-justification." ...|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik {{wrote of}} Will's Broadway plans that [...] "his ambitions, and guilt over them, make {{a much more}} {{believable}} and compelling conflict than Matthew Morrison has had to convey {{for much of the}} season." [...] VanDerWerff complimented Morrison on his portrayal of Will: [...] "every time the show hands him anything to play that's something that makes vague sense, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> good job with it." [...] Other kudos for the actors were provided by Respers France, who highlighted the [...] "further great acting" [...] seen during [...] "Finn and Quinn's moment in his truck", and E! Online Jenna Mullins, who called the scene where Finn and Kurt help Sue with her sister's room [...] "positively heartbreaking", and the trio of characters [...] "magnificent". Although Canning stated that [...] "Terri leaving lacked much punch", Poniewozik commented that it was [...] "satisfying to see her realized as an adult for once".|$|E
500|$|Containing a vague plot, {{the opening}} scene of the clip {{features}} Usher donning a black tank top and dark jeans, while he stands in a field with the sun rising in the background. While performing t'ai chi-inspired dance moves, he begins to pursue his love interest, and appears shirtless {{in front of a}} black backdrop. [...] Appearing alongside his interest in the backdrop scenes, Usher then sings propped on a concrete wall in a dark alley, while he and the woman tease each other, before moving outside on the balcony of a house on top of mountains. The singer performs acrobatic moves, including one in particular in which <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> pull-up onto the roof to kiss his partner. All previous scenes are intercut before culminating with Usher seducing his partner in bed, in racy moments with Usher in nothing but briefs as he pulls off her stockings.

[...] In addition to a quote from Internet Bookwatch, Columbia University Press advertised Animal Rights Without Liberation with quotes from several academics working {{in the area of}} animal ethics. Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare, both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason. Francione, an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation, was quoted as saying that [...] "It would be an understatement to say that I disagree with Cochrane but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} placed Mars {{at number}} 35 on {{its list of}} 50 Best Live Acts Right Now in 2013; he is the youngest act besides Janelle Mon√†e and Lady Gaga on the list. They wrote: [...] "Anyone {{from the age of}} 5 to 95 can walk out of a Bruno Mars concert feeling like the show was designed just for them. Mars walks the old-school walk and talks the sexy talk, but he also nails the hits, leads a super-energetic nine-piece soul band, and rips a mean drum solo", praising the [...] "spectacular version" [...] of [...] "Gorilla". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described Mars' performance as [...] "entertaining ... keeping smiles plastered on the faces of his onlookers, and <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> better job at it than almost anyone working in music right now". NFL executives Sarah Moll and Tracy Perlman stated that: [...] "If you go to his concerts, it's 11-year-old girls to 65-year-old women‚Äîit's everyone", after seeing The Moonshine Jungle tour several times during the summer of 2013.|$|E
500|$|William Leith of the London Evening Standard was {{impressed}} with the biography, and noted that [...] "the thing about Madonna is not in her sensationalism, it‚Äôs in the fact that how much humane she appeared in the book. Taraborrelli does a fine job of capturing the world's most famous courtesan, in the most infamous way", and John Smyntek from Knight Ridder thought [...] "Taraborrelli [...] retelling all [...] and more. After all, in those 10 years, the Great Woman has had two children, wed and maintained her image as a major pain in the keister. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> great job of bringing forth these unknown facts." [...] Ward Triplet of the Kansas City Star felt that although the book is [...] "an eerie, but compelling day by day account of Madonna, and how she became who she is, sometimes Taraborrelli feels like revealing more about his process of writing than his subject", and Ann O' Neil in the Los Angeles Times complimented the book for being [...] "different" [...] from the [...] "regular dirt written everyday about Madonna." ...|$|E

500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The {{best thing to do is}} just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said that}} [...] "The Break-Up" [...] was [...] "well put together", noting {{that it had}} [...] "ood set ups and good execution" [...] and that it [...] "gave us good comedy" [...] as it had [...] "plenty to work with." [...] In regards to the Liz and Dennis story, he admitted that while it was funny, it was [...] "fairly stereotypical." [...] Canning commented that Jack's relationship with Condoleezza Rice in the episode was a [...] "great concept" [...] and [...] "offered up {{a good number of}} chuckles", although [...] "it never became as clever as it appeared it was going to be." [...] Canning gave the episode a 6.5 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich was complimentary towards the episode, reporting, [...] "Now this is what I'm talking about. Second-tier cast integration, multiple stories going on, intimations that Condoleezza Rice likes phone sex... Another winning week for NBC's 30 Rock." [...] Mitovich enjoyed the fact that Jack was in a relationship with Rice, writing that another show [...] "would build [...] whole episode around them" [...] but that 30 Rock [...] "made it that much funnier by playing it in the background and thus getting to be more outrageous with it." [...] Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that Alec Baldwin [...] "always knocks the ball out of the park on the acting front" [...] but noted that [...] "the best material" [...] in this episode belonged to the Tracy and Toofer story. [...] "The show does have a tendency to telegraph its punchlines, but it was nice to have the two men's differences resolved by finding the funny in a Star Jones/excessive vomiting sketch." [...] Ward was complimentary towards Jane Krakowski, observing that her [...] "comic timing" [...] in [...] "The Break-Up" [...] was [...] "impeccable as usual, but {{it would be nice to}} see her character get a tad more three-dimensional." [...] Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald enjoyed Dean Winters' appearances on the show, citing that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> [...] "hilarious turn" [...] as Dennis, while the Houston Chronicles Mike McDaniel opined that Winters had a [...] "cene-stealing and hilarious role" [...] on the show.|$|E
