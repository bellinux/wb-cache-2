5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – there is no record of how much <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E

Filming was put on a two-month hiatus starting in May 2006 so Radcliffe could sit his A/S Levels and Watson could sit her GCSE exams. The film's budget was reportedly between GB£75 and 100 million (US$150–200 million). The largest budget of the other films in the series has been the £75 million <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> make Goblet of Fire.|$|E
5|$|As {{compensation}} for removing {{the track and}} field sections, the stadium company {{had to pay for}} a new municipal athletics venue at Mørkvedlia. The sales stadium's contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling to build new change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had the same quality as the main pitch. The company was criticized by the municipality in 2002 for not prioritizing this obligation. The NOK170,000 <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> move Grand's club house and build a change room for the artificial field was covered jointly by the municipality, Grand, Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling and one of Glimt's sponsors, Nordland Entreprenør.|$|E

5|$|The {{hill was}} used for 31 tournaments, of which six had to be {{cancelled}} because of wind or snow conditions. The tournaments included the Norwegian Championships in 1973, 1978 and 1983; the Norwegian champions in Balbergbakken were Nils-Per Skarseth (1973) and Per Bergerud (1978 and 1983). A FIS Ski Jumping World Cup race was held on 9 March 1984. It saw Pavel Ploc win ahead of Matti Nykänen and Ernst Vettori. The event drew 5,000 spectators. The World Cup race incurred a large loss, with the organizers only covering half of the NOK260,000 <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> host. The hill record was set by Tom Levorstad in 1981, who reached 130.5meters.

50|$|This {{is a sort}} of a Balanced Scorecard {{approach}} in which KPIs are defined and linkages are built between causes and effects in a tree-model on top of a budgeting system which should be integrated with the transactional system, in which financial, procurement, sales and similar types of transactions are tracked. Moreover, linking resources with results provides information on how much <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> provide a given level of outcome. Many public bodies fail to figure out how much <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> deliver an output, primarily due to problems with indirect cost allocation.

On 20 February 1983, the station was closed for renovation to remove the leaks. At the time, {{it was expected that}} the station could reopen in 1984. The cause of the leaks was a combination of the wrong type of concrete being used and the wrong construction method. These were specified correctly in the tender contracts, but after {{the contractor}} was chosen, an agreement was made between the municipality and Selmer {{for the use of the}} membrane method. Combined with the inferior quality of concrete, the leaks were unavoidable. In 1986, the municipality sued Selmer for the NOK158 million <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> repair the station.|$|E
25|$|The {{women of}} the Methodist Church were {{strongly}} mobilized by the temperance movement. In 1879, a Methodist woman, Frances E.

To this day, the Women's Division of the General Board of Global Missions holds property across on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, which was built using funds provided by laypeople. Women of the church were responsible for 70% of the $650,000 <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> construct the building in 1922. The building was intended to serve as the Methodist Church's social reform presence of the Hill.

A Warner Bros. {{executive}} said he was disappointed with the film's opening and attributed it to its controversial storyline, although Body of Lies fared better than previous pictures about the [...] "war on terrorism" [...] such as Rendition, In the Valley of Elah, and Lions for Lambs, which all performed well below studios' expectations.

500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that American {{automakers}} have been producing E85 flex models motivated by a loophole in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements, that allows for a fuel economy credit for every flex-fuel vehicle sold, whether or not in practice these vehicles are fueled with E85.

The actual cost of the border system was a closely guarded secret, and even today it is uncertain exactly how much <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> build and maintain. The BT-9 watchtowers each cost around 65,000East German marks to build and the expanded metal fences cost around 151,800marks per kilometre.

Yankovic appears as Brad Roberts, and his band appears as {{the other members of}} the Crash Test Dummies; notably, the video also marks the on-screen debut of Yankovic's official keyboardist, Rubén Valtierra, who appears in drag as Ellen Reid. The video was filmed on August 29 and 31, 1994. All of the scenes that took place at the school were filmed during the day at Longfellow Elementary School Auditorium, in Pasadena, California. The scenes at the ice rink were filmed at night in a rink in Paramount, California. According to Yankovic, the crew ran over time and it was a rather expensive video. Yankovic noted that [...] "without giving you the actual number", he could have [...] "recorded two albums, probably, for what <b>it</b> <b>cost</b> <b>to</b> do that one video."
