40|$|AbstractStimulus {{threshold}} and response latencies were measured for electrically elicited retinal ganglion cell responses in retina isolated from <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> normal and retinal degenerate (rd 1) mice. Stimulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell-side in normal retina yielded a significantly lower mean {{threshold and}} shorter latency {{when compared with}} stimulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photoreceptor side in normal retina. <b>The</b> latency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell-side stimulation in normal retina also proved to be significantly shorter than the latency for stimulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell side in rd 1 retina. Thus both the electrode positioning as well as <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retinal tissue {{play a role in}} the stimulating current required to elicit a retinal response...|$|R

40|$|In each <b>ganglion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nerve chain <b>of</b> Eisenia foetida {{there are}} several types of neurosecretory cells. They are {{constant}} in number and strictly localized. A. Toward <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion,</b> <b>the</b> array includes (a) a pair of small cells in the anterior region, and (b) a pair of voluminous elements close to <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> nerve 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion.</b> These two types of cells are characterized by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> secretory granules in the perikaryon and in the axon. B. Between <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> nerves 2 and 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion,</b> there are (c) a pair of cells possessing a large apical vacuole filled with a secretory material, and (d) a dozen cells distinguished by a dense, highly chromophilic cytoplasm. Only <b>the</b> cells <b>of</b> group (b) are present when the worm emerges from the cocoon. <b>The</b> cells <b>of</b> group (a) appear in the young worm. <b>The</b> cells <b>of</b> types (c) and (d) are only active in worms {{on their way to}} sexual maturity. The term "neurosecretory elements", as applied to these different cell types is discussed. © 1966 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Horseradish {{peroxidase}} (HRP) was injected unilaterally {{into the}} {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} or tectum, or both, in 26 hooded rats in order to mark <b>the</b> exact extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retina from which uncrossed optic axons arise.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] is shown that <b>the</b> dorsal <b>ganglion</b> arises as a herniation from the dorsal scapholunate ligament. This herniation increases in size (according to La Place's law) owing to the unidirectional pinchcock effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mucosal folds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duct and <b>the</b> pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlying extensor retinaculum until the distending pressure inside <b>the</b> <b>ganglion</b> equals <b>the</b> overlying tissue pressure. Wrist gangliography, retrograde wrist arthrography, histology and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to prove this conclusively. Bearing the pathogenesis in mind, the best clinical results were obtained by excision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion</b> with 0, 5 cm 2 of dorsal scapholunate ligament and closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal capsule with a 3 / 0 Vicryl purse-string suture. Non-surgical sclerotherapy led to severe inflammation and sepsis and a recurrence rate of 45 %. Conservative therapy is illogical since the communicating duct remains and synovial fluid from the scapholunate joint will cause a reherniation and recurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion.</b> Publisher’s versio...|$|R

40|$|In the catfish retina {{there are}} two types of {{ganglion}} cells: in one type (type A cell) a spot <b>of</b> light at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> its receptive field gives rise to a sustained discharge whereas an annulus gives rise to a transient response, and in the other type (type B cell) the response pattern is reversed for a spot and an annulus. Current injected into the horizontal cell induces spike discharges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell very similar to that elicited by a spot of light or by an annulus. In both types of receptive fields, depolarization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal cell gives rise to a response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell similar to that elicited by a spot of light, whereas hyperpolarization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell gives rise to a response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell similar to that elicited by an annulus. Current through a single injecting electrode could drive two types of cells simultaneously. Interaction between a spot of light and an annulus can also be simulated by replacing one light stimulus by current <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proper polarization injected into the horizontal cells.
