5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E

25|$|In April 2016, a third stamp {{from the}} stolen McCoy block turned up for auction at the Spink USA auction house.

Examination revealed that the stamp came from position 76 in the pane of 100.

25|$|An {{aspect of}} this is pharmacogenomics, which uses an individual’s genome {{to provide a more}} {{informed}} and tailored drug prescription. Often, drugs are prescribed with the idea that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> relatively the same for everyone, but in the application of drugs, {{there are a number of}} factors that must be considered. The detailed account of genetic information from the individual will help prevent adverse events, allow for appropriate dosages, and create maximum efficacy with drug prescriptions. The pharmacogenomic process for discovery of genetic variants that predict adverse events to a specific drug has been termed toxgnostics.|$|E

As he freezes to death, he radios Capa to escape the airlock, decouple the bomb from the ship, and activate it as it plummets into the sun, delivering the payload to its destination. Capa blows the airlock, separates the bomb from the ship, which explodes, and enters the payload, where he finds Cassie. Pinbacker ambushes them, telling them God ordered him to send all humanity to Heaven. As they hurtle into the sun, Capa escapes Pinbacker, reaching the bomb controls.

It can achieve up to eight hours of battery life per charge, with an AC wall adapter or a USB DC charger for recharging. USB chargers are readily available from mobile phone accessory shops. The headset can be used with or without a controller. The headset also produces various beeps to signal different actions and give messages to the user. The headset is also compatible for use with a PC via the Microsoft Wireless Receiver. Up to 4 wireless headsets and wireless controllers can be used in conjunction at any one time. The number lit up on the headset will correspond to the quadrant lit up on the controller..|$|E

He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult {{on all of the}} films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying [...] "James [...] is what makes me think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>work...</b> He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's {{going to be hard for}} [...] to keep up." ...|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan commented that: [...] "the {{two biggest}} musical numbers are tremendously entertaining. They're shot and {{performed}} with verve, {{and they put}} to shame those medleys contestants often perform on the Wednesday edition of American Idol", but again observed: [...] "Whether <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> as a satirical dramedy about the cutthroat social environment of high school is another matter." [...] Of the principal cast, Ryan said: [...] "Casting Matthew Morrison as Will Schuester [...] was a wise move; the actor not only has a sweet voice but a hangdog hopefulness that gives a needed anchor to the show's more satirical elements. Cory Monteith gives quarterback Finn Hudson a jock-ish authority mixed with an appealingly square naivete, and Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character, spoiled diva Rachel Berry, more than a humorless stereotype." [...] She was critical, however, of Gilsig as Terri, calling her [...] "the worst thing about Glee" [...] and opining: [...] "As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell." ...|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>work.</b> John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E
