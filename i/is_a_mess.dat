5|$|We {{did a lot}} of {{recording}} at his house. I'd come by in the morning and Stuart would answer the door in his stocking feet– as he'd been up all night. I'd bring him {{a cup of coffee and}} say, 'Stuart, your house <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess,</b> there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E

It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess.</b> Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E

"In her 'Judas' video, Lady Gaga plays {{fast and}} loose with Catholic iconography, and generates several {{untoward}} statements, but she typically dances on the line without going over it. The faux-baptismal scene is a curious inclusion, as is her apparent fondness for the Jesus character. But if anyone thinks the Catholic League is going to go ballistic over Lady Gaga's latest contribution, they haven't a clue about what really constitutes anti-Catholicism. The video <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess,</b> incoherent, it leaves the viewer more perplexed than moved." ...|$|E

[...] "The show is still tense, still powerful, still amusing. But it doesn't know how to apply those things in its new setting." [...] However, Kaiser concluded that [...] "Veronica Mars <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> right now. But it’s an extremely ambitious mess. I’d watch rather 'ambitious and difficult' than 'boring,' and 'My Big Fat Greek Rush Week' was anything but boring." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B".|$|E

The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess.</b> No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose.

500|$|The {{plot was}} {{considered}} confusing and inappropriately dark. GamesRadar considered it overwrought and [...] "conceptually challenged", and Eurogamer found its voice acting painful and its cutscenes cringe-worthy. Some reviewers unfavorably compared {{the story to}} that of an anime or Final Fantasy. The romance between Sonic and the human Princess Elise was especially criticized; for GamesTM, it marked the point [...] "the [...] series had veered off into absolute nonsense." [...] "This ... <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> from top to bottom", wrote GameSpot, that [...] "only the most blindly reverent Sonic the Hedgehog fan could possibly squeeze any enjoyment out of". IGN said that the game had some redeeming qualities, with brief segments of gameplay that demonstrated how a next-generation Sonic game could work, but found it [...] "rips them away {{as soon as it}} shows them" [...] and concluded that the game failed to reinvent the series. Eurogamer believed that Sonic the Hedgehogs mistakes would have been noticed if the game had been released in 1996.|$|E

[...] Yet I can't think of another artist who expressed more succinctly and beautifully the best aspirations of those years: [...] the flight from war and the machine; the asceticism; the nomadic restlessness; the yearning for sensual cloud-cuckoo-lands; the retreat from public into private obsessions, from the big and noisy to the small and still." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the song}}'s release, Lorde teased the song on her Twitter account, saying [...] the [...] "Green Light" [...] would be [...] "different, and kinda unexpected.

Later that day, in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, she also said: The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks you love the beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little stupid things. It sounds so happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. And I realized I was like, 'how come this thing is coming out so joyous sounding?'

He was heavily {{critical of the}} deception and evasion minigames, and although he thought the Alethiometer gameplay was interesting, he felt its almost wholly optional nature in the game undermined it. He was most critical, however, of the plot; [...] "The story <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> standing on its own [...] The game makes little attempt to portray Pullman's world, instead opting to magpie scenes from the film and career through the story with little concession for the player." [...] Ryan Clements rated the PC version 3.5 out of 10 arguing [...] "the game {{is all over the}} place and pretty much does nothing well." [...] As with Robinson, he was highly critical of the plot, which he argued was incomprehensible unless the player was familiar with the novel or the film. He concluded, [...] "Besides lousy gameplay, The Golden Compass has little else worth mentioning. The graphics, regardless of which system you play on, don't push the hardware at all. The sound is almost never properly synchronized with what's happening on the screen, and the overall presentation is embarrassingly cheap." ...|$|E
2500|$|Naomi's best friend, fallen starlet Adrianna Tate-Duncan, battles a drug addiction. This {{gets her}} into trouble when Harry decides to raid the school, {{thanks to the}} help of a cop, Kimberly McIntyre, under cover as a student. Kimberly begins a {{relationship}} with teacher/lacrosse coach Ryan Matthews, which gets him into trouble with the school. Guilt-ridden, Kimberly does her best to solve the case, giving Ryan his job back, although he takes a leave of absence to rethink his life, and Adrianna lands in rehab, after almost getting Naomi in legal troubles as she took the blame for the drugs. There, she begins a relationship with Navid Shirazi, head of the school's paper and Dixon's best friend, who paid for her rehab. Navid and Adrianna are in completely different groups in high school. Adrianna was much more outgoing and popular while Navid was more focused on his studies. Navid's dream was {{to have an opportunity to}} date Adrianna. Although at first she only does it to [...] "repay" [...] him, they start to genuinely care about each other. Adrianna later discovers she is pregnant as a result of her promiscuity while she was addicted. After telling Navid of her pregnancy, he breaks up with her. It is later revealed that the father of Adrianna's child is Ty, although it is unclear when they slept together. She and Navid get back together when he realizes that even though she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> he can't get over her, and get engaged, although he alienates his family when he tells them that the child is not his and gets upset when Adrianna reveals her daughter is Ty's. Navid's family is very close knit and is in someways conservative. This is only applies to some areas of life, seeing that his dad runs an adult entertainment business.|$|E

Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Last Train to Pariss glittery grooves feel authentically his own." [...] He called Last Train {{a throwback to}} Diddy's 2007 hit single [...] "Last Night". It's the [...] "electro-laced torch duet blown out to full album length". He concluded by saying [...] "the sheer number of cameos overwhelms the narrative conceit after a while... But who really cares? By that time, you just might be enjoying yourself way too much to notice." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News was impressed with Dirty Money's contribution to the album. He said [...] "their input gives the CD a cohesion otherwise disrupted by Diddy's usual conga line of guest stars." [...] He {{pointed out that the}} album takes on a Eurodance sound and although people might see it as [...] "leaping on that bandwagon but as it turns out, the milieu proves a much better fit for his, er, talents, than any CD he has released so far." [...] Farber concluded by saying [...] "The Euro edge gives the music a leg up on the more conservative (read: American) dance music favored by the most mainstream club act of now -- those ever mushy Peas." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent noted Dirty Money's [...] "emphasis on emotion over purely dance imperatives" [...] and dubbed the album [...] "easily the best work Diddy's been involved with in his entire career." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian gave it three out of five stars and stated, [...] "The album <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess,</b> but a hook-heavy, likable one." ...|$|E
