5|$|<b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu</b> (stylized onscreen as <b>Deja</b> <b>Vu</b> without accents) is a 2006 American {{science fiction}} thriller film {{directed}} by Tony Scott, written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The film stars Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Jim Caviezel, Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg and Bruce Greenwood. It involves an ATF agent who travels {{back in time}} in attempts to prevent a domestic terrorist attack {{that takes place in}} New Orleans and to save a woman with whom he falls in love.|$|E
5|$|Other sensory {{abnormalities}} {{include a}} {{distortion of the}} patient's sense of time, for example <b>déjà</b> <b>vu,</b> or a distortion {{of the sense of}} self (depersonalization) or sense of reality (derealization).|$|E
5|$|Visual effects editor Marc Varisco, who had {{previously}} collaborated with director Scott on the 2005 film Domino, worked again with Scott to develop <b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu</b> into a fully-fledged work. In total, approximately 400 visual effects scenes were shot during the production of <b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu.</b> They had acquired a LIDAR device, which incorporated lasers to scatter light {{with the intent of}} mapping out a small region, during the production of Domino; Scott and Varisco decided to use the apparatus again during the production of <b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu.</b> Additionally, the two utilized the Panavision Genesis high definition camera to film the shots that would encompass the past that the Snow White team would peer at throughout the film, as well as the various night scenes. The LIDAR apparatus, which was operated by a hired Texan company devoted to the device, performed scans of Claire Kuchever's apartment, the ferry, the ATF office, and actress Paula Patton, among others. Effects editor Zachary Tucker combined the elements created by the Texan LIDAR company with computer-generated graphics to make possible the scenes of time-travel experienced in the film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu</b> was {{released}} on DVD and home video approximately five months after its release in American theaters, on April 24, 2007. In the two weeks succeeding {{the day of the}} DVD's release, the film was the second most purchased DVD in the United States. It was second only to Night at the Museum during this period in time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu</b> premiered in New York City on November 20, 2006, {{two days}} before its wide release {{in all of the}} United States and Canada. Alongside Mexico, the three {{countries}} were the sole nations to open the film in November. The United Kingdom opened the film on December 15, 2006, and was followed shortly thereafter by New Zealand on December 22. Australia was the last English-speaking country where the film premiered, on January 18, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Locke {{finds the}} polar bear's cave and rescues Eko from the polar bear. While Charlie fetches {{water from a}} stream, Locke apologizes to an {{unconscious}} Eko for his lack of faith. Eko appears to briefly awaken and tells Locke that he must rescue Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Upon arriving at camp, Hurley informs the camp that Jack and the others have been captured. As an explanation, Locke announces to the survivors {{that he plans to}} rescue Jack, Kate, and Sawyer, as Desmond indicated to Hurley earlier. Hurley mentions to Charlie a sense of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu.</b>|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, the Enterprise is caught in a time loop which results in the destruction of the ship and the loss of all hands after a collision with the USS Bozeman. As events re-occur, they begin to feel a sense of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> and upon investigating, realize their predicament. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) realizes how to pass a brief message to himself in the next loop, which allows him to save the ship from destruction.|$|E
5|$|In Apison, Tennessee, {{authorities}} {{receive a}} tip from someone named Sidney alleging child abuse and weapons possession by a local cult called the Temple of the Seven Stars. The FBI and BATF stage a raid on the Temple's compound, but are unable to find its leader, Vernon Ephesian (Michael Massee). Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) experiences <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> and walks into a field on the compound, where he finds a trapdoor. Inside, Mulder and Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) find Ephesian preparing to drink a red liquid with his six wives. Mulder stops them and handcuffs Ephesian, but he feels a strange connection {{to one of the}} wives, Melissa Riedal-Ephesian (Kristen Cloke).|$|E
5|$|At CZW's High Stakes on May 11, 2002, CZW held a Four Way {{match for}} the CZW World Heavyweight and CZW Iron Man Championships, in which then-CZW World Heavyweight Champion Justice Pain and then-Iron Man Champion Adam Flash defended against The Messiah and Mondo. If a {{champion}} was pinned by another competitor, then they lost their championship in the encounter. Mondo ended up pinning Flash to win the Iron Man Championship in the bout. On July 13, 2002 at CZW's <b>Deja</b> <b>Vu,</b> Flash and Pain fought to a double pinfall for the CZW Iron Man and World Heavyweight Championships, which Pain held. Due to the double pinfall, Flash won the Iron Man Championship, while Pain retained the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. <b>Déjà</b> <b>vu,</b> derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> during the poker game and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E
25|$|A 2004 review {{claimed that}} {{approximately}} {{two-thirds of the}} population have had <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> experiences. Other studies confirm that <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> is a common experience in healthy individuals, with between 31% and 96% of individuals reporting it. <b>Déjà</b> <b>vu</b> experiences that are unusually prolonged or frequent, or in association with other symptoms such as hallucinations, may be an indicator of neurological or psychiatric illness.|$|E
25|$|Early {{researchers}} {{tried to}} establish a link between <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> and mental disorders such as anxiety, dissociative identity disorder and schizophrenia but failed to find correlations of any diagnostic value. There {{does not seem to}} be a special association between <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> and schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Memory-based {{explanations}} {{may lead}} {{to the development of a}} number of non-invasive experimental methods by which a long sought-after analogue of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> can be reliably produced that would allow it to be tested under well-controlled experimental conditions. Cleary suggests that <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> may be a form of familiarity-based recognition (recognition that is based on a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past) and that laboratory methods of probing familiarity-based recognition hold promise for probing <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> in laboratory settings.|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} <b>déjà</b> <b>vu.</b> Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> {{experiences}} {{are unlikely to be}} pathological dissociative experiences.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{operator}} of strip clubs internationally is <b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu,</b> which has over 130 locations worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{phenomena}} include <b>Déjà</b> <b>vu</b> (Already seen), Jamais vu (Never Seen), and Déjà entendu (Already Heard).|$|E
25|$|Loans of multi-word phrases, {{such as the}} English use of the French term <b>déjà</b> <b>vu,</b> {{are known}} as adoptions, adaptations, or lexical borrowings.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory of}} <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> {{attributes}} {{the feeling of}} having previously seen or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or place, and forgetting about it until {{one seems to be}} mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{study that}} used virtual reality {{technology}} to study reported <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> experiences supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and {{the layout of}} a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) {{may contribute to the}} <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> experience. When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.|$|E
25|$|It {{was a case}} of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> when Blackpool {{went into}} the final game of the season, at Lincoln City, needing a solitary point for promotion. Again, they buckled under the {{pressure}} and lost 2–0, and the play-offs would decide their immediate future once more.|$|E
25|$|With the {{advancement}} of the internet, there are now several tools available {{to aid in the}} detection of plagiarism and multiple publication within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Dr. Harold Garner's laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas is <b>Déjà</b> <b>vu,</b> an open-access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication. All of the entries in the database were discovered through the use of text data mining algorithm eTBLAST, also created in Dr. Garner's laboratory. The creation of <b>Déjà</b> <b>vu</b> and the subsequent classification of several hundred articles contained therein have ignited much discussion in the scientific community concerning issues such as ethical behavior, journal standards, and intellectual copyright. Studies on this database have been published in journals such as Nature and Science, among others.|$|E
25|$|The venue {{was moved}} to <b>Deja</b> <b>Vu,</b> another venue in Chicago that Saturday. Members of Anti-Racist Action began to gather at the venue. The concert was {{cancelled}} by the venue owners just before it was scheduled to begin, due to violence between Anti-Racist Action and fans of Death in June.|$|E
25|$|Often {{described}} as the opposite of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu,</b> jamais vu involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing {{that he or she}} has been in the situation before. Jamais vu is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. Jamais vu is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday August 20, 2013, the Lusty Lady in San Francisco {{announced}} that it would close its doors for business in just two weeks, on Monday at 3:00a.m. September 2, 2013. The landlord, Roger Forbes (part of <b>Deja</b> <b>Vu</b> Consulting Inc. which by that time owned almost every strip club in San Francisco with the exception of Crazy Horse, Mitchell Brothers O’Farrell Theatre, and Nob Hill) refused to renew the lease after attempts to re-negotiate the rent failed.|$|E
25|$|The spans {{have been}} a {{favorite}} of movie production crews as the CCC is an iconic part of the skyline of the city. The HOV lanes are frequently used for filming, as they are not heavily used and are separated from normal traffic by barrier walls. Both spans were briefly closed on April 9, 2006, to allow filming with stunts and pyrotechnics for the Denzel Washington film <b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu.</b> The spans also served as the anchor for the background {{in most of the}} outdoor scenes in the film A Love Song for Bobby Long.|$|E
25|$|Next for Scott came Domino (2005) {{starring}} Keira Knightley. In autumn 2006, Scott reteamed with Denzel Washington for the sci-fi action film <b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu.</b> Scott {{once again}} {{teamed up with}} Denzel Washington on The Taking of Pelham 123, which also starred John Travolta and was released in cinemas on 12 June 2009. The film was a remake of the 1974 film of the same title. 2009 also saw the debut of The Good Wife, a legal drama television series which had Scott and his brother as two of several executive producers.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital {{proposed}} that <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> {{is caused by}} dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals {{is done in the}} temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe twice before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron {{proposed that}} if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.|$|E
25|$|Anthony David Leighton Scott (21 June 1944 – 19 August 2012) was an English film {{director}} and producer. His films {{come from a}} broad range of genres, including the action drama Top Gun (1986), action comedy Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), auto racing film Days of Thunder (1990), action comedy The Last Boy Scout (1991), romantic dark comedy crime film True Romance (1993), submarine action film Crimson Tide (1995), psychological thriller The Fan (1996), spy thriller Enemy of the State (1998), spy film Spy Game (2001), action thriller Man on Fire (2004), sci-fi action thriller <b>Déjà</b> <b>Vu</b> (2006), thriller The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009), and the action thriller Unstoppable (2010).|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} diacritical marks, {{a number of}} (usually French) loanwords are {{sometimes}} spelled in English with an acute accent as used in the original language: these include attaché, blasé, canapé, cliché, communiqué, café, décor, <b>déjà</b> <b>vu,</b> détente, élite, entrée, exposé, mêlée, fiancé, fiancée, papier-mâché, passé, pâté, piqué, plié, repoussé, résumé, risqué, sauté, roué, séance, naïveté, toupée and touché. Retention of the accent is common only in the French ending é or ée, as in these examples, where its absence would tend to suggest a different pronunciation. Thus the French word résumé is commonly seen in English as , with only one accent (but also with both or none).|$|E
25|$|After the Soviet {{occupation}} of Bessarabia in 1940, Romanians went to <b>deja</b> <b>vu,</b> they came again in colonial power of Russians. The Romanian population of Bessarabia was persecuted by Soviet authorities on ethnic grounds, {{especially in the}} years following the annexation, based mostly on social, educational, and political grounds; because of this, Russification laws were imposed again on Romanian population. The Moldovan language introduced during the Interwar period by the Soviet authorities first in the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and after 1940 taught in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, was actually the Romanian language but written with a version of the Cyrillic script derived from the Russian alphabet. Proponents of Cyrillic orthography argue that the Romanian language was historically written with the Cyrillic script, albeit a different version of it (see Moldovan alphabet and Romanian Cyrillic alphabet for a discussion of this controversy).|$|E
25|$|Dmitri Shostakovich {{entered the}} Petrograd Conservatory at age 13, {{becoming}} the youngest student there. He studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev and composition with Rimsky-Korsakov's son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg. He {{proved to be}} a disciplined, hard-working student. Glazunov may have recognized in Shostakovich an echo of his younger self. He carefully monitored his progress in Steinberg's class and, in awarding him his doctorate, recommended Shostakovich for a higher degree which normally would have led to a professorship. Due to his family's financial hardship, Shostakovich was not {{able to take advantage of}} this opportunity. Glazunov also arranged for the premiere of Shostakovich's First Symphony, which took place on 12 March 1926 with the Leningrad Philharmonic under Nikolai Malko. This was 44 years after Glazunov's First Symphony had first been presented in the same hall. In another instance of <b>déjà</b> <b>vu</b> with Glazunov's early life, the symphony caused almost as much of a sensation as the appearance of the 19-year-old Shostakovich on the stage awkwardly taking his bow.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, Styles {{returned}} to International Wrestling Cartel (IWC) and successfully challenged IWC Super Indy Champion Super Hentai for the title. On April 13, Styles defended the title in a rematch against Hentai, but the match {{ended in a}} no contest, meaning Styles retained the title. On May 10, Styles vacated the title. On August 23, Styles unsuccessfully challenged new Super Indy Champion Colt Cabana after the match ended at a twenty-minute time limit draw, meaning Cabana retained the title. On December 12 at IWC: Call to Arms, Styles would once again challenge Cabana for the title, but again was unsuccessful. On April 12, Styles debuted in Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), competing at the promotions 3rd Best of the Best event. Styles teamed with Jason Cross to face Jay Briscoe and Jimmy Rave, in a losing effort. On July 20, at CZW: <b>Deja</b> <b>Vu</b> II, Styles successfully defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Rave.|$|E
25|$|Recognition {{memory is}} {{sometimes}} {{divided into two}} functions by neuroscientists: familiarity and recollection. A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of <b>deja</b> <b>vu.</b> The temporal lobe, in particular the perirhinal cortex, responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected {{with the sense of}} familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar. Specifically, stimulation at 30–40Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; but it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones — they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.|$|E
