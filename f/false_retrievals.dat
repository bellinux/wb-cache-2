40|$|The {{field of}} image {{retrieval}} and mining {{has become a}} vibrant research area due to speedy enhancement in the volume of digital image databases. Nowadays, {{a large portion of}} information is in visual form; it is essential and certainly pleasing to search for images by content. Image mining has a variety of applications in various sectors like medical diagnosis, biology, remote sensing, space research, etc. This research is to determine the exact images while mining an image (multimedia) database and proposes a novel approach for mining images using LIM based image matching technique with neural networks. This process is independent of too many parameter setting to generate a robust solution. It is designed and implemented on MATLAB and is tested with the images of various databases. Appropriate measures were devised to evaluate the performance of the system. The performances of the LIM based image matching technique results were noteworthy and comparable. While comparing with the number of <b>false</b> <b>retrievals</b> with the correct retrievals, the anticipated system performance level will be suited for several simple day to day multimedia database applications and image mining systems. The image mining system derived from the LIM based image matching technique provided promising results...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : Scientometric {{methods and}} the {{resulting}} citations have been applied to investigate the scientific performance of a nation. The present {{study was designed to}} collect the statistical information of dental articles by Iranian authors published in PubMed. Materials and Methods: We searched the PubMed database for dental articles of Iranian authors until June 31, 2015. All abstracts were manually reviewed in order to exclude <b>false</b> <b>retrievals.</b> The number of articles per dental subspecialties, distribution of research designs, Scopus/Google Scholar citation of each article, number of authors and affiliation of the first/corresponding author were extracted and transferred to Microsoft Excel. The data were further analyzed to illustrate the related scientometric indicators. Results: A total of 3, 835 articles were retrieved according to the selection criteria. The number of PubMed-indexed publications between 2008 and 2015 showed a seven-fold increase. The majority of articles were written by four authors (24. 56 %). Systematic reviews and clinical trials constituted 9. 20 % of all publications. The number and percentage of articles with ≥ 4 citations from Google Scholar (n= 2024; 52. 78 %) were higher than those from Scopus (n= 1015; 26. 47 %). According to affiliated departments of the first authors, the top three dental subspecialties with the highest number of publications belonged to endodontics (19. 82 %), orthodontics (11. 13 %) and oral and maxillofacial surgery (10. 33 %). Moreover, the majority of articles originated from Shahid Beheshti- (14. 47 %), Tehran- (13. 72 %) and Mashhad- (12. 28 %) University of Medical Sciences.   Conclusions: Analysis of PubMed-indexed dental publications originating from Iran revealed a growing trend in the recent years.

40|$|Objectives: Research {{activities}} are promoted {{at the government}} and the institutional levels in Oman. However, {{the quantity and quality of}} research conducted in various institutes of Oman has not been measured. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the quantity and quality of biomedical publications emanating from Oman over the last five years (2005 - 2009). Methods: Data regarding the biomedical publications of Omani origin published from January 2005 to December 2009 were retrieved from Pubmed. All abstracts were manually checked to exclude <b>false</b> <b>retrievals.</b> The journal impact factor (IF) for 2008 was applied for every publication. Full-length original articles, review articles and publications mentioning new research methods/new technique were assigned full IF of the journal. However, half of the journal IF were assigned to correspondences/commentaries, case reports/series and short communications. Results: Of biomedical publications, 752 were retrieved from Pubmed and 519 publications were included for final analysis after excluding false positives. The number of biomedical publications steadily increased over the last five years, but it was not statistically significant. Original research articles constituted more than half (54. 3 %) of all the publications, followed by case reports/series (30. 1 %). Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) contributed more than half of the biomedical publications (51. 5 %), followed by the Ministry of Health (MoH), which contributed 38 % of the publications. Interestingly, the mean IF of the publications was not significantly different throughout the years. Conclusions: The number of publications emanating from Oman increased over the last five years; however, the quality of research has not improved. Furthermore, the research in Oman is mainly conducted by the government-run institutions and there is hardly any contribution from the private institutions...|$|E
40|$|We {{sometimes}} vividly remember {{things that}} did not happen, a phenomenon with general relevance, {{not only in the}} courtroom. It is unclear to what extent individual differences in false memories are driven by anatomical differences in memory-relevant brain regions. Here we show in humans that microstructural properties of different white matter tracts as quantified using diffusion tensor imaging are strongly correlated with true and <b>false</b> memory <b>retrieval.</b> To investigate these hypotheses, we tested a large group of participants in a version of the Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm (recall and recognition) and subsequently obtained diffusion tensor images. A voxel-based whole-brain level linear regression analysis was performed to relate fractional anisotropy to indices of true and false memory recall and recognition. True memory was correlated to diffusion anisotropy in the inferior longitudinal fascicle, the major connective pathway of the medial temporal lobe, whereas a greater proneness to retrieve false items was related to the superior longitudinal fascicle connecting frontoparietal structures. Our results show that individual differences in white matter microstructure underlie true and false memory performance...|$|R
30|$|Color {{does not}} only add beauty to images/video but {{provides}} {{more information about}} the scene. This information is used as the feature for retrieving the images. Various color-based image search schemes have been proposed, some of these are discussed in this section. Swain and Ballard [6] introduced the concepts of color histogram feature and the histogram intersection distance metric to measure the distance between the histograms of the images. The global color histogram is extensively utilized for the purpose of retrieval which gives probability of occurrences of each unique color in the image on a global platform. It is a fast method and has translation, rotation and scale invariant property, but it suffers from lack of spatial information which yields <b>false</b> <b>retrieval</b> results. Stricker et al. [7] proposed two new color indexing schemes. In the first approach they have used the cumulative color histogram. In the second method instead of storing the complete color distributions, first three moments of each color space of image are used. Idris and Panchanathan [8] have used the vector quantization technique to compress the image and from codeword of each image, they obtained the histogram of codewords which was used as the feature vector. In the same manner, Lu et al. [9] proposed a feature for color image retrieval by employing the combination of discrete cosine transform (DCT) and vector quantization technique. A well known image compression method i.e. block truncation coding (BTC) method is proposed in [10] for extracting two features i.e. block color co-occurrence matrix (BCCM) and block pattern histogram (BPH). Image descriptors are also generated with the help of vector quantization technique. Global histogram also suffers from spatial information. In order to overcome this problem Hauang et al. [11] proposed a color correlogram method which includes the local spatial color distribution of color information for image retrieval. Pass and Zabih [12] proposed the color coherence vectors (CCV) where a histogram based approach incorporates some spatial information. Rao et al. [13] proposed the modification in color histogram to achieve the spatial information and for this purpose they proposed three spatial color histograms : annular, angular and hybrid color histograms. Chang et al. [14] proposed a method which takes care of change in color due to change of illumination, the orientation of the surface, and the viewing geometry of the camera with less feature vector length as compared to color correlogram.|$|R
40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Trichodesmium spp. can be {{an important}} ecological and biogeochemical component for both the coastal and open ocean ecosystems by way of its nitrogen fixation ability. However, information regarding its spatial and temporal distribution remains sparse. Trichodesmium has unique optical properties that should allow for its spectral signature to be detectable in satellite ocean color data sets. Here, a global data set of concurrent measurements of Trichodesmium abundance and radiometric reflectance was compiled and used to develop bio-optical models for Trichodesmium. The most robust global model related the water-leaving radiance signal to the identification of an occurrence of a Trichodesmium bloom above a threshold value of 3200 trichomes L− 1. Using the in situ data set, this model is trained to successfully predict Trichodesmium blooms (∼ 92 %) while minimizing <b>false</b> positive <b>retrievals</b> (∼ 16 % of nonbloom observations). A validation of the approach applied to Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color imagery shows that the model correctly predicts 76 % of the bloom occurrences of an independent validation data set of in situ Trichodesmium observations. Ultimately, maps of Trichodesmium bloom occurrence will provide a means of addressing the ecology of Trichodesmium and its contribution to new production of the world oceans...|$|R
30|$|Several {{theoretical}} positions concerning human memory {{suggest that}} when people generate an answer that they assert with confidence to be true, they have no knowledge over and above those feelings of confidence of whether their answer is, in actuality, true or not. However, {{there is always the}} possibility that the ratings are made impulsively and could be made more accurately upon further deliberation (e.g., Buratti, Allwood, & Kleitman, 2013; Koriat, Lichtenstein, & Fischhoff, 1980). However, aside from the possibility that there might be some latent knowledge that the person could theoretically tap into when making a judgment, stated confidence is taken to be a straightforward reflection of subjective knowledge. If true and <b>false</b> <b>retrievals</b> from memory are not distinguishable, and our evaluation of or confidence in the correctness of our answers is based on heuristics that should apply equally for right and wrong retrievals, then the correction of errors given true feedback may be indistinguishable from the updating of correct answers by false feedback. If this is the case, then individuals may show the same confidence-related hyper'correction' to feedback when they had been correct just as they do when they were incorrect. On the other hand, while confidence may be highly associated with prior knowledge, other factors may could influence how a person responds to feedback and updates memory. For example, if they have some additional knowledge beyond their stated confidence, or if underlying memory structures are different for correct vs. incorrect responses or for true or false feedback, then they might show a different pattern of confidence-related memory updating. It is this basic idea that we test in the five experiments that follow. We investigate this question through the lens of the so-called hypercorrection effect, a phenomenon that is characteristic of the correction of high-confidence errors.|$|E
40|$|A {{signature}} file organization, called the weight-partitioned {{signature file}}, for supporting document ranking is proposed. It employs multiple signature files, {{each of which}} corresponds to one term frequency, to represent terms with different term frequencies. Words with the same term frequency in a document are grouped together and hashed into the signature file corresponding to that term frequency. This eliminates the need to explicitly record the term frequency for each word. We investigate the effect of <b>false</b> drops on <b>retrieval</b> effectiveness {{if they are not}} eliminated in the search process. We have shown that false drops introduce insignificant degradation on precision and recall when the false drop probability is below a certain threshold. This is an important result since false drop elimination could become the bottleneck in systems using fast signature file search techniques. We perform an analytical study on the performance of the weight-partitioned signature file un [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Memory {{research}} has been guided by two powerful metaphors: the storehouse (computer) and the correspondence metaphor. The latter emphasizes the dependability of retrieved mnemonic information and draws upon ideas about the state dependency and reconstructive character of episodic memory. We used a new movie to unveil the neural correlates connected with retrieval, monitoring and control processes, and memory accuracy (MAC), according to the paradigm of Koriat and Goldsmith (1996 a, b). During functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects performed a memory task which required (after an initial learning phase) rating true and <b>false</b> statements (<b>retrieval</b> phase, RP), making confidence judgments in the respective statement (monitoring phase, MP) and deciding for either venturing (volunteering) the respective answer or withholding the response (control phase, CP). Imaging data pointed to common and unique neural correlates. Activations in brain regions related to RP and MAC were observed in the precuneus, middle temporal gyrus and left hippocampus. MP was associated with activation in the left anterior and posterior cingulate cortex along with bilateral medial temporal regions. If an answer was volunteered (as opposed to being withheld) during the CP, temporal and frontal as well as middle and posterior cingulate areas and the precuneus revealed activations. Increased bilateral hippocampal activity was found during withholding compared to volunteering answers. The left caudate activation detected during withholding compared to venturing an answer supports {{the involvement of the}} left caudate in inhibiting unwanted responses. Contrary to expectations, we did not evidence prefrontal activations during withholding (as opposed to volunteering) answers). This may reflect our design specifications, but alternative interpretations are put forth...|$|R
40|$|Task {{unrelated}} thought (TUT) {{refers to}} thought {{directed away from}} the current situation, for example a daydream. Three experiments were conducted on healthy participants, with two broad aims. First, to contrast distributed and encapsulated views of cognition by comparing the encoding of categorical and random lists of words (Experiments One and Two). Second, to examine the consequences of experiencing TUT during study on the subsequent retrieval of information (Experiments One, Two, and Three). Experiments One and Two demonstrated lower levels of TUT {{and higher levels of}} word-fragment completion whilst encoding categorical relative to random stimuli, supporting the role of a distributed resource in the maintenance of TUT. In addition the results of all three experiments suggested that experiencing TUT during study had a measurable effect on subsequent retrieval. TUT was associated with increased frequency of <b>false</b> alarms at <b>retrieval</b> (Experiment One). In the subsequent experiments TUT was associated with no advantage to retrieval based on recollection, by manipulating instructions at encoding (Experiment Two), and/or at retrieval (Experiment Three). The implications of the results of all three experiments are discussed in terms of recent accounts of memory retrieval and conscious awareness...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the distinctiveness of gene regulatory networks in CA 1 {{associated with the}} extinction of contextual fear memory (CFM) after recall using Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2. 0 Arrays. These data were compared to previously published retrieval and reconsolidation-attributed, and consolidation datasets. A stringent dual normalization and pareto-scaled orthogonal partial least-square discriminant multivariate analysis together with a jack-knifing-based cross-validation approach was used on all datasets to reduce <b>false</b> positives. Consolidation, <b>retrieval</b> and extinction were correlated with distinct patterns of gene expression 2 hours later. Extinction-related gene expression was most distinct from the profile accompanying consolidation. A highly specific feature was the discrete regulation of neuroimmunological gene expression associated with retrieval and extinction. Immunity-associated genes of the tyrosine kinase receptor TGF beta and PDGF, and TNF families' characterized extinction. Cytokines and proinflammatory interleukins of the IL- 1 and IL- 6 families were enriched with the no-extinction retrieval condition. We used comparative genomics to predict transcription factor binding sites in proximal promoter regions of the retrieval-regulated genes. Retrieval that {{does not lead to}} extinction was associated with NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression. We confirmed differential NF-kappa Bp 65 expression, and activity in all of a representative sample of our candidate genes in the no-extinction condition. The differential regulation of cytokine networks after the acquisition and retrieval of CFM identifies the important contribution that neuroimmune signalling plays in normal hippocampal function. Further, targeting cytokine signalling upon retrieval offers a therapeutic strategy to promote extinction mechanisms in human disorders characterised by dysregulation of associative memory...|$|R
40|$|International audience"Travelling in time," {{a central}} feature of episodic memory is {{severely}} affected among individuals with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with two opposite effects: vivid traumatic memories are unorganized in temporality (bottom-up processes), non-traumatic personal memories tend to lack spatio-temporal details and false recognitions occur more frequently {{that in the}} general population (top-down processes). To test the effect of these two types of processes (i. e. bottom-up and top-down) on emotional memory, we conducted two studies in healthy and traumatized adolescents, a period of life in which vulnerability to emotion is particularly high. Using negative and neutral images selected from the international affective picture system (IAPS), stimuli were divided into perceptual images (emotion generated by perceptual details) and conceptual images (emotion generated by the general meaning of the material). Both categories of stimuli were then used, along with neutral pictures, in a memory task with two phases (encoding and recognition). In both populations, we reported a differential effect of the emotional material on encoding and recognition. Negative perceptual scenes induced an attentional capture effect during encoding and enhanced the recollective distinctiveness. Conversely, the encoding of conceptual scenes was similar to neutral ones, but the conceptual relatedness induced <b>false</b> memories at <b>retrieval.</b> However, among individuals with PTSD, two subgroups of patients were identified. The first subgroup processed the scenes faster than controls, except for the perceptual scenes, and obtained similar performances to controls in the recognition task. The second subgroup group desmonstrated an attentional deficit in the encoding task with no benefit from the distinctiveness associated with negative perceptual scenes on memory performances. These findings provide a new perspective on how negative emotional information may have opposite influences on memory in normal and traumatized individuals. It also gives clues to understand how intrusive memories and overgeneralization takes place in PTSD...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} of opponent processes describes {{the interaction between}} verbatim and gist processes in creating true and false memories. Whereas true memory is supported by both verbatim and gist processes, false memory is supported by gist processes and suppressed by verbatim processes. In other words, verbatim and gist processes work in opposition to one another {{when it comes to}} false memories. [...] Suppose, for example, that one is presented with a word list such as lemon, apple, pear, and citrus. During a recognition test, the items lemon (target), orange (related distractor), and fan (unrelated distractor) are shown. In this case, retrieval of a gist trace (fruits) supports acceptance of both test probes lemon (true memory) and orange (<b>false</b> memory), whereas <b>retrieval</b> of a verbatim trace (lemon) only supports acceptance of the test probe lemon. In addition, retrieval of an exclusory verbatim trace ("I saw only the words lemon, apple, pear, and citrus") suppresses acceptance of false but related items such as orange through an operation known as recollection rejection. If neither verbatim nor gist traces are retrieved, then one might accept any test probe on the basis of response bias.This principle {{plays a key role in}} FTT's explanation of experimental dissociations between true and false memories (e.g., when a variable affects one type of memory without affecting the other, or when it produces opposite effects on them). The time of exposure of each word during study and the number of repetitions have been shown to produce such dissociations. More specifically, while true memory follows a monotonically increasing function when plotted against presentation duration, false memory rates exhibit an inverted-U pattern when plotted as a function of presentation duration. Similarly, repetition is monotonically related to true memory (true memory increases as a function of the number of repetitions) and is non-monotonically related to false memory (repetition produces an inverted-U relation with false memory).|$|R
40|$|Cognitively speaking, {{repetition}} {{can work}} as a facilitator for both the planning and the understanding of spoken language. It can {{work as a}} cohesive and interactive device or, at a higher-level function of discourse, to engage in interaction by creating interpersonal involvement: repetition always conveys altered meaning, as {{it has to be}} re-interpreted by the interlocutor “in light of the accretion, juxtaposition, or expansion” (Tannen 2007 : 62). Repetition is thus useful for the building of shared representation and organization of discourse, especially in the elderly’s speech where it may serve as a glue to engage in social interaction (Davis & Maclagan 2014). In this line, the aim of our talk is to determine whether self-repetitions fulfill a specific function in the elderly’s discourse. To reach this goal, corpus-based analyses will be carried out based on multimodal (audio and video) data taken from CLARe’s corpora (Corpora for Language and Aging Research) consisting of face-to-face conversations in French, between a young adult and a very old speaker. First, we will give an overview of the types of verbatim self-repetitions (affirmation/negation, <b>false</b> starts, word <b>retrieval,</b> anaphors, intensifiers/mitigators), comparing older and younger people’s speech (CLARe corpora vs. C-ORAL-ROM and VALIBEL corpora). We will then have {{a closer look at the}} role of prosody in the discourse of elderly speakers (LangAge/CLARe corpus). It has been evidenced that prosody plays an important role for the interpretation of repetitions (Couper-Kuhlen 1996; Curl, Local & Walker 2006). While this was examined for dialogues, we will focus here on monological sequences of verbatim self-repetitions with a personal meaning (e. g., et qu'on avait faim et qu'on avait faim ‘we suffered from hunger’). The phonetic-prosodic analysis shows that there are minimal differences in the original and the repeated elements, which leads us to argue that the repetitions reinforce the position of the speaker, instead of contributing to the (dialogical) discursive flow of the interaction. Next, the multimodal approach will explore the function of repetition in gestures (CorpAGEst/CLARe corpus). In line with form-based approaches to gesture (Müller, Bressem & Ladewig 2013), relations that exist between speech and nonverbal resources (including hand gestures, facial displays, gaze, head, and shoulders) will be investigated. We will highlight recurrent cases combining repeated word-sequences and clusters of nonverbal parameters (e. g., l’amour ‘love’ [gaze towards the interlocutor, eyebrows raising, wide opening of the eyes] / en un mot l’amour surtout ‘in one word love above all’ [repeated head turns] / l’amour ‘love’ [repeated head turns, head leaning]). The focus will thus be on self-repetitions that have an expressive or a self-adapting function (Ekman & Friesen 1972 : 382), which are linked to the affective and intimate component of communication. Such prosodic and gestural phenomena, which contribute to the subjective expression of the self and to the speaker’s stance taking in discourse (Du Bois 2007) will give new insight in the way elderly people actually engage in dialogues in a context-sensitive manner...|$|R
