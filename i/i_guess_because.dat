In the Italian Tour, which ended suddenly by Mrs. Sterling's illness recalling him, he had missed Naples; a loss which he always thought to be considerable; and which, from time to time, he had formed little projects, failures hitherto, for supplying. The rigors of spring were always dangerous to him in England, {{and it was always}} of advantage to get out of them: and then the sight of Naples, too; this, always a thing to be done some day, was now possible. Enough, with the real or imaginary hope of bettering himself in health, and the certain one of seeing Naples, and catching a glance of Italy again, he now made a run thither. It was not long after Calvert's death. The Tragedy of Strafford lay finished in his desk. Several things, sad and bright, were finished. A little intermezzo of ramble was not unadvisable.|$|E

5000|$|Lee was undisputed {{first choice}} {{back in the}} Championship and made 41 {{appearances}} during the 2007-08 season, though Watford fell to Hull City in the playoff semi-finals. In Jay DeMerit's absence, manager Aidy Boothroyd also made Lee captain for a period. Save for a run of 11 matches from September through to November 2008, Lee spent the 2008-09 season battling with Mart Poom for the position of second-choice goalkeeper behind Scott Loach. He signed a new one-year contract extension in May 2009, but spent the entire 2009-10 season behind Scott Loach, making just two League Cup appearances in August 2009. Lee turned down the offer of a new contract and departed Watford on 31 May 2010, having made 110 appearances in eight years as a first team player with the club. In 2015, Lee stated that failure {{to be seen as}} a consistent first-choice at Watford was down to being [...] "seen as a good back up. I backed up Alec Chamberlain and he won player of the season, I backed up Ben Foster and he won an England cap, I backed up Scott Loach and he got an England cap. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>because</b> I never kicked up much of a fuss and I wanted those guys to do well it didn't help my cause".|$|E

5000|$|Having grouped over 75 songs, {{recording}} with Nathan Chapman, {{who produced}} {{all but one}} song on Taylor Swift, commenced soon after having completed touring with Strait; in the process, Swift made her record producing debut. Thereon, she and Chapman recorded and cut an abundance of songs to keep the best material on the album. Thirteen tracks were planned due to Swift's fondness for the number; she considers it to be her lucky number. To aid her in choosing the songs, Swift performed various new tracks - [...] "Permanent Marker", [...] "Missing You", [...] "I'd Lie", [...] "Sparks Fly", and [...] "Fearless" [...] - at the Gold Country Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 29 and May 30, 2007; only the latter song was chosen for the album. By January 2008, Swift had recorded {{approximately half of the}} songs that would remain on the final cut of Fearless. The remainder of the songs resulted from the last two recording sessions: one held in March 2008, the other held sometime in the summer of 2008. When asked to describe the album, Swift commented, [...] "It's the same kind of album I made (in 2006) - just two years older. Sound-wise, it's the kind of songs I like to write, which are country songs, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>because</b> of the subject matter and because of some of the melodies I love to use, I guess they have crossover appeal." ...|$|E

5000|$|In September 1997, Hamsher {{published}} the controversial memoir Killer Instinct recounting her {{experiences as a}} producer of Natural Born Killers. The L.A. Times said the book is [...] "chock-full of outrageous firsthand tales."

Hamsher charges that he betrayed her and Murphy by going behind their backs {{to keep them from}} making Natural Born Killers. She also calls Tarantino a 'one-trick pony,' a wildly overrated director." [...] Hamsher included a full-page reproduction of a suggestive note Tarantino allegedly sent her at the Venice Film Festival. On his website, Murphy says that when Tarantino's former manager, Cathryn Jaymes, [...] "came back with her notes the manuscript my then partner lost it on her, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>because</b> she didn't want to make changes. There are many reasons why our partnership ended soon after that book, but her treatment of Cathryn was a major factor." [...] Killer Instinct reached number two on the L.A. Times bestseller list. Hamsher was later sued by an attorney who is described in the book as a [...] "creepazoid attorney," [...] "the Kmart Johnnie Cochran" [...] and [...] "a loser wannabe lawyer."

[...] sample repeated throughout the song is the scat portion of the original song's refrain. Shaw had the following to say about it:When it first happened, and the Mushroom Jazz people contacted me from San Francisco, I was kind of excited about it. But then, once I actually HEARD it, my first reaction was 'Oh my goodness! How in the world can I possibly stand onstage and sing those same notes, and those same lyrics, over and over again?'! You know, 'I'm the one who had your babies - ha-ha-ha-ha'! I mean, it’s different when it's being recorded and you're just pushing the button! But then, once I got used to the idea, I became excited all over again! And actually several other people have sampled the song since, though with them it's been the onstage version I did on the (1973-released) 'Live At Montreux' album that seems to have got more attention - <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>because</b> it was more spontaneous. Which, as I say, is something that HAPPENS in my live performances! And I particularly liked the St. Germain version, which had more of a jazz flavour to it.|$|E

[...] Ray Danton was born in 1931, while Miss Russell was born in 1921. Ralph Meeker was born in 1920. About the movie, Russell wrote in her autobiography; [...] "Norman Taurog saw the picture as strictly a Technicolor camp, while I had the mystery and romance of it in mind, in black and white.

Rosemary 2 ̆ 6 I are both looking for another job—I hate to have an arguement [sic] with anyone. Today’s Wednesday 2 ̆ 6 there are only three more days til you’ll be home again. Golly I miss you so much. It does seem months since last Sunday. Yes, I got to bed early Sunday. That’s more than you can say—so there! Do you get much sleep? This weekend we’d better just for a change be wide awake 2 ̆ 6 stop yawning. (Johnny Mercer is playing “You 2 ̆ 6 Your Love”—You should hear it sometime). We had a few snow flakes Monday but nothing exciting. It made me laugh because you had said it had to snow or do something different. What was it like to fly in the snow? I’m very proud of your being able to save 4. 38 by March. You’re really thrifty—(Now he’s playing “Always”—How true). Well, the way things look now I probably will have about two dollars saved by next Christmas—If I get that fur coat especially. What are these “pretty-good-ideas-on-how-to-raise-money ideas” of yours? Well, I was talking to some people about the cost of diamonds 2 ̆ 6 they’re practically an arm 2 ̆ 6 a leg now. Tomorrow I’m going to find out for myself. Going down to Macy’s to look. They’re supposed to have very good junk because they’re all marked 2 ̆ 6 checked by officials or something so that people won’t get gyped [sic]. Daddy can get most jewelery [sic] wholesale 2 ̆ 6 if he could do that it would be wonderful because there probably wouldn’t be a tax on it if he got it. No, honey, there’s {{no doubt in my mind}} at all. And I’ve decided not to try to talk myself out of anything 2 ̆ 6 to just be happy 2 ̆ 6 not worry about anything. When it happens—anything—then maybe I’ll worry about it but not ‘til then. I hope that you can remember all the things we’re going to have a long talk about because there are millions of things that I’ve already forgotten. Yes, we’ve told daddy. He doesn’t want me to get married til the war’s over but if I want to he won’t stand in the way. Besides, even if he didn’t approve I’d do it anyway. Once my mind’s made up it’s pretty hard to change it. Anyway nothing anyone could say about waiting would bother me. If you want to get married in March, we’ll get married in March. Honey, I love you and miss you so much. Just finished dinner 2 ̆ 6 daddy said that he could get rings wholesale. That would be neat. He says they’re about 200 or 250 plus tax. Sinatra’s on now. He’s singing “There Goes That Song Again. ” That reminds me of last Saturday when Henry James played it. Golly so many things happened last Saturday. Golly, there are so many things we have to get settled, honey. I have a fairly good idea of what I’ll have to do between now 2 ̆ 6 March. There are only 38 more shopping days to Christmas. This is going to be some Christmas. Hon, what should I do about telling that fellow? Again that reminds me—Have you been able to get Woody a date for this Saturday? She is so neat.

To get back to the subject—I hate to write him but that’s the only way. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>because</b> if he ever went overseas before I told him it would be awful.

Maybe we could slow down the clock or something. Time really flies on those weekends. Guess that Gilly 2 ̆ 6 I won’t go to the Pelham-Pleasantville game because we can’t find anyone who’s going. Well, honey, please write soon again. I love you. All my love,Dottie P. S. Please don’t forget about getting Woody a date, honey. Oh, Sinatra is at the Waldorf Astoria or someplace. Maybe we could go there sometime, huh? Where do you want to have the reception? Where did your sisters have theirs? Golly, there are so many questions that I want to ask you. We’re going to have to talk awfully fast to get everything said this weekend. Have you told any of the cadets, yet? So far I’ve only told two girls, of course. I’m practically going crazy but until it’s official or announced anyway, they’re the only ones who’ll know. There are going to be a heck of a lot of people who will be surprised. I’d love to hear what people will say. That would be fun, but I don’t especially care what anyone thinks. Wonder what Don or Bill would say. I’ll bet they won’t believe it.
