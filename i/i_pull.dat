500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{widespread}} rumors, Usher stated, [...] "People assume things, {{because as}} I said, <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> from my personal experiences {{to make my}} music." [...] He added that he loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Man Down" [...] is a reggae murder ballad with [...] "Caribbean-rhythms" [...] and {{elements}} of ragga and electronic music. The song, {{in the key}} of C minor, has a tempo of 77beats per minute. Rihanna's voice spans more than {{one and a half}} octaves, from F3 to E5. Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani described [...] "Man Down" [...] as one of Rihanna's [...] "most confident vocal performances" [...] with her strong Barbadian patois. Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that the singer [...] "plays up her West Indian accent", and August Brown of the Los Angeles Times described the vocals as reasserting [...] "her Caribbean lilt". Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt described [...] "Man Down" [...] as a song with [...] "island rhythms". Lyrically, Rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man, but later regrets it. Rihanna slowly relays the chain of events which led up to the murder. She cries to her mother about the act that she has committed– [...] "Mama, I just shot a man down"– expressing guilt and remorse for not meaning to kill her attacker, and that he is somebody's son. As the track develops, Rihanna's Bajan accent becomes stronger and exaggerated, which climaxes during the bridge as she declares [...] "Why deed <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> dee treeguh, pull dee treeguh, pull dee treeguh, BOOM!" [...] MuuMuse writer Bradley Stern thought that the track took on a confessional tone.|$|E

2500|$|... "You and I {{should not}} now {{pull on the}} ends of the rope in which you have tied a knot of war, because the harder you and <b>I</b> <b>pull,</b> the tighter the knot will become. And a time may come when this knot is tied so tight that the person who tied it is no longer capable of untying it, and then the knot will have to be cut. What that would mean I need not explain to you, because you {{yourself}} understand perfectly what dreaded forces our two countries possess." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 she {{proposed}} a similar idea {{to the same}} gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramović would {{stand in front of}} the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. [...] "From the right pocket of my skirt I take a gun. From the left pocket of my skirt I take a bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. I place the gun to my temple. <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> the trigger." [...] The performance had two possible outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Rathbone {{was also}} one to dismiss the {{complaints}} {{in an interview with}} MTV, saying, [...] "I think it's {{one of those things where}} <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> my hair up, shave the sides, and I definitely need a tan. It's one of those things where, hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit." [...] The controversy was poorly received by critics as well. Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical voices against the casting. When asked about casting a white cast to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan go out of their way to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that will fade away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E
