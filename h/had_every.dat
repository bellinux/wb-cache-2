Mieszko <b>had</b> <b>every</b> reason to believe that great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as Wolin, Szczecin and Kołobrzeg.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to remain}} in one place long enough to receive provisions, Black Hawk's group were in poor health {{and some of them}} starved to death on the road. Black Hawk stated in his account of the battle that {{at this point in the}} war he <b>had</b> <b>every</b> {{intention}} of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River, but on encountering the large U.S. force at Wisconsin Heights he was left with no choice but to fight. His intention was to allow the non-combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who <b>had</b> <b>every</b> interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or {{he may have been}} related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E

5|$|Cleph {{kept the}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. Possibly {{he too was}} killed at the {{instigation}} of the Byzantines, who <b>had</b> <b>every</b> interest in avoiding a hostile and solid leadership among the Lombards. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed Cleph, opening a decade of interregnum, thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only {{when faced with the}} danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an exarch in Ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.|$|E
5|$|While the Command {{retained}} a minimum peacetime {{force and the}} Air Ministry <b>had</b> <b>every</b> intention of maintaining it as such, the fleet was further reduced and suffered from procurement problems. The Short Shetland and Short Seaford were rejected as replacements for the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. A maritime version of the promising Avro Lincoln {{had yet to be}} ordered by the time the Lend-Lease programme ended in August 1945. The Short Sunderland was forced to continue as the main operational type until the end of 1946. Most of the aircraft that operated in the command were the Second World War types; the Spitfire, Lancaster, Mosquito and Beaufighter.|$|E
5|$|Wake's post-score kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. With time running down, Georgia Tech had a chance for a game-winning score if it could sustain a drive into Wake Forest {{territory}} from its own 20-yard line. The drive began with a promising 14-yard completion to Calvin Johnson, but after Reggie Ball threw three incomplete passes, Georgia Tech was forced to punt the ball back to Wake Forest. The Deacons, after getting the ball at their own 20-yard line, began a drive of their own. Riley Skinner completed his first four passes of the drive, including a long 45-yard strike to Willie Idlette for the longest play of the game. With a first down inside the Georgia Tech red zone, the Deacons seemed to be in perfect position for a potentially game-winning touchdown. But as <b>had</b> <b>every</b> other drive previous, Wake Forest's offense failed to cross the goal line. Sam Swank kicked a 22-yard field goal to give the Deacons a 96 lead, but Georgia Tech still had time for one final drive.|$|E

Further away from the provincewide result, on an election night which demonstrated Liberal strength province wide, Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant delivered the most crushing defeat for a Liberal candidate in the province, with the victorious PC incumbent Toby Barrett coming out 16,571 votes and 38.6% ahead of the Liberal.|$|E

Further, that this mandate had to be obeyed in order to remain in communion with the Roman church.
