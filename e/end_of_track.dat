Also observing the excessive speed of 4876 was an assistant train director in Interlocking Tower 'C', who radioed ahead to Tower 'K'. The train director in Tower 'K' had the switches changed to allow 4876 to enter Union Station on Track 16, its regularly assigned track. Having insufficient time to switch the runaway on to another track, the director alerted the station master's office which was situated at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Track</b> 16.
