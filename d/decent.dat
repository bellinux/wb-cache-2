5|$|A newly wed couple, Vishwam (Madhu) and Sita (Sharada), {{have married}} against the {{preference}} of their families, and left their hometown. Both {{want to start}} a new life at a new place. Initially, they stay in a <b>decent</b> hotel but soon due to financial reasons they move to another, ordinary hotel.|$|E
5|$|Keating was a {{champion}} swimmer for the University of Cincinnati in the 1940s. From the late 1950s through the 1970s, {{he was a}} noted anti-pornography activist, founding the organization Citizens for <b>Decent</b> Literature and serving as a member on the 1969 President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography.|$|E
5|$|Lute is a {{carefree}} bard {{whose mother}} {{kicked him out}} of the house until Lute found a <b>decent</b> job. He stumbles face-first into a plot involving Trinity general Mondo and resistance leader Captain Hamilton, and the legacy of Lute's deceased father, who was betrayed and killed by Mondo.|$|E
5|$|Their home ground success, winning seven {{from nine}} matches, {{was never able}} to attract <b>decent</b> figure crowds, their highest {{reaching}} 7,719. Compared with the Super League competition average of 12,347 and the nearby Newcastle Knights had an average of 14,257 home attendances. With crowds at these levels, the Mariners were unsuccessfully competing in the Newcastle area.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, Grabner {{failed to}} score at his {{previous}} pace {{as with the}} Islanders, but was a <b>decent</b> addition on the penalty kill and had some hot streaks. Despite the decrease in production, the Maple Leafs had interest in bringing Grabner back, but a plethora of young players expected to make the roster the following season prevented the team from signing him.|$|E
5|$|When Billy Sunday was {{ten years}} old, his impoverished mother sent him and an older brother to the Soldiers' Orphans Home in Glenwood, Iowa, and later to the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home in Davenport, Iowa. At the orphanage, Sunday gained orderly habits, a <b>decent</b> primary education, and the {{realization}} {{that he was a}} good athlete.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic. Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system down into the subtropics {{to the east of}} Bermuda, and it maintained <b>decent</b> organization. By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} four years, Lassie {{received}} very <b>decent</b> ratings. However, {{at the end}} of the 1958–1959 season, the ratings had fallen out of the top 30 due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies ratings greatly improved and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E
5|$|Family Trade {{started off}} with <b>decent</b> ratings by GSN's standards, {{averaging}} 403,000 viewers for the two episodes shown {{on the night of}} the show's premiere, slightly above the network's primetime viewership average. However, the show quickly fell in the ratings, with all new episodes airing in March (including the premiere night's episodes) averaging 296,000 viewers, and only 40,000 viewers (with a 0.0 rating) among adults 18–49. In April, the series dropped even lower in terms of total viewers, with an average of 274,000, and only improved by a negligible amount among adults 18–49, with 46,000 viewers (again with a 0.0 rating).|$|E
5|$|Geen excelled athletically at Oxford, earning four Blues between 1910 and 1913. However, {{in three}} {{successive}} Varsity Matches, {{he failed to}} score after dropping the ball over the tryline. In the holidays, he played club rugby for Newport, and {{he was part of}} the team that defeated the touring South African side of 1912–1913. He was also a <b>decent</b> cricketer keeping wicket for Oxford University Authentics and Monmouthshire.|$|E
5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a minor planet goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC with enough positional data for a <b>decent</b> orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} <b>decent</b> sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|Kolb {{was traded}} to the Arizona Cardinals on July 28, 2011, in {{exchange}} for cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and a second-round draft pick in the 2012 NFL Draft (which the Eagles traded for draft picks used on Vinny Curry and Brandon Boykin). Expected to start, Kolb had a <b>decent</b> preseason debut for the Cardinals in preseason play against the Oakland Raiders, going 4-for-7 for 68yards; among the four completions was a 43-yard pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald.|$|E
5|$|Released on 19 September 2014 in 2000 screens globally, Aagadu {{opened to}} <b>decent</b> {{critical}} reception and debuted {{with a positive}} response at the box office. Due to unfavourable word of mouth and competition from new releases, Aagadu ended up collecting a distributor share of 342.5 million globally and was declared a box office bomb due to the high costs involved. However, Aagadu crossed the US$1 million mark at the United States box office in two days including its previews, which was considered a remarkable feat. The film was dubbed into Hindi as Encounter Shankar and into Tamil as Idhudhaanda Police.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{moved into}} a very basic ground-floor {{apartment}} in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill. Given {{how hard it was}} to find <b>decent</b> housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, who at the time was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Clarke to the ODI {{team for the}} Pakistan series also saw White move down the order again, {{although}} batting at number five, he made his second international century in the first match, scoring 105 from 88 balls to help drive Australia to victory. White continued to perform well with the bat in the series, making a half-century in the second match and making <b>decent</b> totals {{in a number of}} the other games as Australia swept the series 5–0.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that those net-men wearing tunics, known as retiarii tunicati, formed a special sub-class, one even more demeaned than their loincloth-wearing colleagues. The Roman satirist Juvenal wrote that: So even the lanista's establishment is better ordered than yours, for he separates the vile from the <b>decent,</b> and sequesters even from their fellow-retiarii the wearers of the ill-famed tunic; in the training-school, and even in gaol, such creatures herd apart….|$|E
5|$|When Flanders {{finds out}} that the {{children}} were not baptized, he takes {{it upon himself to}} give the kids an emergency baptism. When Homer and Marge are declared <b>decent</b> parents, they quickly head for the Springfield River to stop Flanders. Just as Flanders is about to pour holy water on Bart, Homer shoves Bart over to prevent the water from hitting him. The Simpson family is reunited, and they head home together.|$|E
5|$|While {{the film}} was still untitled, Javed Akhtar was signed to write the lyrics, and even wrote and {{recorded}} one song. However, when the movie was titled Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he found the title mediocre, obscene, and vulgar and decided to quit the project. Akhtar later regretted leaving the film, as he found it <b>decent</b> and {{could see that the}} title has become quite a buzz-word, realizing that {{he was the only one}} who disliked the title.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the social}} status of nobles, officials, farmers, and artisan-craftsmen were {{considered}} above the station of the lowly registered merchant, wealthy and successful businessmen acquired huge fortunes which {{allowed them to}} rival the social prestige {{of even the most}} powerful nobles and highest officials. Slaves were {{at the bottom of the}} social order, yet they represented only a tiny portion of the overall population. Retainers attached themselves to the estates of wealthy landowners, while medical physicians and state-employed religious occultists could make a <b>decent</b> living. People of all social classes believed in various deities, spirits, immortals, and demons. While Han Daoists were organized into small groups chiefly concerned with achieving immortality through various means, by the mid 2nd century CE they formed large hierarchical religious societies that challenged imperial authority and viewed Laozi (fl. 6th century BCE) as a holy prophet.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very <b>decent</b> opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|In 1631 Wiśniowiecki {{returned}} to the Commonwealth and took over from his uncle the management of his father's huge estate, which included {{a large part of}} what is now Ukraine. In 1632 he converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Catholicism, an action that caused much concern in Ukraine. His decision has been analyzed by historians, and often criticized, particularly in Ukrainian historiography. The Orthodox Church feared to lose a powerful protector, and Isaiah Kopinsky, metropolitan bishop of Kiev and a friend of his mother, unsuccessfully pleaded with him to change his mind. Jeremi would not budge although he remained on <b>decent</b> terms with the Orthodox Church, avoiding provocative actions, and supported his uncle and Orthodox bishop Peter Mogila and his Orthodox Church collegium.|$|E
5|$|In Shreveport, meanwhile, {{whatever}} positive momentum {{the team}} had gained {{at the end of}} the 1994 season failed to carry over into 1995. Notable NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver was signed and put up <b>decent</b> numbers; the rest of the team, however, was unable to muster much success and limped to a 5–13 record. As elsewhere, the team saw a second season attendance decline. With the season winding down, the city had clearly soured on the Gliebermans. They became embroiled in legal difficulties and, in one particularly absurd incident, Bernie Glieberman had his lawyer attempt (unsuccessfully) to abscond with a half-million dollar Tucker automobile that Glieberman had donated to a local museum.|$|E
5|$|Made on {{a budget}} of 110 million, Aitraaz was {{released}} on 375 screens on 12 November 2004 during the festive Diwali weekend. It clashed with three other major releases: Veer-Zaara, the coloured version of Mughal-e-Azam, and Naach. The film opened to excellent occupancy in metros and <b>decent</b> at other places. It was the second best playing release of the week after Yash Chopra's Veer-Zaara. According to Box Office India, the film grossed approximately 45 million on its opening weekend and 76 million in its first week at the domestic box office. After its run, Aitraaz grossed over 260 million at the box office, becoming the eleventh-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. The film was deemed a commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Mario Eduardo Lemus Hollands (born August 26, 1988) is an American {{professional}} baseball pitcher {{who is currently}} a free agent. He played college baseball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, where he {{earned a degree in}} sociology. The Phillies drafted him in the 2010 MLB Draft, and after a few seasons in the farm system, they invited him to spring training in 2014. After performing well in those exhibition games, he made the Phillies' 2014 Opening Day roster, and although he walked too many hitters, showed some potential to emerge as a <b>decent</b> relief pitcher. His teammates described him as a good personality to have in the bullpen, and his coaches approved of his development. Meanwhile, he is pursuing another college degree; he is studying merchandise marketing at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the early history of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, another Lancastrian commander; the chronicles mention little about him until the Battle of Losecoat Field. His father, the {{previous}} earl and a loyal Lancastrian, was executed for a failed plot to assassinate Edward IV. The Yorkist king tried to secure the loyalty of Oxford by knighting him and pardoning his transgressions. This tactic failed; Oxford remained true to the Lancastrian crown and participated in Warwick's effort to dethrone Edward. Historians describe the young Oxford as a <b>decent</b> military leader, exemplified by his conduct in the Battle of Barnet.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars Headspace is an {{electronic}} music compilation album executively produced by Rick Rubin and Kevin Kusatsu. It compiles electronic dance tracks of acts including Claude VonStroke, Flying Lotus and Röyksopp. It featured sound effects and {{samples from the}} Star Wars films, but does not contain any sample of John Williams' music for the series. Hollywood Records and American Recordings released Star Wars Headspace in digital forms on February 19, 2016 and in physical forms on March 18, to <b>decent</b> commercial performance, beginning at {{number one on the}} United States Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and becoming the second various artists compilation to top the chart. However, it also garnered a mixed response from music critics, praise going towards its eccentric concept and criticism that it would likely only be enjoyed by fans of the film series.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Empire {{was in no}} {{position}} to launch any <b>decent</b> counter-attack or defence of these lands; by now the Ottomans had become supremely powerful. Murad I crushed an army of Serbians on 26 September 1371 at the Battle of Maritsa leading to the end of Serbian power. The Ottomans were now poised to conquer Constantinople. In an attempt to stave off defeat, John V appealed to the Pope for support offering submission to Rome in return for military support. Despite publicly confessing the Roman Catholic Faith in St. Peter's Basilica, John V received no help. John V therefore was forced to turn to reason with his enemies, the Ottomans. Murad I and John V then came to an agreement whereby Byzantium would provide regular tribute in troops and money in exchange for security.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{compiled}} a 68–76record, 20games out of first-place, in 1995. Originally, Michael Jordan, {{who played with}} the White Sox's Double-A Birmingham Barons in 1994, was signed to play the 1995 season as a non-drafted free agent for the Sounds. However, with the ongoing MLB strike, Jordan decided to quit the sport rather than becoming a replacement player and being labeled a strikebreaker. The team improved their record in 1996, ending up with 77wins and 67losses. Despite a <b>decent</b> winning percentage, Nashville failed to secure {{a spot in the}} playoffs. Outfielder Jeff Abbott won the Rookie of the Year Award, and Rick Renick earned his second Manager of the Year Award. Joey Vierra pitched in a career franchise-record 238games from 1990 to 1992 and 1994 to 1995.|$|E
