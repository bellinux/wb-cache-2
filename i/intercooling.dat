The results of this analysis have been used in a sample calculation and, {{on the basis of this}} calculation, a new inter cooler arrangement is suggested. Because the length of the two air passages of the new arrangement is short in comparison with the third dimension, the height of the <b>intercooler,</b> this <b>intercooler</b> arrangement has unusual dimensions. These dimensions give the proposed <b>intercooler</b> arrangement an advantage over one of usual dimensions because less total power will be consumed by the <b>intercooler,</b> the weight and volume of the <b>intercooler</b> will be smaller, and the pressure drop of both the engine air and the cooling air in passing through the <b>intercooler</b> will be lower...|$|R
40|$|Establishing {{an optimal}} <b>intercooled</b> {{aeroengine}} constitutes a coupled problem where the conceptual {{design of the}} <b>intercooler</b> and the engine has to be considered simultaneously. The heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics {{will depend on the}} choice of the <b>intercooler</b> architecture. Hence, to be able to optimize the performance of an <b>intercooled</b> aeroengine, the performance characteristics of a given <b>intercooler</b> architecture has to be known in the parameter range anticipated for the aeroengine optimization. Here, the conceptual design of a tubular two-pass cross-flow <b>intercooler</b> architecture intended for a turbofan aeroengine application is presented. The internal flow is simulated applying a porous media model for the <b>intercooler</b> tubes, whereas the connecting ducts are analyzed with three-dimensional simulations allowing the assessment of a number of design solutions. The external flow is treated with two-dimensional simulations investigating the external pressure loss and heat transfer characteristics of the two elliptical tube stacks. The <b>intercooler</b> performance is then generalized by developing a reduced order correlation covering a parameter range anticipated for a turbofan conceptual design optimization. The paper constitutes a first effort to establish an open literature complete set of correlations for the prediction of aeroengine <b>intercooler</b> performance...|$|R
25|$|An {{adiabatic}} {{storage system}} does {{away with the}} <b>intercooling</b> during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but {{the downside is that}} the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an isentropic efficiency of around 85%, with the result that round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.|$|E

In this paper, efficiency-heat transfer units were used for the design of <b>intercooler,</b> and the structure parameters were optimized by genetic algorithm.

40|$|When an {{airplane}} is operating at high altitude, {{it is necessary}} to use a supercharger to maintain ground pressure at the carburetor inlet. This maintenance and high intake-manifold pressure tends to keep the power output of the engine at ground-level value. The air, being compressed by the supercharger, however, is heated by adiabatic compression and friction to a temperature that seriously affect the performance of the engine. It is thus necessary to use an <b>intercooler</b> to reduce the temperature of the air between the supercharger outlet and the carburetor inlet. The amount of cooling required of the <b>intercooler</b> depend on the efficiency of the supercharger installation. In this investigation, several types of intercoolers were compared and a design procedure that will give the best <b>intercooler</b> for a given set of conditions is indicated. The figure of merit used for the selection of the best design was the total power consumed by the <b>intercooler.</b> This value includes the power required to transport the weight of the <b>intercooler</b> as well as the power used to force the charge air and the cooling air through the <b>intercooler.</b> The cost, size and practicality of construction were not considered, inasmuch as it was thought that a survey of possibilities of improvement in design would be of interest, regardless of whether the improvement could be immediately realized.
