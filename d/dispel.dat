5|$|In {{traditional}} Hinduism, Ahalya is extolled as {{the first}} of the panchakanya ("five virgins"), archetypes of female chastity whose names are believed to <b>dispel</b> sin when recited.

5|$|According to beliefs {{derived from}} fusui (feng shui), the fox's power over evil {{is such that}} a mere statue of a fox can <b>dispel</b> the evil kimon, or energy, that flows from the northeast.

On 22 August, after taking soundings in Samborombón Bay, the Beagle began survey work down the coast from Cape San Antonio.|$|E

The Bernier-Couillard Affair erupted in May 2008 over confidential, NATO-related documents left at Couillard's house. Media coverage, and Bernier's reaction, left Couillard feeling victimized. To help <b>dispel</b> rumours regarding her life and her role with Bernier, Couillard signed a book deal.|$|E

5|$|The {{perception}} of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity {{given to a}} few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. Jaws author Peter Benchley, as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg later attempted to <b>dispel</b> the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie I asked the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to help him to {{establish}} an airline {{as part of his}} modernisation effort. According to the BBC News {{it is possible that the}} Emperor intended the creation of a quality national airline to help <b>dispel</b> impressions of Ethiopian poverty. In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a commercial aviation company in Ethiopia.|$|E

Around {{the same time in}} 1959, Manne recorded with the traditional Benny Goodman and the iconoclastic Ornette Coleman, a striking example of his versatility.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to <b>dispel</b> the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} <b>dispel</b> the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would <b>dispel</b> notions of {{the group as a}} mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E

5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to <b>dispel</b> that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{developed}} {{the concept of}} jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series. He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to <b>dispel</b> preconceived notions about ninja popularized by other manga and to bring an original take to the presentation of ninja in manga. The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games. The hand seals are based upon the characters of the Chinese zodiac, which is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and Kishimoto used them specifically to draw upon that tradition.|$|E

5|$|After {{mourning}} her death, Jude {{leads the}} party to meet Maxwell and attempts {{to persuade him to}} <b>dispel</b> the barrier and save Elympios. Reunited with Milla, who has been reborn as a spirit, they convince Maxwell of their cause. However, Gaius and the spirit named Muzét seal Maxwell within the Lance of Kresnik, intent on sustaining the barrier until all spyrixs are destroyed; Maxwell sends {{the party to}} Elympios before he is completely subdued. There, the party learns about Elympios' dependence on spyrix and an ongoing research on spyrite, a power source harmless to spirits. With renewed conviction, the party confronts and defeats Gaius and Muzét. Maxwell dispels the barrier and disperses its energy to temporarily power spyrixes until the completion of spyrites. The party returns to their daily lives with Jude joining a spyrite research team, Milla resuming her role as Maxwell, and Gaius uniting Rieze Maxia under his rule.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} their mutual dislike, the Electress and Violante Beatrice {{attempted}} to improve Gian Gastone's poor public image together. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died; it was a rarity {{for the public to}} see him. To <b>dispel</b> the said rumours, the Electress compelled him to make an appearance—his last one—in 1729, on the feast day of the patron saint of Florence, John the Baptist. The Ruspanti, Gian Gastone's morally corrupt entourage, hated the Electress; and she, them. Violante Beatrice tried to withdraw the Grand Duke from their sphere of influence by organising banquets. His conduct at these literally sent those in attendance scrambling for their carriages: he vomited repeatedly into his napkin, belched and told rude jokes. These distractions ceased upon Violante Beatrice's death in 1731.|$|E
5|$|State legislatures elected U.S. Senators {{until the}} {{ratification}} of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In 1849 one of New York's seats was up for election, and a Whig would likely be elected to replace John Adams Dix. Seward, with Weed's counsel, decided to seek the seat. When legislators convened in January 1849, he was spoken of as the favorite. Some opposed him as too extreme on slavery issues, and intimated {{that he would not}} support the slaveholding President-elect Taylor, a Louisianan. Weed and Seward worked to <b>dispel</b> these concerns, and when the vote for the Senate seat took place, the former governor received five times the vote of the nearest other candidate, gaining easy election on the first ballot.|$|E
