40|$|Abstract. Graph <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> are {{functions}} measuring how fre-quently a given subgraph pattern {{occurs in}} a given database graph. An important class of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> relies on overlap graphs. A major advantage of the overlap graph based approaches is that they combine anti-monotonicity with counting occurrences of a pattern which are in-dependent according to certain criteria. However, existing overlap graph based <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> are expensive to compute. In this paper, we propose a new <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> {{which is based on}} a new notion of independence. We show that our measure is the solution to a linear program which is usually sparse, and using interior point meth-ods can be computed efficiently. We show experimentally that for large networks, in contrast to earlier overlap graph based proposals, pattern mining based on our <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> is feasible...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} of graph databases has grown rapidly. This paper focuses on single-graph as an effective model to represent information and its related graph mining techniques. In frequent pattern mining in a single-graph setting, {{there are two main}} problems: <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> and search scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> that brings together existing minimum-image-based and overlap-graph-based <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Our framework is built on the concept of occurrence / instance hypergraphs. Based on that, we present two new support measures: minimum instance (MI) measure and minimum vertex cover (MVC) measure, that combine the advantages of existing measures. In particular, we show that the existing minimum-image-based <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> is an upper bound of the MI measure, which is also linear-time computable and results in counts that are close to number of instances of a pattern. Although the MVC measure is NP-hard, it can be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. We also provide polynomial-time relaxations for both measures and bounding theorems for all presented <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> in the hypergraph setting. We further show that the hypergraph-based framework can unify all <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> studied in this paper. This framework is also flexible in that more variants of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> can be defined and profiled in it...|$|R
40|$|European {{national}} policies {{involve a}} range of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> to enhance the competitiveness of certain regions or products, inlcuding financial and institutional instruments. For those <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> that involve environmentally counterproductive impacts, the question of their reform arises. The present paper first gives an overview on such <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> in the transport sector and ranks them {{with respect to their}} quantitative importance for the case of Austria. Second, the financial <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> of fixed mileage rate tax allowances is selected for a more detailed quantitative analysis. A transport focused CGE SOE model is employed to quantify the economic impact of a reform of this instrument. Conclusions are sought as to how this reform can be achieved and what type and magnitude of macroeconomic feedbacks such a reform involves.

40|$|Abstract—Correlated motif mining (CMM) is {{the problem}} to find overrepresented pairs of patterns, called motif pairs, in {{interacting}} protein sequences. Algorithmic solutions for CMM thereby provide a computational method for predicting binding sites for protein interaction. In this paper, we adopt a motif-driven approach where the support of candidate motif pairs is evaluated in the network. We experimentally establish {{the superiority of the}} Chi-square-based <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> over other <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Furthermore, we obtain that CMM is an NP-hard problem for a large class of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> (including Chi-square) and reformulate the search for correlated motifs as a combinatorial optimization problem. We then present the method SLIDER which uses local search with a neighborhood function based on sliding motifs and employs the Chi-square-based <b>support</b> <b>measure.</b> We show that SLIDER outperforms existing motif-driven CMM methods and scales to large protein-protein interaction networks...|$|R

We show how these <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> are related. Furthermore, we introduce a novel type of pattern combining numerical and categorical attributes. We give efficient algorithms to find all frequent patterns for the proposed <b>support</b> <b>measures,</b> and evaluate their performance on real-life datasets...|$|R
