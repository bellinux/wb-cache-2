5000|$|On 15 January 2013, the Prime Minister of India conferred on him the Lifetime Achievement Award for {{the year}} 2011 for his {{outstanding}} contributions {{in the field of}} nuclear engineering, towards national initiative to open international civil nuclear trade, further development of framework for governance of nuclear power and human resource development. The citation for the award stated, [...] "During a career spanning four decades, Dr. Grover has distinguished himself as an academic, research and development engineer and a science administrator. His knowledge of nuclear engineering and nuclear law has earned him the title 'nuclear diplomat'." [...] Citation says, [...] " [...] He played maximum role in all steps taken by the Government of India towards opening international civil nuclear trade." [...] Citation also acknowledges his role during negotiations in 2005 aimed at India joining ITER and he has been leading the Indian delegation to <b>ITER</b> <b>Council</b> since its inception.|$|E
40|$|ID. I {{would like}} to thank Dr. Lance Snead, the {{outgoing}} chair of the Fusion Energy Division (FED), for his service during his term. Lance now serves as Past Chair and I have already called upon him for several tasks, which he has performed in the best tradition of service to the fusion community. As this decade comes to a close, I note that this is an exciting time in fusion research. The National Ignition Facility was dedicated in May 2009 and the ITER project selected Cadarache as the site in June 2005. ITER continues to work toward construction. Site preparation and leveling for the tokamak buildings was completed in 2009. Earth moving for construction of the PF magnet assembly building began in the fall of 2010. The <b>ITER</b> <b>Council</b> approved a budget in July 2010, which has led to cost containment approaches that will help keep the project on budget. As you have read in the June 2010 FED newsletter, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers has formed a new division of the internationally recognized Section III design code. Section III, Division 4 is titled “Magnetic Fusion Energy Confinement Devices ” and the effort dwells on writing desig...|$|E

(The United States of America was an ITER Party until September 30 th 1999). The activities are conducted {{under the auspices}} of the IAEA by the ITER Joint Central Team and by the Home Teams (HT). The JCT is composed of qualified persons made available by each of the Parties in approximately equal numbers. The JCT members are located at the ITER Joint Work Sites (JWS) in Naka (Japan), Garching (Germany), and formerly in San Diego (USA). The Home Teams are established and organized by each Party for performing the tasks of the work programme for the EDA, assigned to them in approximately equal shares. Home Teams in each of the Parties perform specific design tasks, and perform research and development in technology (physics R&D is contributed voluntarily). The Home Team Leaders (HTL) are responsible to the Director for the execution of tasks. All activities are directed and supervised by the <b>ITER</b> <b>Council</b> (IC). The ITER Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), upon request of the Council, advises it on technical matters. The Management Advisory Committee (MAC) reports to and advises the Council on management and administrative matters. The Council also makes use of Special Working Groups and other ad hoc groups for particular assignments...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} {{strategy for}} the ITER divertor in ITER research plan in 2008 was that the replacement of CFC/W divertor with all W divertor during D-phase after the demonstration of a 15 MA H-mode integrated scenario with ELM amelioration. In 2009, in order to accelerate initial operation phases before DT-phase, baseline strategy was revised that ITER operation starts with CFC/W divertor and it changes out to full W divertor before the nuclear phase (D-phase) after the confirmation of the controllability of transient events in H/He phase. However, {{in the frame of}} the ITER cost containment policy, the option for implementing a single divertor up to achieving the Q= 10 milestone in the nuclear phase has been proposed by ITER organization and supported by <b>ITER</b> <b>council.</b> Then, the ITPA Coordinating Committee has asked the ITPA groups to provide a scientific view on issues linked with the ITER divertor strategy for submission to ITER Science and Technology Advisory Committee held in May 2013. In ITPA "transport and confinement (T&C) topical group" and "pedestal and edge physics (PEP) topical group", joint session discussing ITER divertor strategy at autumn meeting held in San Diego, October 2012. In the session, influence of W divertor on the access to the H-mode, effect of W divertor on pedestal parameters and plasma confinement, predicted impacts of wall and divertor material on pedestal structure, requirements for ELM control to prevent W accumulation, transport of high Z impurities in the core plasma and possibilities for its control have been discussed. Based on this session, both groups have agreed to provide joint report based on the common understanding that no significant issue is identified in the T&C and PEP research area regarding the start of operations with a CFC/W divertor. In this report, therefore, the evaluation has focused on the additional risks associated with the start of ITER operation up to the DT phase with a single W divertor, and has been structured in the following five topics: 1. Operation in L-mode (C. Angioni, M. Reinke) 2. Access to H-mode (J. W. Hughes, F. Ryter, C. Maggi) 3. Operation in H-mode (T. Pütterich, C. Angioni, R. Dux, V. Bobkov) 4. Quality of H-mode plasmas (M. Beurskens, J. Schweinzer, F. Ryter, M. Reinke) 5. Specific issues in He plasma operation (M. Reinke, C. Angioni, F. Ryter...|$|E
