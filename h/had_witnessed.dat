5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was coolly received at the subsequent Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, but was greatly praised {{by those who}} <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> the trials.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{selected for}} the barrow <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> inhabitation during the preceding Mesolithic period, as evidenced by a nearby hearth and scatters of knapped flint tools. Built out of earth and local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus. Within {{the eastern end of}} the tumulus was a stone chamber, into which human remains were deposited, alongside sherds of pottery vessels.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} {{result of the}} Catilinarian conspiracy was that the populares party became discredited. The prior 70 years <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> a gradual erosion in senatorial powers. The violent nature of the conspiracy, {{in conjunction with the}} senate's skill in disrupting it, did a great deal to repair the senate's image.|$|E
5|$|Three police constables {{from the}} Hammersmith and Fulham police station—Nicholas Jackson, Andrew Moore, and Kerry Smith—told their supervisor, Inspector Wynne Jones, on 3 April that they <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> the incident.

Jackson was the first to tell the inspector; officers then contacted Moore and Smith, who had been standing next to Jackson at the time.|$|E

5|$|As {{he began}} to read up on the written {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} Henry's reign, Pain <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> over 60 royal {{charters}} for the king, spanning {{a period}} from around 1115 until 1135. Although Pain witnessed {{a large number of}} royal documents, this activity took place mostly in England, as few of the documents he witnessed were drawn up while the king was in Normandy. As a reward for his service, Henry gave Pain the lordships of Ewias Lacy and Archenfield, both in Wales.|$|E

5|$|General Mack {{thought that}} Austrian {{security}} relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous Black Forest area in Southern Germany that <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack {{believed that there}} would be no action in Central Germany. Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.|$|E
5|$|Given that Gadge is {{revealed}} {{to actually be}} a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> Gadge engaging {{in some kind of}} supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by greed. However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must have been based on some level of belief.|$|E
5|$|Jolie first {{witnessed}} {{the effects of}} a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world. Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she <b>had</b> <b>witnessed.</b>|$|E

Bolli was killed by Olaf's sons and their allies in a raid led by Thorgerd. Some twelve years later, Gudrun, {{with the help of}} her friend Snorri Goði, had {{a number of}} Bolli's murderers killed in revenge.|$|E
5|$|Sigeberht {{secured the}} future of the Church in East Anglia when he {{established}} a school in his kingdom so that boys could be taught reading and writing in Latin, on the model that he <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> in Gaul. Felix assisted him by obtaining teachers of the kind who taught in Kent. According to the Life of Gregory the Great, Paulinus of York, who from 633 to 644 was the Bishop of Rochester in northern Kent, had been connected with Rædwald's court during the exile of Edwin.|$|E

5|$|The {{claims were}} a massive exaggeration. But while the Big Wing had proven {{physically}} ineffective {{for the most}} part, its biggest contribution to the day had been its use as a psychological weapon. The German bomber units that had seen the Big Wing form up were quite shocked, and those crews in the badly hit units, including KG 2 and KG 3, that <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> head-on collisions with German aircraft were badly shaken.|$|E

It began serialisation in France in Cœurs Vaillants from 29 December 1935, {{and later in}} the Swiss magazine L'Écho Illustré. Alongside protagonists Tintin and Snowy, Hergé also included the detectives Thomson and Thompson in the story, who had been introduced in the previous story. He also alluded to the movie that Tintin <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> being filmed in Cigar, Rastapopoulos' The Sheik's House, having characters enter a cinema where it was being screened.|$|E
