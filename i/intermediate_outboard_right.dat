50|$|The {{critical}} engine of a multi-engine, fixed-wing aircraft is the engine {{a failure of}} which would most adversely affect the performance or handling abilities of an aircraft(§1.1). On propeller aircraft, {{there is a difference}} in the remaining yawing moments after failure of the left or the <b>right</b> (<b>outboard)</b> engine when all propellers rotate in the same direction due to the P-factor. On turbojet/turbofan aircraft, there usually is no difference between the yawing moments after failure of a left or <b>right</b> (<b>outboard)</b> engine.|$|R
2500|$|At 09:50:34 {{following}} both initial impacts {{the aircraft}} continued inverted {{for a further}} [...] {{and came to a}} rest in soft ground {{to the right of the}} runway. During this time the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) began to sound in the Control Tower at Cork Airport. Post impact fires ensued in both engines, and from fuel leaking from the <b>outboard</b> <b>right</b> fuel tank. The fires were put out by the Airfield Fire Service (AFS) before they reached the fuselage. Of the twelve on board, six people were fatally injured including both pilots. Four of the survivors suffered serious injury whilst two received minor injuries and were described as walking wounded. A witness inside the airport terminal building stated that the fog was so thick that the crashed aircraft could not be seen. The airport fire service extinguished both post impact fires within ten minutes of the accident, and started to remove the casualties from the wreckage.pg.192 The injured were taken to Cork University Hospital for treatment. As a result of the accident, Cork Airport was closed until the evening of 11 February.|$|R

50|$|At 23:09, as the {{aircraft}} was on course to the Trinidad Intersection, {{the left wing}} and number one (left outboard) engine separated from {{the aircraft}}. Pieces of the wing, blown back by the wind-blast, struck and dislodged the horizontal stabilizer. The right wing's planking then broke away and the number four (<b>right</b> <b>outboard)</b> engine tore away. The <b>right</b> wing <b>outboard</b> of the number four engine broke away as well, causing structural damage to the fuselage and triggering {{the breakup of the}} aircraft.|$|R
50|$|On 25 May 1949, 44-27299 was {{assigned}} to a navigation training mission. Shortly after takeoff an engine fire {{broke out in the}} <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> engine, resulting in a crew bailout.

25|$|On 8 February 2005, {{on board}} an Airbus A340-600 {{aircraft}} (G-VATL) {{en route from}} Hong Kong to Heathrow, the fuel control computer system caused a loss of automatic fuel transfer between tanks. The left outboard engine lost power, and shortly afterwards the <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> engine also began to falter until the crew began to crossfeed fuel manually. The crew diverted to Amsterdam and landed safely. The interim accident report made four safety recommendations addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft (EASA and the FAA), advising {{on the need for}} a low-fuel warning system for large aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|Flight 843, {{carrying}} 143 {{passengers and}} 10 crew members, took off around 2:00 pm PST on Monday, June 28, 1965.

40|$|A limited {{evaluation}} of the F/A- 18 baseline loads model {{was performed on the}} Systems Research Aircraft at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (Edwards, California). Boeing developed the F/A- 18 loads model using a linear aeroelastic analysis in conjunction with a flight simulator to determine loads at discrete locations on the aircraft. This experiment was designed so that analysis of doublets could be used to establish aircraft aerodynamic and loads response at 20 flight conditions. Instrumentation on the <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> leading edge flap, left aileron, and left stabilator measured the hinge moment so that comparisons could be made between inflight -measured hinge moments and loads model-predicted values at these locations. Comparisons showed that the difference between the loads model-predicted and in-flight-measured hinge moments was up to 130 percent of the flight limit load. A stepwise regression technique was used to determine new loads derivatives. These derivatives were placed in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the event}} of a control surface failure, the purpose of a {{reconfigurable}} control system is to redistribute the control effort among the remaining working surfaces such that satisfactory stability and performance are retained. Four reconfigurable control design methods were investigated for the X- 33 vehicle: Redistributed Pseudo-Inverse, General Constrained Optimization, Automated Failure Dependent Gain Schedule, and an Off-line Nonlinear General Constrained Optimization. The Off-line Nonlinear General Constrained Optimization approach was chosen for implementation on the X- 33. Two example failures are shown, a <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> elevon jam at 25 deg. at a Mach 3 entry condition, and a left rudder jam at 30 degrees. Note however, that reconfigurable control laws have been designed for the entire flight envelope. Comparisons between responses with the nominal controller and reconfigurable controllers show the benefits of reconfiguration. Single jam aerosurface failures were considered, and failure detection and identification is considered accomplished in the actuator controller. The X- 33 flight control system will incorporate reconfigurable flight control in the baseline system...|$|R
40|$|An 11 % scale-model of a Cruise-Efficient Short Take-off and Landing (CESTOL) scalemodel {{test was}} {{recently}} completed. The test {{was conducted in}} the AEDC National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC) 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center. The model included two over-wing pod-mounted turbine propulsion simulators (TPS). The hybrid blended wing-body used a circulation control wing (CCW) with leadingand trailing-edge blowing. The bulk of the test matrix included three forward velocities (40 kts, 60 kts, and 100 kts), angle-of-attack variation between - 5 and 25, and CCW mass flow variation. Seven strut-mounted microphones outboard of the left wing provided source directivity. A phased microphone array was mounted <b>outboard</b> of the <b>right</b> wing for source location. The goal {{of this paper is}} to provide a preliminary look at the acoustic data acquired during the Advanced Model for Extreme Lift and Improved Aeroacoustics (AMELIA) test for 0 angle-of-attack and 0 sideslip conditions. Data presented provides a good overview of the test conditions and the signal-to-noise quality of the data. TPS height variation showed a difference of 2 dB to 3 dB due to wing shielding. Variation of slot mass flow showed increases of 12 dB to 26 dB above the airframe noise and the TPS increased the overall levels an additional 5 dB to 10 dB...|$|R
5000|$|At 03:32 UTC Aeroflot flight 331 {{took off}} from Lisbon airport and ascended to 35 {{thousand}} feet (10.67 kilometers). While on approach to Havana the crew reported seeing false altitude and air pressure readings. Upon approach to Havana, they were granted permission to descend from 35,000 feet to 15,000 feet, followed by being ordered to descend to 3,000 ft. Set to approach number two at they had to fly two minutes then turn 52° {{to land on the}} runway at the glide path. At the time, cumulus clouds were present, visibility was 8 kilometers (but a dense fog was 40 meters high), air pressure was 758mm Hg (or 0.99737 atm) and the temperature was 21° Celsius. [...] At 8:45:28 (12:45:28 UTC) local time at 1270 meters from the runway, whilst approaching the runway, saw power lines 28 meters high, and, in efforts of avoiding them, pulled back on the yoke. But at 23-25 meters they clipped all four power lines, slicing stabilizer and severing the <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> wing flaps. The damage caused by the power lines resulted in the aircraft making a sharp bank to the right at 70° in the time of three seconds. The plane crashed starting with the bow of the right wing, followed by total hull loss of the aircraft due the fire engulfing the cabin, only the tail section was spared.|$|R
50|$|U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigators}} queried the German Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), Germany's {{equivalent of}} the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding the accident history of the Nimbus-4DM {{in conjunction with a}} 1999 accident near Minden, Nevada where both occupants of the aircraft were killed. In this accident, the glider broke up in flight during the recovery phase after a departure from controlled flight while maneuvering in thermal lift conditions. Airborne witnesses in other gliders who saw the beginning of the accident sequence said the glider was in a tight turn, as if climbing in a thermal, when it entered a spiral. With a 45-degree nose-down attitude, the speed quickly built up as the glider completed two full rotations. The rotation then stopped, the flight stabilized on a northeasterly heading, and the nose pitched further down to a near-vertical attitude (this is consistent with the spin recovery technique specified in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM)). The glider was observed to level its attitude, with the wings bending upward and the wing tips coning higher, when the outboard wing tip panels separated from the glider, the wings disintegrated, and the fuselage dived into the ground. Several witnesses estimated that the wing deflection reached 45 degrees or more before the wings failed. Examination of the wreckage disclosed that the left and <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> wing sections failed symmetrically at two locations.|$|R
5000|$|On December 29, 1934, the US Navy assumed {{jurisdiction}} over Kingman Reef. [...] The lagoon {{was used in}} 1937 and 1938 as a halfway station between Hawai'i and American Samoa by Pan American Airways flying boats (Sikorsky S-42B). Pan Am wanted to expand flights into the Pacific and include Australia and New Zealand to their [...] "Clipper" [...] air routes. In 1935 {{it was decided that}} the lagoon at Kingman Reef was suitable for overnight stops en route from the U.S. to New Zealand via Samoa. Kingman Reef became the stopover to and from Pago Pago, American Samoa, located 1600 mi further south. A supply ship, the North Wind, was stationed at Kingman Reef to provide fuel, lodging, and meals. The S42B Pan American Clipper II, piloted by Captain Edwin Musick, landed at Kingman on its first flight on March 23, 1937. Several successful flights followed, but the flight on January 11, 1938 ended in tragedy. Shortly after the early morning take off from Pago Pago, bound for New Zealand, the Clipper exploded. The <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> engine had developed an oil leak and the plane burst into flames while dumping fuel; there were no survivors. As a result of the tragedy, Pan Am ended flights to New Zealand via Kingman Reef and Pago Pago. A new route was established in July 1940 by way of Canton Island and New Caledonia.|$|R
50|$|Bombs {{released}} from a bomber above them struck one of their engines. (Believed by the crew to be the #4, or <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> engine.) This shut down one engine, but the propeller couldn't be properly feathered and there was damage to the electrical and/or hydraulic systems. Their troubles mounted when they attempted to drop their bombs and the bomb bay doors had to be manually opened and the bomb's released manually. Once the bombs were gone, {{they were unable to}} close the bomb bay doors. The increased drag of a non-feathered propeller and the open bomb bay doors, combined with the lost power from one inoperative engine, caused them to slow down and forced them to fall out of formation. The crew recalls that they were then attacked by German fighter aircraft and they lost one or two more engines and had to drop down to the cloud deck (tops around 5,000') to attempt to continue flying. The aircraft was headed west towards England, but was lower than their formations and unable to keep up. Witness crew members from a 323rd Bomb Squadron aircraft reported losing sight of the missing aircraft about 30 minutes (east of) the Zuider Zee, but that the aircraft was continuing on course, just lower & slower. The witnesses reported that the engines were feathered, but crew statements suggest that the engines were not turning, however the propellers were not feathered either.|$|R
40|$|Mirror {{fields of}} view (FOV) of 43 {{men and women}} were {{measured}} in their own passenger cars. A manual pole-sighting method was supplemented by calculations from three-dimensional vehicle data. A coordinate measurement machine was used to record the mirror orientations and driver eye locations. The mean horizontal FOV widths were 12. 9, 25. 3, and 22. 5 degrees for the left (driver-side), center, and right mirrors, respectively. On average, drivers could see 14. 0 degrees outboard on the left and 19. 8 degrees <b>outboard</b> on the <b>right.</b> Driver age, gender, and body size did not significantly affect mirror aim. The vehicle defined the edge of the horizontal FOV in the left and right mirrors for 84 percent and 78 percent of drivers in the left and right mirrors, respectively. On average, the vehicle took up 21 percent of the available horizontal FOV in the left mirror. FOV were not significantly different after the drivers were allowed to reaim the mirrors, except that {{the outer edge of the}} left mirror horizontal FOV increased to 15. 1 degrees outboard. The distributions of mirror FOV parameters were comparable to those reported in an earlier study, but the current data are much more detailed and include the physical mirror orientation, mirror dimensions, mirror positions relative to driver eye location, and other information. Summary statistics on the parameter distributions are provided to facilitate modeling of mirror FOV...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was still too}} high and close in to land when it circled back to the airport. It was forced to continue circling Amsterdam until it could reduce altitude to that required for a final approach to landing. During the second circle, the wing flaps were extended. The inboard trailing edge flaps extended, since they were powered by the number one hydraulic system, which was still functioning, but the outboard trailing edge flaps did not extend, because they were powered by the number four hydraulic system, which failed when the number four engine {{broke away from the}} wing. The partial flap condition meant that the aircraft would have a higher pitch attitude than normal as it slowed down. The leading edge flaps extended on the left wing, but not on the right wing, because of the extensive damage sustained when the engines separated, which had also severely disrupted the air flow over the right wing. That differential configuration caused the left wing to generate significantly more lift than the damaged right wing, especially when the pitch altitude increased as the airspeed decreased. The increased lift on the left side increased the tendency to roll further to the right, both because the <b>right</b> <b>outboard</b> aileron was inoperative and because the thrust of the left engines was increased in an attempt to reduce the aircraft's very high sink rate. As the aircraft slowed, the ability of the remaining controls to counteract the right roll diminished. The crew finally lost all ability to prevent the aircraft from rolling to the right. The roll reached 90 degrees just before the impact with the apartment houses.|$|R
40|$|Mirror {{fields of}} view (FOV) of 48 {{men and women}} were {{measured}} in their own pickup trucks, minivans, and sport utility vehicles using methods previously applied to measuring mirror fields of view in passenger cars. A manual pole-sighting method was supplemented by calculations from three-dimensional vehicle data. A coordinate measurement machine was used to record the mirror orientations and driver eye locations. Mirror aim did not differ significantly by vehicle type or driver gender, except that the vertical FOV in the left mirror was greater in trucks than in SUVs and minivans, due to larger mirrors. The mean horizontal FOV widths were 12. 6, 19. 6, and 20. 2 degrees for the left (driver-side), center, and right mirrors, respectively. On average, drivers could see 12. 1 degrees outboard on the left and 17. 2 degrees <b>outboard</b> on the <b>right.</b> The FOV in the left mirror did not differ significantly from the FOV measured in a previous study of passenger cars. The center mirror FOV was smaller and included less of the area {{to the right of the}} vehicle than in passenger cars. Right-mirror FOV was similar to passenger cars, except that the outer edge of the horizontal FOV averaged 17. 2 degrees, compared with 19. 8 degrees in passenger cars. The differences in FOV are probably attributable to differences in vehicle and mirror geometry rather than differences in driver aiming behavior. Drivers were asked to check and, if desired, to reaim their mirrors as they drove over a short road route. The FOV measured on their return did not differ substantially from the initial FOV measurements, although all but fourteen drivers adjusted at least one mirror. Combined with the results of the previous study, the findings demonstrate the distribution of mirror FOV for vehicles in use...|$|R
