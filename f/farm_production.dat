25|$|In rural India in the {{agriculture}} and allied industrial sectors, females account {{for as much}} as 89.5% of the labour force. In overall <b>farm</b> <b>production,</b> women's average contribution is estimated at 55% to 66% of the total labour. According to a 1991 World Bank report, women accounted for 94% of total employment in dairy production in India. Women constitute 51% of the total employed in forest-based small-scale enterprises.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{agriculture}} reform and modernization {{program of the}} Department of Agriculture other {{agencies such as the}} National Irrigation Administration, Department of Agrarian Reform and cooperatives extend to farmers other services to develop and harness to the maximum the agricultural potentials of the municipality. The agricultural technologists of the municipal agricultural office provide extension and other related services in order to boost <b>farm</b> <b>production</b> in the municipality.|$|E
25|$|By 1984, when about 99% of <b>farm</b> <b>production</b> {{teams had}} adopted the Family Production Responsibility System, the {{government}} began further economic reforms, aimed primarily at liberalizing agricultural pricing and marketing. In 1984, the government replaced mandatory procurement with voluntary contracts between farmers and the government. Later, in 1993, the government abolished the 40-year-old grain rationing system, leading to more than 90 percent of all annual agricultural produce to be sold at market-determined prices.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, {{the fifth}} {{successive}} year of decline, <b>farm</b> <b>production</b> declined by roughly 7 percent {{in comparison with}} the previous year. Production of basic grains fell as a result of Hurricane Joan in 1988 and a drought in 1989. By 1990 agricultural exports had declined to less than half the level of 1978. The only bright spot was the production of nontraditional export crops such as sesame, tobacco, and African palm oil.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s <b>farm</b> <b>production</b> had {{increased}} dramatically thanks to mechanization, more potent insecticides and {{increased use of}} fertilizer. Due to an overproduction of agricultural products farmers faced a severe and chronic agricultural depression throughout the 1920s. The Great Depression even worsened the agricultural crises. At the beginning of 1933 agricultural markets nearly faced collapse. Farm prices were so low that, as an example, in Montana wheat was rotting in the fields because {{it could not be}} profitably harvested. In Oregon sheep were slaughtered and left to the buzzards because meat prices were not sufficient to warrant transportation to markets.|$|E
25|$|Clapp was {{notable for}} his support and {{assistance}} to the farming sector. This reflected not only a desire to boost rail traffic through increased <b>farm</b> <b>production</b> and customer demand, but also {{a belief that the}} role and social responsibilities of the Victorian Railways as an organisation went far greater than simply the provision of transport. To this end, he introduced two special trains with the aim of developing the rural economy of Victoria, the Better Farming Train and the Reso Train (for Victorian National Resources Development). These trains served to link up businessmen with primary producers and develop entrepreneurial relationships, as well as educate farmers on the latest developments and best practices in agricultural science.|$|E

25|$|In 1942 many Japanese from British Columbia were {{forcibly}} sent to internment {{camps in}} southern Alberta, which already had Japanese communities at Raymond and Hardieville. At first limited to working in sugar beet fields, the newly arrived Japanese had severe housing, school, and water problems. In {{the following years}} some of the Japanese were permitted to work in canning factories, sawmills, and other businesses. There was constant controversy in the press about the role and freedom of the local Japanese. <b>Farm</b> <b>production</b> increased markedly, {{and after the war}} few of the Japanese took advantage of the repatriation plan to go to Japan. The Japanese in Alberta today are well assimilated, but little of Japanese heritage remains.|$|E
25|$|The demand had {{increased}} so much after 1776, that many farmers {{were unable to}} meet the demands for exports, which increased the prices of tobacco even further. With a desire {{to increase the amount of}} tobacco available, many American farmers took out credit loans from the British to increase the size of their landholdings as well as increase the number of slaves they owned. Much of this credit went to gentleman farmers, but the desire for tobacco was so strong that even middle class farmers found it easy to receive loans to increase their <b>farm</b> <b>production.</b> Many of these farmers opted not to pay back these loans however, and many in turn found themselves jailed toward the end of the century for not paying their debts. Many of these debtors were small farmers, causing a further consolidation of smaller farms into larger ones.|$|E
25|$|Over time, Mamluk slave {{soldiers}} {{became a}} very powerful landed aristocracy, {{to the point of}} getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a Mamluk dynasty. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as amirs. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a Mongol invasion in 1260 at the Battle of Ain Jalut. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of Medina and Mecca. Eventually the iqta system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their iqta as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. <b>Farm</b> <b>production</b> declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of handguns and cannons.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture in Scotland in the Middle Ages {{includes}} {{all forms of}} <b>farm</b> <b>production</b> in the modern boundaries of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Britain in the fifth century and the establishment of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Scotland has between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land of England and Wales, mostly located in the south and east. Heavy rainfall encouraged the spread of acidic blanket peat bog, which with wind and salt spray, made most of the western islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and agriculture difficult. Most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. The early Middle Ages were a period of climate deterioration resulting in more land becoming unproductive. Farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family and cattle were the most important domesticated animal.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} of expansion, farmers {{introduced}} modern production practices. The widespread use of modern inputs—chemical fertilisers and insecticides, agricultural machinery, and improved seed varieties—sharply improved crop yields. Yet the modernisation process again made <b>farm</b> <b>production</b> dependent on supplies from abroad, this time on imports of petroleum and fertilisers. By 1984 domestic sources of energy covered only about 20 percent of farm needs, while in 1950 domestic sources had supplied 70 percent of them. In {{the aftermath of the}} oil price increases of the early 1970s, farmers began to return to local energy sources such as firewood. The existence of many farms that were too small to allow efficient use of tractors also limited mechanisation. Another weak point was the existence of many fields with open drainage ditches needing regular maintenance; in the mid-1980s, experts estimated that half of the cropland needed improved drainage works. At that time, about 1 million hectares had underground drainage, and agricultural authorities planned to help install such works on another million hectares. Despite these shortcomings, Finland's agriculture was efficient and productive—at least when compared with farming in other European countries.|$|E

500|$|Lloyd George {{immediately}} {{set about}} transforming the British war effort, taking firm {{control of both}} military and domestic policy. In the first 235 days of its existence, the War Cabinet met 200 times. Its creation marked {{the transition to a}} state of total war—the idea that every man, woman and child should play his or her part in the war effort. Moreover, it was decided that members of the government should be the men who controlled the war effort, primarily utilising the power they had been given under the Defence of the Realm Act. For the first time, the government could react quickly, without endless bureaucracy to tie it down, and with up-to-date statistics on such matters as the state of the merchant navy and <b>farm</b> <b>production.</b> The policy marked a distinct shift away from Asquith's initial policy of laissez-faire, which had been characterised by Winston Churchill's declaration of [...] "business as usual" [...] in [...] The success of Lloyd George's government can also be attributed to a general lack of desire for an election, and the practical absence of dissent that this brought about.|$|E
