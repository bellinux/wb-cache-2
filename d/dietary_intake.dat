40|$|Aim: There {{has been}} no {{systematic}} research {{on the role of}} cooking skills for improving <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> in Australia. Cooking skills are proposed to be declining and/or being devalued. If cooking skills have been devalued and declining, then what evidence is there for this decline and what impact might this have on <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes?</b> The aim of the present paper is to explore these assumptions with particular reference to Australia. The objectives of the present paper are to define the terms cooking and cooking skills, discuss evidence on levels of cooking skills in Australia and describe the evidence linking cooking skills to <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes.</b> [...] Methods: A review of the peer-reviewed literature using multiple databases from 1990 to September 2009. [...] Results: Cooking skills are complex and require a range of processes for people to develop efficiency or confidence in food preparation. There is little evidence on the level of cooking skills in the Australian population and how this relates to <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes.</b> The Australian Bureau of Statistic’s latest Time Use Survey and Household Expenditure Survey suggest that cooking is still a gendered activity and that the time devoted to cooking has changed little in the past 15 years, but there is an increasing use of foods prepared outside the home.

As part of a larger cross-sectional study, this investigation aimed to understand the <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> of 31 Hispanic mother-child dyads in Southern Chester County Pennsylvania. Twenty-four hour dietary recalls were used to measure <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> among the population and bivariate analysis and regression modeling methods were used to assess the relationship between mother and child diet.

40|$|Abstract: A {{high number}} of {{relationships}} between <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> and health outcomes has been suggested and investigated during the last decades (Ezzati & Riboli, 2012; Vargas & Thompson, 2012; Alinia et al., 2009; Howarth et al., 2005; Kushi, 1992). Diet is of special interest {{as it is a}} modifiable risk factor. However, to date little is known with certainty on the complex relations between diet and specific diseases as respective research requires accurate, quantitative information on <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes.</b> Hence, the description of <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> {{is one of the main}} tasks of dietary monitoring surveys and epidemiological studies. Assessment of <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> is challenging due to changes in diet during life as well as due to the day-to-day variation that characterizes <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> in general. In addition, the estimation of long-term consumption frequencies and amounts is difficult for most people as it relies on long-term memory and the capability of correct averaging. Strictly spoken, <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> cannot be measured without error and will presumably never be. Researchers investigating associations between diet and specific diseases or distributions of <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> need to account for various measurement errors to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions. The nature and magnitude of measurement errors in dietary data depend on the study population under investigation as well as on the assessment instrument. To date, there are only few recommendations available for measuring <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> among children. As young children do not have the cognitive ability to report their <b>dietary</b> <b>intakes</b> themselves, usually parents are asked to proxy-report their child's intakes. This means that additional problems emerge from meals that are not under parents' control like e. g. school meals leading to unintentional misreporting. Little is known about the validity of proxy-reported dietary data, potential determinants of misreporting and additional sources of measurement errors in young populations yet. Therefore, this thesis aimed to investigate the extent and effects of measurement errors when assessing and modeling dietary data in young children. Special emphasis was put on differential measurement errors resulting from misreporting where different methods to counteract attenuation or distortion of risk estimates were encountered and evaluated. In summary, differences in the determinants of misreporting were found for proxy-reported dietary data compared to those previously reported for self-reported data where the problem of misreporting seemed to be even more severe in case of proxy-reports. Misreporting strongly affected effect estimates of associations between diet and overweight/obesity. Results strongly depended on the chosen statistical model where even reversed signs were observed when accounting or not-accounting for reporting errors. These findings suggest that studies on diet-disease associations based on proxy-reported dietary data are problematic as there is still no formal way to handle differential measurement errors caused by misreporting. In the absence of objective validation data, the true effects remain unknown. A large number of associations reported so far in epidemiological studies may be biased due to the application of models relying on the assumption of non-differential measurement errors only...|$|R

A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and <b>dietary</b> <b>intake,</b> on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting <b>dietary</b> <b>intake.</b> The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Behind fish, {{the next}} most {{significant}} prey base for bald eagles are other waterbirds. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Exceptionally, in the Greater Yellowstone area, birds were eaten as regularly as fish year-around, with both prey groups comprising 43% of the studied <b>dietary</b> <b>intake.</b> Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, herons, egrets, and geese. Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American coots (Fulica americana) as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. American herring gull (Larus smithsonianus) are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well, with wintering emperor geese (Chen canagica) and snow geese (C. caerulescens), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by bald eagles have included common loons (Gavis immer), great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus), sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), great blue herons (Ardea herodias), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and fledging American white pelicans (P. erythrorhynchos). Colony nesting seabirds, such as alcids, storm petrels, cormorants, northern gannets (Morus bassanus), terns and gulls, may be especially vulnerable to predation. Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.|$|E

Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the <b>dietary</b> <b>intake</b> of eagles.
