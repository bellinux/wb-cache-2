40|$|A {{survey was}} {{begun in the}} fall of 1965 to collect {{information}} on the development of high school <b>family</b> <b>living</b> programs. A review of the literature was made and the studies presented which traced the history of <b>family</b> <b>living</b> in high school from its beginning to the present. The literature emphasized the need for such education for individuals in all staged of development. The need for a survey on family life education in Nebraska became apparent from this literature. The specific objectives of this study were to determine: The provisions in the curriculum for the teaching of <b>family</b> <b>living</b> in the Nebraska schools. The attitude of the administrator toward the teaching of <b>family</b> <b>living</b> in the high school. The characteristics and qualifications of the high school teach of <b>family</b> <b>living.</b> The methods used in the teaching of <b>family</b> <b>living</b> in the homemaking department in Nebraska. The differences between family life education in schools with vocational and non-vocational homemaking programs. Data for this research were gathered during the 1965 - 1966 school year through the use of two questionnaires, one of which was for the school administrator and one for the homemaking teacher. The questionnaires were mailed to 365 public high schools in Nebraska. Returns were received from 280 administrators and 206 teachers. Advisor: Beverly Fowle...|$|R
5|$|After the British invasions {{had been}} repelled, Rosas {{and his family}} moved from Buenos Aires to their estancia (ranch). His work there further shaped his {{character}} and outlook {{as part of the}} Platine region's social establishment. In the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, owners of large landholdings (including the Rosas family) provided food, equipment and protection for <b>families</b> <b>living</b> in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Most of these peons, as such workers were called, were gauchos.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the census}} of 2000, there were 6,108 people, 2,134 households, and 1,796 <b>families</b> <b>living</b> in the village. The {{population}} density was 1,386.2 people per square mile (534.8/km²). There were 2,177 housing units at an average density of 494.1 per square mile (190.6/km²). The racial makeup of the village was 94.1% White, 0.5% African American, 0.1% Native American, 3.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.5% from other races, and 1.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.5% of the population.|$|E
5|$|As seas {{surrounding}} Banton can {{be rough}} during the wet season, {{the best time}} to visit the island is from March to May during the dry (summer) season. This is also the typical time for Asi <b>families</b> <b>living</b> in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as habal-habal) and motorized boats. A circumferential road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.|$|E

5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six <b>families</b> <b>living</b> there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|In November 1907 {{six more}} {{families}} consisting of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on Sandray, {{which has a}} sheltered beach.

Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay with the aim of providing new crofts. By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay <b>families</b> <b>living</b> there. Only six families remained on Mingulay itself, and all of them planned to leave.|$|E

5|$|The wealthy <b>families</b> <b>living</b> on the estates {{of these}} scholar-officials – {{as well as}} rich merchants, princes, and nobles—often {{maintained}} a massive entourage of employed servants, technical staffs, and personal favorites. They hired personal artisans such as jewellers, sculptors, and embroiderers, while servants cleaned house, shopped for goods, attended to kitchen duties, and prepared furnishings for banquets, weddings, and funerals. Rich families also hosted literary men such as secretaries, copyists, and hired tutors to educate their sons. They were also the patrons of musicians, painters, poets, chess players, and storytellers.|$|E
5|$|Although the Sogdians {{had been}} {{responsible}} for transmitting Buddhism to China from India during the 2nd to 4th centuries, soon afterwards they largely converted to Zoroastrianism due to their links to Sassanid Persia. Sogdian merchants and their <b>families</b> <b>living</b> {{in cities such as}} Chang'an, Luoyang, and Xiangyang usually built a Zoroastrian temple once their local communities grew larger than 100 households. Sogdians were also responsible for spreading Manichaeism in Tang China and the Uyghur Khaganate. The Uyghurs built the first Manichaean monastery in China in 768, yet in 843 the Tang government ordered that the property of all Manichaean monasteries be confiscated in response to the outbreak of war with the Uyghurs. With the blanket ban on foreign religions two years later, Manichaeism was driven underground and never flourished in China again.|$|E
5|$|One JNA {{officer and}} one non-commissioned officer were {{killed during the}} fighting, and 15 JNA troops were wounded. Croatian forces {{sustained}} losses of two killed and 24 wounded. Two civilians were also killed. Approximately 1,000 JNA officers and soldiers surrendered to the ZNG. The officers and their <b>families</b> <b>living</b> in Varaždin, as well as approximately 450 soldiers who wanted to leave Croatia were transported to Serbia in a convoy comprising twelve buses and several passenger cars. The convoy was provided with a police escort and two representatives of the civilian authorities in Varaždin accompanied the convoy as hostages to guarantee its safe passage. One of the hostages was Radimir Čačić, who became Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia 20 years later.|$|E

40|$|Budgeting {{for family}} income and {{expenses}} {{is often a}} lower priority for farm and ranch families than budgeting for the business. Without budgeting, however, <b>family</b> <b>living</b> expenses may exceed the available income and jeopardize the overall financial goals of the farm and family. The management of family expenses within a set of mutual family goals can help to keep money from slipping needlessly away. Some reasons producers do not {{devote more time to}} managing family finances include: They are not tax deductible. • Family budgeting is difficult and time • consuming. Compared to farm/ranch expenses, <b>family</b> • <b>living</b> expenses are too small to worry about. Non-farm income pays for family expenses • so it doesn’t matter. Many producers devote attention to <b>family</b> <b>living</b> expenditures only once a year—at loan renewal time. To approve an operating loan, many lenders require that the borrower provide an estimate of <b>family</b> <b>living</b> costs, either as an annual total or broken down by expense catego-ry. Producers may rarely go back and compare their actual <b>family</b> <b>living</b> expenses against their budgeted amounts...|$|R
5|$|Thinly populated, {{far from}} the colonial capital of Rio de Janeiro (which {{exercised}} little actual control), Rio Grande do Sul was often the target of invasions from its neighboring Hispanic-American colony, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (later Argentina). Because the captaincy had to be self-sufficient, the inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul led lives as merchants, farmers or ranchers, while often also serving as soldiers or militiamen. Owners of large landholdings such as Marques de Sousa's father and grandfather provided food, equipment and protection for themselves and <b>families</b> <b>living</b> in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Marques de Sousa grew up in that hostile environment, and from {{a very young age}} he listened to war stories recounting the exploits of his relatives against Hispanic-American invaders.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{comprehensive}} demographic {{study was}} done by historian John Demos for his seminal 1970 work on the Pilgrims A Little Commonwealth. He reports that the colony's average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families, and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation <b>families</b> <b>living</b> until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. Life expectancy was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived {{until the age of}} 21, the average life expectancy was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died before the age of 50. For women, the numbers are much lower, owing to the difficulties inherent in childbearing. The average life expectancy of women at the age of 21 was only 62.4 years. Of these women, less than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died before the age of 50.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local <b>families</b> <b>living</b> on the island fled for their lives.|$|E

5|$|Briarcliff Manor is {{primarily}} non-commercial, with over 80percent of village land residential. Approximately 99% {{of the buildings}} are residential; of these, 85.3% are single-family units. In the 2010 United States Census there were 7,867 people, 2,647 households, and 2,037 <b>families</b> <b>living</b> in 2,753 housing units. Hispanic and Latino Americans made up 5.3percent of the population.

Twenty-one percent of all households were individuals, with 14.1percent age 65 or older. Average household size was 2.71; average family size was 3.16, with a median age of 43.4years. The 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) reported an estimated 2,636 households, 50 of which were held by unmarried partners. 34 of these were female householder and male partner households and 16 were male householder and male partner households. No male-female or female-female unmarried partner households were reported.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{control of}} Nakhichevan {{passed to the}} Safavid dynasty of Persia. Because of its {{geographic}} position, it frequently suffered during the earlier wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1604–1605, Shah Abbas I, concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced some 300,000 Armenians, including the Armenian population of Nakhichevan {{to leave their homes}} and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River. After the last 1826-1828 Russo-Persian War, Nakhichevan became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia's forced ceding. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, reported that 1,228 Armenian families from Persia migrated to Nakhichevan, while prior to their migration there were 2,024 Muslim and 404 Armenian <b>families</b> <b>living</b> in the province.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely disposable, as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant <b>families</b> <b>living</b> at subsistence level. To such persons, any disposable income would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent to relatives or simply saved for retirement.|$|E
