5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs worsened.

5|$|President Roosevelt sought {{re-authorization}} of NIRA on February 20, 1935.

5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey <b>had</b> <b>ruled</b> out any object as they had defined it.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} pregnant once, Catherine had {{no trouble}} doing so again. She may have owed her change of fortune to the physician Jean Fernel, who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, Elisabeth. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future Charles IX (born 27 June 1550); the future Henry III (born 19 September 1551); and Francis, Duke of Anjou (born 18 March 1555).

5|$|Auroras {{departure}} from Australia was delayed {{by a series}} of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did not arrive in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very late in the season for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging work should begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set aside to acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton <b>had</b> <b>ruled</b> out a crossing that season.|$|E

The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E

Charlotte and her brother, Wilhelm, were the only grandchildren born in Albert's lifetime. He and Victoria visited their daughter and two grandchildren when Charlotte was two months old; Vicky and Frederick in turn brought Wilhelm and Charlotte on a visit to England in June 1861, six months before Albert's death.|$|E
