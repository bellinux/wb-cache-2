50|$|A {{good idea}} of the {{effectiveness}} of a <b>Faraday</b> <b>shield</b> can be obtained from considerations of skin depth. With skin depth, the current flowing is mostly in the surface, and decays exponentially with depth through the material. Because a <b>Faraday</b> <b>shield</b> has finite thickness, this determines how well the shield works; a thicker shield can attenuate electromagnetic fields better, and to a lower frequency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{amplitude}} of the gradient {{of a potential}} inside a wire cage is investigated, with {{particular attention to the}} 2 D configuration of a ring of n disks of radius r held at equal potential. The <b>Faraday</b> <b>shielding</b> effect depends upon the wires having finite radius and is weaker than one might expect, scaling as | log r|/n in an appropriate regime of small r and large n. Both numerical results and a mathematical theorem are provided. By the method of multiple scales, a continuum approximation is also derived {{in the form of a}} homogenized boundary condition for the Laplace equation along a curve. The homogenized equation reveals that in a Faraday cage, charge moves so as to somewhat cancel an external field, but not enough for the cancellation to be fully effective.

50|$|A {{continuous}} <b>Faraday</b> <b>shield</b> is {{a hollow}} conductor. Externally or internally applied electromagnetic fields produce {{forces on the}} charge carriers (usually electrons) within the conductor; the charges are redistributed accordingly due to electrostatic induction. The redistributed charges greatly reduce the voltage within the surface, to an extent depending on the capacitance, however, full cancellation does not occur.|$|E
50|$|A Faraday cage or <b>Faraday</b> <b>shield</b> is an {{enclosure}} used {{to block}} electromagnetic fields. A <b>Faraday</b> <b>shield</b> may be formed by a continuous covering of conductive material {{or in the}} case of a Faraday cage, by a mesh of such materials. Faraday cages are named after the English scientist Michael Faraday, who invented them in 1836.A Faraday cage operates because an external electrical field causes the electric charges within the cage's conducting material to be distributed such that they cancel the field's effect in the cage's interior. This phenomenon is used to protect sensitive electronic equipment from external radio frequency interference (RFI). Faraday cages are also used to enclose devices that produce RFI, such as radio transmitters, to prevent their radio waves from interfering with other nearby equipment. They are also used to protect people and equipment against actual electric currents such as lightning strikes and electrostatic discharges, since the enclosing cage conducts current around the outside of the enclosed space and none passes through the interior.|$|E
50|$|Isolation {{transformers}} {{are designed}} with attention to capacitive coupling between the two windings. The capacitance between primary and secondary windings would also couple AC current from the primary to the secondary. A grounded <b>Faraday</b> <b>shield</b> between the primary and the secondary greatly reduces the coupling of common-mode noise. This may be another winding or a metal strip surrounding a winding. Differential noise can magnetically couple from the primary to the secondary of an isolation transformer, and must be filtered out if a problem occurs.|$|E
50|$|Faraday cages are <b>Faraday</b> <b>shields</b> {{which have}} {{holes in the}} {{conductor}} and are more complex to analyze. Whereas continuous shields essentially attenuate all frequencies above the skin depth, the holes in a cage can permit higher frequencies to diffract through them or set up evanescent waves a short distance inside the surface. The higher the frequencies, the better they pass through a mesh of given size. Thus to work well at high frequencies {{the holes in the}} cage must be smaller than the wavelength of the incident EM wave, and Faraday cages may be thought of as band block devices.|$|R

Also, the clock pulses of modern digital electronics that operates at high frequency are needed to be shielded for preventing interference with magnetic field. Hence, it prevents the non-uniformity of magnetic field and generation of eddy currents around the conductive shield (Yamamoto et al. 2005). In case of asymmetric shielding arrangement with Bruker Birdcage RF coils, which produce the negative impact on the MRI system due to its tight fit (España et al. 2010). Also, the gamma shielding tends to cause the distortion and non-linearity due to the adverse effects of eddy currents (Zaidi et al. 2011). Thus, it makes an essence of RF shielding.|$|R

5000|$|Equipment {{sometimes}} requires {{isolation from}} external magnetic fields. For static or slowly varying magnetic fields (below about 100 kHz) the <b>Faraday</b> <b>shielding</b> described above is ineffective. In these cases shields made of high magnetic permeability metal alloys can be used, such as sheets of Permalloy and Mu-Metal (trademark of Magnetic Shield Corporation, Illinois), or with nanocrystalline grain structure ferromagnetic metal coatings. [...] These materials don't block the magnetic field, as with electric shielding, but rather draw the field into themselves, providing {{a path for}} the magnetic field lines around the shielded volume. The best shape for magnetic shields is thus a closed container surrounding the shielded volume. The effectiveness {{of this type of}} shielding depends on the material's permeability, which generally drops off at both very low magnetic field strengths and at high field strengths where the material becomes saturated. So to achieve low residual fields, magnetic shields often consist of several enclosures one inside the other, each of which successively reduces the field inside it.|$|R

Initial operation in plasma was limited by high metallic impurity injection resulting from front surface arcing between protection tiles and from current straps to <b>Faraday</b> <b>shields.</b> Antenna modifications were made in February 2000, resulting in impurity reduction, but low-heating efficiency was observed when the antenna was operated in its 4 -strap rather than a 2 -strap configuration. Further modifications were made in July 2000, with the installation of BN plasma-facing tiles and radio- frequency bypassing of the antenna backplane edges and ends to reduce potential leakage coupling to plasma surface modes. Good heating efficiency was now observed in both heating configurations, but coupled power was limited to 2. 5 MW in H-mode, 3 MW in L-mode, by plasma-wall interactions.
