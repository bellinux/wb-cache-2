5000|$|In conclusion, and as {{was pointed}} out by Captain Lanthier, an officer with the Canadian armed forces who served with UNPROFOR from April to November 1993, {{who was able to}} visit many of the villages in the Kiseljak enclave after the hostilities: What had {{happened}} in the Kiseljak pocket is what is known as ethnic cleansing, where deliberately the citizens had been attacked, that is, those citizens of Muslim origin and only them. The others had been left untouched. It wasn't specifically the villages that were attacked but specifically people within the villages. That was what allowed me - that is the conclusion I came to. … In my mind, it was clear, and even more so in retrospect, that the operations that were carried out in the Vitez and Kiseljak pockets constituted ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population living there. They were carried out in the military fashion. The tactics utilised {{and the use of the}} land and all the other factors, which I have already mentioned, indicates quite clearly that situation was not that one day to the next, a farmer decides to exterminate his neighbours, but rather a systematic extermination … When you look at what happened in Vitez two days later, this thing continued in the Kiseljak pocket, and then several days later, in Breza, in this 302nd Brigade, I was told that the same thing was being prepared for Vareš and Stupni Do. And I was told by this brigade that he feared for Stupni Do. History showed later on that the <b>exact</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> was to happen there. So it was systematic, it was organised, and there was no doubt whatsoever that this was a military operation against a civilian population.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, Cooley {{started his}} career with the {{forestry}} service. At this point in time the forestry was looking for ways to improve the methods used to fight fires. Terrain in the mountains in the 1930s was almost inaccessible, and the roads almost nonexistent. (Bramwell). The challenge became focused on finding a way to get to the fire quicker. The service came up with an idea on attaching “water bombs” to a plane to drop on the fire. Although the idea was tested several times, it proved ineffective and was cancelled. (NY times) Cooley thought he could do something with the plane and brought up the idea of smokejumping - parachuting out of an airplane into a fire to get it under control. This had been tried and appeared to prove true in other countries including Russia and Germany. (Bramwell) Many American pilots were unsure about the idea of dropping firefighters into a fire from the air. There are many factors that can go wrong and they were reluctant and hesitant at the idea. Cooley and a partner by the name of Rufus Robinson began to toil with the notion.On July 12, 1940, Cooley and Robinson got their chance to test their idea. The twenty-eight-year-old who had been building roads, towers, and various other structures for the service was ready for the challenge. A forest fire had sprung up along Martin Creek in the Naz Perce National Forrest. Robinson jumped first followed by Cooley. (Bushey) Their supplies were dropped on the planes’ next pass. (NY times) The next day when the four-man crew reached them, they had the fire under control. They turned around and hiked the 28 miles back to camp. (Bushey).After the service set up the smokejumpers, Cooley began training other young men on how to do the <b>exact</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> he did. He trained men for what the National Service called “10’o clock men”. The idea was that they could have the fire put out by 10’o clock the next morning after being dispatched. (Bramwell) ...|$|E
