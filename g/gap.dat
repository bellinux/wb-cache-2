40|$|It {{has been}} claimed in the {{literature}} that <b>gapping</b> is prohibited in Chinese. Johnson's (1994) theory of <b>gapping</b> receives important support from Chinese. However, Li (1988) and Paul (1996 a, b, 1999) observe some prima facie evidence for <b>gapping</b> in Chinese. I argue that the examples illustrated by Li and Paul are not canonical <b>gapping</b> sentences that are created by V-to-T movement; instead, I propose that they are empty verb sentences. Furthermore, I argue that Chinese has some <b>gapping</b> sentences that result from ATB movement from V to v (LPD). This paper identifies two types of <b>gapping</b> in natural languages: <b>gapping</b> derived by V-to-T movement and <b>gapping</b> derived to V-to-v movement. Consequently, <b>gapping</b> should not be an 'all or nothing' phenomenon.

5000|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} parasitic <b>gaps</b> {{is not a}} settled matter by any means, since accounts of the phenomenon vary drastically. In very broad terms, there are two lines of analysis that one can pursue. The first is to assume that parasitic <b>gaps</b> are extraction <b>gaps</b> (the extraction analysis); parasitic <b>gaps</b> arise {{by way of the}} same basic mechanism that licenses [...] "normal" [...] extraction <b>gaps.</b> This sort of approach must augment the analysis of extraction <b>gaps</b> in some way in order to accommodate parasitic <b>gaps</b> under the same theoretical umbrella. The alternative approach rejects the analysis that takes parasitic <b>gaps</b> to be extraction <b>gaps.</b> One assumes instead that parasitic <b>gaps</b> actually contain a covert element, this element having the status of definite proform. (the proform analysis). Some analyses mix and match these two basic lines of analysis, although in general, both are well represented in the literature on parasitism and most accounts can be placed in the one or the other camp.|$|R

5|$|Field {{survey for}} the roadway began in January 1931. On July 18 of that year, an {{official}} groundbreaking for Skyline Drive took place. The {{first section of}} the road was to be built from the Rapidan Camp to the Skyland Resort, but would be extended from Swift Run <b>Gap</b> to Thornton <b>Gap.</b> The funds for the first stretch of the drive came from the Federal Drought Relief Administration and employed local farmers and apple pickers who suffered from a severe drought in 1930. In the later part of 1932, Congress approved $1 million (equivalent to $ in ,) in funds to construct Skyline Drive, which would extend from Front Royal to Swift Run <b>Gap.</b> The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was formed in 1933 and would have {{a hand in the}} construction of Skyline Drive. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was impressed with the scenery of the mountains and established the first CCC camps along Skyline Drive. These camps were the first to be placed in a national park. The CCC graded the slopes {{on both sides of the}} roadway, built guardrails and stone walls, constructed overlooks, and planted thousands of trees and shrubs along the parkway. Three different companies were awarded contracts for bituminous surfacing of the road. The section of Skyline Drive between Thornton <b>Gap</b> and Swift Run <b>Gap</b> opened in the middle part of 1934 and cost $1,570,479 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the roadway included the Marys Rock Tunnel, a tunnel that was bored through Marys Rock. A tunnel was constructed at this location as opposed to a cut. The tunnel was justified as a money-saving measure but was also suggested to challenge Bureau of Public Roads and National Park Service landscape architects. With the official establishment of Shenandoah National Park in 1935, the CCC hired 300 men, most of whom were not local to the area, to continue to build Skyline Drive. On October 1, 1936, the drive was completed between Front Royal and Thornton <b>Gap</b> at a cost of $1,235,177 (equivalent to $ in ,). The portion of Skyline Drive from Swift Run <b>Gap</b> to Jarman <b>Gap</b> was opened to traffic on August 29, 1939, costing $1,666,528 (equivalent to $ in ,). The road between Jarman <b>Gap</b> and Rockfish <b>Gap</b> was built as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway and was completed on August 11, 1939, at a cost of $358,636 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the Blue Ridge Parkway was given to Shenandoah National Park in 1961 and became the southernmost portion of Skyline Drive. The creation of the park and the construction of Skyline Drive resulted in many people losing their homes either voluntarily or forcibly; several homes within the present-day park were razed.|$|E

Skyline Drive winds south past Blackrock and turns to the west. The roadway heads north before a hairpin turn to the south at Blackrock <b>Gap,</b> where it closely follows the border between Augusta and Albemarle counties. Further south, Skyline Drive passes the Wildcat Ridge Parking Area before coming to the Crimora Lake Overlook that faces to the west. The roadway continues along past the Turk Mountain Overlook {{on the west side of}} the road prior to reaching the Turk <b>Gap</b> Parking to the east. The drive winding south through Jarman <b>Gap</b> before it curves southwest and continues to the west-facing Calf Mountain Overlook, where it turns to the southeast. Skyline Drive passes through Beagle <b>Gap,</b> winding to the south. The roadway heads to the southwest and west to the north-facing McCormick <b>Gap</b> Overlook, where it curves back to the southwest. The drive continues along and passes through the Rockfish <b>Gap</b> Entrance Station, where a ranger station is located. Past here, the road heads south and comes to a bridge over I-64 before it reaches an interchange with US 250 that provides access to I-64 in Rockfish <b>Gap</b> in Augusta County, which is located east of Waynesboro and west of Charlottesville. At this interchange, Skyline Drive ends and the road continues to the south as the Blue Ridge Parkway.|$|E

At this point Ostojić and Baćović were also questioning Mihailović's plans. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to the Ljubljana <b>Gap</b> independent of Mihailović, and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić's forces already in the Ljubljana <b>Gap</b> to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. When he left Mihailović, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić and the Chetnik detachments commanded by Ostojić and Baćović as well as a large number of refugees.|$|E
40|$|An overlap of two {{sequences}} {{is considered}} an alignment where start and end <b>gaps</b> are ignored. This is also called semi-global alignment because we are globally aligning the two sequences but ignoring trailing <b>gaps</b> at both extremities.

Similarly, end <b>gaps</b> are <b>gaps</b> that occur after the last character of a sequence. Therefore, if the two sequences are x and y, start and end <b>gaps</b> can be either in x or in y.

Consider the following example of aligning x = CAGCACTTGGATTCTCGG and y = CAGCGTGG...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how the prose style of James Joyce's Ulysses provides seductive <b>gaps</b> which by design prompt readers to become co-producers of the text. Joyce strategically creates opportunities for readers to engage actively with the text through response-inviting <b>gaps</b> in the prose. The various types of <b>gaps</b> in the text place demands on readers and, inevitably, upon the author. The more reader-friendly <b>gaps</b> are overdetermined <b>gaps</b> which, by definition, are obvious and point to their own completion. These <b>gaps</b> when filled are, more often than not, confirmed by related references throughout the text. Ulysses, however, also abounds with <b>gaps</b> of indeterminacy. The ambiguous nature of these <b>gaps</b> generates anxiety for readers by undermining the expectations established by overdetermined <b>gaps.</b> Joyce's prose arrangements continually call on readers to play roles and adapt these roles to the linguistic movements of the text. This project endeavours to analyse how different <b>gaps</b> function and the degree to which they work in conjunction to seduce readers and the author into the dual roles of co-production and co-consumption of Ulysses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} gender earnings <b>gaps</b> in Hong Kong {{using the}} 2006 by-census data. To explore {{the sources of}} gender earnings <b>gaps,</b> we decompose the <b>gaps</b> using the method proposed by Machado and Mata (2005). We have three major findings. First, gender earnings <b>gaps</b> are larger both in lower positions and in higher positions in the earnings distribution. Both the "glass ceiling effect" and the "sticky floor effect" exist in Hong Kong. Second, gender earnings <b>gaps</b> in higher positions are much explained by gender differentials in productivity-related characteristics; however, gender earnings <b>gaps</b> in lower positions are barely explained by these characteristics. Third, the effect of occupational segregation on gender earnings <b>gaps</b> depends on specific positions in the earnings distribution. In lower positions, occupational segregation {{is not a big}} problem and has little impact on gender earnings gaps; in higher positions, however, occupational segregation favors male workers and enlarges gender earnings <b>gaps.</b> Gender earnings <b>gaps</b> Glass ceiling effect Sticky floor effect Occupational segregation Quantile decomposition...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gapped</b> domain walls, as topological line defects between (2 + 1) D topologically ordered states, are examined. We provide simple {{criteria}} {{to determine the}} existence of <b>gapped</b> domain walls, which apply to both Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders. Our criteria also determine which (2 + 1) D topological orders must have gapless edge modes, namely, which (1 + 1) D global gravitational anomalies ensure gaplessness. Furthermore, we introduce a new mathematical object, the tunneling matrix W, whose entries are the fusion-space dimensions W[subscript ia], to label different types of <b>gapped</b> domain walls. By studying many examples, we find evidence that the tunneling matrices are powerful quantities to classify different types of <b>gapped</b> domain walls. Since a <b>gapped</b> boundary is a <b>gapped</b> domain wall between a bulk topological order and the vacuum, regarded as the trivial topological order, our theory of <b>gapped</b> domain walls inclusively contains the theory of <b>gapped</b> boundaries. In addition, we derive a topological ground state degeneracy formula, applied to arbitrary orientable spatial 2 -manifolds with <b>gapped</b> domain walls, including closed 2 -manifolds and open 2 -manifolds with <b>gapped</b> boundaries.
