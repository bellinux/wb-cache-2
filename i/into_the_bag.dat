2500|$|Sherbet dips or Sherbet Dabs {{are also}} popular, {{such as the}} Dip Dab by Barratt. They consist of a small packet of sherbet, with a {{lollipop}} sealed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> [...] Once the lollipop has been licked, it can be dipped into the sherbet and then sucked clean, alternatively it can simply be used to shovel the sherbet into the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Hawtrey {{spent most}} of his life living with his mother, who {{suffered}} senile dementia in later years. Another anecdote recounted by Williams describes how during the filming of Carry On Teacher Joan Sims cried out to Hawtrey that his mother's handbag had caught fire after her cigarette ash fell into it. Without batting an eyelid, Hawtrey poured a cup of tea <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> to put out the flames, snapped the handbag shut and continued with his story. Williams also recounted his gathering up of the sandwiches left over from a buffet for the Carry On cast. Williams was envious of Hawtrey's easier acceptance of his sexuality: [...] "He can sit in a bar and pick up sailors and have a wonderful time. I couldn't do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Philippines, copra is {{collected}} as dried [...] "cups" [...] (the meat from one-half of a coconut), which are shipped in large burlap bags. At the shipping point (typically, a dock) the copra is sampled by driving a small metal tube <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> at several points, thus perforating the cups and collecting {{small amounts of}} copra within the tubes. Those samples are measured for aflatoxin contamination. If within standards the bag is shipped. This method leaves the risk that many cups are missed by the random sampling—and seriously contaminated copra might be missed. Because so many small producers are involved, it is impractical to monitor all the farms and drying sites (which is where aflatoxin contamination occurs). The Philippines government continues to work on developing methods for the testing, safety, and minimisation of aflatoxins.|$|E

2500|$|An {{even more}} extreme example was his notorious [...] "sick bag" [...] prank. This {{involved}} carrying {{on to an}} aircraft a tin of Heinz Russian Salad, which he would then surreptitiously empty into an air-sickness bag. At the appropriate point in the flight, he would pretend to vomit loudly and violently <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> Then, to the horror of passengers and crew, he would proceed to eat the contents. One April Fools' Day Humphries placed a roast dinner and glass of champagne in an inner-city rubbish bin. Later in the morning, when there were many businesspeople queuing at a nearby building, Humphries approached {{the group as a}} dirty, dishevelled man. He walked to the bin, opened the lid and proceeded to lift the roast and glass of champagne and drink from the glass. Much to the amazement of watchers-by, he found a suitable seating area and began to eat the meal. Such stunts were the early manifestations of a lifelong interest in the bizarre, discomforting, and subversive.|$|E
