5|$|At {{the first}} {{performances}} of Parsifal {{problems with the}} moving scenery during the transition from scene 1 to scene 2 in act 1 meant that Wagner's existing orchestral interlude finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grail. Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 857 of the Tang Dynasty, the Great East Hall (东大殿) is {{the third}} oldest dated wooden {{building}} in China after the main <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nanchan Temple dated to 782, and the main <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Five Dragons Temple, dated to 831. The hall {{is located on the}} far east side of the temple, atop a large stone platform. It is a single storey structure measuring seven bays by four or 34 by 17.7 metres (110 by 58ft), and is supported by inner and outer sets of columns. On top of each column is a complicated set of brackets containing seven different bracket types that are one-third as high as the column itself. Supporting the roof of the hall, each of the bracket sets are connected by crescent shaped crossbeams, which create an inner ring above the inner set of columns and an outer ring above the outer columns. The hall has a lattice ceiling that conceals much of the roof frame from view. The hipped-roof and the extremely complex bracket sets are testament to the Great East Hall's importance as a structure during the Tang Dynasty. According to the 11th-century architectural treatise, Yingzao Fashi, the Great East Hall closely corresponds to a seventh rank building in a system of eight ranks. The high rank of the Great East Hall indicates that even in the Tang Dynasty it was an important building, and no other buildings from the period with such a high rank survive.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically {{enter the}} house from the High Street to the south, passing through the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main building.

Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche {{displayed}} annually in the Medieval Sculpture <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.|$|E
