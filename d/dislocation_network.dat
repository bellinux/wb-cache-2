50|$|When Mott {{returned}} to Bristol after the war, (during that period, {{he worked on}} the role of plastic deformation on the progression of fracture cracks), his having met and hired of Frederick Charles Frank led both of them to develop, with the help of others such as Frank Nabarro and Alan Cottrell, to attack with the field of dislocations, in which Bristol shone with a new vigor, especially {{at the end of the}} 1940s. If Mott only produced early and somewhat minor contributions to that field, notably on alloy hardening with Nabarro and on the topology of a <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> lowering the apparent elastic constants of a crystal, there is no doubt that Mott's enthusiasm played its role in the three major steps forward in the field by F. C. Frank on crystal growth and plasticity and later, in Cambridge, by P. Hirsch on the thin film electron microscopy.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, creep {{deformation}} behavior of Ni-based single crystal superalloys LSC- 15 were studied. LSC- 15 {{does not include}} Rhenium and has been developed by IHI Corporation Japan. Creep tests were performed at 1000 and 1050 [*]∘C under several stress levels. The {{creep deformation}} behaviour was different between test temperatures at 1000 [*]∘C and 1050 [*]∘C. Moreover, {{the relationship between the}} minimum creep rate and stress was different at the various temperatures. The stress exponent values at 1000 [*]∘C and 1050 [*]∘C, were n = 6 and 12 respectively. This difference was due to differences in the formation of <b>dislocation</b> <b>network.</b> At 1000 [*]∘C, when the minimum creep rate, the <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> formed completely independent of stress level. On the other hand, at 1050 [*]∘C, the <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> had not developed fully at the minimum creep rate and the formation of <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> depended on the stress level. Therefore, stress dependency at 1050 [*]∘C is higher than that at 1000 [*]∘C...|$|E

The twist and tilt misorientations induce two interacting <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks.</b> Advanced bonding techniques are applied and optimized allowing {{to eliminate the}} tilt and to control the twist misorientation.

40|$|The <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> {{generated}} during high-temperature creep {{of several}} single-crystal nickel-based superalloys are analyzed. The networks continually evolve during creep at relatively low temperatures or eventually reach {{a more stable}} configuration at high temperatures. Specifically, the role of these networks in directional coarsening processes are studied, along with their formation kinetics, characteristics, and stability during creep. The {{results of this study}} combined with previous findings suggest that the directional coarsening process is strongly influenced by elastic strain energy. The <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> formed during primary creep are found to be stable during all subsequent creep stages. Aspects of these <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> are determined to be a product of both the applied creep stress and coherency strains...|$|R

The injected atoms can form under-graphene islands, or incorporate into the topmost Ru layer, thereby increasing its density and forming <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks.</b> Density functional calculations imply that Ru islands nucleated between the graphene layer and the substrate are energetically stable; {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) reveals that <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> exist near step edges...|$|R

The interface between InN quantum dots and a (0001) GaN substrate contains three noninteracting sets of regularly-spaced misfit dislocations lying along directions. The network has a "Star of David" form, with each star bounding a hexagonal region which is pseudomorphic. These misfit dislocations form a threading <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> at the island edges due to free surface forces...|$|E
40|$|The average strain {{state of}} Ge films grown on Si(111) by {{surfactant}} mediated epitaxy {{has been compared}} to the ordering of the interfacial misfit <b>dislocation</b> <b>network.</b> Surprisingly, a smaller degree of average lattice relaxation was found in films grown at higher temperature. On the other hand, these films exhibit a better ordered <b>dislocation</b> <b>network.</b> This effect energetically compensates the higher strain at higher growth temperature, leading to the conclusion that, apart from the formation of misfit dislocations, their ordering represents an important channel for lattice-strain energy relaxation...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of grain boundaries in hexagonal materials {{has been studied}} using transmission electron microscopy. On {{the basis of these}} observations, boundaries are classified as low-angle, special or general. Low-angle boundaries are composed of crystal <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks,</b> similar to observations in materials exhibiting other crystal symmetries. Special boundaries contained interfacial <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> accommodating deviations from singular reference structures. Evidence that reference structures are based on 3 -D, 2 -D and 1 -D periodic configurations has been obtained, but further work is required on this topic. An observation of a transition between two structural forms which are characteristic of 3 -D and 1 -D reference structures is also presented. In the 1 -D case, the interfacial structure is incommensurate in one direction, and hence resembles a general boundary in some respects...|$|R
40|$|The power-law {{scaling of}} size effect of {{strength}} in micro-crystals is {{explained in terms}} of an assumed fractal geometry of the initial <b>dislocation</b> <b>network.</b> The size effect arises from the Taylor-type resistance in such a network. The power exponent of the size effect is predicted to be 3 /(q + n), where q is the fractal dimension of the <b>dislocation</b> <b>network,</b> and n is the stress exponent of dislocation velocity.

40|$|Generalized stacking-fault {{energies}} for the {{basal plane}} of graphite are calculated from first principles for slip along two high-symmetry directions. The rhombohedral fault energy compares well with experiment and the anisotropy in behaviour {{is consistent with}} observed <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> geometry. Utilizing these calculated fault energies within a modified Peierls-Nabarro model, we estimate the barrier for basal dislocation motion based on lattice friction. This {{is found to be}} extremely small, from which we conclude that <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> interaction and pinning, rather than the Peierls barrier, must determine the practical shear strength of graphite. However, at low dislocation densities or over small crystalline regions, the shear strength should tend to this lower limit. We discuss the relevance of this to the mechanism of lubrication...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} increasing the radiation resistance of silicon epitaxial layers by creating radiation defects sinks {{in the form of}} <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> of the density of 109 — 1012 m– 2. Such networks are created before the epitaxial layer is applied on the front surface of the silicon substrate by its preliminary oxidation and subsequent etching of the oxide layer. The substrates were silicon wafers KEF- 4. 5 and KDB- 10 with a diameter of about 40 mm, grown by the Czochralski method. Irradiation of the samples was carried out using electron linear accelerator "Electronics" (ЭЛУ- 4). Energy of the particles was 2, 3 — 3, 0 MeV, radiation dose 1015 — 1020 m– 2, electron beam current 2 mA/m 2. It is shown that in structures containing <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks,</b> irradiation results in reduction of the reverse currents by 5 — 8 times and of the density of defects by 5 — 10 times, while the mobility of the charge carriers is increased by 1, 2 times. Wafer yield for operation under radiation exposure, when the semiconductor structures are formed in the optimal mode, is increased by 7 — 10 % compared to the structures without <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks.</b> The results obtained can be used in manufacturing technology for radiation-resistant integrated circuits (bipolar, CMOS, BiCMOS, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy (STM) the Ge epitaxy on a Bi terminated Si(I 11) {{surface is}} compared to the growth without surfactant. During {{the growth of the}} Ge wetting layer in surfactant mediated epitaxy (SME), Si and Ge can be distinguished by different apparent heights in the STM images due to the Bi termination of the surface. As soon as the two bilayer high wetting layer is completed, Ge islands with a flat top and an underlying <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> occur. Elastic distortions due to the <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> result in periodic sub-angstrom height undulations measured by the STM. In this case the Ge islands have the form of a mesa. With increasing Ge coverage, these mesas spread laterally. Beyond a Ge coverage of 10 bilayers, the Ge mesas have coalesced and further Ge deposition leads to a 2 D layer-by-layer growth of Ge on Si(I 11). In epitaxy without the use of a surfactant as well, the formation of Ge islands with an underlying <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> is observed. However, in this case the Ge islands are much higher and show no tendency to coalesce. The partially relaxed islands coexist with another type of tall islands. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{structural}} modifications observed in a buried amorphous Si (α-Si) layer containing high oxygen concentration level (up to ~ 3 at. %) after being implanted at elevated temperature with 16 O+ ions. For implants conducted at temperatures lower than 150 °C, the α-Si layer expands via layer by layer amorphization at {{the front and back}} amorphous–crystalline (a–c) interfaces. When performed at temperatures above 150 °C, the implants lead to the narrowing of the buried a-Si layer through ion beam-induced epitaxial crystallization at both a–c interfaces. Cross section transmission electron microscopy analysis of samples implanted at 400 °C revealed an array of microtwins and a <b>dislocation</b> <b>network</b> band in the recrystallized material.

In addition, edge <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> and defects, including vacancies, substitutions, and interstitials evolve in both the CeO 2 and the underlying YSZ to reduce further this residual misfit.

40|$|Structural alloys for Generation-IV nuclear {{reactors}} need to endure a high neutron dose, high temperature, and corrosive coolant. Austenitic stainless steels, particularly the oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) austenitic steels, are promising candidate materials, but they suffer several limits such as irradiation damage and {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC). This research applies a laser shock peening (LSP) process to improve the radiation and SCC resistance of austenitic stainless steels in simulated nuclear reactor environments. A high density <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks,</b> stacking faults and twin boundaries were generated in the surface region of 304 steels by the shock wave-material interactions in the LSP process. In-situ TEM irradiation experiments suggest that laser-peened 304 steels suffer less radiation damage than the untreated samples because the generated <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> and twin boundaries serve as sinks for the annihilation of irradiation defects. Stress corrosion cracking tests show that transgranular cracks propagate in the untreated 304 steels, while no apparent cracks were observed in laser peened 304 steel samples on the same conditions.

30|$|Despite these advances, {{there is}} a clear {{disconnect}} between these interface constructs and crystal plasticity constitutive models in which interface mediated plasticity is accounted for. To address these shortcomings and to depart from a simple treatment of material interfaces as impenetrable obstacles, different classes of DDD models with increasing level of complexity have been developed. A first class of models consists of introducing dislocation sources in both bulk and material interfaces, which allows modeling the decomposition of dislocations at grain boundaries and the associated plastic straining by glide (grain boundary sliding) and climb (diffusion), as well as slip transfer (Ahmed and Hartmaier 2011; Quek et al. 2014, 2016). A second class of models proposes to add slip transmission and re-emission criteria at material interfaces, which can invoke critical shear stress (Fan et al. 2015), interfacial energy (Li et al. 2009; Hou et al. 2009) -possibly as obtained from atomistic simulations (Zheng et al. 2017)-, or line-tension (de Koning et al. 2002, 2003; Zhou and LeSar 2012). A third class of models consists of explicitly modeling ID as well as their evolution and interactions with bulk <b>dislocations.</b> Discrete <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> were recently used to model the migration of low angle mixed grain boundaries (Lim et al. 2012). <b>Networks</b> of misfit <b>dislocations</b> where used to study Ni-based superalloys (Gao et al. 2015). Discrete intrinsic <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> were also used to simulate their complex interactions with extrinsic dislocations (Fan et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2011, 2012; Yashiro et al. 2006). Discrete <b>dislocation</b> <b>networks</b> can be built from coupled kinematic/energetic considerations (Vattré and Demkowicz 2013, 2015; Vattré et al. 2014 b; Vattré 2017 a, b), or they can be atomistically informed (Burbery et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2014).|$|R
