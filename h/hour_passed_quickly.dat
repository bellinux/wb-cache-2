60|$|The <b>hour</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly</b> away in lively talk, {{and when}} it was ended, the lonesome and {{neglected}} Wilson was richer by two friends than he had been when it began. He invited the twins to look in at his lodgings presently, after disposing of an intervening engagement, and they accepted with pleasure.|$|E
60|$|A man was {{standing}} at the studio door with a large dish into which each person as he went in dropped his half franc. The studio was much fuller {{than it had been in}} the morning, and there was not the preponderance of English and Americans; nor were women there in so large a proportion. Philip felt the assemblage was more the sort of thing he had expected. It was very warm, and the air quickly grew fetid. It was an old man who sat this time, with a vast gray beard, and Philip tried to put into practice the little he had learned in the morning; but he made a poor job of it; he realised that he could not draw nearly as well as he thought. He glanced enviously at one or two sketches of men who sat near him, and wondered whether he would ever be able to use the charcoal with that mastery. The <b>hour</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly.</b> Not wishing to press himself upon Miss Price he sat down at some distance from her, and at the end, as he passed her on his way out, she asked him brusquely how he had got on.|$|E
60|$|The <b>hours</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly.</b> The {{next day}} the last Spaniard was taken; and no sooner had he been forced, {{struggling}} and resisting, from the chamber; than the guard who, since he had taken up his post four hours before, had made no sign to Roger, gave the password agreed upon. The latter {{rose to his feet}} and, with the aid of the native, unfastened the cords that bound his ankles together.|$|R
60|$|If {{she denied}} this, she must defend her belief {{that human beings}} were as various as the beasts at the Zoo, which had stripes and manes, and horns and humps; and so, wrestling over the entire list of their acquaintances, and {{diverging}} into anecdote and theory and speculation, they came to know each other. The <b>hours</b> <b>passed</b> <b>quickly,</b> and seemed to them full to leaking-point. After a night's solitude they were always ready to begin again.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{dare say}} you haven't slept since you arrived. One doesn't on the passage, you know; the twenty <b>hours</b> <b>pass</b> so <b>quickly,</b> and the {{experience}} is so exciting--to US at least. But I suppose as an American you are used to it." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{he went on}} reading, and {{the rest}} of the half <b>hour</b> <b>passed</b> away very <b>quickly.</b> In fact, his mother came out before he got up from his reading, to tell him it was time for him to go. She said she was very glad he had {{submitted}} pleasantly to his punishment, and she gave him something wrapped up in a paper.|$|R
60|$|In story-telling the captain, the doctor, and Glynn shone conspicuous. And {{when all}} was going {{smoothly}} and well, the anecdotes, histories, and romances related by these three were listened to with such intense interest and delight {{by the whole}} crew, that {{one would have thought}} they were enjoying a pleasure trip, and had no cause whatever for anxiety. Gurney, too, and Briant, and Nikel Sling came out frequently in the story-telling line, and were the means of causing many and many an <b>hour</b> to <b>pass</b> <b>quickly</b> and pleasantly by, which would otherwise have hung heavily on the hands of all.|$|R
60|$|But {{most of all}} {{he thought}} of his mother, of how she must have grieved for him as dead, and of the joy there would be at their reunion. The <b>hours</b> {{therefore}} <b>passed</b> <b>quickly,</b> and he could scarcely believe it to be two o'clock when he suddenly saw the light of a fire far way {{toward the end of the}} island. A glance at the stars showed him that the time was correct. He rose to his feet, and taking the lantern held it aloft, then he lowered it behind a bush and twice raised it again. He knew exactly the direction in which the harbor lay, and no sooner had he put down the lantern for the third time than three flashes of light followed in close succession.|$|R
60|$|Slowly and reluctantly Mrs. Haden {{passed along}} the row. The sad errand {{on which she}} was going was one that has often to be {{discharged}} in a large colliery village. The women who had seen Bill go in were still at their doors, and had been joined by others. The news {{that he had come}} in at this unusual <b>hour</b> had <b>passed</b> about <b>quickly,</b> and there was a general feeling of uneasiness among the women, all of whom had husbands or relatives below ground. When, therefore, Jane Haden came out with signs of tears on her cheeks, her neighbours on either side at once assailed her with questions.|$|R
60|$|But {{the mood}} <b>passed</b> <b>quickly,</b> {{and in a}} moment she was seized with dismay.|$|R

60|$|After <b>passing</b> <b>quickly</b> along several streets, {{the men who}} {{led them}} stopped and relaxed their hold.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce did not wave to them, but <b>passed</b> <b>quickly,</b> {{between the}} yew-trees, through the wicket-gate....|$|R
60|$|She {{was driven}} there, and <b>passed</b> <b>quickly</b> {{through the hall}} and entered the lift. The commissionaire hurried up to her.|$|R

60|$|Another <b>hour</b> <b>passed,</b> and {{the woman}} {{appeared}} again bearing a letter.|$|R
60|$|An <b>hour</b> <b>passed,</b> {{a second}} <b>hour</b> <b>passed.</b> There was nothing. He {{sat at his}} desk {{as though he were}} writing, but he neither wrote nor read. He merely listened. He {{strained}} his ears for a sound travelling from a far distance. At last he heard hesitating footsteps and knew it was the Chinese cook.|$|R
60|$|For a moment, a {{reflection}} of the terror which had seized him flashed in her own face. It <b>passed</b> <b>quickly</b> away. She laughed mockingly.|$|R
60|$|One, two, three <b>hours</b> <b>passed,</b> and yet no arrest {{had been}} made.|$|R
60|$|The <b>hours</b> <b>passed</b> slowly; {{the heat}} in the bottom, as the sun, almost overhead, poured its rays down into it, was very great. As the <b>hours</b> <b>passed</b> on the heat became less oppressive, but it was with intense {{pleasure}} that the boys saw Mr Harvey suddenly appear on the brow, and checking his horse gaze into the valley.|$|R
6000|$|Demorest <b>passed</b> <b>quickly</b> {{down the}} steps and disappeared. At the same moment a voice came from the {{banisters}} of the landing above. [...] "Who's there?" ...|$|R

50|$|Mankiewicz's rancor toward Welles grew {{over the}} {{remaining}} 12 {{years of his}} life. Welles's irritation with Mankiewicz <b>passed</b> <b>quickly,</b> and he spoke of him with fondness.|$|R
