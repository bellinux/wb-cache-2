5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E

5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|After the {{acquisition}} of Jay Cutler, Hester took on the role as the de facto number one wide receiver. In {{the first game of}} the season, Hester caught seven passes from Cutler for 90 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown reception. In the following weeks Hester began to develop a rapport with Cutler and amassed 634 receiving yards and three touchdowns though the first ten weeks of the season. He played the best game of the season on October 25, 2009 against the Cincinnati Bengals, catching eight passes for 101 yards and a touchdown. In a game against the St. Louis Rams during the thirteenth week of the season, Hester injured his calf and missed three starts. Hester returned to play in the Bears season finale against the Detroit Lions, catching three passes for 75 yards. Despite missing the three starts, Hester led the team with 757 receiving yards, and finished behind Greg Olsen in receptions. Hester built his reputation around his kick returning abilities, but his kickoff-returning duties decreased significantly following the 2007 season finale. He told the Chicago Tribune that he plans on spending the offseason honing his receiving and returning skills by strengthening <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> especially to fully recover from the calf injury he sustained earlier.|$|E

The cricket news site Cricinfo reported that these injuries may be due to genetic disorders or a dietary deficiency at a young age.|$|E

In 1880, he painted a portrait there of the opera singer Émilie Ambre as Carmen.

25|$|Yuen {{let their}} body style develop and then worked with each actor's strength. He built on Reeves' diligence, Fishburne's resilience, Weaving's precision, and Moss's {{feminine}} grace. Yuen designed Moss' moves to suit her deftness and lightness. Prior to the pre-production, Reeves suffered a two-level fusion of his cervical spine which {{had begun to}} cause paralysis <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> requiring him to undergo neck surgery. He was still recovering {{by the time of}} pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film. Weaving had to undergo a hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{believes}} {{that he needs to}} work on his turn of pace and also improve his heading ability, and considers these as his main weaknesses. Former manager Darren Ferguson said [...] "there might be those who say he lacks a little bit of pace but what he does not have <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> he has in his head". In his career, Boyd has only ever scored three headed goals, and says that he is much more comfortable with the ball at his feet.|$|E

The pipe-smoking Scot was, however, the only man of the crew that Shackleton was [...] "not dead certain of". His Scots accent was described as rasping like [...] "frayed cable wire".|$|E

Campbell at first maintained the ailments were genetic, but said in 2012, [...] "I think some of it came from playing football, playing the way I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Dennis QC, for the prosecution, {{argued that}} Harwood's {{use of force}} against Tomlinson had been {{unnecessary}} and unreasonable, and had caused Tomlinson's death. He argued that a [...] "clear temporal link" [...] between the incident and Tomlinson's collapse had been provided by the Guardian video, that Tomlinson had posed no threat, and that the use of force had been a [...] "gratuitous act of aggression." [...] The defence argued that Tomlinson's health was relevant. The court heard that he had liver and brain disease caused by alcohol abuse, numbness <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and balance problems, and that he had been treated at least 20 times between 2007 and 2009, mostly at A departments, related to falling while drunk. On the day he died, The Times reported, he had drunk a bottle of red wine, a small bottle of vodka and several cans of 9-per-cent super-strength lager.|$|E
500|$|It is {{impossible}} to be certain about what caused Daniel Lambert's extreme weight, but it is considered unlikely to {{have been caused by}} an endocrine (glandular) or genetic disorder. Other than his weight gain, he showed no symptoms of a thyroid disorder, and none of his many portraits show the moon face of a patient with Cushing's syndrome. Patients with Bardet–Biedl syndrome and Prader–Willi syndrome, genetic syndromes which can lead to obesity in patients, also suffer from learning disabilities and muscular weakness, but all those who knew Lambert agreed that he was highly intelligent, was extremely strong physically, and, except for erysipelas and venous insufficiency (varicose veins) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> did not suffer from any health problems. One contemporary commentator remarked that [...] "Mr. Lambert scarcely knows {{what it is to be}} ailing or indisposed". Lambert's only recorded psychological problem was an occasional [...] "depression of the spirits", during his time in London. Although he had an aunt and uncle who were overweight, his parents and surviving siblings remained of normal build throughout their lives.|$|E
