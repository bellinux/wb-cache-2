40|$|Consistent with a {{life course}} and social contextual approach, this study proposes a {{reciprocal}} relationship between stressful life <b>events</b> <b>and</b> emotional distress during the transition from adolescence to early adulthood. Study predictions included continuity of <b>events</b> <b>and</b> distress, and reciprocal causation between <b>events</b> <b>and</b> distress. SEM analysis of longitudinal, prospective data from 526 white, rural targets largely supported study expectations. Stressful <b>events</b> <b>and</b> distress showed stability over time, and a degree of reciprocity between <b>events</b> <b>and</b> distress was observed. At each of three time points, stressful events predicted psychological distress, and psychological distress at mid- <b>and</b> late-adolescence predicted <b>events</b> at early adulthood. Possible direct and buffering effects of resource were also examined, including, financial, self-concept, and social support. Analysis of resource models revealed a direct and buffering influence of financial resources...|$|R

By using event chain diagrams to visualize <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>event</b> chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.|$|R
