40|$|We {{consider}} binary deletion channels with a segmentation assumption {{which appears}} to be suited for more practical scenarios. Unlike the binary independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) deletion channel where each bit is independently deleted with an equal probability, the segmentation assumption prohibits certain transmitted bits to be deleted, i. e., in a block of bits of a certain length, {{only a limited number of}} deletions can occur. We first propose several upper and lower capacity bounds for the segmented deletion channel.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We develop an {{information}} theoretic characterization and a practical coding approach for segmented deletion channels. Compared to channels with independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) deletions, where each bit is independently deleted {{with an equal}} probability, the segmentation assumption imposes certain constraints, i. e., in a block of bits of a certain length, {{only a limited number}} of deletions are allowed to occur. This channel model has recently been proposed and motivated by the fact that for practical systems, when a deletion error occurs, it is more likely that the next one will not appear very soon. We first argue that such channels are information stable, hence their channel capacity exists. Then, we introduce several upper and lower bounds with two different methods in an attempt to understand the channel capacity behavior. The first scheme utilizes certain information provided to the transmitter and/or receiver while the second one explores the asymptotic behavior of the bounds when the average bit deletion rate is small. In the second part of the paper, we consider a practical channel coding approach over a segmented deletion channel. Specifically, we utilize outer LDPC codes concatenated with <b>inner</b> <b>marker</b> codes, and develop suitable channel detection algorithms for this scenario. Different maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) based channel synchronization algorithms operating at the bit and symbol levels are introduced, and specific LDPC code designs are explored. Simulation results clearly indicate the advantages of the proposed approach. In particular, for the entire range of deletion probabilities less than unity, our scheme offers a significantly larger transmission rate compared to the other existing solutions in the literature...|$|E
40|$|In vertebrates, {{the inner}} ear arises from the otic placode, a {{thickened}} swathe of ectoderm that invaginates to form the otic vesicle. We report that histone demethylase KDM 4 B is dynamically expressed during early stages of chick inner ear formation. A loss of KDM 4 B results in defective invagination and striking morphological changes in the otic epithelium, characterized by abnormal localization of adhesion and cytoskeletal molecules and reduced expression of several <b>inner</b> ear <b>markers,</b> including Dlx 3. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals direct and dynamic occupancy of KDM 4 B and its target, H 3 K 9 me 3, at regulatory regions of the Dlx 3 locus.

Probe localization was determined by examining membrane, periplasmic, and cytosolic protein fractions.

NHS-A- and NHS-LC-biotin were also shown to label a specific <b>inner</b> membrane <b>marker</b> protein (Tet-LacZ). Both probes, however, failed to label a cytosolic marker (the omega fragment of beta-galactosidase).

Outer and inner membrane fractions isolated by this method contained less than 1 and 2 %, respectively, of the total lactate dehydrogenase activity (soluble marker) in cell lysate. More importantly, the purified outer membranes contained less than 4 % contamination by the C subunit of F 1 /F 0 ATPase (<b>inner</b> membrane <b>marker).</b> Very little flagellin protein was present in the outer membrane sample. This indicated that the outer membranes were relatively free of contamination by cytoplasmic, inner membrane or flagellar components. The outer membrane fractions (rho = 1. 19 g/cm 3) contained 0. 15 mg (dry weight) of protein per mg. Inner membrane samples (rho = 1. 12 g/cm 3) contained 0. 60 mg (dry weight) of protein per mg.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and nonequilibrium pH gel electrophoresis-SDS-PAGE analyses of inner and outer membrane samples revealed several proteins unique to the inner membrane and 20 proteins that localized specifically to the outer membrane.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{premixed}} turbulent methane/air jet flames {{in the thin}} reaction zone (TRZ) and distributed reaction zone (DRZ) regimes were studied using simultaneous three-scalar high-resolution imaging measurements, including HCO/OH/CH 2 O, CH/OH/CH 2 O, T/OH/CH 2 O and T/CH/OH/. These scalar fields offer a possibility of revisiting the structures of turbulent premixed flames in different combustion regimes. In particular, CH 2 O provides {{a measure of the}} preheat zone, CH/HCO a measure of the inner layer of the reaction zone, and OH a measure of the oxidation zone. Scalar correlations are analyzed on both single-shot and statistical basis, and resolvable correlated structures of ∼ 100 µm between scalars are captured. With increasing turbulence intensity, it is shown that the preheat zone and the inner layer of the reaction zone become gradually broadened/distributed, and the correlation between HCO and [OH]LIF×[CH 2 O]LIF decreases. A transition from the TRZ regime to the DRZ regime is found around Karlovitz number of 70 – 100. The physical and chemical effects on the broadening of the flame are investigated. In the TRZ regime the <b>inner</b> layer <b>marker</b> CH and HCO remains thin in general although occasional local broadening of CH/HCO could be observed. Furthermore, there is a significant probability of finding CH and HCO at rather low temperatures even in the TRZ regime. In the DRZ regime, the broadening of CH and HCO are shown to be mainly a result of local reactions facilitated by rapid turbulent transport of radicals and intermediate reactants in the upstream of the reaction paths. Differential diffusion is expected to have an important effect in the DRZ regime, as H radicals seemingly play a more important role than OH radicals...|$|R

40|$|Clusterin has {{previously}} {{been identified as a}} gene potentially involved in development of the cochlear sensory epithelium. In {{order to be able to}} predict the cellular roles that clusterin may play in the development of this organ, an understanding of the spatiotemporal expression pattern is required. Therefore, clusterin gene expression during mouse inner ear development was studied using riboprobes from the mouse gene. Clusterin mRNA demonstrates a dynamic expression pattern within the developing cochlear sensory epithelium. Clusterin mRNA expression is initiated at 12. 5 dpc (days post coitum) along the entire length of the cochlear sensory epithelium. Throughout in utero development, expression is maintained but becomes progressively restricted in this sensory epithelium. Postnataly expression resolves to specific cellular regions, but clusterin expression ceases at some time point between P 2 -P 17. The analysis of clusterin protein expression revealed this was not restricted to the developing sensory epithelium alone, but also was detected transiently in the periotic mesenchye, otic capsule, as well as Reissner’s membrane, a non-sensory epithelium. The detailed localisation of clusterin was compared to other <b>inner</b> ear <b>markers.</b> Using α and β tectorin mRNA markers, clusterin mRNA was shown to localise to the developing inner and outer sulcus and spiral prominence. Clusterin expression also overlaps with both Myosin VIIA and Prox 1, markers for hair cells and supporting cells respectively. Clusterin mRNA and protein was absent from the developing mouse vestibular system. In order to study the regulatory mechanisms underlying inner ear clusterin expression, a clusterin BAC was modified by insertion of ZsGreen reporter gene into clusterin genomic regions using recombineering technique. The pronuclear injection of this construct has not been successful so far although these studies are ongoing. Finally in order to determine the fate of clusterin expressing cells after the expression is ceased in the inner ear, clusterin BAC was modified by insertion of Cre recombinant gene at the same location as ZsGreen gene for the generation of Cre transgenic mouse. This transgenic mouse will be crossed with a silent reporter mouse for future clusterin fate mapping studies...|$|R

Its biochemical {{function is}} to process rRNA for ribosome biogenesis, {{and it has been}} shown {{to play a role in}} digestive organ development in zebrafish. Here we analyzed the role of RBM 19 during mouse embryonic development by generating mice containing a mutation in the Rbm 19 locus via gene-trap insertion. Results Homozygous mutant embryos failed to develop beyond the morula stage, showing defective nucleologenesis, activation of apoptosis, and upregulation of P 53 target genes. A unique feature of RBM 19 is its localization to the cytoplasm in morula stage-embryos, whereas most other nucleolar proteins are localized to the nucleolar precursor body (NPB). The nucleoli in the Rbm 19 mutant embryos remain immature, yet they can carry out rRNA synthesis. The timing of developmental arrest occurs after expression of the <b>inner</b> cell mass <b>markers</b> OCT 3 / 4 and NANOG, but prior to the specification of trophectoderm as reflected by CDX 2 expression.

40|$|AbstractDendritic cells express DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin (CTL) {{that binds}} {{a variety of}} {{pathogens}} and facilitates their uptake for subsequent antigen presentation. DC-SIGN forms remarkably stable microdomains on the plasma membrane. However, <b>inner</b> leaflet lipid <b>markers</b> are able to diffuse through these microdomains suggesting that, rather than being densely packed with DC-SIGN proteins, an elemental substructure exists. Therefore, a super-resolution imaging technique, Blink Microscopy (Blink), was applied to further investigate the lateral distribution of DC-SIGN. Blink indicates that DC-SIGN, another CTL (CD 206), and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) are all localized in small (∼ 80  nm in diameter) nanodomains. DC-SIGN and CD 206 nanodomains are randomly distributed on the plasma membrane, whereas HA nanodomains cluster on length scales up to several microns. We estimate, as a lower limit, that DC-SIGN and HA nanodomains contain on average two tetramers or two trimers, respectively, whereas CD 206 is often nonoligomerized. Two-color Blink determined that different CTLs rarely occupy the same nanodomain, although they appear colocalized using wide-field microscopy. What to our knowledge is a novel domain structure emerges in which elemental nanodomains, potentially capable of binding viruses, are organized in a random fashion; evidently, these nanodomains can be clustered into larger microdomains that act as receptor platforms for larger pathogens like yeasts...|$|R

Transplant recipients were nine albino athymic nu/nu rats with a normal retina. The donor tissue was dissected from fetuses of 12 – 17 weeks gestational age. Transplants were analyzed at 5 – 12 months after surgery by light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry with various antibodies specific for rhodopsin, S-antigen, transducin, neurofilament and synaptophysin. In 4 of 11 transplants, the RPE stayed as a monolayer sheet and supported {{the development of the}} retinal sheet with a normal lamination, including photoreceptor inner and outer segments. Cones and rods in the organized transplants were labeled with different photoreceptor <b>markers.</b> <b>Inner</b> and outer plexiform layers, containing cone pedicles and rods spherules, were immunoreactive for synaptophysin. As the recipients had a normal retina, transplant/host integration was not expected. However, at the transplant/host interface, there were sometimes areas without glial barriers, and neurofilament-containing processes could be observed crossing between transplant and host. In other, more disorganized transplants, the RPE cells were partially dispersed or clumped together in clusters. Such transplants developed photoreceptors in rosettes, often with inner and outer segments. In conclusion, sheets of human fetal retina transplanted together with its RPE to the subretinal space of nude rats can develop and maintain perfectly laminated transplants after long survival times, indicating the potential of applying cotransplantation to human patients with retinal diseases...|$|R

Embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells {{have been shown}} to reduce experimental liver fibrosis but have potential limitations, including the formation of dysplastic precursors, tumors, and profibrogenic cells. Other stem-like cells may reduce hepatic inflammation and fibrosis without tumor and profibrogenic cell formation. To test this hypothesis we transplanted human amnion epithelial cells (hAEC), isolated from term delivered placenta, into immunocompetent C 57 /BL 6 mice at week 2 of a 4 -week regimen of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) exposure to induce liver fibrosis. Two weeks following hAEC infusion, intact cells expressing the human-specific <b>markers</b> <b>inner</b> mitochondrial membrane protein and human leukocyte antigen-G were found in mouse liver without evidence of host rejection of the transplanted cells. Human albumin, known to be produced by hAEC, was detected in sera of hAEC-treated mice. Human DNA was detected in mouse liver and also spleen, lungs, and heart of some animals. Following hAEC transplantation, CCl 4 -treated animals showed decreased serum ALT levels and reduced hepatocyte apoptosis, compared to controls. hAEC-treated mouse liver had lower TNF-α and IL- 6 protein levels and higher IL- 10 compared to animals given CCl 4 alone. Compared to CCl 4 controls, hAEC-treated mice showed fewer activated collagen-producing hepatic stellate cells and less fibrosis area and collagen content. Reduced hepatic TGF-β levels in conjunction with a twofold increase in the active form of the collagen-degrading enzyme matrix metalloproteinase- 2 in hAEC-treated mice compared to CCl 4 controls may account for the reduction in fibrosis. hAEC transplantation into immunocompetent mice leads to cell engraftment, reduced hepatocyte apoptosis, and decreased hepatic inflammation and fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of cytochrome oxidase (an <b>inner</b> mitochondrial membrane <b>marker)</b> in mouse mammary gland homogenates {{was found to}} increase five- to sixfold from late pregnancy to day 8 of lactation, while that of monoamine oxidase (an outer membrane marker) increased only about 25 %. The specific {{activity of}} cytochrome oxidase in the isolated mitochondria decreased slightly {{over the same period}} while the specific activity of monoamine oxidase decreased fivefold. This reflects the fact that both cytochrome oxidase and mitochondrial protein are increasing at a much greater rate than is monoamine oxidase activity. Mixing experiments preclude the possibility that the release or removal of an inhibitor or stimulator produces the changes in enzymatic activity. The cytochrome oxidase to monoamine oxidase ratio was followed throughout the pregnancy-lactation cycle in total mammary homogenates, isolated mammary parenchymal cells, and isolated mammary mitochondria. In each preparation the pattern was the same with little change in the ratio until late pregnancy; and then a three- to fourfold increase occurred and the values reached a maximum by day 8 of lactation. These experiments were interpreted as demonstrating that the observed enzymatic changes are reflective of alterations in the mitochondria of the mammary parenchymal cell population. Electron micrographs of mid-pregnant and mid-lactating mammary parenchymal cells in situ were prepared, and distinct changes in the mitochondrial morphology noted. The most significant and obvious change is the large {{increase in the number of}} inner membrane cristae and an increase in matrix density in the lactating gland cell. Therefore, both enzymatic and morphological studies support the concept of an expansion of the mitochondrial inner membrane during presecretory differentiation in the mouse mammary parenchymal cell...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is an age-dependent {{neurodegenerative disease}} that causes motor neuron degeneration, paralysis and death. Mutations in Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) are one {{cause for the}} familial form of this disease. Transgenic mice expressing mutant SOD 1 develop age-dependent motor neuron degeneration, skeletal muscle weakness, paralysis and death similar to humans. The mechanism whereby mutant SOD 1 induces motor neuron degeneration is not understood but widespread mitochondrial vacuolation has been observed during early phases of motor neuron degeneration. How this vacuolation develops is not clear, but could involve autophagic vacuolation, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) or uncharacterized mechanisms. To determine which of these possibilities are true, we examined the vacuolar patterns in detail in transgenic mice expressing mutant SOD 1 G 93 A. RESULTS: Vacuolar patterns revealed by electron microscopy (EM) suggest that vacuoles originate from {{the expansion of the}} mitochondrial intermembrane space and extension of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Immunofluorescence microscopy and immuno-gold electron microscopy reveal that vacuoles are bounded by SOD 1 and mitochondrial outer membrane <b>markers,</b> but the <b>inner</b> mitochondrial membrane <b>marker</b> is located in focal areas inside the vacuoles. Small vacuoles contain cytochrome c while large vacuoles are porous and lack cytochrome c. Vacuoles lack lysosomal signal but contain abundant peroxisomes and SOD 1 aggregates. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that mutant SOD 1, possibly by toxicity associated with its aggregation, causes mitochondrial degeneration by inducing extension and leakage of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and expansion of the intermembrane space. This could release the pro-cell death molecules normally residing in the intermembrane space and initiate motor neuron degeneration. This Mitochondrial Vacuolation by Intermembrane Space Expansion (MVISE) fits neither MPT nor autophagic vacuolation mechanisms, and thus, is a previously uncharacterized mechanism of mitochondrial degeneration in mammalian CNS...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGenetic {{studies in}} fish, amphibia, and mice {{have shown that}} {{deficiency}} of Nodal signaling blocks differentiation into mesoderm and endoderm. Thus, Nodal is considered as a major inducer of mesendoderm during gastrulation. On this basis, Nodal {{is a candidate for}} controlling differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into tissue lineages with potential clinical value. We have investigated the effect of Nodal, both as a recombinant protein and as a constitutively expressed transgene, on differentiation of hESCs. When control hESCs were grown in chemically defined medium, their expression of markers of pluripotency progressively decreased, while expression of neuroectoderm markers was strongly upregulated, thus revealing a neuroectodermal default mechanism for differentiation in this system. hESCs cultured in recombinant Nodal, by contrast, showed prolonged expression of pluripotency marker genes and reduced induction of neuroectoderm markers. These Nodal effects were accentuated in hESCs expressing a Nodal transgene, with striking morphogenetic consequences. Nodal-expressing hESCs developing as embryoid bodies contained an outer layer of visceral endoderm-like cells surrounding an inner layer of epiblast-like cells, each layer having distinct gene expression patterns. Markers of neuroectoderm were not upregulated during development of Nodal-expressing embryoid bodies, nor was there induction of markers for definitive mesoderm or endoderm differentiation. Moreover, the <b>inner</b> layer expressed <b>markers</b> of pluripotency, characteristic of undifferentiated hESCs and of epiblast in mouse embryos. These results could be accounted for by an inhibitory effect of Nodal-induced visceral endoderm on pluripotent cell differentiation into mesoderm and endoderm, with a concomitant inhibition of neuroectoderm differentiation by Nodal itself. There could also be a direct effect of Nodal in the maintenance of pluripotency. In summary, analysis of the Nodal-expressing phenotype suggests a function for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) growth factor superfamily in pluripotency and in early cell fate decisions leading to primary tissue layers during in vitro development of pluripotent human stem cells. The effects of Nodal on early differentiation illustrate how hESCs can augment mouse embryos as a model for analyzing mechanisms of early mammalian development...|$|R
40|$|Background Keratins are a {{multigene family}} of {{intermediate}} filament proteins that are differentially expressed in specific epithelial tissues. To date, no type II keratins specific for the inner root sheath {{of the human}} hair follicle have been identified. Objectives To characterize a novel type II keratin in mice and humans. Methods Gene sequences were aligned and compared by BLAST analysis. Genomic DNA and mRNA sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed by direct sequencing. Gene expression was analysed by reverse transcription (RT) –PCR in mouse and human tissues. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a C-terminal peptide derived from the mouse K 6 irs protein. Protein expression in murine tissues was examined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Results Analysis of human expressed sequence tag (EST) data generated by the Human Genome Project revealed a fragment of a novel cytokeratin mRNA with characteristic amino acid substitutions in the 2 B domain. No further human ESTs {{were found in the}} database; however, the complete human gene was identified in the draft genome sequence and several mouse ESTs were identified, allowing assembly of the murine mRNA. Both species' mRNA sequences and the human gene were confirmed experimentally by PCR and direct sequencing. The human gene spans more than 16 kb of genomic DNA and is located in the type II keratin cluster on chromosome 12 q. A comprehensive immunohistochemical survey of expression in the adult mouse by immunofluorescence revealed that this novel keratin is expressed only in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. Immunoblotting of murine epidermal keratin extracts revealed that this protein is specific to the anagen phase of the hair cycle, as one would expect of an <b>inner</b> root sheath <b>marker.</b> In humans, expression of this keratin was confirmed by RT–PCR using mRNA derived from plucked anagen hairs and epidermal biopsy material. By this means, strong expression was detected in human hair follicles from scalp and eyebrow. Expression was also readily detected in human palmoplantar epidermis; however, no expression was detected in face skin despite the presence of fine hairs histologically. Conclusions This new keratin, designated K 6 irs, is a valuable histological <b>marker</b> for the <b>inner</b> root sheath of hair follicles in mice and humans. In addition, this keratin represents a new candidate gene for inherited structural hair defects such as loose anagen syndrome...|$|R
