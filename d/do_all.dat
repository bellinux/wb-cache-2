5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} arthropods, such as centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, and spiders, {{are sometimes}} confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar, sharing (as <b>do</b> <b>all</b> arthropods) a jointed exoskeleton. However, upon closer examination, their features differ significantly; most noticeably, {{they do not}} have the six-legged characteristic of adult insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficult}} {{habitat and}} retiring {{nature of the}} invisible rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse, and there are few confirmed sightings. Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects. It also feeds at cut sago plants, although {{it is unclear whether}} it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items. It swallows small stones, as <b>do</b> <b>all</b> rails, to help break up its food in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 2,000 species of antlion {{found in most}} parts of the world, with the {{greatest}} diversity being in warmer areas. The best known species are those in which the larvae dig pits to trap their prey, but by no means <b>do</b> <b>all</b> species do this. Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including open woodland floors, scrub-clad dunes, hedge bases, river banks, road verges, under raised buildings and in vacant lots.|$|E

Smith would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> {{schoolwork}} twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors catching his sham. When he had a test, he would take it twice and then turn it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered Burdell membership.|$|E

This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a conference at the Hall of Hearts; Friend Bear, Secret Bear and Christy's friends later join them.|$|E

He debuted for the club on 6 February, coming on as a second-half substitute for Vicente Gómez in a 1−0 loss away to Granada, and made his first start the following week in a loss to Sevilla by the same scoreline.|$|E

Rampal, {{in the role of}} Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original but with an emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP DeSilva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film.|$|E

5|$|Foiled at the AOC, boycott advocates {{turned to}} the AAU, hoping that the {{athletics}} organization, though also led by Brundage, would refuse to certify athletes for Berlin. Although no vote took place on a boycott at the AAU's December 1934 meeting, Brundage did not seek re-election, and delegates elected Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney as the new president, to take office in 1935. Although pro-boycott activities briefly fell into a lull, renewed Nazi brutality against the Jews in June 1935 sparked a resurgence, and converted Mahoney to the pro-boycott cause. In October, Baillet-Latour wrote to the three American IOC members: William May Garland, Charles Sherrill, and Ernest Lee Jahncke, asking them to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> they could to ensure a US team was sent to Germany. Garland and Sherrill agreed; Jahncke, however, refused, stating {{that he would be}} supporting the boycott. Brundage, at Baillet-Latour's request, took the lead in the anti-boycott campaign. Matters came to a head at the AAU convention in December 1935. Brundage's forces won the key votes, and the AAU approved sending a team to Berlin, specifying that this did not mean it supported the Nazis. In victory, Brundage was not magnanimous, demanding the resignation of opponents. Although not all quit, Mahoney did.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth United States Army {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} Australia. Since Sixth Army would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the planning, {{and there was}} as yet little scope for corps-sized operations, Eichelberger found himself with a training role, preparing the 24th Infantry Division, which had arrived from Hawaii, and the 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions, which had returned from Papua, for future missions. The War Department asked in May 1943 if Eichelberger could be released to command the First United States Army, but MacArthur would not release him. Later, it {{asked if he could}} be released to command the Ninth United States Army, but this was also refused, and this job went to Eichelberger's West Point classmate William H. Simpson. Instead, he was given responsibility for Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to Australia in September 1943. She visited Sydney and Melbourne, and had dinner with the Governor General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, many United Nations {{agencies}} such as the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNICEF maintain specific programs on women's health, or maternal, sexual and reproductive health. In addition the United Nations global goals address many issues related to women's health, both directly and indirectly. These include the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and their successor, the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, following the report on progress towards the MDGs (The Millennium Development Goals Report 2015). For instance the eight MDG goals, eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child mortality rates, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and developing a global partnership for development, all impact on women's health, as <b>do</b> <b>all</b> seventeen SDG goals, in addition to the specific SDG5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.|$|E

He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing {{some of the things}} on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E
5|$|The conversion, said Belhaven, {{would enable}} James Francis Edward's {{accession}} to the English throne upon William III's death. The Queen-Regent was not swayed by Belhaven's argument, so a compromise was reached: James Francis Edward, if he became King, {{would limit the}} number of Roman Catholic priests in England and promise not to tamper with the established Church of England. In exchange, the confederate Lords would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> in their power to block the passing of the Hanoverian succession in Scottish parliament. When, in March 1702, William III died, Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, declared for James Francis Edward at Inverness. Soon after, Lovat travelled to the court-in-exile at Saint-Germain, and begged the Queen-Regent to allow her son to come to Scotland. Lovat intended to raise an army of 15,000 soldiers in Scotland, to seize the throne for James Francis Edward. Mary refused to part with James Francis Edward, and the rising failed. Mary's regency ceased with her son's reaching of the age of 16.|$|E
5|$|The three {{beings are}} {{discovered}} to be reptilian humanoids, {{and in a}} scuffle, they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the beings are {{a new form of}} Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; {{she is a member of}} the warrior caste, awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as <b>do</b> <b>all</b> Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an act of war. The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him.|$|E
