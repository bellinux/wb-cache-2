Penn via rear naked choke at 4:39 of the first round, in a fight he was heavily favored to win. The title was vacated upon a contract dispute between Penn and UFC who promptly stripped him of the welterweight title, claiming Penn had breached his contract and that the signing constituted him refusing to defend his title. Penn filed suit against UFC and publicized <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict, claiming his contract had expired. Penn filed a motion to stop UFC from awarding a new welterweight title, but that motion was denied.|$|E

Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing.

Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy.

5|$|The terms {{by which}} Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were {{that he should}} remove his forts and armies on the {{frontier}} at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum. Since the Sultan had already failed to keep <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum. Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire. The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the Battle of Manzikert, 105 years earlier, to restore {{the reputation of the}} empire. Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century. In western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Potential presidential {{candidates}} are vetted by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ("PEC"). The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny {{a certificate of}} eligibility. Its decision {{is not subject to}} legal or political scrutiny, and its verdict is final. There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan, who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, was denied a certificate of eligibility. Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter, he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character. Subsequently, Kuan was denied a certificate, the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to the experience of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million, as required by the Constitution. There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates, and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. As a result, the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term.|$|E
