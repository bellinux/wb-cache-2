[...] If the region is already in unrest (already has one or more revolt markers), a battle must occur {{to determine if the}} player still controls the region. A battle triggered by this action involves placing 1 <b>Farmer</b> <b>army</b> for each revolt marker into the cube tower along with any <b>Farmer</b> <b>armies</b> currently in the cup of the tower. A successful revolt will cause the player to lose the region, all buildings will be destroyed, and he receives none of the income from the territory.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant <b>farmers.</b> The White <b>Army</b> controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|R
50|$|The 13th {{century was}} a costly {{time for the}} local lords. They were {{expected}} to provide soldiers for the English monarchy and its overseas wars and also enjoy a lavish lifestyle. Thus it was seen {{that part of the}} decision to construct these bastide villages was economic as well as with security in mind. In feudalism, the local population swore loyalty to a lord. These locals paid taxes (tithes) out of whatever they could produce and sell. A lord kept law and order: police, judge and jury all in one, enforced by his <b>army.</b> <b>Farmers</b> didn't make a lot of money, and mostly grew grain and raised enough cattle to live on, with only a little left over. Lords needed another way to finance their lavish lifestyles and the crusades, plus whatever demands the church also made for financial support.

50|$|Mountain {{men were}} ethnically, socially, and religiously diverse, fitting no ready stereotype. While they {{considered}} themselves independent they were, in fact, an economic {{arm of the}} big fur companies which held annual fairs, known as trappers' rendezvous, for the mountain men to sell their wares. Most mountain men were born in Canada, the United States, or in Spanish-governed Mexican territories, although some European immigrants also moved west in search of financial opportunity, and the French and British both had long-standing active fur-trading industries in Canada. Like any businessmen, mountain men were primarily motivated by profit, trading with Native Americans, trapping for beaver and other skins, and selling the skins, although some few {{were more interested in}} exploring the West and traded solely to support their passion. As such, most of them were part trader, part explorer, part exploiter, part trapper, part teamster and part settler; some were also <b>farmers</b> or occasional (<b>army)</b> hired scouts; and most survived by having good relations with one or more native tribes, and so were multilingual out of necessity. They quite frequently lived part of the year (mainly winters) with Amerindians, and often took Native American wives in the normal course of human events.|$|R
50|$|In 680 CE, Bulgars {{crossed the}} Danube and invaded lands {{now part of}} modern-day Bulgaria, which {{was at that time}} largely {{inhabited}} by Slavic <b>farmers.</b> The Bulgar <b>army</b> was led by Asparukh, who according to Byzantine chroniclers was one of the five sons of Kubrat, the Onogur chief who revolted against his Avar rulers and succeeded in uniting the various Bulgar groups living north of the Black Sea. When Asparukh and his warriors entered the region south of the Danube, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IV was upset and led an army to prevent the Bulgars from remaining there. The Byzantine expedition against the Bulgars ended disastrously and after defeating the imperial forces, Asparukh forced the nearby Slavic tribes to pay tribute to him, while leaving their tribal organization intact. As a result of this defeat, the empire was forced to sign a treaty recognizing the Bulgar state in 681. Despite the area having been for some time under the de facto control of various Slavic tribes, the emperors of Byzantium had kept up the fiction that the area was still imperial, as up to 681 no true state had replaced imperial rule. This {{was the first time that}} the Byzantine empire officially acknowledged another state in the Balkans.|$|R

The decision of Lý Thần Tông was met with criticism from Lê Văn Hưu because of its unorthodoxy according to the feudal tradition in which the Emperor should accept only one origin, in this case was the late Lý Nhân Tông and his empress. Lê Văn Hưu, together with Ngô Sĩ Liên, again criticized Lý Thần Tông for his order in {{the first month}} of 1130 that every daughter of the mandarins in the royal court had to be available for the emperor's selection of concubines and ones who were not chosen could only get married afterwards. Because of the young age of the emperor, Ngô Sĩ Liên and Lê Văn Hưu often pointed their criticisms to Lý Thần Tông's officials who were considered ( [...] by the historians [...] ) lacking ability and being flatterers. However, Lý Thần Tông was later considered in Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư a skilled ruler who was able to choose and use talented officials and hold the stability of the Lý Dynasty. On the other hand, the modern historian Trần Trọng Kim wrote in his Việt Nam sử lược that Đại Việt was able to witness a peaceful era during the reign of Lý Thần Tông thanks to some capable mandarins such as Trương Bá Ngọc, Lưu Khánh Đàm and Dương Anh Nhị and the policy of [...] "ngụ binh ư nông" [...] which meant conscripting <b>farmers</b> into the <b>army</b> for a period of six months and release them for the remaining six months so that they could resume their farming work and thus the agriculture of the country was not affected by military activities.|$|R
50|$|The {{divisions}} of social classes that Ellis describes are quite stratified. The upper class is siphoned {{off from the}} other occupations as its own group, and then underneath this, Ellis puts the following: yeoman and <b>farmers,</b> church, law, <b>army,</b> navy, medicine, miscellaneous professions, officials, commercial, crafts, and then artisans and unskilled. So, based on the categories, Ellis does not consider any of these other professions in the upper class. He also suggests that {{the order of the}} professions may actually be considered a hierarchical relationship that others could use. When observing professions that are primarily in farms or in rural areas, Ellis decided that these places provided a much larger potential for intellectual development than urban cities. The predictions for the future were that he did not believe the cities would ever actually catch up to the rural growth. Dividing this further, he felt that individuals in rural areas of the lowest classes were able to achieve greater intellectual contributions than those in urban areas. In the section talking about heredity, it seems that Ellis supported the idea that it is a large part of people's natural intelligence. He said as well, though, that it was not the only concept that mattered when figuring it out. Ellis then focused on childhood and youth. He pointed out {{the fact that most of}} the people who grew up to be important and prominent people, such as Charles Dickens, had very delicate childhoods. Some of them were not expected to live past infancy, and some almost died. Many of these people also had parents who had died before or after the birth of their children. Ellis argued that this also showed the inherited frailty of families.|$|R

Due to lack of adequate training among other factors, farmers make sub-optimal profit margins and produce vegetables which are dangerous to human health due to misuse of agrochemicals. This study was embarked upon for a period of three months, to build the capacity of vegetable farmers on how to produce safe and profitable vegetables using good agricultural practices (GAP) and improved production packages with minimal use of appropriate agro-chemicals. Two groups of 60 women vegetable <b>farmers</b> in Odogbo <b>army</b> barrack of the city were involved. Farmers' production practices and associated problems were documented through Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Innovative capacity building strategies building on farmers' resources and on-farm demonstration (OFAD) in the form of urban producers' field school (UPFS) focusing on the three most important vegetables - Corchorus, Celosia and Amaranthus - to the farmers was set up to address the problems. Weekly trainings were conducted and farmers were encouraged to apply the knowledge gained on their private farms. Thirty farmers each from participating and non-articipating farmers were randomly selected to compare their yield, quality of harvest and economic returns after the training. Data were analyzed using t-test. There was significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the yield obtained by participating and non-articipating farmers. Economic gains of the participating farmers also increased by 300 % on the average due to improved quality of produce and higher market price. There should be conscious effort to assist vegetable farmers through capacity building in order to ensure supply of good quality vegetables and increase economic gains in the city...|$|R
5000|$|Although he {{had been}} not long on the Lý throne, Lý Thần Tông at once made several {{major changes in the}} royal court such as {{relaxing}} strict laws, appointing officials for important positions and maintaining diplomatic relations with the Song Dynasty and the Kingdom of Champa. At that time, the Đại Việt's borders were fairly stable except for some skirmishes with the Khmer rulerSuryavarman II, starting in 1128, and Champa, which were driven out by the Lý army without difficulty. Besides the Emperor, the victory over Champa was also attributed to the protection of the Buddhist and Taoist deities, an opinion that the historian Lê Văn Hưu did not agree with since the historian thought that the victory in battlefield was solely due to the ability of the commander.In the first month of 1129, the Emperor bestowed his real father and mother Marquis Sùng Hiền and Lady Đỗ thị on titles the Retired Emperor (Thái thượng hoàng) and the Empress Mother (Hoàng thái hậu) of the Lý Dynasty.
