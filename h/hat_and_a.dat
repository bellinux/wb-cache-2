5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E

Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400.

5|$|The Cat in the Hat is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat, who wears a red and white-striped <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her unnamed brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up. He then says his goodbyes and disappears just before the children's mother walks in.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial at}} the upper {{regional}} court in Dresden began on 26 October 2009. It took place under strict security precautions due to alleged death threats to Wiens. All concurrent trials were transferred to other local venues, due to the security concerns, the great interest by the national and international media, and the public. El-Sherbini's widower, brother and parents acted {{in the role of}} 'co-claimant' and were represented by eight lawyers. On {{the first day of the}} trial, the entire prosecution counsel constituted of eight lawyers from Germany, France and Egypt was present in court; the defendant arrived in court shrouded behind a mask, sunglasses, <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> hood. The judge asked the defendant to remove his head attire and to confirm his name and date of birth. The defendant complied, except for removing his sunglasses, for which he was fined for contempt of court. The defence counsel motioned for the judges to be removed from the trial on the grounds of bias as they were colleagues of witnesses and worked near the crime scene. This was denied by a separate panel that had ruled on this motion.|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of Sapieha are {{reformer}} Stanisław Staszic (26) and, with his hand around Staszic, Andrzej Zamoyski (27), author of the Zamoyski Codex, an earlier attempt to reform the state. To the left of Staszic, the head of bishop of Smoleńsk, Tymoteusz Gorzeński (28), is visible in the crowd. Beneath Staszic and Zamoyski, with an outstretched hand, is Kazimierz Konopka (29), Kołłątaj's secretary {{and one of the}} Polish Jacobins; Konopka has a French blue-white-red flower in his <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> czekan, an ax- and hammer-like weapon, in his hand. Above them is an unnamed Eastern Orthodox priest (30); the figure on his right (31) is either Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski, pioneer of agricultural reforms, or Józef Stępkowski, a less progressive figure. This line of figures ends with Antoni Tyzenhauz (32), Lithuanian official and reformer. To {{the right of}} Zamoyski is an unnamed peasant (33). His passive attitude is seen as a representation of the unconcerned attitude of Polish peasantry towards the reforms.|$|E
5|$|When they arrive, the Tiger {{attacks and}} kills her. They {{run into the}} store, but are separated. Graham calls for Roy, but the Tiger gets into the {{building}} and attacks him, Graham barely failing to kill the tiger with both shots he fires. Sheriff Barnes arrives after being alerted about a break-in alarm and is chased into the store by the tiger. He finds Graham's <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> blood trail and tries to find him before hearing Roy calling {{out from under a}} truck outside. The sheriff dives under the truck and shields the boy as the Tiger tries to attack. When the Tiger jumps into the bed of the truck, they run to the sheriff's truck. The sheriff shoots at the tiger, but hits a gasoline tank causing it to explode and kill the Tiger. Graham appears beside the building, bloody but alive. Deciding his hunting days are over, Graham returns home. Sheriff Barnes and his wife adopt the orphaned Roy.|$|E

25|$|During the mid 17th century, {{the older}} doublets, ruffs, paned hose, and jerkins were {{replaced}} by the precursor to the three piece suit comprising waistcoat, tight breeches, powdered wig, tricorne <b>hat,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long coat called a justacorps. This coat, popularised by Louis XIII of France and Charles II of England, was knee length and looser fitting than the later frock coat, with turn-back cuffs and two rows of buttons. English and French noblemen often wore expensive brocade coats decorated with velvet, gold braid, embroidery, and gold buttons to demonstrate their wealth.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, the National League {{celebrated its}} 100th anniversary. To {{coincide}} with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes. After the season, the Pirates {{were the only}} team to adopt the hats permanently, (alternating between a black <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> gold hat for several seasons until keeping the black hat in 1985) and kept the hat through the 1986 season, which would be Barry Bonds rookie season with the team.

He dresses in tartan clothing, with a red and black <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large red cloak.|$|E
25|$|As Lord Northcliffe aged, {{his grip}} on the paper slackened and there were periods when he was not involved. But light-hearted stunts enlivened him, such as the 'Hat campaign' in the winter of 1920. This was a contest with a prize of £100 for a new design of hat — a subject in which Northcliffe took a {{particular}} interest. There were 40,000 entries and the winner was a cross between a top <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bowler christened the Daily Mail Sandringham Hat. The paper subsequently promoted the wearing of it but without much success. In 1922, when Lord Northcliffe died, Lord Rothermere took full control of the paper.|$|E

Both the cloak and scarf covered either a black double-breasted trench coat or a regular black suit. As seen {{in some of the}} later comics series, The Shadow would also wear his hat and scarf with either a black Inverness coat or Inverness cape.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, security was provided by two different corps of police; the Garde de Paris and the Guet Royal, or royal watchmen. Both organizations were under the command of the Lieutenant General of Police. The Garde had one hundred twenty horsemen and four hundred archers, and was more of a military unit. The Guet was composed of 4 lieutenants, 139 archers, including 39 on horseback, and four drummers. The sergeants of the Guet wore a blue justaucorps or tight-fitting jacket with silver lace, a white plume on their hat, and red stockings, while ordinary soldiers of the guard wore a gray jacket with brass buttons and red facing on their sleeve, a white plume on their <b>hat</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bandolier. 1750 there were nineteen posts of the Guet around the city, each the manned by twelve guards.|$|E

No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.|$|E
