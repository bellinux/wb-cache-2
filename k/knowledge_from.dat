5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on <b>knowledge</b> <b>from</b> one generation to the other.|$|E

5|$|In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was {{foremost}} {{in studying the}} remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered <b>knowledge</b> <b>from</b> the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building {{the dome of the}} Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.|$|E
40|$|Goal of {{the work}} is to {{interconnect}} isolated <b>knowledges</b> <b>from</b> single study subjects into logical framework for management of IT services including transparent decision making method. Value of the mentioned approach is in interconnecting of the ITIL knowledges, the latest <b>knowledges</b> <b>from</b> outsourcing area and decision making know-how. There will be necessary to collect and analyse quantitative and qualitative data to achieve the target. Requirements will be expressed by IT service. The most suitable variant will be chosen by transparent method supporting decision making. Shown process can be generalized and used for design and evaluation of other IT services...|$|R
40|$|Small to {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly opening up their innovation processes {{in order to}} improve innovation outcomes. Exactly how openness influences enterprises’ ability to innovate and benefit from external sources of innovation is not well understood. Despite theoretical models explicating knowledge inflows as the antecedent and innovation as the consequence of absorptive capacity, to date, the relationships between external <b>knowledge</b> inflows <b>from</b> specific external actors, absorptive capacity, innovation and SME performance remain underexplored. We address this gap, focussing on market- and science-based knowledge flows, absorptive capacity, innovation and SME performance. Using structural equation modelling on a sample of 838 Australians SMEs, we find evidence indicating that the mechanisms by which external <b>knowledge</b> inflows <b>from</b> market- and science-based actors affect innovation differ: external <b>knowledge</b> inflows <b>from</b> market-based actors influence innovation directly or “serendipitously”, while external <b>knowledge</b> inflows <b>from</b> science-based actors influence innovation indirectly via absorptive capacity. We also find that their effect on innovation differ, with external <b>knowledge</b> inflows <b>from</b> market-based actors exerting a positive direct effect on innovation vis-à-vis external <b>knowledge</b> inflows <b>from</b> science-based actors where there is no significant direct effect. In contrast, external <b>knowledge</b> inflows <b>from</b> science-based actors influence innovation through absorptive capacity. In addition to this mediation effect, absorptive capacity has a positive direct effect on innovation, and an effect on firm performance through innovation. This research contributes to our understanding of how, and the extent to which, external <b>knowledge</b> inflows <b>from</b> specific external actors influence absorptive capacity, innovation and firm performance in SMEs.

5|$|In many respects, Ranavalona's {{rule was}} a {{continuation}} of precedent established under Radama I. Both monarchs encouraged {{the introduction of new}} technologies and forms of <b>knowledge</b> <b>from</b> abroad, supported the establishment of an industrialized economy, and adopted measures to professionalize the army. Both viewed foreigners with ambivalence, establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems. In addition, both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the Merina court to govern remote provinces across an island larger than the Netherlands, Belgium and France combined.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and Attorney General for England and Wales a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been {{returned}} only for political purposes, Garrow acted {{as one of the}} principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop criminal law reform as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on Assize, used his criminal law <b>knowledge</b> <b>from</b> his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass <b>knowledge</b> <b>from</b> one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
40|$|Automatically {{constructing}} <b>knowledge</b> bases <b>from</b> online resources {{has become}} a crucial task in many research areas. Most existing knowledge bases are built from English re-sources, while few efforts have been made for other languages. Building knowledge bases for Chinese is of great importance on its own right. However, simply adapting existing tool-s from English to Chinese yields inferior re-sults. In this paper, we propose to create Chi-nese <b>knowledge</b> bases <b>from</b> online resources with less human involvement. This project will be formulated in a self-supervised framework which requires little manual work to extrac-t <b>knowledge</b> facts <b>from</b> online encyclopedia resources in a probabilistic view. In addition, this framework {{will be able to}} update the con-structed knowledge base with <b>knowledge</b> facts extracted <b>from</b> up-to-date newswire. Currently, we have obtained encouraging results in our pilot experiments that extracting <b>knowledge</b> facts <b>from</b> infoboxes can achieve a high accu-racy of around 95 %, which will be then used as training data for the extraction of plain web-pages. ...|$|R

5|$|On 1 August 1914, {{just before}} the start of World War I, Olga's regiment, the Akhtyrsky Hussars, {{appeared}} at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at Krasnoe Selo. Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars, who were stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia. With the Grand Duchess's prior medical <b>knowledge</b> <b>from</b> the village of Olgino, she started work as a nurse at an under-staffed Red Cross hospital in Rovno, near to where her own regiment was stationed. During the war, she came under heavy Austrian fire while attending the regiment at the front. Nurses rarely worked so close to the frontlines and consequently she was awarded the Order of St. George by General Mannerheim, who later became President of Finland. As the Russians lost ground to the Central Powers, Olga's hospital was moved eastwards to Kiev, and Michael returned to Russia from exile abroad.|$|E
