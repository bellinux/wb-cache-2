5|$|The South Staffordshire Railway reached Brownhills in 1850 {{and led to}} a huge {{expansion}} of the local mining operation and with it a population explosion in the area, with the population increasing from 305 in 1801 to over 13,000 in 1891. In 1858 a branch line was constructed through the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was then the hamlet of Brownhills, which led to a migration of the population eastwards, leading to the formation of mining slums in the Ogley Hay area. Eventually a new town centre developed, complete with library and theatre. This led to the gradual amalgamation of Brownhills, Ogley Hay and Catshill into one town.|$|E

Many of the people of German descent opposed slavery and cooperated in aiding fugitive slaves. Local Lancaster County resident Charles Spotts found 17 stations.

25|$|At the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now Chatterton Village {{stood the}} grounds of Bromley Villa (later renamed Walpole Lodge), a large house owned by gentryman {{landowner}} Henry Hebbert. It was his death in 1864, and the subsequent auction of Bromley Villa, that presaged the residential development out of which Chatterton Road was built. This first tranche of development {{to the east of}} Bromley Common stretched from Chantry Lane to Johnson Road, between which lay Pope Road and Walpole Road; connecting these roads and running parallel to Bromley Common was Chatterton Road. Only in the late 1870s did the area just to the north – including Bloomfield, Addison and Cowper roads – begin to be developed. The development to the south – of Mosslea, Balfour, Albert, Victoria and Salisbury roads and Crown Lane – began {{around the turn of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|A {{new museum}} {{dedicated}} {{to the memory of}} Macedonia's Jews who perished in the Holocaust during the Bulgarian rule was inaugurated {{in the presence of the}} country's President and representatives of Macedonia's religious communities and international Jewish organizations in 2011. The modern building is located in the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was once the city's Jewish quarter (Macedonian: Еврејско маало), in the center of the Macedonian capital Skopje. Macedonia's Jewish community benefited from a 2002 law providing for the return of heirless Jewish property to the Jewish community, a law that is widely recognized as one of the best in Europe. Macedonia was widely hailed for enabling the Jews to regain their heirloom that was lost in the Holocaust. The museum opened in March 2011, with transferring the urns containing the ashes of Macedonian Jews executed in Treblinka from the Museum of the City of Skopje to the Holocaust Museum. The museum was the first one to be opened in a museum complex that includes the Archeological Museum of Macedonia and the Museum of Macedonian Independence. Major landmarks and tourist attractions, such as the Stone Bridge, Skopje Fortress and the Old Turkish Bazaar are located around the museum.|$|E
25|$|But {{there is}} a {{peculiarity}} in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This is the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But {{there is a}} primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, {{but it is the}} prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.|$|E

Others were used in circuses and related forms of entertainment, such as Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The horses were originally called [...] "Palouse horses" [...] by settlers, {{a reference to the}} Palouse River that ran through the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was once Nez Perce country. Gradually, the name evolved into [...] "Apalouse", and then [...] "Appaloosa". Other early variations of the name included [...] "Appalucy", [...] "Apalousey" [...] and [...] "Appaloosie". In one 1948 book, the breed was called the [...] "Opelousa horse", described as a [...] "hardy tough breed of Indian and Spanish horse" [...] used by backwoodsmen of the late 18th century to transport goods to New Orleans for sale. By the 1950s, [...] "Appaloosa" [...] was regarded as the correct spelling.|$|E

[...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, saying that it was more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] than You Do Your Thing, and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That".

500|$|Raynolds's 1848 {{expedition}} to the summit of Pico de Orizaba in Mexico predated {{what is known as}} the Golden age of alpinism (1854–65), when many major mountain peaks in the Alps were first climbed. The effort to summit the mountain was one of the earliest deliberate attempts to climb a major mountain peak, and involved logistics, planning and use of rudimentary climbing equipment, [...] "making it one of the more serious mountaineering expeditions undertaken to that point in history." [...] Though unable to penetrate into the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> later became Yellowstone National Park, the Raynolds Expedition produced maps that were used by subsequent explorers to the greater Yellowstone region. Raynolds also located suitable wagon routes in the Bighorn Basin and was able to help narrow down the most appropriate routes for a future transcontinental railroad. The Raynolds Expedition further determined that few if any rivers in the region would be suitable for steamboats due to numerous rapids and steep gradients. Several lighthouses whose construction was designed or supervised by Raynolds are still in use and several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

2500|$|Eamhain Mhacha (or Navan Fort), at {{the western}} edge of Armagh, is {{believed}} to have been an ancient pagan ritual or ceremonial site. According to Irish mythology it was one of the great royal sites of Gaelic Ireland and the capital of Ulster. It appears to have been largely abandoned after the 1st century.

Evidence suggests that it was a pagan sanctuary and the successor to Navan. Like Navan, it too was named after the goddess Macha– Ard Mhacha means [...] "Macha's height".
