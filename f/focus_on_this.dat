25|$|The {{split between}} {{classical}} and some atypical MAP kinases happened quite early. This is suggested {{not just by}} the high divergence between extant genes, but also recent discoveries of atypical MAPKs in primitive, basal eukaryotes. The genome sequencing of Giardia lamblia revealed the presence of two MAPK genes, one of them similar to the already-well-known mammalian MAPKs (ERKs, p38s, etc.), the other one showing similarities to the mammalian ERK7 protein. The situation is similar in the multicellular amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, where the ddERK1 protein {{appears to be a}} classical MAPK, while ddERK2 more closely resembles our ERK7 and ERK3/4 proteins. Atypical MAPKs can also be found in higher plants, although they are poorly known. Similar to the situation in mammals, most aspects of atypical MAPKs are uncharacterized {{due to the lack of}} research <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> area.|$|E

To allow them to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> the Brabham team reverted to a known quantity, the reliable and widely used Ford Cosworth DFV engine that it had last used in 1975. Three BT49s were designed and built in only six weeks for the Canadian Grand Prix on 30 September 1979; two of them were converted BT48 chassis and one was newly built.|$|E

The album features a series of skits in which rednecks, pedophiles, and husbands who abuse their wives receive phone calls inviting them to the Dark Carnival, where they are promised US$100,000 for arriving.|$|E

He felt pressure in trying to produce something significant regarding the Borg because of the release of First Contact a few months earlier, and wanted to do something equally as exciting but without being repetitive. Instead, he wanted to give the viewer a sense of suspense and mystery regarding the people that Chakotay meets even if they {{do not appear to be}} Borg. McNeill saw [...] "Unity" [...] as being a type of film noir, with Chakotay being seduced by the Devil during the course of the story, and wanted to have a strong <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> direction throughout the episode.|$|E
500|$|The Bond novels also {{dealt with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West. In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> directly, instead creating [...] "an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action". Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens observed that [...] "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans". Although Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, he did not focus on it strongly. Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, pointed out that [...] "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he".|$|E
500|$|Red is {{the color}} of freedom, chaos, passion, creativity, impulse, fury, warfare, lightning, the {{classical}} element of fire, and the abiotic geological aspects of the classical element earth. Red's strengths include the ability to directly damage creatures or players; destroying opposing lands and artifacts; and sacrificing permanent resources for temporary but high-profit power. Red has a wide array of creatures, but (with the exception of late-game powerhouses, such as Red's notable dragons) most tend to be defensively weak, rendering them easier to destroy. As a trade-off, some of these weaker creatures have the ability to temporarily raise their offense value, leaving their defense value unaffected; many other Red spells <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> concept of glass cannon offense. Much like Blue, Red explores the element of trickery, this being represented by spells that are able to temporarily steal an opponent's creatures; divert or copy other spells; and those involving random chance. In terms of keyword abilities, Red tends to focus on quickness and speed, this being represented by the popular abilities [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Red's weaknesses include its inability to destroy enchantments; the self-destructive, single-use nature of many of its spells; the overall lack of defense value or toughness of its creatures; {{and the way in which}} it trades early-game speed and vulnerability for late-game staying power, in which it may not last that long.|$|E

500|$|Most of the Hollywood films {{considered}} to be classic noirs, fall {{into the category of}} the [...] "B movie". Some were Bs in the most precise sense, produced to run on the bottom of double bills by a low-budget unit of one of the major studios or by one of the smaller Poverty Row outfits, from the relatively well-off Monogram to shakier ventures such as Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC). Jacques Tourneur had made over thirty Hollywood Bs (a few now highly regarded, most forgotten) before directing the A-level Out of the Past, described by scholar Robert Ottoson as [...] "the ne plus ultra of forties film noir". Movies with budgets a step up the ladder, known as [...] "intermediates" [...] by the industry, might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances. Monogram created Allied Artists in the late 1940s to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> sort of production. Such films have long been colloquially known as B movies. Robert Wise (Born to Kill , The Set-Up [...] ) and Anthony Mann (T-Men [...] and Raw Deal [...] ) each made a series of impressive intermediates, many of them noirs, before graduating to steady work on big-budget productions. Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer John Alton, a specialist in what James Naremore called [...] "hypnotic moments of light-in-darkness". He Walked by Night (1948), shot by Alton and though credited solely to Alfred Werker, directed in large part by Mann, demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of [...] "police procedural" [...] crime dramas. It was released, like other Mann-Alton noirs, by the small Eagle-Lion company, it was the inspiration for the Dragnet series, which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951.|$|E
