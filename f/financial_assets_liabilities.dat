The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the statistical consistency which is estimated by this method by comparing with the other inter-institutional statistics calculated simply from released balance sheet.

Selected model of vector autoregression enables the analysis of mutual relations between the loans provided for the households, share of the non-performing loans, development of GDP, interest rates, unemployment, consumption expenditures and the house prices. The thesis concludes with the prediction of indebtedness of the Czech households and together with the results of stress tests provided by the Czech National Bank estimates the resistance of the financial system to the household credit risk...|$|E

30|$|The {{financial}} accounts depict {{the changes in}} lending and borrowing by agents resulting from changes in <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities.</b> Conceptually, the sum of these changes is equal in magnitude to the balancing item of the capital account. The complete set of the {{financial accounts}} in SAM helps analyzing the monetary aggregates {{as well as the}} long-term financial investments and financial sources (Hubic, 2012). The SAM already incorporates a capital account that presents the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) of the economic agents. However, this is a unitary account for all economic agents, and therefore it does not reflect the participation of each agent in the GFCF. In addition, the de facto capital account records only the flows of physical capital and the resources received by the agents. The addition of a distinct capital account for each agent keeps the details of different resources held by the individual agents, as well as the details of various physical or <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> held as counterparts of those resources. Together, the accounts of <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> keep the details of the nature and structure of financial resources and how they are used by economic agents.
