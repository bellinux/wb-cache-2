40|$|We {{characterize}} the fluctuation properties of a polymer chain under external tension and the fluctuation-induced forces between two ring molecules threaded around the chain. The problem is relevant {{in the context}} of fluctuation-induced forces in soft matter systems, features of liquid interfaces and to describe properties of polyrotaxanes and slide-ring materials. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model for the polymer and a simple ring-molecule model, in the canonical ensemble. We study transverse fluctuations of the stretched chain, as a function of chain stretching and in the presence of ring-shaped threaded molecules. The fluctuation spectra of the chains are analyzed in equilibrium at constant temperature and the differences in presence of two ring molecules are compared. For the rings located at fixed distances, we find an attractive fluctuation-induced force between the rings, proportional to the temperature and decaying with the <b>ring</b> <b>distance.</b> We characterize this force as a function of <b>ring</b> <b>distance,</b> chain stretching, <b>ring</b> radius and measure the differences between the free chain spectrum and the fluctuations of the chain constrained by the rings.

40|$|Background: Accurate {{assessment}} of depth of invasion {{is critical in}} decision-making for addi-tional surgery after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer (EGC). Although this depth of invasion is determined at the deepest point of submucosal invasion (DPSI), there is no literature describing the distribution of deepest invasion point. Objective: To describe {{the location of the}} DPSI, and to determine whether it is possible to predict this point by clinicopathological features before treatment. Methods: One hundred and ninety-five lesions of EGC with minute submucosal invasion, which had been resected en bloc between 1991 and 2003, were reviewed. For each lesion, we recorded the location of the DPSI as being in one of three areas demarcated by three concentric equal <b>distance</b> <b>rings.</b> We also examined the correlation between the location of the deepest penetration and the clinicopathological characteristics. Results: The DPSI was located most often (53 %) in the central, less often (31 %) in the middle and least often (16 %) in the outermost area. There was no significant correlation between the distribution of the deepest point and any clinicopathological features. Conclusions: The DPSI was not always in the central area, and it was impossible to predict its location by clinicopathological features alone. To obtain an accurate measure of depth of tumor invasion, we must histologically assess the entire lesion by thin sections.
