50|$|Norway’s <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>schools</b> (Norwegian: Husmorskoler), or {{technical}} schools for domestic arts (Norwegian: fagskoler i husstell) arose {{at the end}} of the 19th century for the purpose of providing specialized instruction in domestic subjects. The schools developed in parallel with agricultural schools (Norwegian: landbruksskoler) and were intended to teach food preparation and housework. Later these <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>schools</b> were also established in Norway's cities. The schools in the countryside were generally governed by county councils (Norwegian: fylkeskommuner) and town schools by municipal governments.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>schools</b> were renamed as {{technical}} {{schools for}} domestic arts (fagskoler i husstell). The schools weren’t regulated by law before the secondary education law (Lov om videregående opplæring) came {{into effect in}} 1974. The <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>schools</b> then {{became a part of}} the secondary education program, on an equal footing with gymnasiums (university preparation schools) and practical and professional schools (yrkeskoler) specializing in business and technical programs. Following the 1976 secondary education law, the gymnasiums were consolidated with the practical and professional schools into a unified secondary education system. Nowadays instruction in restaurant work, food and nutrition is offered as a program discipline within Norway's overall secondary education program.|$|E

50|$|After the Appenzell wars Hans von Bonstetten {{concluded}} a pact with Zürich, {{and became a}} citizen of the city of Zürich respectively claimed the so-called Burgrecht in 1407. From that moment, the castle in time of war could be strengthened by a Zürich garrison. As an Austrian vassal, Zürich guaranteed a neutral status to the Bonstetten family, particularly during the Old Zürich War when the neighbouring town of Greifensee was besieged and destroyed by Old Swiss Confederacy marauders; the bodies of the defenders were buried at the Uster church. In 1492 a fire destroyed the castle. In 1534 Uster castle changed hands by inheritance into the possession of Ludwig von Diesbach. Frequent sales followed and one of the next owners, Hans Vogler sold all sovereign rights to the city of Zürich in 1544. The owners changed the following decades many times; the family who remained the longest the castle's owner, from 1560 to 1663, was that of Hohensax. Junker Tschudi's family from Bern was one of the next owners from 1563 to 1710. They were followed by Colonel Franz Schlatter von Graviseth's and his sons to 1750, followed by about 28 different owners within one century. In 1852 the castle became the seat of the district administration, and the tower was used as a prison. In the same year the castle was rebuilt, again, and a restaurant opened. Since 1858 the castle was {{in the hands of the}} Escher family. Jakob Heusser-Staub, a fabricant, bought the nearly ruined castle in 1916, financed a reconstruction by the architect Johannes Meier in 1917, and donated the property along with the economic structures to the citizens of Uster, managed by the Heusser-Staub-Stiftung, a foundation. During several decades the complex housed the cantonal farmers and <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>schools.</b> Viticulture resumed at the Schlossberg by 1975.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} transformation of the Iranian home in twentieth century Iran. While surveying the socio political underpinnings and aesthetic ends of domesticity in Iranian culture from the early twentieth century through the first two decades of the revolution, this study also examines the impact of the Cold War on the daily life of Iranians. A showcase for the West's humanitarian efforts in the region, the "reform" of the Iranian home was first brought about by missionaries, architects, and other foreign parties. They engaged in a hybrid dialogue that helped bring about a reconfiguration of houses, home cultures, and behaviors and tastes in domestic life. The Point IV Program of the Truman administration exported American home life by establishing <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>schools</b> for Iranian girls. Subsequently, the Iranian domestic market was flooded with a plethora of new home goods. The influx of new spaces and goods raised questions about the authenticity of Shiite daily life, indigenous taste, consumer culture, and gender relations. Since 1979 the focus on Iran's internal politics and its foreign relations has distracted attention from more subtle transformations, which took place prior to and {{in the aftermath of the}} Islamic Revolution. By looking at the roles and opinions of religious scholars, the Left, and the revolutionary elites this study can also be seen as one that re-examines the history of Iran's revolution through the lens of the everyday and private lives of people. (cont.) Subsequently, this dissertation details the ways in which new ideas regarding the relationship between public and private spaces were put forward by numerous architects, urban planners, and cultural critics both during the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (1941 - 1979) and in the two decades following the revolution. Finally, it shows how, since 1979, Iranians have contested the dichotomies of "public" and "private" as manifested in the Islamic Republic's texts, images, and actual physical spaces. Towards this end, this dissertation explores the interplay between foreign influences, religious rhetoric, gender roles, economic factors, and education as they intersect with taste, fashion, and architecture. by Z.

40|$|Tutkimuksen tarkoituksena on tuottaa tulkintaa kotitalouden alan ammattikasvatuksen muotoutumisesta sekä tarkastella alan yhteyksiä suomalaisen yhteiskunnan ja elinkeinojen kehityksen kanssa. Tavoitteena on kuvata ja tulkita alan ammattikasvatuksen historiallisia kerrostumia, muutoksia ja jatkuvuuksia. Tutkimuksen tulkinnan mukaan kotitalousalan ammattikasvatus muodostuu varhais-, maaseutu-, kotitalous- ja palveluammatillisista kehitysvaiheista. Varhaisvaiheessa alan koulutusta syntyi erilaisten taustayhteisöjen tukemana kouluhallinnon ja sittemmin perustetun maataloushallinnon alaisuuteen. Ensimmäinen kotitalouskoulutusta määrittelevä laki ohjasi sitä maatalouden yhteyteen. Maaseutuammatillisen koulutuksen kehittämisestä vastasi maataloushallinto, jonka merkittävä saavutus oli kotitalousopettajakoulutuksen käynnistäminen. Kotitalousammatillisessa vaiheessa syntyi koti- ja laitostalousala. Ammatillinen koulutus järjestyi ammattikasvatushallintoon mittavassa keskiasteen uudistusprojektissa. Palveluammatillinen vaihe ilmeni alan laaja-alaistumisena osaksi palvelusektoria ja kotitalouspalvelujen kehittymisenä. Tuolloin koulutus jakautui ammatilliselle toiselle asteelle ja korkea-asteelle. Tutkimuksessa esitellään kahden tapauskoulutarinan avulla kotitalousalan koulutuksen kehityskaari alkuvaiheesta nykypäivään. Historian tunteminen tarjoaa perspektiivin tuleville valinnoille. Vaikka {{historian}} ratkaisut eivät sellaisenaan ole siirrettävissä nykypäivän toimintamalleiksi, ne voivat tuottaa virikkeitä kehittämisprosesseihin. Alan taustojen tunteminen auttaa eri toimijoita ymmärtämään tehtyjä ratkaisuja ja niiden perusteluita. Näin ollen teos palvelee kaikkia alan ammattikasvattajia. Erityisesti tuleva tutkimus hyötyy tästä perustutkimukseen lukeutuvasta aihepiirin käsittelystä. Tutkimuksen tietoa voidaan soveltaa ammattikasvatuksen ja kasvatuksen tulevassa tutkimuksessa sekä koulutuksen opetus- ja kehittämistyössä. Tutkimuksen voi toivoa löytävän tiensä lukuisten tutkijoiden ja opettajien käsiin. Tulosten perusteella voidaan päätellä, että koulumuotoisesta ammattikasvatuksesta on muodostunut suomalainen tapa tuottaa uutta ammatillista osaamista työelämän tarpeeseen. Koulutustaso ja -rakenne ilmentävät eri aikoina vallinnutta käsitystä koulutuksen järjestämisestä. Yksialaiset koulut ovat muuttuneet pienistä sisäoppilaitoksista ensin tavallisiksi päiväkouluiksi ja edelleen osaksi monialaisia koulutuskonserneja. Opettajien ammattitaidon varaan rakentunut ammatillinen opetus on muuttunut moniammatilliseksi tiimityöksi. Kuusi luokkaa kansakoulua on vaihtunut peruskoulu-, ammattikoulu- ja lukiotaustoiksi. Ennen aikaan kotona opituista arkielämän taidoista on kehittynyt osaamista vaativia ammatteja ja tutkintoja. Kotitaloustyössä on kyse pääosin naisten tekemästä matalapalkkaisesta työstä. Alan ammattien vähäinen arvostus juontuu sekä ammattitaidon yhdistymisestä naisten osaamiseen että sen liittymisestä arkisiin toimiin. The {{aim of this}} doctoral thesis, situated {{within the}} field of education, is to depict and analyze the various development stages, changes and continuums of home economics vocational training from an administrative-political viewpoint. The research question is: “How has home economics vocational education been formed in the case schools?” The framework of reference covers vocational education as a form of education. The paradigm of vocational education within home economics education comprises the field itself, its administration and different aspects of education. The core of the research lies in education, when scrutinized from the administrative-political angle. The methodological orientation is the history of education. The informative research material comprises research papers, statistics and documents that cover the field, education in general and administration of education. The archives of two case schools and material collected through interviews were exploited. The first case school, Elias Lönnrotin Emännyyskoulu, represents vocational training, whereas the second case school, Järvenpään Kotitalousopettajaopisto, is a teacher training facility. Developing home economics education has had two orientations in Finland: it has been developed both for the needs of the countryside and cities. The focus in this thesis is mainly on the rural home economics education. In the countryside home economics comprised the tasks needed to carry out in home, with livestock and when farming. The case schools merge into Laurea University of Applied Sciences’ degree programmes in Service Management. Already before the reform in the 1990 s, when the vocational institute was separated from the university-level education, the case schools had seen major changes in their field of operation, administrative and educational structure. The housekeeping school, which was founded in Sammatti in 1897, operated 50 years as a private school, under the administration of school administration, and taught girls, who had been to elementary school, home economics skills. The housekeeping school was placed under the administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and it became a state-owned school in the 1940 s and it carried out its operations as a housekeeping school until the 1980 s. During the reform of the secondary education the home economics education, which was supervised by agricultural administration, became a part of the vocational education system and was now being supervised by the National Board of Vocational Education. The housekeeping school became a home economics institute that qualified students for vo- cational professions in its programmes. Jobs corresponding these qualifications were available in the field of home economics and institutional household and the education focused on see- ing to the services within public administration. Espoon koti- ja laitostalousoppilaitos was established to provide for educational needs as a result of migration. This school, owned by the federation of municipalities, was founded as an affiliated school of Elias Lönnrotin emäntäkoulu. Espoon koti- ja laitostalousoppilaitos became Espoon palvelualojen oppilaitos in 1996. Its institutes merged into a university of applied sciences and the secondary education re- mained where it was, as part of the federation of municipalities. The school, which was foun- ded in Sammatti, is nowadays Lönnrotin Opisto, owned by Työtehoseura, and it produces know-how for the service field. Järvenpään Kotitalousopettajaopisto (teacher training institute) was established in 1928 and it was supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture to serve the needs of the home economics skills as needed in farming. The operations of Kotitalousopettajisto were stabilized after the years of war and the Great Depression. The housekeeping and <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> <b>schools</b> that were parts of the institute served the needs of teacher training as placement schools. The teacher training institute became a home economics school in 1963 where candidates with university-level degrees could qualify as teachers. When Kotitalousopettajaopisto was closed down in 1997, the teacher training was merged into Jyväskylä Teacher Education College. The secondary vocational education was continued in Tuusulanjärvi-instituutti and the various in- stitute-level programmes joined the local university of applied sciences. The vocational education {{within the field of}} home economics consists of the development stages of an early stage, agricultural industry, home economics and service trade professions. In the early stage of de- velopment, education within the field was created and supported by various communities under the governance of school administration and later on under the governance of agricultural administration. The first law dictating home economics education unified different school forms and forced them under the governance of agricultural administration. The Department of Home Economics was in charge of developing the education in the countryside. The education in its entirety was further advanced by the introduction of teacher training in Järvenpää. The development of home economics education comprises the advancement of middle school education into professional education as well as the introduction of the field of home economics and institutional household. Vocational education focusing on services can be seen as an element of both the advancement of the service field and development of home economics services and the division of education at two levels, vocational upper secondary level and university-level...|$|E
