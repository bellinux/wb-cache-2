5000|$|On 18th century {{innovation}} in lathe {{was the use}} of a [...] "master screw" [...] in the thread-cutting machine, which seems to have been of French origin. Perrigo explained that [...] "in this lathe there was an arbor upon which threads of different pitches had been cut. These threads were on short sections of the arbor and by its use the different pitches required could be cut. While the exact manner of using this arbor was not described, its probable method of use will readily suggest itself to the mechanic, and was, no doubt, used at an earlier period, and in fact was what led up to the use of a lead screw or arbor with a multiplicity of different pitches. The principle is analogous to that used in the [...] "Fox" [...] brass <b>finishing</b> <b>lathe</b> so well known and extensively used, not only in finishing plain surfaces but in [...] " [...] chasing threads. This machine is shown" [...] in the third image.|$|E
40|$|A {{shape memory}} alloy (SMA) is an {{intermetallic}} compound able to recover, in a continuous and reversible way, a predetermined shape during a thermal cycle while generating mechanical work. In this thesis, its use in developing an actuator for a machining process is investigated. The actuator is to drive the tool cross feed into an aluminium workpiece in a <b>finishing</b> <b>lathe</b> operation. The actuator structure was designed with an output shaft to transfer the movement and force of the SMA wire outside the device. The actuator was fabricated and the experimental setup was assembled which also included a power supply control circuit, displacement sensor, temperature sensor and current sensor for feedback, and data collection and monitoring within software. PID control was implemented within the software that regulated the power supplied to the SMA, thereby providing the position control. This study covers the mechatronics system design {{and development of the}} actuator, the experiments carried out to determine performance and the results. Open loop tests were conducted to determine the maximum stroke, the effect of cooling and response to radial forces. These tests revealed the expected non-linearity of the SMA. The actuator achieved the rated maximum stroke of 3 - 4 percent. The forced cooling test showed a general improvement of approximately 65 percent with fans. The radial force tests showed the value of the maximum stroke remained unaffected by force. The results from the closed loop tests responses with a tuned PID controller produced a stable system for various displacement setpoints. The actuator had a feed rate of 0. 25 mm/s and an accuracy of 0. 0153 mm, which was within the acceptable accuracy for turning operations. The system was deemed accurate for a conventional lathe machine cross fee...|$|E
50|$|Shaving {{green wood}} with the {{drawknife}} or spokeshave {{along the grain}} is far quicker and easier work than turning across it. Skilled operators can produce very fine results with a drawknife and shavehorse, requiring minimal <b>lathe</b> <b>finishing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Halle I {{is located}} at the {{entrance}} to the site and has a glass front behind which the railcars and various other vehicles may be found. In addition, Shed I houses the main workshop with an area where replacement components can be <b>finished</b> on <b>lathes.</b> There is also a large spare parts store and an office with adjoining society library. Social rooms, such as a kitchen, common room, showers, toilets and overnight accommodation are also located in Shed I.|$|R
40|$|The Barkhausen noise {{technique}} {{was used to}} characterize machined surfaces of small diameter tensile specimens. The Barkhausen noise butterfly curves measured for specimens with different surface <b>finishing</b> (grinding, <b>lathe</b> working) at several differnt analyzing frequencies were compared to those obtained on electro-polished specimens. Microstructure modifications at the surface by machining are the reason for a complex structure of the butterfly curves, especially, those achieved at high analyzing frequencies. A new analyzing {{technique was}} developed based on cross correlation of a Barkhausen noise butterfly curve with a curve of a reference material. Depth profiling results achieved by this method showed excellent agreement with x-ray diffraction measurements...|$|R
50|$|Lailey made {{a variety}} of items (including wooden ladles) but {{concentrated}} mainly on bowls, produced in {{a variety of}} sizes. For this, elm logs were seasoned for at least two years, sawn with a crosscut saw, and then trimmed using a side axe; the blanks were then roughly turned, stored for a further short period and <b>finished</b> on the <b>lathe,</b> applying a polish of beeswax and turmeric root. Most of the specialist tools used would have been made by Lailey himself.|$|R
50|$|The Confederates did {{solid cast}} 8-inch and 10-inch columbiads that {{resemble}} Rodman guns. A closer examination of these Confederate columbiads reveals {{that they have}} a straighter cylindrical contour between the trunnions and the breech as opposed to the sweeping continuous curve of the Rodman gun. The Confederate columbiads have longer trunnions that were intended for use with heavy wooden carriages. The Union gun were designed to be mounted in iron carriages with thinner cheeks, permitting shorter trunnions. The exteriors of the Confederate columbiads are rough, not having been <b>finished</b> on a <b>lathe</b> as were their Union counterparts.|$|R
