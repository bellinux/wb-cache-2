5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E

During this period, his gift for languages first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. It was while a student here that he took up interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.|$|E

5|$|Today {{physicists}} {{continue to}} look for applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. In addition to the applications to nuclear physics advocated by Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators, condensed matter physicists such as Subir Sachdev have used string theory methods to understand some aspects of condensed matter physics. A notable result <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> was the description, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, of the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. Another emerging subject is the fluid/gravity correspondence, which uses the AdS/CFT correspondence to translate problems in fluid dynamics into problems in general relativity.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|E

He championed the Samnorsk language reform, the declared aim of which was to consolidate the two standards of written Norwegian. A reform pushing the formal written language <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> was indeed implemented in 1938, but historical events led {{to the failure of}} this policy. A pertinacious and unyielding advocate of international peace, Koht was {{a founding member of the}} Norwegian Peace Association and an ordinary member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. As an activist and politician he was described as a strong-willed and individualistic, and nurturing a strong belief in taking an academic and legal perspective on political problems.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{comprised}} twelve flying squadrons, two aircraft depots and {{a flying}} school, situated at five air bases: Point Cook and Laverton in Victoria; Richmond and Rathmines in New South Wales; and Pearce in Western Australia. An air force of this size did not require large-scale operational formations such as wings, groups, or commands, as all units could be directly administered and controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. With the onset of war in September 1939, the Australian Air Board decided to implement a decentralised form of command and control, commensurate with an envisioned increase in manpower and units. The RAAF's initial move <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> was to create Nos.1 and 2 Groups in November 1939, the former based in Melbourne to control units in Victoria, and the latter in Sydney to control units in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The federal government, which {{owned and}} {{operated}} Dulles Airport before Congress created the MWAA, built the Dulles Access Road in the 1960s to connect the airport to Washington by way of Interstate 66. As the access road was built, the government opted to reserve the median of the road for some form of rail transit, and the nearby West Falls Church station was designed so that the line could eventually be extended <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction.</b> The original 1968 Metrorail plan included an eventual extension to Dulles airport. In 1969, Senator William Spong of Virginia tried unsuccessfully to have the extension to Dulles be built {{as part of an}} early stage of the system rather than having it be built at some unspecified time in the future. A 1971 study of the feasibility of Metrorail running to Dulles estimated that 30,000 people would ride the extension each day.|$|E

5|$|The local {{government}} bodies; Panchayat, Municipalities and Corporations have existed in Kerala since 1959, however, the major initiative to decentralise the governance {{was started in}} 1993, conforming to the constitutional amendments of central government <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction.</b> With the enactment of Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and Kerala Municipality Act in 1994, the state implemented reforms in local self-governance. The Kerala Panchayati Raj Act envisages a 3-tier system of {{local government}} with Gram panchayat, Block panchayat and District Panchayat forming a hierarchy. The acts ensure a clear demarcation of power among these institutions. However, the Kerala Municipality Act envisages a single-tier system for urban areas, with the institution of municipality designed to par with the Gram panchayat of the former system. Substantial administrative, legal and financial powers are delegated to these bodies to ensure efficient decentralisation. As per the present norms, the state government devolves about 40 per cent of the state plan outlay to the local government.|$|E
5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp and saw that the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{decryption}} of German radio communications, the Allied headquarters {{became aware}} of the German withdrawal plan. They recognized the open German flank to the east of the Rhône at Grenoble due the retreat of the 157th Infantry Division towards the Alps. To seize this opportunity, Taskforce Butler was ordered to advance <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction,</b> paralleling the German evacuation effort and ultimately cutting them off further north. While doing so, it fought some scattered German resistance, and finally, after turning left, found itself near Montélimar, a small city on the east bank of the Rhône River. This town lay directly on the German escape route. Following Taskforce Butler was the 36th Infantry Division. Together, they were tasked on 20August to block the German force at Montélimar as well as continue the northward advance to Grenoble, while VICorps was pursuing the Germans from behind. However, after this speedy advance, the forward Allied forces suffered now from a serious lack of fuel and supplies, which made this task difficult.|$|E

5|$|Under Rau's {{leadership}} the DWK, {{still under}} {{supervision of the}} Soviet Military Administration in Germany (German: Sowjetische Militäradministration in Deutschland or SMAD), quickly developed more and more into a partner of the SMAD with its own conceptions and intentions. This policy was also endorsed by the Soviet chief diplomat in Germany, Vladimir Semyonov, the future Chief Commissar of the USSR in Germany, who already in January 1948 correspondingly stated, that SMAD orders, (which accompanied DWK orders,) should have merely the purpose to back {{the authority of the}} German orders. One of Rau's aims during the meetings with the SMAD was, to come to agreements, which also obliged the Soviet side, including subordinate Soviet authorities, who still engaged in wild confiscations for reparation purposes. An important success <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> was a half-year plan for the economic development {{in the second half of}} 1948, which was accepted by the SMAD in May 1948.

Unlike heavier artillery, a leather gun could be led by a single horse, transported efficiently over difficult terrain, and still be an effective tool for bombardment.|$|E

In February 1816, he reviewed August Wilhelm Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Literature for the Edinburgh Review. The German critic Schlegel showed {{an appreciation for}} Shakespeare of a kind {{that no one in}} Hazlitt's country had yet demonstrated, and Hazlitt, sympathising with many of Schlegel's ideas, felt there was a place for a whole book that would provide appreciative criticism of all of Shakespeare's plays. Such a book would provide liberal quotations from the text, and focus on the characters and various qualities particular to each play; and he felt that he could write it. His writing career was now moving <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction</b> (he had been contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to the Examiner and elsewhere during this period), he needed the money to support his family, and his growing reputation as a drama critic enabled him to have his name appear on the title page (as a reviewer for periodicals, his contributions were anonymous, as was customary at the time).|$|E

5|$|To {{protect the}} UERL group's income, its {{chairman}} Lord Ashfield lobbied {{the government for}} regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>direction,</b> with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP and Minister of Transport) Herbert Morrison {{at the forefront of}} debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC's tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area. The Board was a compromise– public ownership but not full nationalisation– and came into existence on 1 July 1933. On this date, the LER and the other Underground companies were liquidated.|$|E
