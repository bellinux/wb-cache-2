Stochastic music was pioneered by Iannis Xenakis, who coined the term stochastic music. Specific examples of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in Pithoprakta, statistical distribution of points on a plane in Diamorphoses, minimal constraints in Achorripsis, the normal distribution in ST/10 and Atrées, Markov chains in Analogiques, game theory in Duel and Stratégie, group theory in Nomos Alpha (for Siegfried Palm), set theory in Herma and Eonta, and Brownian motion in N'Shima. Xenakis frequently used computers to produce his scores, such as the ST series including Morsima-Amorsima and Atrées, and founded CEMAMu. Earlier, John Cage and others had composed aleatoric or indeterminate music, which is created by chance processes but does not have the strict mathematical basis (Cage's Music of Changes, for example, uses a system of charts based on the I-Ching). Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson used generative grammars and Markov chains in their 1957 <b>Illiac</b> <b>Suite.</b> See: Generative music.|$|E

50|$|Two further major 1950s {{developments}} {{were the}} origins of digital sound synthesis by computer, and of algorithmic composition programs beyond rote playback. Max Mathews at Bell Laboratories developed the influential MUSIC I program and its descendents, further popularising computer music through a 1963 article in Science.

50|$|Style {{modeling}} implies {{building a}} computational {{representation of the}} musical surface that captures important stylistic features from data. Statistical approaches are used to capture the redundancies in terms of pattern dictionaries or repetitions, which are later recombined to generate new musical data. Style mixing can be realized by analysis of a database containing multiple musical examples in different styles. Machine Improvisation builds upon a long musical tradition of statistical modeling that began with Hiller and Isaacson's <b>Illiac</b> <b>Suite</b> for String Quartet (1957) and Xenakis' uses of Markov chains and stochastic processes.

50|$|In 1949, the University of Illinois {{created the}} Digital Computer Laboratory {{following}} the joint funding between the University and the U.S. Army {{to create the}} ORDVAC and ILLIAC I computers {{under the direction of}} physicist Ralph Meagher. The ORDVAC and ILLIAC computers the two earliest von-Neumann architecture machines to be constructed. Once completed in 1952, the ILLIAC I inspired machines such as the MISTIC, MUSASINO-1, SILLIAC, and CYCLONE, as well as providing the impetus for the university to continue its research in computing through the ILLIAC II project. Yet despite such advances in high-performance computing, faculty at the Digital Computer Laboratory continued to conduct research in other fields of computing as well, such as in Human-Computer Interaction through the PLATO project, the first computer music (the <b>ILLIAC</b> <b>Suite),</b> computational numerical methods through the work of Donald B. Gillies, and James E. Robertson, the 'R' co-inventor of the SRT division algorithm, to name a few. Given this explosion in research in computing, in 1964, the University of Illinois reorganized the Digital Computer Laboratory into the Department of Computer Science, and by 1967, the department awarded its first PhD and Master's degrees in Computer Science. In 1982, UIUC physicist Larry Smarr wrote a blistering critique of America's supercomputing resources, and as a result the National Science Foundation established the UIUC's National Center for Supercomputing Applications in 1985. NCSA {{was one of the first}} places in industry or academia to develop software for the 3 major operating systems at the time - Macintosh, PC, and UNIX. NCSA in 1986 released NCSA Telnet and in 1993 it released the Mosaic web browser. In 2004, the Department of Computer Science moved out of the Digital Computer Laboratory building into the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science following a gift from alumnus Thomas Siebel.|$|E
5000|$|In Japan, {{experiments}} in computer music {{date back to}} 1962, when Keio University professor Sekine and Toshiba engineer Hayashi experimented with the TOSBAC computer. This resulted in a piece entitled TOSBAC Suite, influenced by the <b>Illiac</b> <b>Suite.</b> Later Japanese computer music compositions include a piece by Kenjiro Ezaki presented during Osaka Expo '70 and [...] "Panoramic Sonore" [...] (1974) by music critic Akimichi Takeda. Ezaki also published an article called [...] "Contemporary Music and Computers" [...] in 1970. Since then, Japanese research in computer music has largely been carried out for commercial purposes in popular music, {{though some of the}} more serious Japanese musicians used large computer systems such as the Fairlight in the 1970s.Early computer-music programs typically did not run in real time. Programs would run for hours or days, on multimillion-dollar computers, to generate a few minutes of music. One way around this was to use a 'hybrid system', most notably the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, where a microprocessor-based system controls an analog synthesizer, released in 1978. John Chowning's work on FM synthesis from the 1960s to the 1970s allowed much more efficient digital synthesis, eventually leading {{to the development of the}} affordable FM synthesis-based Yamaha DX7 digital synthesizer, released in 1983. In addition to the Yamaha DX7, the advent of inexpensive digital chips and microcomputers opened the door to real-time generation of computer music. In the 1980s, Japanese personal computers such as the NEC PC-88 came installed with FM synthesis sound chips and featured audio programming languages such as Music Macro Language (MML) and MIDI interfaces, which were most often used to produce video game music, or chiptunes. By the early 1990s, the performance of microprocessor-based computers reached the point that real-time generation of computer music using more general programs and algorithms became possible.Interesting sounds must have a fluidity and changeability that allows them to remain fresh to the ear. In computer music this subtle ingredient is bought at a high computational cost, both in terms of the number of items requiring detail in a score and in the amount of interpretive work the instruments must produce to realize this detail in sound.|$|E
40|$|Lejaren Hiller's 1970 chapter, "Music Composed with Computers: An Historical Survey" (Hiller 1970) {{contains}} numerous {{descriptions of}} {{projects in the}} computer generation of musical structures. By then, just over {{ten years after the}} publication of Hiller's and Leonard Isaacson's seminal book Experimental Music (Hiller and Isaacson 1959), a startling number of experiments in generativemusic with early computers had been completed. Hiller’s early research, compositions, and publications established him as a leader in the then-emerging field of computer-aided algorithmic composition (CAAC). Some researchers, likely inspired by Hiller and Isaacson's 1956 <b>Illiac</b> <b>Suite</b> string quartet, even duplicated their instrumentation: in an amusing footnote, Hiller writes that "it is curious to note how many computer pieces have been written for string quartet... particularly since string-quartet performers seem to be among the least receptive to newer compositional ideas such as computermusic" (Hiller 1970, p. 70) ...|$|E

40|$|We are {{interested}} in exploring ways in which unconventional modes of computation may provide new directions for future developments in Computer Music. Research into Unconventional Computing (Calude et al. 1998) is aimed at computational paradigms other than the standard von Neumann architecture, which have prevailed in computing since the 1940 s. This paper presents {{an investigation into the}} feasibility of synthesizing sounds with hybrid wetware-silicon devices using in vitro neuronal networks. The field of Computer Music has evolved in tandem with the field of Computer Science. 1 Computers have been programmed to play music as early as the beginning of the 1950 ’s when the CSIR Mk 1 computer was programmed in Australia to play popular musical melodies (Doornbusch 2005). The <b>Illiac</b> <b>Suite</b> for String Quartet, composed in the USA in late 1950 ’s by Lejaren Hiller (composer) and Leonard Isaacson (mathematician), is often cited as the first piece of music involving materials generated by a computer; e. g., the fourth movement was generated using a Markov chain (Hiller and Isaacson 1959). Nowadays, the computer is ubiquitous in many aspects of music, ranging from software for musical composition and production, to systems for distribution of music on the Internet.

The appointment came {{about with the}} help of Lejaren Hiller, founder of the University of Illinois??? Experimental Music Studio and the co-composer of the first significant computer composition <b>Illiac</b> <b>Suite</b> (1957). Cage???s tenure in Urbana culminated in the production of the multimedia work HPSCHD which he produced in collaboration with Hiller, Calvin Sumsion, and Ron Nameth. Hiller oversaw much of the programming work and functioned as a sounding board for Cage???s compositional ideas. Sumsion supervised the static visual elements used in the performance and later collaborated with Cage on a series of lithographs and plexigrams called Not Wanting to Say Anything about Marcel. Nameth, a filmmaker from the Art Department, organized the motion picture films that were used for the performance. Initially, HPSCHD was a commission from the Swiss harpsichordist Antoinette Vischer who had requested from Cage ???a harpsichord piece. ??? Vischer???s modest commission grew into a huge work that included seven harpsichords, 52 tapes of computer-produced tones, about 8, 000 slides and over 40 motion picture films. HPSCHD is an unusual work among Cage???s oeuvre for many reasons. Especially noteworthy is Cage???s large scale use of technology (specifically the computer), the use of historical musical quotations, the theatrical environment of the work, and, perhaps most surprisingly, Cage???s return to earlier compositional ideas. These noteworthy aspects open many avenues of inquiry about the piece, about Cage, and about our assumptions of the composer in the late 1960 s. Since the details of the computer programs and the history of the programming process have been thoroughly discussed, my study will not duplicate these efforts, but will draw on available sources to inform the compositional, philosophical, visual, and contextual meanings of the work. In this study, I analyze the production of HPSCHD ethnographically, as an event. I situate the event within the context of postmodern philosophy, anarchic politics, the culture of the university campus of the late 1960 s, and the countercultural ???summer of love. ??? Through this type of contextual study, I bring some of the assumptions about Cage into question. Cage intentionally couched his compositions in a wealth of political and philosophical rhetoric. In the late 1960 s Cage was highly influenced by his recent rediscovery of Henry David Thoreau and his discovery of the American social philosophy of Marshall McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller. Just as Cage used Asian philosophies to bolster his turn to chance composition in the 1950 s, Cage appropriated a vocabulary from Thoreau, McLuhan, and Fuller to legitimize his new work with the computer. Cage characterized HPSCHD as political work of art which was to demonstrate the possibility of an anarchic utopia??????a world which had come to terms with its own history and its technology. Using David Patterson???s analysis of Cage???s idiosyncratic use of South Asian philosophical terms as a methodological model, I define and clarify terms that Cage used in connection to HPSCHD such as ???abundance,??? ???multiplicity,??? ???anarchy,??? ???chaos,??? and ???interpenetration. ??? For this study, I use a number of previously unpublished primary sources. Cage???s letters from this time period (housed in the John Cage Archives at Northwestern University) are an excellent source. I also draw heavily on the scores and sketches of HPSCHD {{that are part of the}} New York Public Library???s Music Collection. Peter Yates was a devoted friend to Cage and authored the liner notes to the HPSCHD recording released simultaneous to the 1969 event. The Peter Yates Papers, housed in the Mandeville Special Collections Library at the University of California, San Diego contain a wealth of information and correspondence between Yates and Cage. The poet and scholar Eric Mottram Papers wrote fairly extensively about Cage and his book Silence. The Eric Mottram Papers (King???s College, London) are valuable insights into Cage???s work simultaneous to the composition of HPSCHD. Personal interviews and e-mail correspondence with a number of ???informants??? has also proven to be essential to this study. This document includes quite a bit of oral history about Cage, the atmosphere at the University of Illinois in the late 1960 s, and the 1969 HPSCHD event. There is evidence that despite the chance operational selection of materials for the event, Cage had specific ideas about how one was to react to the work. Cage designed into the piece elements that were to cause a participatory reaction and were designed to create an atmosphere of inclusiveness for the mostly college-aged audience. Despite the traditional view and some evidence that Cage distanced himself from the countercultural movement, there is evidence that Cage panders to this population to a certain degree with the inclusion of visual elements that are iconic of the Summer of Love and the psychedelic age. As of yet, no one has studied HPSCHD as an event, with equal emphasis on the visual, the aural, and the participatory aspects of the work. A study of the visual elements of the performance draws on published interviews, unpublished letters, Calvin Sumsion???s graduate thesis from the University of Illinois, and oral accounts from the artists and participants. A study of the slides and films, and how they were produced and selected using consistent chance compositional methods, sheds light on Cage???s conception of HPSCHD as a theater piece...|$|E
