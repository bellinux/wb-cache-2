5|$|Copenhagen has a {{significant}} jazz scene that has existed for many years.

Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as cafés and concert halls fill up with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival.

In one summer alone he received more than 700 visitors.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{was also}} music {{director}} of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months. The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and {{ceased to be a}} major factor in the orchestra's finances. During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which <b>guests</b> <b>from</b> outside the world of classical music appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett. Its regular complement at the end of the decade was 88 players.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} sets of {{greenhouses}} near the property; one set behind Law's home produced decorations for Law's Briarcliff Farms, his house, the lodge, and workers' houses. The other set, the Pierson Greenhouses, were used for growing the American Beauty rose and rare carnations, producing between 5,000 and 8,000 per week.

The lodge also ran an annual American Beauty carnival, with events including a golf tournament, water sports, moonlight bathing and night diving, a dinner dance, cinema program, and a concert. During the lodge's service, carriage transportation was provided for <b>guests</b> <b>from</b> the Scarborough and Briarcliff Manor train stations to the lodge.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1879 as a halt on the Smaalens Line, {{now known as}} the western branch of the Østfold Line. The station {{building}} was designed by the Norwegian architect Peter Andreas Blix in the same Swiss cottage style as the stations Ås and Såner. In the 1950s, the station was frequently used by weekend <b>guests</b> <b>from</b> Oslo that visited the nearby conurbation Hvitsten for having a bath. A few years after the section of the Østfold Line between Ski and Moss Station was upgraded to double tracks, Vestby Station received a major renovation. A regulation plan for the station area was published in May 2010, which involved increasing the number of car parking places.|$|E
5|$|The Academy {{wanted to}} find a new venue for the festivities amid limited seating and {{rehearsal}} time concerns with the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. In addition, problems arose regarding staging the Oscars at the Shrine Auditorium because there was difficulty of directing <b>guests</b> <b>from</b> the auditorium where the main event took place to the adjacent Exhibition Hall for the Governor's Ball. In August 1997, AMPAS and Canadian development firm TrizecHahn went into negotiations over the development of an entertainment complex located on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue adjacent to the Mann's Chinese Theatre. Seven months later, both the Academy and TrizecHahn agreed on a twenty-year lease that allowed for the ceremony to be staged at a new venue, which would later be called the Kodak Theatre, located within the property which was also situated near the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel site of the inaugural awards ceremony in 1929. This {{was the first time the}} ceremony was held in Hollywood since the 32nd ceremony took place at the Pantages Theatre in 1960.|$|E
