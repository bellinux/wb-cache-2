5|$|At the Jock River, {{southwest}} of Barrhaven, deposits of sensitive leda clay presented a challenge <b>in</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> crossing for the freeway {{as well as}} the Canadian National Railway overpass to the north. It was feared that the weight of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath and lead to landslides. In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter blast furnace slag, at half the weight, was substituted.|$|E

5|$|In February 1989, the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee {{selected}} Dworsky {{as executive}} architect {{to work with}} designated architect Frank Gehry <b>in</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dworsky was selected to translate Gehry's conceptual designs into working drawings that would meet building code specifications. By 1994, {{the cost of the}} project had skyrocketed to $160 million (it eventually reached $274 million), and controversy halted the project. By 1996, a major donor was sought to complete the project by 2001 (four years behind schedule). Gehry and his design came under fire, and some considered him a spoiled, impractical artist.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> game mechanics, Naka was {{inspired}} by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E

40|$|A central element <b>in</b> <b>design</b> is <b>the</b> {{search for}} the new and not-yet-existing.

5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, <b>in</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> {{strengths and weaknesses of}} the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the Mario series, Yoshizawa kept the same title but changed everything else; it became a platformer {{as opposed to a}} beat 'em up such as Double Dragon; the gameplay was modeled after Konami's Castlevania, with Ryu being equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. <b>In</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest in order to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they utilized specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.|$|E
5|$|Huh had {{difficulty}} <b>in</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> Pig Girl's mask and attempted several different designs which were rejected before {{arriving at the}} chosen mask, but cannot imagine Mu-Yeon wearing any other mask now. Yen Press licensed Pig Bride for an English-language release in North America and began serializing it in the manga anthology Yen Plus. The final issue of Yen Plus in July 2010 contained the conclusion to Pig Bride. The English localization process included Korean onomatopoeia and sound effects with the anglicized word followed by the English translations.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> 777 as {{its first}} {{fly-by-wire}} commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
5|$|John von Neumann, {{working with}} Oskar Morgenstern {{on the theory}} of games, broke new {{mathematical}} ground in 1944 by extending functional analytic methods related to convex sets and topological fixed-point theory to economic analysis. Their work thereby avoided the traditional differential calculus, for which the maximum–operator {{did not apply to}} non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work in cooperative game theory, game theorists Lloyd S. Shapley, Martin Shubik, Hervé Moulin, Nimrod Megiddo, Bezalel Peleg influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the fair prices in cooperative games and fair values for voting games led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in public–works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used <b>in</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> water distribution system of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.|$|E
5|$|Development of Final Fantasy X-2 {{began in}} late 2001 in {{response}} to the success of Final Fantasy X, particularly fan reaction to the Eternal Calm video included in the Japanese version of Final Fantasy X International. It was released in Japan shortly before the merger between Square and Enix. The game's eventual name, X-2, was initially not liked by the production team, but it was eventually accepted since the story was a direct continuation of X and thus could not be the next numbered title in the series. Kazushige Nojima, the previous game's writer, was also skeptical about the creation of a sequel. Something he was particularly averse to originally was the happy ending, which he felt was wrong for the story. The production team was one third the size of the previous installment. This was because the team was already familiar with the material and it allowed them to give a hand-crafted feel to the game. <b>In</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> game, a significant number of character models, enemies, and location designs from Final Fantasy X were reused. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura has explained that this allowed the game to be developed in one year and at half the normal scope Final Fantasy titles are normally produced. Maya and Softimage 3D were the two main programs used to create the graphics.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> levels, Newcomer added {{platforms}} to {{the environment}} after the combat was devised. A static game world was chosen over a scrolling world to showcase visual textures applied to the platforms. The hardware could not easily display the textures while scrolling, and the team felt that displaying the whole environment would aid players. The last game world element was a lava pit and a hand reaching out of it to destroy characters {{too close to the}} bottom. Newcomer placed the platforms to optimize Pfutzenrueter's enemy artificial intelligence (AI), which factors attack patterns based partly on platform placements. The knight enemies were designed to exhibit progressively more aggressive behavior. Bounders fly around the environment randomly, occasionally reacting to the protagonist. Hunters seek the player's character in an effort to collide. Shadow Lords fly quickly and closer {{to the top of the}} screen. Pfutzenrueter designed them to fly higher when close to the protagonist to increase the Shadow Lord's chances of victory against the player. The pterodactyl was designed to attack idle players and be difficult to defeat. The only vulnerability was attacking the creature in its open mouth during a specific animation frame. Newcomer and Pfutzenrueter designed the pterodactyl to quickly fly upward at the last moment when approaching a player waiting at the edge of a platform. This was done to prevent an easy defeat of the enemy. When processing the graphics, the game gives priority to the player characters over the enemies. As a result, enemies begin to react more slowly when the number of on-screen sprites increases.|$|E
