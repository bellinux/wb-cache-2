40|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>reserve,</b> an {{historic}} form of planned open space creating semi-private parks {{at the rear}} of residential allotments and without street frontages, can be found in Australian suburban areas of diverse socio-economic status. <b>Internal</b> <b>reserves</b> commonly express the idealism of the early town planning movement, which envisaged the <b>internal</b> <b>reserve</b> as an embedded community-building mechanism with multiple potential uses. En vogue from 1910 - 1930, the <b>internal</b> <b>reserve</b> concept proved problematical from the outset. Even today, while many residents agree that their reserves are responsible for the special nature of their domestic environment, others are apprehensive about safety, maintenance and custodianship. Two surveys of residents living around <b>internal</b> <b>reserves</b> in four Melbourne suburbs, conducted in 1979 and 2002, reveal a variety of opinions on the potential and importance of these spaces. Local communities were found for the most part to have negative and ambiguous perceptions of these reserves. With one exception, residents did not value the parks highly as community spaces and alternative uses may need to be explored. The results suggest that a more innovative set of tools and incentives may be needed to reinvigorate the <b>internal</b> <b>reserve</b> as a significant recreation resource for local communities. <br /...|$|R

50|$|<b>Reserved</b> <b>list</b> - Defined in Major League Rule 2, the 40-man roster is {{also known}} as the Major League <b>Reserve</b> <b>List.</b> This name hearkens back to baseball's past when teams {{reserved}} the rights to a number of their players, making it impossible for any other team to sign those individuals. In time, a team's <b>reserve</b> <b>list</b> was expanded to all players under contract to that team until the player was released (potentially never). In the 1970s, free agency allowed players achieving certain conditions the opportunity to leave their original team. The system has undergone further changes since then, but there are still players under reserve from year to year on each team. Those players include most minor leaguers and players on the Major League <b>Reserve</b> <b>List.</b>|$|R
30|$|Ha-Sung Chang {{identified}} that Korean capitalism is broken {{because it does}} not have the three growth elements: employment, wage, and distribution. As an alternative, he suggested righteous capitalism (Ha-Sung 2014 p. 521). For five years from 2008 when the economic crisis occurred until 2013, the average global growth rate of Korea was 1.7  %, and the average growth rate of the US and England was 0.8  % and − 0.6  %, respectively. The record rates brought about capitalism in crisis. Chang pointed out that the crisis was caused by the structure of inequality and the worsening of inequality rather than by the slowdown of growth, and that the fruit of growth did not have an impact on people’s lives (Ha-Sung 2014 p. 20). He said, for the past 30  years when market fundamentalism dominated, the conditions of employment have been aggravated, and unstable employment has increased such occurrences as income inequality, class polarization, an economic growth structure without employment, and an increase in low-wage employees and temporary workers. Korea has experienced the same economic conditions. Ha-Sung Chang analyzed that as corporate income continuously increases against household income among household income, corporate income, and government income, which comprise the gross national income, it seems that the <b>internal</b> <b>reserves</b> of <b>listed</b> companies rise without an end, resulting in a lack of corporate investment for job creation, a decrease in consumption in the household section, and the stagnant growth of capitalism in Korea. He takes an optimistic view that the growth limits of capitalism in Korea can be overcome by converting capitalism to righteous capitalism guaranteed by a competing system, fair market, and realization of justice. He also added that the current growth stagnation can be handled. In particular, he {{identified that}} based on trust in shareholders, who are the owners of assets in modern capitalism rather than capitalists, if shareholder capitalism in the investment of foreign companies in Korea and even in the state-run firms of state capitalism like in China and Russia is based on competition, fairness, and justice, capitalism, with its growth stopped, will begin again (Ha-Sung 2014 p. 247).|$|R
