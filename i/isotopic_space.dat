40|$|Oral {{presentation}} - Session #: 12 : Abstract ID: 29719 Although marine sponges {{are frequently}} placed into functional categories {{based on their}} overall microbial abundance (High and Low Microbial Abundance [HMA and LMA]), recent {{research has shown that}} these communities and overall interactions are highly variable across individual species. To elucidate the role that overall microbial abundance, photosymbiont abundance, host sponge identity, and geography play in holobiont C and N cycling, we used a stable isotope approach in conjunction with multivariate and ellipse-based analyses. This allowed us to evaluate the core isotopic niche of a species or group and investigate factors driving the placement of individuals within <b>isotopic</b> <b>space.</b> Up to 14 sponge species were collected from three Caribbean sites (Panama, Honduras, and Belize), the Florida Keys, and a temperate reef off Georgia, USA. Some variation was attributed to geographic location, but this effect was greatly minimized when data from the temperate reef were excluded. Within individual sites, HMA and LMA groups filled unique niche space. However, host identity accounted for at least 70 percent of the variation in isotope values within a site, while photosymbiont and overall microbial abundance accounted for a much lower proportion of this variation. Together these data suggest that microbial symbionts may allow sponges to expand into novel niche space on tropical reefs, but species placement within <b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> is relatively stable and is likely structured more by host-specific microbial community composition than by overall microbial or photosymbiont abundance...|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} in isotopic composition between a consumer's tissues {{and that of}} its diet is a critical aspect {{of the use of}} stable isotope analyses in ecological and palaeoecological studies. In a controlled feeding experiment with the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the value of tissue-diet isotope spacing in nitrogen in a growing animal is not constant, but varies inversely with growth rate. The value of tissue-diet <b>isotopic</b> <b>spacing</b> in N reflects N use efficiency. Thus, in salmon, growth rate is accompanied by, or requires, increased N use efficiency. The total range in tissue-diet <b>isotopic</b> <b>spacing</b> in N seen in the experimental population of 25 fish was 1 ‰, approximately 50 % of the total trophic shift. Mean equilibrium tissue-diet <b>isotopic</b> <b>spacing</b> (±standard deviation) in salmon averaged 2. 3 ‰ (± 0. 3 ‰) and 0. 0 ‰ (± 0. 3 ‰) for N in muscle and liver, respectively, and 2. 1 ‰ (± 0. 1 ‰) and 1. 6 ‰ (± 0. 3 ‰) for C in muscle and liver, respectively. Feeding with a mixed dietary source (wheat and fish-meal origin) resulted in tissue-diet isotopic fractionation in both C and N due to the differential digestibility of food components with distinct isotopic composition. The rate of change in isotopic composition of S. salar tissues was dominated by growth, but the estimated contribution of metabolic turnover to change in tissue N was relatively high for an ectothermic animal at ca. 20 – 40 %. The estimated half-life for metabolic turnover of the tissue N pool was ca. 4 months in both muscle and liver tissue. This is the first study to demonstrate a direct relationship between tissue-diet <b>isotopic</b> <b>spacing</b> in N and growth rate and adds to the growing list of factors known to influence the level of isotopic separation between a consumer's tissue and that of its diet...|$|R

Techniques range from simple, qualitative inferences based on the isotopic niche, to Bayesian mixing models that can be used to characterize food-web structure at multiple hierarchical levels. We provide a comprehensive review of these techniques, and thus a single reference source to help identify the most useful approaches to apply to a given data set. We structure the review around four general questions: (1) what is the trophic position of an organism in a food web?; (2) which resource pools support consumers?; (3) what additional information does relative position of consumers in <b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> reveal about food-web structure?; and (4) what is the degree of trophic variability at the intrapopulation level?

40|$|Tropical rainforests {{support the}} {{greatest}} diversity of small mammals in the world, {{yet we have}} little understanding about the mechanisms that promote the coexistence of species. Diet partitioning can favor coexistence by lessening competition, and interspecific differences in body size and habitat use are usually proposed {{to be associated with}} trophic divergence. However, the use of classic dietary methods (e. g. stomach contents) is challenging in small mammals, particularly in community-level studies, thus we used stable isotopes (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) to infer about trophic niche. We investigated i) how trophic niche is partitioned among rodent and marsupial species in three Atlantic forest sites and ii) if interspecific body size and locomotor habit inequalities can constitute mechanisms underlying the isotopic niche partitioning. We found that rodents occupied a broad <b>isotopic</b> niche <b>space</b> with species distributed in different trophic levels and relying on diverse basal carbon sources (C 3 and C 4 plants). Surprisingly, on the other hand, marsupials showed a narrow isotopic niche, both in δ 13 C and δ 15 N dimensions, which is partially overlapped with rodents, contradicting their description as omnivores and generalists proposed classic dietary studies. Although body mass differences did not explained the divergence in isotopic values among species, groups of species with different locomotor habit presented clear differences in the position of the <b>isotopic</b> niche <b>space,</b> indicating that the use of different forest strata can favor trophic niche partitioning in small mammals communities. We suggest that anthropogenic impacts, such as habitat modification (logging, harvesting), can simplify the vertical structure of ecosystems and collapse the diversity of basal resources, which might affect negatively small mammals communities in Atlantic forests...|$|R

Here, we asked how two ungulate species with contrasting feeding habits, grazing gemsbok (Oryx g. gazella) and browsing springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), {{respond to an}} increase in food availability during a pronounced rain period. We used a stable isotope approach to delineate the feeding habits of these two ungulates in the arid Kunene Region of Namibia. Our nineteen months field investigation included two time periods of drought when food availability for ungulates was lowest and an intermediate period with extreme, unusual rainfalls. We documented thirteen isotopically distinct food sources in the <b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> of the study area. Our results indicated a relatively high dietary plasticity of gemsbok, which fed on a mixture of plants, including more than 30 % of C 3 plants during drought periods, but almost exclusively on C 4 and CAM plant types when food was plentiful. During drought periods, the inferred gemsbok diets also consisted of up to 25 % of Euphorbia damarana; an endemic CAM plant that is rich in toxic secondary plant compounds. In contrast, springbok were generalists, feeding on a higher proportion of C 3 than C 4 /CAM plants, irrespective of environmental conditions. Our results illustrate two dietary strategies in gemsbok and springbok which enable them to survive and coexist in the hostile Kunene arid ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The upstream-downstream {{gradient}} (UDG) is a {{key feature}} of streams. For instance food webs are assumed to change from upstream to downstream. We tested this hypothesis in a small European river catchment (937 km(2)), and examined whether food web modifications are related to structural (i. e. food web composition) or functional changes (i. e. alteration of linkages within the web). We adopted a double approach at two levels of organisation (assemblage and species levels) using two isotopic metrics (<b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> area and isotopic niche overlap), and proposed a new hypothesis-testing framework for exploring the dominant feeding strategy within a food web. We confirmed that the UDG influenced stream food webs, and found that food web modifications were related to both structural and functional changes. The structural change was mainly related {{to an increase in}} species richness, and induced functional modifications of the web (indirect effect). In addition, the UDG also modified the functional features of the web directly, without changing the web composition. The proposed framework allowed relating the direct effect of the UDG to a diet specialisation of the species, and the indirect effect via the structural changes to a generalist feeding strategy. The framework highlights the benefits of conducting the double approach, and provides a foundation for future studies investigating the dominant feeding strategy that underlies food web modifications...|$|E

With the objective of estimating potential medium-term and inter-annual variations in trophic niche, we measured δ 15 N and δ 13 C in feather samples of pygoscelid penguins from museum specimens (1982 – 1984) and in blood and feather samples from 2009 / 10 – 2011 collected from animals on Ardley Island. Current penguin feathers had lower δ 13 C and δ 15 N values and were more similar to Antarctic krill values, than feathers in 1982 – 1984 and blood from 2009 / 10 - 2011. Moreover, δ 13 C and δ 15 N values from museum feathers and modern samples occupied a larger <b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), compared to Adélie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap Penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica). Our results from feathers samples indicated that penguins have decreased their consumption of fish and other prey of higher trophic levels in the early interbreeding period (EIBP), while increasing the amount of euphausiids (Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) taken. The isotopic values of the species suggest that foraging sites varied significantly over time and seasonally. We suggest that environmental changes may have modified the feeding habits of pygoscelid penguins, resulting in changed foraging behaviour in the EIBP, and altering the secondary prey consumption. Prey choice in breeding pygoscelid species is probably limited by the foraging range around the breeding colony and competitive exclusion between congeners...|$|E

40|$|During {{the late}} Pleistocene (130 - 12 ka), Beringia, a largely {{ice-free}} land {{located in the}} Mammoth Steppe Ecosystem, was home to a large grazing community of megafauna. Many of these animals, including the woolly mammoth, became extinct at the terminal Pleistocene. Assessment of the paleoenvironment, nutrient cycling and foraging ecology in Beringia should help to understand the role of climate change in their extirpation. Such information might also help to explain the curiously higher δ 15 N of woolly mammoths relative to other coeval herbivores. This study assessed eastern Beringian paleoecology using stable nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) isotopic analyses of late Pleistocene fossil and modern soils, plants and rodent bones from Yukon Territory. A principal goal {{was to determine whether}} a modern isotopic baseline for the grassland food web should be used to interpret the isotopic data for Beringian megafauna. The average δ 13 C of fossil plants from fossil arctic ground squirrel nests is 1. 6 ‰ higher than modern equivalents, mostly because of the Suess effect. Experiments using modern grasses suggest that the fossil plants were enriched in 15 N by microbially mediated decomposition. The pre-decomposition δ 15 N of the fossil plants was determined by measuring the N <b>isotopic</b> <b>spacing</b> between modern arctic ground squirrel collagen and their diet, and applying this spacing to the fossil bones. The results show that the δ 15 N of fossil plants was originally ~ 2. 5 ‰ higher than their modern equivalents. This difference suggests a shift in N cycling between the late Pleistocene and present time. A controlled-growth study of the effects of progressive CO 2 enrichment – which occurred after the terminal Pleistocene – on subarctic nutrient cycling, demonstrates a pattern of decreasing δ 13 C for mature grasses, although the change was not significant. The δ 15 N response was nonlinear and not significant. The collective results indicate that modern plant isotopic compositions for Yukon Territory are not appropriate baselines for interpreting the δ 13 C and δ 15 N of Pleistocene megafauna from eastern Beringia. In addition, decomposed plants, which are typically enriched in 15 N, may have been important foods that were preferentially available to the woolly mammoth during cold seasons, and thus biased their δ 15 N to higher values...|$|R

A special solution W^k_(triv) α (x) in three spaces is described, which can be understood as result of embedding the Abelian monopole potential into the non-Abelian model. The problem of Dirac fermion doublet in the external BPS-monopole potential in these curved spaces is examined on the base of generally covariant tetrad formalism by Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko.

The Apogonidae (cardinalfishes) include mostly carnivorous species and evidence of trophic niche partitioning among sympatric cardinalfishes is still limited. The present study combines stomach contents and stable isotope analyses to investigate the feeding ecology of an assemblage of eight cardinalfishes from the Great Reef of Toliara (SW Madagascar). δ 13 C and δ 15 N of fishes ranged between - 17. 49 ‰ and - 10. 03 ‰ and between 6. 28 ‰ and 10. 74 ‰, respectively. Both stomach contents and stable isotopes showed that they feed on planktonic and benthic animal prey in various proportions. Previous studies were able to group apogonids in different trophic categories but such a discrimination is not obvious here. Large intra-specific variation in the stomach contents and temporal variation in the relative contribution of prey to diet support that all apogonids {{should be considered as}} generalist, carnivorous fishes. However the exploration of the <b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> revealed a clear segregation of isotopic niches among species, suggesting a high level of resource partitioning within the assemblage. According to low inter-specific variation in stomach content compositions, we argue that the differences in isotopic niches could be driven by variation in foraging locations (i. e. microhabitat segregation) and physiology among species. Our temporal datasets demonstrate that the trophic niche partitioning among cardinalfishes and the breadth of their isotopic niches are dynamic and change across time. Factors driving this temporal variation need to be investigated in further studies. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The geochemical {{properties}} of the South-Eastern Alps volcanics (SEAV, Eocene age) call for a within-plate origin of the most primitive basalts, {{in contrast to the}} widespread calc-alkaline magmatism which developed some million years later northwestwards along the Periadriatic Lineament. The two contrasting magmatic suites that coexist in the Alpine area deﬁne binary mixing relationships in the Sr–Nd and Sr–Pb <b>isotopic</b> <b>space,</b> the end members of which being a crustal component (e. g. lower continental crust) and a HIMU-DMM component (e. g. the SEAV). The occurrence of a HIMU (high μ= high 238 U/ 204 Pb) component, which normally traces mantle plumes of deep mantle origin, in a tectonic regime dominated by collision tectonics (the tertiary convergence of European and Adriatic plates) can be explained by slab detachment and ensuing upwelling of mantle material through the lithospheric gap. We combine geochemical data and geophysical modelling to unravel the evolution of the Alpine slab after interaction with plume material and the genesis of the Alpine magmatism. The combination of changes in negative buoyancy caused by continental subduction and softening of a part of the slab caused by slab–plume interaction may act as a regulator for the time of slab breakoff and, consequently, for the variations of magmatism in the overriding lithosphere above a subduction zone. The thermal evolution of a subducting slab is modiﬁed by contact with the plume material which decreases signiﬁcantly the total strength of the slab and favours slab detachment. Interactions between the HIMU component and the shallower depleted mantle can account for the geochemical characteristics of the SEAV. Counterﬂows of plume material towards the top of the subducting slab may also increase heating and partial melting of the overriding mantle wedge, giving rise to the calc-alkaline suite outcropping in the proximity of the Periadriatic Lineament. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is located off-axis the Southwest Indian Ridge {{in the vicinity of}} the triple point joining the African, South American, and Antarctic plates. As early as the seventies, this island has been regarded as being the surface expression of a mantle plume, which triggered the break-up of the Gondwanaland supercontinent. However, the detailed lower mantle structure of the Bouvet hotspot is largely unknown, because seismic ray coverage of the lowermost mantle under the southwestern Indian Ocean is weak. Surface wave tomography lacks the lateral resolution to image small-scale structures such as hotspots, expected to generate anomalies only a few hundred kilometers wide. The geology of the island is also poorly known because of the presence of a permanent ice cap. Previous studies (e. g. Verwoerd et al., 1990) have established the presence of solely two geological formations: a lower hydrothermally altered sequence of mainly pyroclastic rocks and an upper formation of predominantly subaerial lava flows. This latter unit consists of mainly mildly alkaline basalts, and carries minor amounts of intermediate and acid lavas, ranging in age from 1. 39 Ma to < 0. 1 Ma. The early magmatic evolution of the island is virtually unknown. The geochemical data presented here are based on a suite of about 25 samples collected from the coastlines of Bouvet Island. The serie extends from basic (mildly alkaline basalts) to intermediate (benmoreites) and acid rocks (rhyolites). None of our samples (MgO < 4. 84 wt. %) can be regarded as a primary product of mantle melting. The alkali basalt lavas are chemically homogeneous in spanning a narrow range of major and trace element variability. These lavas all show strong light Rare Earth Element (REE) enrichment typical of ocean island basalts and the overall parallel REE trends show increasing enrichment in all the REE from hawaiite through to rhyolite. The similarity of their trace element ratios and parallelism of their rare earth element patterns indicate: (1) a mantle source homogeneity; (2) an uniformity of the melting conditions (i. e. degree of melting and residual mineralogy) during most of the sub-aerial eruptive history. Their trace element systematics are not typical of a HIMU-like mantle source. Their homogeneous Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic composition occupy an intermediate position among the isotopic variability spectrum defined by Earth's oceanic island basalts, encompassing the isotopic variability range of the common component “C” representing the intersection point of the isotopic arrays of ocean island and mid-ocean ridge suites in two or in three dimensional <b>isotopic</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|Studying ontogenetic {{trends in}} diet and habitat use of {{endangered}} sharks and deep-water teleosts is logistically challenging and expensive, {{due to the}} remote and inaccessible nature of the pelagic realm, {{and the extent of}} many marine migrations. Chemical analysis of inert, organic, incrementally formed tissues represents a window to retrospectively study whole life-history ecology, however these tissues are rare or absent in many fishes. The fish eye lens is a unique tissue, formed via the sequential deposition of protein-filled fiber cells, which undergo no subsequent remodelling once formed. Despite having great potential to record chemical variations reflecting foraging behaviour, lenses have received relatively little analytical attention. In this thesis I have explored the suitability of fish lenses for recovery of retrospective ontogenetic chemical information, focusing particularly on pre-birth and early juvenile life histories in elasmobranchs. I have confirmed consistent relationships between the body size and lens diameter of four study species (Aphonopus carbo, Coryphaenoides rupestris, Lamna nasus and Squalus acanthias), which allows recovery of a body size-referenced lens samples. Growth relationships reveal that a large proportion of lens tissue in elasmobranchs is deposited pre-birth, opening a previously unrecognised opportunity to study maternal provisioning from tissues of the offspring as adults. I have confirmed that transects of stable isotope compositions across lenses show bilateral symmetry, reflecting the sequential deposition of eye lens tissue. Muscle-lens tissue offsets were examined in S. acanthias and C. rupestris, identifying the potential for species-specific differences, possibly driven by variability in taxon-specific lens protein expression. I have then applied the validated lens sampling protocol to recover cross-generational life history movement and diet ecology information in three study species. Focusing on pre-birth ecology requires some understanding of the isotopic relationship between maternal and embryonic tissues. With access to gravid female spiny dogfish, <b>isotopic</b> <b>spacing</b> between maternal and offspring tissues was investigated. However, the measured mother-embryo isotopic offsets are confounded by migration across isotopic provinces, introducing considerable temporal de-coupling between nutrient assimilation fuelling maternal tissue remodelling and yolk sac provisioning, particularly in species with a long gestation period. For the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias recovered from the North Sea, lens-derived isotope histories revealed that, whilst the southern and central North Sea represent important foraging areas during mature life history, the northern North Sea is more important during gestation, pupping, and early life history. Similarly, porbeagle (L. nasus) lens chemistry indicates that the mothers of individuals caught in the Celtic Sea region forage over a wide area of the north Atlantic. Attracting mothers from a wide geographical area, this nursery area is likely to be important for the conservation of the endangered northeast Atlantic population, where mitigating discarding is a priority to fisheries managers. The isotopic variability of sequential A. carbo lens samples was also investigated in order to address trends in foraging and location throughout individual life history. Lens data provide further evidence of ontogenetic depth and latitudinal movements, consistent with the species’ ontogenetic migration theory. Obtaining a near whole life history record of information relating to an individual’s trophic and spatial ecology using traditional tagging methods is challenging, if not impossible. The lens therefore represents a valuable chemical repository for high-resolution ecological information that can be analysed retrospectively. <br/...|$|R

On tropical coral reefs, many (High Microbial Abundance [HMA]) but not all (Low Microbial Abundance [LMA]) marine sponges host abundant symbiont communities. Although recent research has revealed substantial variation in these sponge-microbe associations (termed holobionts), {{little is known about the}} ecological implications of this diversity. We investigated the expansion of diverse sponge species across isotopic niche space by calculating niche size (as standard ellipse area [SEAc]) and assessing the relative placement of common sponge species in bivariate (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) plots. Sponges for this study were collected from the relatively isolated reefs within the Miskito Cays of Honduras. These reefs support diverse communities of HMA and LMA species that together span a gradient of photosymbiont abundance, as revealed by chlorophyll a analysis. HMA sponges occupied unique niche space compared to LMA species, but the placement of some HMA sponges was driven by photosymbiont abundance. In addition, photosymbiont abundance explained a significant portion of the variation in isotope values, suggesting that access to autotrophic metabolism provided by photosymbionts is an important predictor in the location of species within <b>isotopic</b> <b>space.</b> Host identity accounted for over 70 % of the variation in isotope values within the Miskito Cays and there was substantial variation in the placement of individual species within isotopic niche space, suggesting that holobiont metabolic diversity may allow taxonomically diverse sponge species to utilize unique sources of nutrients within a reef system. This study provides initial evidence that microbial symbionts allow sponges to expand into novel physiochemical niche space. This expansion may reduce competitive interactions within coral reefs and promote diversification of these communities...|$|E
40|$|The {{relatively}} pristine upper Gila River in New Mexico is a stronghold for endemic native fishes {{despite the}} presence of non-native fishes. In other, more severely human-impacted tributaries in the Colorado River basin, non-native fishes are a major factor in native species decline and extirpation. I tested whether presumed negative effects of non-natives on natives are compounded during drought using an approach based on Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA) and comparisons of resource use overlap during different flow conditions. Fish specimens were selected from natural history collections to represent a time series that encompassed wet and dry years, as well as varying non-native abundances. I estimated ‘isotopic niche space’ by plotting δ 13 C vs. δ 15 N for native and non-native fishes and statistically compared breadth and overlap in niches among species. I hypothesized that during low-flow periods, the availability of resources is constrained, causing isotopic niches of non-natives and natives to overlap more, which increases the potential for competition. I hypothesized that during wet periods, resource space is broader, suggesting reduced overlap of resource use. My results indicate that low-flow conditions constrain resources in <b>isotopic</b> <b>space,</b> and wet conditions increase diversity of available resources. During wet conditions, native and non-native groups have more varied resource use. SIA of museum specimens offered the potential to test key hypotheses about the impact of non-native species on a native fauna, and provided understanding of the environmental context that non-native species negatively impact native fishes. Such understanding is important for conservation of the fishes of the Gila River, where climate change and pending water diversion could lead to further imperilment of native fish abundance.

40|$|The western Antarctic Peninsula is {{experiencing}} strong environmental changes {{as a consequence}} of ongoing regional warming. Glaciers in the area are retreating rapidly and increased sediment-laden meltwater runoff threatens the benthic biodiversity at shallow depths. We identified three sites with a distinct glacier-retreat related history and different levels of glacial influence in the inner part of Potter Cove (King George Island, South Shetland Islands), a fjord-like embayment impacted since the 1950 s by a tidewater glacier retreat. We compared the soft sediment meio- and macrofauna isotopic niche widths (d 13 C and d 15 N stable isotope analysis) at the three sites to investigate possible glacier retreat-related influences on benthic trophic interactions. The isotopic niches were locally shaped by the different degrees of glacier retreat-related disturbance within the Cove. Wider isotopic niche widths were found at the site that has become ice-free most recently, and narrower niches at the older ice-free sites. At an intermediate state of glacier retreat-related disturbance (e. g. via ice-growler scouring) species with different strategies could settle. The site at the earliest stage of post-retreat development was characterized by an assemblage with lower trophic redundancy. Generally, the isotopic niche widths increased with increasing size spectra of organisms within the community, excepting the youngest assemblage, where the pioneer colonizer meiofauna size class displayed the highest isotopic niche width. Meiofauna at all sites generally occupied positions in the <b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> that suggested a detrital-pool food source and/or the presence of predatory taxa. In general ice scour and glacial impact appeared to play a two-fold role within the Cove: i) either stimulating trophic diversity by allowing continuous re-colonization of meiofaunal species or, ii) over time driving the benthic assemblages into a more compact trophic structure with increased connectedness and resource recycling...|$|E
40|$|Large predators often play {{important}} roles in structuring marine communities. To understand the role that these predators play in ecosystems, {{it is crucial to}} have knowledge of their interactions {{and the degree to which}} their trophic roles are complementary or redundant among species. We used stable isotope analysis to examine the isotopic niche overlap of dolphins Tursiops cf. aduncus, large sharks (> 1. 5 m total length), and smaller elasmobranchs (sharks and batoids) in the relatively pristine seagrass community of Shark Bay, Australia. Dolphins and large sharks differed in their mean isotopic values for δ 13 C and δ 15 N, and each group occupied a relatively unique area in <b>isotopic</b> niche <b>space.</b> The standard ellipse areas (SEAc; based on bivariate standard deviations) of dolphins, large sharks, small sharks, and rays did not overlap. Tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier had the highest δ 15 N values, although the mean δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of pigeye sharks Carcharhinus amboinensis were similar. Other large sharks (e. g. sicklefin lemon sharks Negaprion acutidens and sandbar sharks Carcharhinus plumbeus) and dolphins appeared to feed at slightly lower trophic levels than tiger sharks. In this seagrass-dominated ecosystem, seagrass-derived carbon appears to be more important for elasmobranchs than it is for dolphins. Habitat use patterns did not correlate well with the sources of productivity supporting diets, suggesting that habitat use patterns may not necessarily be reflective of the resource pools supporting a population and highlights the importance of detailed datasets on trophic interactions for elucidating the ecological roles of predators...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how marine predators {{interact}} is {{a scientific}} challenge. In marine ecosystems, segregation in feeding habits {{has been largely}} described as a common mechanism to allow the coexistence of several competing marine predators. However, {{little is known about}} the feeding ecology of most species of chondrichthyans, which play a pivotal role in the structure of marine food webs worldwide. In this study, we examined the trophic ecology of 3 relatively abundant chondrichthyans coexisting in the Mediterranean Sea: the blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus, the velvet belly lanternshark Etmopterus spinax and the rabbit fish Chimaera monstrosa. To examine their trophic ecology and interspecific differences in food habits, we combined the analysis of stomach content and stable isotopes. Our results highlighted a trophic segregation between C. monstrosa and the other 2 species. G. melastomus showed a diet composed mainly of cephalopods, while E. spinax preyed mainly on shrimps and C. monstrosa on crabs. Interspecific differences in the trophic niche were likely due to different feeding capabilities and body size. Each species showed different <b>isotopic</b> niche <b>space</b> and trophic level. Specifically, C. monstrosa showed a higher trophic level than E. spinax and G. melastomus. The high trophic levels of the 3 species highlighted their important role as predators in the marine food web. Our results illustrate the utility of using complementary approaches that provide information about the feeding behaviour at short (stomach content) and long-term scales (stable isotopes), which could allow more efficient monitoring of marine food-web changes in the study area...|$|R
40|$|Species invasions are a {{significant}} threat to global biodiversity and ecosystem function, and yet our knowledge of consequences for native species remains poor. The problem is exacerbated in highly speciose ecosystems like coral reefs. The invasion of the wider Caribbean by predatory lionfish (Pterois spp.) {{is one of the}} most successful marine colonizations ever documented, and its impact is anticipated to be substantial on native species. However, despite the ecological and commercial importance of iconic Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), the impacts of the invasion on this IUCN Red-Listed species remain unexamined. Using data gathered from two critical habitats in the Bahamas, we investigate <b>isotopic</b> niche <b>space</b> overlap between lionfish, Nassau grouper and putative prey species. Despite their relatively small body size, we find that lionfish occupy the highest isotopic niche position on patch reefs, occupying much of the same space as the native apex predator. Contrary to expectation, lionfish trophic level (δ 15 N) does not increase with body size, contrasting with confamilials in their native range. However, we find that tissue carbon (δ 13 C) changes systematically with body size on deep forereef habitats, representing a length-specific shift in food resources, with smaller individuals partitioning resources from larger individuals in this habitat but not on shallow patch reefs. We conclude that, despite the difference in body size, lionfish are capable of directly competing for food resources with Nassau grouper, and that impacts on guilds such as planktivores and invertivores may vary systematically by habitat. Our study contributes to the growing body of research aimed at understanding how a species that is relatively rare in its native range achieved the most successful fish invasion ever documented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith the use {{of stable}} isotopes, new {{concepts}} have emerged {{based on the idea}} that the ecological niche can be approximated by the isotopic niche defined as a δ-space area with isotopic δ values as coordinates. This study aims to (i) redefine functional indices originally based on quantitative biological traits of species and demonstrate the ecological significance of newly defined isotopic functional indices (IFI) in a δ-isotopic space, (ii) compare IFI using biomass data with existing unweighted isotopic indices using only isotopic compositions. Using a community-wide approach, we tested IFI using isotopic compositions of a large set of associated species from two marine benthic communities widely reported in coastal shallow waters: the common Amphiura filiformis muddy-sand community and the engineered Haploops nirae sandy-mud community. Biomass and isotopic composition (13 C and 15 N) of all species were measured during four seasons. IFI were calculated in the <b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> defined by the two communities, and variations were analysed: (i) isotopic functional richness indices measure the overall extent of the community trophic niche. They are higher in the Haploops community due to a higher diversity in food sources but also to longer food chains. (ii) isotopic functional evenness indices quantify the regularity in species distribution and the density in species packing. They showed that the biomass is concentrated at the edges of the food web in the Haploops community, outside the isotopic range of the main food source. (iii) isotopic functional divergence indices quantify the degree to which species distribution maximizes the divergence. They showed a larger utilization of secondary food sources in the Haploops community. The IFI variations responded according to expectations overall, based on the extensive knowledge of those communities. Results highlighted that IFI weighted with species biomass provide new insights into how the structure of energy accumulation as biomass between species is likely to underpin community structure and the interplay between structural components of richness, diversity and evenness of biomass distribution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} and isotopic characteristics of island arc lavas are usually {{attributed to the}} combined effects of subducted materials and processes occurring in the mantle wedge. Most island arcs have compositions displaced towards continental crust values relative to MORB, none {{more so than the}} Lesser Antilles arc. Not only do lavas from the Lesser Antilles arc contain a high proportion of crustal material but they also display a very large range of {{chemical and}} isotopic compositions. Lavas on Martinique Island cover most of the variability known for the entire arc, and volcanism occurred almost continuously for the last 25 Ma. It is therefore an ideal target to establish the causes of the chemical and isotopic variability and to evaluate whether a secular relationship exists. We measured Pb, Sr, Nd and Hf isotopic ratios on 30 well-dated Martinique samples whose ages range between 25 Ma and the present. Samples were chosen to cover all volcanic phases, from island formation to the most recent eruptions. Our results cover most of the isotopic range defined by the entire arc, from fairly unradiogenic to highly radiogenic values; but more importantly, they define two distinct hyperbolas in <b>isotopic</b> <b>space.</b> One array is defined by old lavas (25 to 7. 1 Ma), and the other by recent lavas (5. 1 Ma to present). The hyperbolas are compatible with simple two-component mixtures but are not reproduced by AFC models. Using these hyperbolas, we can constrain the composition of the mixing end-members. Both depleted sources correspond to depleted mantle contaminated by a radiogenic Sr component, and the two enriched components resemble local sediments with little to no relative fractionation of Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb. We conclude on this basis that sediments were added to the mantle wedge by melting and not dehydration. Our interpretation for Martinique can be extrapolated to the entire Lesser Antilles arc because the isotopic arrays of Martinique and other islands are indistinguishable. More generally, if the same occurs under most other island arcs, the chemical and isotopic characteristics of arc volcanism might be directly linked to the amount and nature of subducted sediments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Food web {{structure}} is of underlying importance to ecological functions and processes. Whilst {{it is understood}} that a range of biotic and abiotic factors affect structure, relatively little is known {{of the role of}} biodiversity per se in structuring food webs. In this thesis I utilise novel multi-dimensional estimates of food web structure based on stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ 15 N) and carbon (δ 13 C) to quantify structural responses to changing community diversity. I additionally investigate methodological aspects of sample preparation and stable isotope quantifications of food chains. Using an arthropod prey-predator system, in chapter 2 I demonstrate that tissue selection and lipid extraction are important methodological procedures for deriving accurate δ 15 N and δ 13 C signatures. In chapter 3 I test the utility of δ 15 N to quantify food chain length, and δ 13 C to trace primary energy sources through to end consumers. Bayesian resampling of variance in sample means for plant and arthropod food chains produces robust isotopic estimates that match known food chain length well despite some error variance, and estimates of δ 13 C-range that trace trophic transfers. Chapter 4 represents a change in system from lab to field as I determine δ 15 N and δ 13 C signatures for plant and invertebrate species within three grassland communities representing a gradient of biodiversity. Quantifications of community bivariate <b>isotopic</b> <b>space</b> using isotopic metrics revealed that greater taxonomic richness increased both diversity of resource space exploited and overlap in resource space. These results therefore suggest that loss of diversity affected structure through altering relative patterns of niche partitioning in resource exploitation amongst community members. In chapter 5, I additionally find evidence that grassland management mediated changes in food web compartmental structure that were associated with differences in generalist invertebrate predator feeding habits. Taken together, these findings develop and demonstrate the utility of isotopic approaches to quantifying food web structure, and provide evidence of important mechanisms by which biodiversity affects food web structure. I conclude that the preservation of natural food web structure and trophic dynamics are further reasons for halting loss of biodiversity. The Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA...|$|E
40|$|Scat is {{frequently}} {{used to study}} animal diets because {{it is easy to}} find and collect, but one concern is that gross fecal analysis (GFA) techniques exaggerate the importance of small-bodied prey to mammalian mesopredator diets. To capitalize on the benefits of scat, we suggest the analysis of scat carbon and nitrogen isotope values (δ 13 C and δ 15 N). This technique offers researchers a non-invasive method to gather short-term dietary information. We conducted three interrelated studies to validate the use of isotopic values from coyote scat: 1) we determined tissue-to-tissue apparent C and N isotope enrichment factors (ε 13 * and ε 15 *) for coyotes from road kill animals (n = 4); 2) we derived diet-to-scat isotope discrimination factors for coyotes; and 3) we used field collected coyote scats (n = 12) to compare estimates of coyote dietary proportions from stable isotope mixing models with estimates from two GFA techniques. Scat consistently had the lowest δ 13 C and δ 15 N values among the tissues sampled. We derived a diet-to-scat Δ 13 C value of - 1. 5 ‰ ± 1. 6 ‰ and Δ 15 N value of 2. 3 ‰ ± 1. 3 ‰ for coyotes. Coyote scat δ 13 C and δ 15 N values adjusted for discrimination consistently plot within the <b>isotopic</b> mixing <b>space</b> created by known dietary items. In comparison with GFA results, we found that mixing model estimates of coyote dietary proportions de-emphasize the importance of small-bodied prey. Coyote scat δ 13 C and δ 15 N values therefore offer a relatively quick and non-invasive way to gain accurate dietary information...|$|R

Throughout geologic time the oxygen mass budget was likely conserved within these Earth system reservoirs, but hydrogen’s was not, as it can escape to <b>space.</b> <b>Isotopic</b> properties of serpentine from the approximately 3. 8  Ga Isua Supracrustal Belt in West Greenland are used to characterize hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of ancient seawater. Archaean oceans were depleted in deuterium [expressed as δD relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water (VSMOW) ] by at most 25  ±  5 ‰, but oxygen isotope ratios were comparable to modern oceans. Mass balance of the global hydrogen budget constrains the contribution of continental growth and planetary hydrogen loss to the secular evolution of hydrogen isotope ratios in Earth’s oceans.
