5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing <b>how</b> <b>men</b> and women {{differ in their}} consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E
5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching <b>how</b> <b>men</b> move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire. The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details <b>how</b> <b>men</b> feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E

Most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into sub-clades. Some known sub-clades were founded in the last 1000 years, meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era (c.1500 onwards).|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Darragh McManus of The Guardian {{states that}} grunge {{was not simply}} a young person's trend or a musical fad; she states that grunge {{synthesized}} the key philosophies of the modern era, from [...] "Feminism, liberalism, irony, apathy, cynicism/idealism..., anti-authoritarianism, [...] wry post-modernism". McManus states that grunge dealt with serious, [...] "weighty" [...] topics, which does not occur often in popular music. McManus stated that for Generation X, grunge was not just music, it was a key cultural influence. Marlen Komar states that Nirvana's success popularized [...] "non-heterosexist", non-binary ways of thinking about [...] "gender and sexuality", emphasized <b>how</b> <b>men</b> and women were alike and promoted progressive political thinking.|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} loyalty and trust {{is related to}} the novel's other major theme of gender. Ai has {{considerable}} difficulty in completing his mission because of his prejudice against the ambisexual Gethenians and his inability to establish a personal bond with them. Ai's preconceived ideas of <b>how</b> <b>men</b> should behave prevents him from trusting Estraven when the two meet; Ai labels Estraven [...] "womanly" [...] and distrusts him because Estraven exhibits both male and female characteristics. Estraven also faces difficulties communicating with Ai, who does not understand shifgrethor, the Gethenians' indirect way of giving and receiving advice. A related theme that runs through Le Guin's work is that of being rooted or rootless in society, explored through the experiences of lone individuals on alien planets.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, {{while helping}} his father with a side-job, Hendrix found a ukulele amongst the garbage {{that they were}} {{removing}} from an older woman's home. She {{told him that he}} could keep the instrument, which had only one string. Learning by ear, he played single notes, following along to Elvis Presley songs, particularly Presley's cover of Leiber and Stoller's [...] "Hound Dog". By the age of thirty-three, Hendrix's mother Lucille had developed cirrhosis of the liver, and on February 2, 1958, she died when her spleen ruptured. Al refused to take James and Leon to attend their mother's funeral; he instead gave them shots of whiskey and instructed them that was <b>how</b> <b>men</b> were supposed to deal with loss. In 1958, Hendrix completed his studies at Washington Junior High School and began attending, but did not graduate from, Garfield High School.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} three pick up beats as André 3000 counts [...] "one, two, three, oh" [...] and then leads {{into the first}} verse. The lyrics begin to {{describe}} the protagonist's concerns and doubts about a romantic relationship. He wonders if they are staying together just [...] "for tradition", as in the lines [...] "But does she really wanna [...] / But can't stand to see me / Walk out the door?" [...] André 3000 commented, [...] "I think it's more important to be happy than to meet up to...the world's expectations of what a relationship should be. So this is a celebration of <b>how</b> <b>men</b> and women {{relate to each other}} in the 2000s". The song then leads into the chorus, which consists of the line [...] "Hey ya!"

500|$|Alex {{has been}} {{depicted}} {{as someone who}} is not afraid of expressing her sexuality, and as a flawed human being who takes charge of her own life. Chopra told Cosmopolitan: [...] "It's empowering in that way, which doesn't say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be. It's extremely individual to each one of us. As for Alex, she happens to not care." [...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to <b>how</b> <b>men</b> usually treat women. She does not treat men as if they are {{the most important thing in}} her life because she is more focused on her work, with men just happen to come and go in her life. Chopra explained [...] "I think that's extremely empowering on her end. It may not be something I personally agree with or something I do, but I think different people have different individual choices that they make." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Aaliyah {{explored}} {{the intricacies of}} romantic love and phases in a relationship such as heartache, frivolous infatuation, and issues {{near the end of}} a relationship. Subtle, lighthearted humor and witty sound effects such as comical vocal manipulation interspersed the themes of heartbreak and eroticism. According to Citysearch's Justin Hartung, the record [...] "transforms the confusion of young adulthood into exhilarating freedom". Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In observed female empowerment-themed songs that showed a [...] "healthy self-respect" [...] by Aaliyah, who [...] "doesn't put up with unfaithful cads ('You Got Nerve'), mind games ('I Refuse'), self-impressed hunks ('Extra Smooth'), gossip and envy ('Loose Rap'), or physical abuse ('Never No More')". The key-shifting, drum and bass-influenced [...] "Extra Smooth" [...] addressed an enthusiastic courtship and was inspired by a conversation between Aaliyah and Static about <b>how</b> <b>men</b> try to act suave, while [...] "Loose Rap" [...] was titled after the slang phrase of the same name and dismissed romantic admirers who use trite pick-up lines. [...] "Those Were the Days" [...] dispassionately dismissed a male lover, while [...] "What If" [...] angrily threatened an unfaithful lover and by extension similar men. On [...] "I Care 4 U", the narrator tried to console a friend who is heartbroken, but found herself distressed by unrequited feelings she has for him.|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome to the Occupation" [...] {{is about}} a teacher limited with his career who strives to be an artist. Willett was {{inspired}} by his job as an English high school teacher in Torrance to write the song, saying that it didn't give him [...] "a lot of creative space to really be very inspired to be a teacher." [...] "Golden Gate Jumpers" [...] {{is about a}} woman who goes to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplates taking her life away. The tracks [...] "Avalanche in B" [...] and [...] "I've Seen Enough" [...] were originally conceived by the band as one-long track but instead cut into two songs. The former uses snow as a metaphor for how bleak and empty life is when it is coming straight towards you. The latter was created during a jam session in which the band played one continuous chord progression that stuck with them throughout the session. [...] "Every Man I Fall For" [...] is about a woman's perspective on relationships. Inspired by his own mother's relationship with men, Willett saw something he could craft from that emotion, saying that it stuck with him as having importance [...] "because it was something I always saw in relationships; like my mom being a single mother and seeing <b>how</b> <b>men</b> treat these women and how they operate in relationships." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just <b>how</b> <b>men</b> perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{writings}} of various travellers in the Holy Land, {{especially in the}} 18th and 19th centuries, tell of how the Wall and its environs {{continued to be a}} place of devotion for the Jews. Isaac Yahuda, a prominent member of the Sephardic community in Jerusalem recalled <b>how</b> <b>men</b> and women used to gather in a circle at the Wall to hear sermons delivered in Ladino. His great-grandmother, who arrived in Palestine in 1841, [...] "used to go to the Western Wall every Friday afternoon, winter and summer, and stay there until candle-lighting time, reading the entire Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs...she would sit there by herself for hours." [...] In the past women could be found sitting {{at the entrance to the}} Wall every Sabbath holding fragrant herbs and spices in order to enable worshipers to make additional blessings. In the hot weather they would provide cool water. The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall. Throughout the ages, the Wall is where Jews have gathered to express gratitude to God or to pray for divine mercy. On news of the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 thousands of Jews went to the Wall to offer prayers for the [...] "success of His Majesty’s and Allied Forces in the liberation of all enemy-occupied territory." [...] On October 13, 1994, 50,000 gathered to pray for the safe return of kidnapped soldier Nachshon Wachsman. August 10, 2005 saw a massive prayer rally at the Wall. Estimates of people protesting Israel's unilateral disengagement plan ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 people. Every year on Tisha B'Av large crowds congregate at the Wall to commemorate the destruction of the Temple. In 2007 over 100,000 gathered. During the month of Tishrei 2009, a record 1.5 million people visited the site.|$|E
