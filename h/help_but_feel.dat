500|$|Before the film's release, reporters {{speculated that}} it would have a {{difficult}} run due to competition from DreamWorks' Shrek (a wholly CGI feature) and [...] (an action-adventure film from Paramount Pictures). Regarding the market's shift from traditional animation and competition with CGI films, Kirk Wise said, [...] "Any traditional animator, including myself, can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> a twinge.

[...] He felt that a viewer couldn't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> déjà vu, but that the work shows greater [...] "dimension". Dana Stevens at Slate magazine believed that the film was an [...] "absolutely unnecessary" [...] retelling of the origin story, although it avoided [...] "the common comic-book adaptation trap of gloomy self-seriousness".

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Together When..." [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Bradley Stern, head writer from MuuMuse, awarded the song {{a maximum of}} ten points and labelled {{it one of the}} best tracks on Guilty. He commented, [...] "Finally, a ballad with feeling!... Call me sadistic, but the best moments in an Ayumi song are the parts where it sounds like she’s about to break ("Memorial Address"). This song is full of those moments." [...] In a similar review, a staff member at Channel-Ai awarded it five stars out of five, and believed that the song is one [...] "of her strongest ballads". The reviewer further explained, [...] "The emotion within the ballad is so infectious that the audience cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> empathy towards Ayumi."

500|$|Not all reviews were positive.

[...] He noted that the main plot had funny moments but [...] "there wasn't much else to invest in." [...] Overall, Canning reasoned that this episode {{was very much a}} stand-alone one [...] "built for some good jokes, and not exactly focused on storytelling. [...] An episode like 'Verna' can still bring a lot of laughs, but you can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> like it's missing that extra something." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked both stories from [...] "Verna", and wrote that it was a disappointing episode, and that it was [...] "pretty weak overall." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, reported that despite Hooks' hilarious performance, the episode still felt a [...] "little bit like filler", and that there [...] "wasn't too much that was especially funny or memorable about it".|$|E
5000|$|The online review site Premium Hollywood {{described}} the episode in 2009 as [...] "part sci-fi and part morality play" [...] when [...] "Land of the Lost really {{begins to take}} off", noting that the episode is written by [...] "no less than" [...] Walter Koenig.

Premium Hollywood went on to describe the episode as notably deeper, more complex, and more philosophical than those previous, with [...] "hefty ideas on display."

500|$|The album {{received}} {{some of its}} most negative reviews from the British and Irish press. A review for NME was critical of the album's personal lyrics, and claimed that Manson had emasculated himself by opening up. In a one-star review, The Guardian called the album unconvincing, and criticized it for a lack of experimentation; whilst Entertainment.ie writer Lauren Murphy chastised several songs for sounding too experimental and [...] "completely misplaced", summarizing: [...] "If he'd stuck to what he was good at – ear-piercing yelps, liberal dashes of real controversy and big, brawny metal songs with tough beats – he may have [...] a 'comeback' on his hands." [...] Conversely, Mayer Nissim from Digital Spy commended the album for its diversity, but was critical of its length and [...] "ill-advised attempts at stadium anthems."

[...] "For the more esoteric viewer, it's a milestone episode", said The Ages Farah Farouque. Cameron Adams for the Herald Sun called the episode hilarious, while The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert {{felt that it was}} flaccid and cliched. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that the episode [...] "did have its moments" [...] and that the storylines [...] "had their potential, and their share of laughs, but I can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> they both could have been so much more."

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, enjoyed the episode, commenting: [...] "A case perhaps of life {{reflecting}} art as guest star Helen Hunt is now married to Hank Azaria, who is, of course, Moe, which is rather nice as you can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> sad that, {{by the end of}} this rather clever and charming episode, Moe has been unlucky in love once more."
