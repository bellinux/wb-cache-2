5|$|The {{wildebeest}} {{benefit the}} ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. They are economically important for <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> {{they are a}} major tourist attraction. They also provide important products like leather to humans. The wildebeest, however, can also {{have a negative impact}} on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|In 2029, {{aboard the}} United States Air Force space station Oberon, Leo Davidson {{works closely with}} {{primates}} who are trained for space missions. His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the Oberon and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers {{that the world is}} ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use domesticated horses for transportation, and treat <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> slaves.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

5000|$|Adriana Cavarero’s Inclinations critiques the {{characterization}} of the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>as</b> upright, erect—in philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropological writings, literature and artworks. Her aim is to illuminate [...] "the effects of this figuration, the 'truths' and 'power-relations' that these discursive or artistic figurations produce and install…to tally the costs of depicting the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>as</b> upright {{when it comes to}} our view of women, our overall understanding and collective self-conception." [...] The figuration of the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>as</b> 'upright,' Cavarero suggests, obscures a more natural figuration: Inclination. In this book, she hones a [...] "rhetoric of inclination," [...] in order to superimpose it [...] "like a transparent screen, over the rhetoric of the philosophical subject, to highlight {{the differences between the two}} ontological, ethical, and political models." ...|$|R

They represent about 10% of all species of Hemiptera associated with water and belong to two series of the suborder Heteroptera: the Nepomorpha, which include four superfamilies whose members {{spend most of their}} time under water, and the Naucoridae, which include a single family, the Naucoridae, whose members are commonly termed creeping water bugs.|$|E

25|$|Another basic {{drive is}} the sexual drive which like food motivates us {{because it is}} {{essential}} to our survival. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone. Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than woman to think about sex.|$|E
25|$|As a Buddhist emperor, Ashoka {{believed}} that Buddhism is beneficial for all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> well as animals and plants, so {{he built a}} number of stupas, Sangharama, viharas, chaitya, and residences for Buddhist monks all over South Asia and Central Asia. According to the Ashokavadana, he ordered the construction of 84,000 stupas to house the Buddha's relics. In the Aryamanjusrimulakalpa, Ashoka takes offerings {{to each of these}} stupas traveling in a chariot adorned with precious metals. He gave donations to viharas and mathas. He sent his only daughter Sanghamitra and son Mahindra to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then known as Tamraparni).|$|E
25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{affirms that}} human beings exist in a world around them and that through {{background}} a priori (before experience) foreknowledge, they constantly seek to understand themselves and that world, including other humans and inanimate objects. Heidegger termed <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> Dasein, the German word for being-there. In other words, an individual is termed Dasein {{because he or she}} exists there, being there at some place in the present. Put in more simple terms, an individual is Dasein because he or she literally exists. Heidegger, along with Dilthey, was concerned about understanding human nature, what it means to exist, to be.|$|E

25|$|An unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, {{formerly}} {{classified as}} T. nutricula, might be effectively immortal {{because of its}} ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory. At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded {{that there are three}} species of jellyfish that are immortal, and says their immortality may hold the key to immortality for <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> <b>as</b> he says that genetically they are not that much different from humans.|$|E
25|$|Although wolf attacks do occur, their {{frequency}} {{varies with}} geographical location and historical period. Gray wolf attacks are rare because wolves are often subsequently killed, or even extirpated in reaction by <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> <b>As</b> a result, wolves today tend to live mostly far from people or {{have developed the}} tendency and ability to avoid them. The country with the most extensive historical records is France, where nearly 7,600 fatal attacks were documented from 1200–1920. In modern times, they occur most often in India and neighboring countries. There are few historical records or modern cases of wolf attacks in North America. In the half-century up to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, three in North America, and more than 200 in south Asia. Experts categorize wolf attacks into various types, including rabies-infected, predatory, agonistic, and defensive.|$|E
25|$|Two psychiatrists testified upon {{behalf of}} the defence. The first of these, Dr. James MacKeith, began his {{testimony}} on 26 October. MacKeith testified as to how, through a lack of emotional development, Nilsen experienced difficulty expressing any emotion other than anger, and his tendency to treat other <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>as</b> components of his fantasies. The psychiatrist also described Nilsen's association between unconscious bodies and sexual arousal; stating that Nilsen possessed narcissistic traits, an impaired sense of identity, {{and was able to}} depersonalise other individuals. He stated his conclusions that Nilsen displayed many signs of maladaptive behaviour, the combination of which, in one man, was lethal. These factors could be attributed to an unspecified personality disorder from which MacKeith believed Nilsen suffered. In response to prosecution contention that, in attributing Nilsen to an unspecified disorder, MacKeith was therefore undecided in his conclusions, MacKeith contended that this unspecified personality disorder was severe enough to substantially reduce Nilsen's responsibility.|$|E
