5000|$|By the 1960s, large {{portions}} of the park, such as Tibbetts Brook, were being polluted by human activity; in addition, the brook now flowed into the Broadway sewer {{at the south end}} of Van Cortlandt Lake. Pollution from upstream and the highways, and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course, led to the death of fish inhabiting the lake. This problem was first noticed in May 1961 when [...] "thousands" [...] of dead bass, pickerel, catfish, perch, and carp started floating up at the edge of the lake. The mass-death of fish was blamed on siltation, and three years later, <b>fish</b> <b>deaths</b> caused by siltation was still a problem in the lake. City investigators, examining water samples from the lake, found that it contained large amounts of weeds and sediment, with about 22000 ft2 m2 of the lake's surface area being lost to sedimentation every year. In addition, a significant algal bloom that caused the lake to be in a low-oxygen condition, endangering plants and animals in the lake's vicinity. [...] "Unpleasant odors" [...] in the summer also reduced recreational opportunities on the lake, and these conditions combined made it virtually impossible to come into contact with the lake's water without getting sick. By 1976, there was a moratorium on all boating activities on the lake.|$|E
40|$|Possible {{causes of}} deaths of Oreochromis niloticus in Lake Chivero were {{examined}} in relation to changes in limnological conditions monitored over a 25 -month period. The <b>fish</b> <b>deaths</b> coincided {{with the collapse of}} an algal bloom that had developed and builtup in the lake for 8 months.

Dissolved oxygen decreased when the bloom started to die off and coincided with the <b>fish</b> <b>deaths</b> when the average surface dissolved oxygen concentration in the lake was 3. 9 mg l(- 1) and was at a depth of 5 m < 2 mg l(- 1).

50|$|A {{eutrophic}} body of water, commonly a lake or pond, {{has high}} biological productivity. Due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, these water bodies {{are able to}} support an abundance of aquatic plants. Usually, the water body will be dominated either by aquatic plants or algae. When aquatic plants dominate, the water tends to be clear. When algae dominate, the water tends to be darker. The algae engage in photosynthesis which supplies oxygen to the fish and biota which inhabit these waters. Occasionally, an excessive algal bloom will occur and can ultimately result in <b>fish</b> <b>death,</b> due to respiration by algae and bottom-living bacteria. The process of eutrophication can occur naturally and by human impact on the environment.|$|R

30|$|The {{eutrophication}} {{of aquatic}} ecosystems {{is a major}} environmental issue threatening water security and biodiversity. In recent years, lake eutrophication has intensified globally due to human activities such as aquaculture, agricultural fertilization, sewage discharge and tourism. Eutrophication causes algal blooms, hypoxia, acidification and <b>fish</b> <b>deaths,</b> raised water purification costs, and results {{in the loss of}} economic benefits associated with clean water [1]. Phosphorus is an important nutrient that restricts microbial production in freshwater and marine environments [2, 3]. A steady increase in phosphorus loading in a lake is usually the most important cause of eutrophication, causing rapid increase in algal productivity when the biological productivity of the lake is low or intermediate [4].|$|E
