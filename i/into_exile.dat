5|$|Along {{with the}} prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, {{who later became}} Queen Musa of Parthia. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa {{convinced}} Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his Res Gestae Divi Augusti. When Phraataces took the throne as Phraates V (r. c.2BC – 4AD), Musa married her own son and ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of both the incestuous relationship {{and the notion of}} a king with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair <b>into</b> <b>exile</b> in Roman territory. Phraates' successor Orodes III of Parthia lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by Vonones I, who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, Artabanus III of Parthia (r. c.10–38AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him <b>into</b> <b>exile</b> in Roman Syria.|$|E

Within months, Constantine died in Italy. One of Olga's sons, Prince Andrew, was among those arrested by the new regime. Many defendants in the treason trials that followed the coup were shot, including senior politicians and generals. Foreign diplomats assumed that Andrew was also in mortal danger, and George V of the United Kingdom, Alfonso XIII of Spain, the French president Raymond Poincaré and Pope Pius XI sent representatives to Athens to intercede on his behalf.
