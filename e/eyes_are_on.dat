5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the soft}} tick, family Argasidae, is pear-shaped or oval with a rounded {{anterior}} portion. The mouthparts cannot be seen from above as {{they are on the}} ventral surface. The cuticle is leathery; there is often a centrally positioned dorsal plate, with ridges which project slightly above the surrounding surface, but there is no decoration. A pattern of small, circular depressed areas show where muscles are attached to the interior of the integument. The <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the sides of the body, the spiracles open between legs 3 and 4, and males and females only differ {{in the structure of the}} genital pore.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the unusual}} nature and {{positions}} of {{the eyes of the}} Araneae (spiders), and their importance in taxonomy, evolution and anatomy, special terminology with associated abbreviations has become established in arachnology. Araneae normally have eight eyes in four pairs. All the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the carapace of the prosoma, and their sizes, shapes and locations are characteristic of various spider families and other taxa. In some taxa not all four pairs of eyes are present, the relevant species having only three, two, or one pair of eyes. Some species (mainly troglobites) have no functional eyes at all.|$|E

25|$|The {{flattened}} {{bodies of}} stingrays {{allow them to}} effectively conceal themselves in their environments. Stingrays do this by agitating the sand and hiding beneath it. Because their <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey; instead, they use smell and electroreceptors (ampullae of Lorenzini) {{similar to those of}} sharks. Stingrays feed primarily on molluscs, crustaceans, and occasionally on small fish. Some stingrays' mouths contain two powerful, shell-crushing plates, while other species only have sucking mouthparts. Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tails visible. Coral reefs are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide.|$|E

[...] Jenna Gregory of Marie Claire wrote that Beyoncé shows an [...] "amazing bod in parely-there clothes which you definitely wouldn't find in the maternity section." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound found a 1980s vibe similar to the song's sound, adding {{that the only thing}} the [...] "family affair is missing is Jay-Z wearing sunscreen on his nose and a shirt from Tommy Bahama." [...] Ted Maider of the same publication, noted that Beyoncé [...] "adds some luster to the rusty surroundings, shining through as the beautiful pop icon that she has become. It just goes to show it doesn't matter where Beyonce is, or where her music is playing, she can turn any spot into a rager." [...] A writer of OK! said that Beyoncé [...] "don an unbelievable amount of cool oufits, all of which we need in our lives." [...] Rap-Up commented [...] "Summer may be over, but Beyoncé gives us another reason to celebrate with the vibrant video" [...] adding [...] "This is one party you won't want to miss." [...] Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine described [...] "Party"'s video as a [...] "fittingly shindig-centric affair." [...] Jessica Misener of The Huffington Post praised the fashion used in the video saying that Beyoncé had a lot of [...] "chic looks". Another writer of the same publication praised the decision to make a simple party set. He further described the video as [...] "a gorgeous boast of her beauty as well as a helpful reminder that, even in these down economic times, one can party like a rock star." [...] At the 2012 BET Awards, Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson won in the category for Video Director of the Year after they collaborated on the music video for [...] "Party".|$|E
2500|$|The head bears {{a pair of}} dorsal {{compound}} {{eyes that}} lie {{close to each other}} and are nearly fused together. The compound eyes are generally sessile (not stalked). In addition, there is a naupliar ocellus (the [...] "third eye") between them. The compound <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the surface of the head, but the ocellus is deep within the head. All the eyes, however, are easily visible through the shell covering of the head. A distinct horizontal groove, known as the mandibular groove, marks the division between the anterior three head segments and the posterior two. Posterior to it is the cervical groove, marking the division between the head and the thorax.|$|E

2500|$|Flatfish are {{an order}} of ray-finned benthic fishes which lie flat on the ocean floor. Examples are flounder, sole, turbot, plaice, and halibut. The adult fish of many species have both eyes {{on one side of}} the head. When the fish hatches, one eye is located on each side of its head. But as the fish grows from the larval stage, one eye migrates to the other side of the body as a process of metamorphosis. [...] The {{flatfish}} then changes its habits, and camouflages itself by lying on the bottom of the ocean floor with both eyes facing upwards. The side to which one eye migrates depends on the species; with some species both eyes are ultimately on the left side, whereas with other species the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the right.|$|E
2500|$|The jumping spiders, {{unlike the}} other families, have faces that are roughly {{rectangular}} surfaces perpendicular to their direction of motion. In effect this means that their forward-looking, anterior <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> [...] "flat faces", {{as shown in the}} photographs. Their eye pattern is the clearest single identifying characteristic. They have eight eyes, as illustrated. Most diagnostic are the front row of four eyes, in which the anterior median pair are more dramatically prominent than any other spider eyes apart from the posterior median eyes of the Deinopidae. There is, however, a radical functional difference between the major (AME) eyes of Salticidae and the major (PME) eyes of the Deinopidae; the large posterior eyes of Deinopidae are adapted mainly to vision in dim light, whereas the large anterior eyes of Salticidae are adapted to detailed, three-dimensional vision for purposes of estimating the range, direction, and nature of potential prey, permitting the spider to direct its attacking leaps with great precision. The anterior lateral eyes, though large, are smaller than the AME and provide a wider forward field of vision.|$|E
