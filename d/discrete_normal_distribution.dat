40|$|An {{algorithm}} for sampling exactly {{from the}} normal distribution is given. The algorithm reads some number of uniformly distributed random digits in a given base and generates an initial portion of the representation of a normal deviate in the same base. Thereafter, uniform random digits are copied directly into {{the representation of the}} normal deviate. Thus, in contrast to existing methods, it is possible to generate normal deviates exactly rounded to any precision with a mean cost that scales linearly in the precision. The method performs no extended precision arithmetic, calls no transcendental functions, and, indeed, uses no floating point arithmetic whatsoever; it uses only simple integer operations. It can easily be adapted to sample exactly from the <b>discrete</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> whose parameters are rational numbers. Comment: LaTeX, 8 pages, 1 figure.

Modern lattice-based public-key cryptosystems require {{sampling}} from <b>discrete</b> Gaussian (<b>normal)</b> <b>distributions.</b> The paper surveys algorithms {{to implement}} such sampling efficiently, with particular {{focus on the}} case of constrained devices with small on-board storage and without access to large numbers of external random bits. We review lattice-based encryption schemes and signature schemes and their requirements for sampling from discrete Gaussians.

DILN is a generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that models correlation structure between the weights of the atoms {{at the group}} level.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely known {{that the stock market}} is always {{volatile}} and full of risk. How to better capture the volatility and decrease risk accordingly has become a main concern for both investors and researchers. In this thesis, the stochastic volatility model with offset mixture of <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> is fitted for financial dataset NASDAQ:LLTC daily stock market returns volatility and one-step-ahead prediction is made based on the AR(1) SV model. Bayesian analysis is fully applied for model fitting and parameter estimation. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using the Metropolis Hasting method, the Forward Filtering Backward Sampling and the Gibbs Sampler is well developed to fit the real data. A small improvement incorporated is the resampling of weights in the <b>discrete</b> <b>normal</b> mixture <b>distribution</b> which is used to approximate a non-normal distribution. Estimated parameters when having weights sampled are compared with the results when weights are fixed. The predictive distribution for one-step-ahead log volatility zT+ 1 and log transformed stock return yT+ 1 is given in the graphs. Mean and 95 % posterior interval are also provided for both zT+ 1 and yT + 1. FFBS algorithm is first applied to a simulated dataset with normal mixture structure in Dynamic Linear Models. Visual plots with posterior mean and 95 % posterior interval are given. Autoregressive model with application of Monte Carlo approximation is also included to model LLTC stock returns. ...|$|R

40|$|Classical {{discrete}} distributions rarely support modelling {{data on the}} set {{of whole}} integers. In this paper, we shall introduce a flexible discrete distribution on this set, which can, in addition, cover bimodal as well as unimodal data sets. The proposed distribution can also be fitted to positive and negative skewed data. The distribution is indeed a discrete counterpart of the continuous alpha-skew-Laplace distribution recently introduced in the literature. The proposed distribution can also be viewed as a weighted version of the discrete Laplace distribution. Several distributional properties of this class such as cumulative distribution function, moment generating function, moments, modality, infinite divisibility and its truncation are studied. A simulation study is also performed. Finally, a real data set is used to show applicability of the new model comparing to several rival models, such as the <b>discrete</b> <b>normal</b> and Skellam <b>distributions.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

There is a critical value of T which separates the subcritical case, in which it is vanishingly unlikely that the particles wrap around the circle, and the supercritical case, in which particles may wrap around the circle. In this paper we show that in the subcritical and critical cases the probability that the total winding number is zero is almost surely 1 as n → ∞, and in the supercritical case that the distribution of the total winding number converges to the <b>discrete</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution.</b> We also give a streamlined approach to identifying the Pearcey and tacnode processes in scaling limits. The formula of the tacnode correlation kernel is new and involves a solution to a Lax system for the Painleve ́ II equation of size 2 × 2.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} Value at Risk measures constructed under a <b>discrete</b> {{mixture of}} <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> on the innovations with time-varying volatility, or MN-GARCH, model. We adopt an approach {{based on the}} continuous empirical characteristic function to estimate the param eters of the model using several daily foreign exchange rates' return data. This approach has several advantages as a method for estimating the MN-GARCH model. In particular, under certain weighting measures, a closed form objective distance function for estimation is obtained. This reduces the computational burden considerably. In addition, the characteristic function, unlike its likelihood function counterpart, is always uniformly bounded over parameter space due to the Fourier transformation. To evaluate the VaR estimates obtained from alternative specifications, we construct several measures, such {{as the number of}} violations, the average size of violations, the sum square of violations and the expected size of violations. Based on these measures, we find that the VaR measures obtained from the MN-GARCH model outperform those obtained from other competing models.

40|$|This paper studies {{determinants}} of household stock marker participation and proportion of risky assets in household financial wealth using recent data from Australia. The methodological novelty {{of the paper}} consists in addressing in a systematic fashion the two prominent features of the data: fractional nature of the proportion of financial wealth invested in stocks and prevalence of zeros which {{stems from the fact}} that many households do not participate in the stock market. The dependent variable in this case is a mixture of discrete and continuous outcomes, with continuous outcome bounded between zero and one. To study participation and share decisions jointly the paper proposes a two-part model which combines a probit model for participation decision and a linear regression model for the logistic transformation of the fraction of financial wealth invested in stocks. To accommodate possible deviations from normality in the share of risky assets conditional on participation, the transformed share is modelled as having a <b>discrete</b> mixture of <b>normals</b> <b>distribution.</b> The paper then compares posterior distributions of marginal effects of the covariates on participation and share decisions across competing models which include tobit, two-part normal model for untransformed share, two-part normal model fo...|$|R
40|$|If E is an {{elliptic}} curve with {{a point of}} order two, then work of Klagsbrun and Lemke Oliver shows that the distribution of _F_ 2 Sel_ϕ(E^d/Q) - _F_ 2 Sel_ϕ̂(E^' d/Q) within the quadratic twist family tends to the <b>discrete</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> N(0, 1 / 2 X) as X →∞. We consider the distribution of dim_F_ 2 Sel_ϕ(E^d/Q) within such a quadratic twist family when _F_ 2 Sel_ϕ(E^d/Q) - _F_ 2 Sel_ϕ̂(E^' d/Q) has a fixed value u. Specifically, we show that for every r, the limiting probability that _F_ 2 Sel_ϕ(E^d/Q) = r is given by an explicit constant α_r,u. The constants α_r,u {{are closely related to}} the u-probabilities introduced in Cohen and Lenstra's work on the distribution of class groups, and thus provide a connection between the distribution of Selmer groups of {{elliptic curve}}s and random abelian groups. Our analysis of this problem has two steps. The first step uses algebraic and combinatorial methods to directly relate the ranks of the Selmer groups in question to the dimensions of the kernels of random F_ 2 -matrices. This proves that the density of twists with a given ϕ-Selmer rank r is given by α_r,u for an unusual notion of density. The second step of the analysis utilizes techniques from analytic number theory to show that this result implies the correct asymptotics in terms of the natural notion of density.
