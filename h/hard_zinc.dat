40|$|In this study, {{changes in}} {{physicochemical}} properties and leachability of indium from mechanically activated <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue by planetary mill were investigated. The {{results showed that}} mechanical activation increased specific surface area, reaction activity of <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue, and decreased its particle size, which had {{a positive effect on}} indium extraction from <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue in hydrochloric acid solution. Kinetics of indium leaching from unmilled and activated <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue were also investigated, respectively. It was found that temperature had an obvious effect on indium leaching rate. Two different kinetic models corresponding to reactions which are diffusion controlled, [1 -(1 - x) 1 / 3] 2 =kt and (1 - 2 x/ 3) -(1 -x) 2 / 3 =kt were used to describe the kinetics of indium leaching from unmilled sample and activated sample, respectively. Their activation energies were determined to be 17. 89 kJ/mol (umilled) and 11. 65 kJ/mol (activated) within the temperature range of 30 °C to 90 °C, which is characteristic for a diffusion controlled process. The values of activation energy demonstrated that the leaching reaction of indium became less sensitive to temperature after <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue mechanically activated by planetary mill...|$|E
40|$|The given {{paper is}} closely {{connected}} {{with the process of}} the manufacturing of ZnO. The purity of the metal zinc has crucial influence on the quality of ZnO. ZnO can be produced by pyrometallurgical combustion of zinc and <b>hard</b> <b>zinc.</b> But this mentioned method of preparation leads {{to the creation of the}} enormous amount of waste including chemical complexes. On the basis of the occurrence of the residual content of other elements, it is possible to make prediction about the material behavior in the metallographic process. The input and finally materials were investi-gated and this investigation was done from the aspect of structural and chemical composition of the materials.

40|$|Nanoparticles have {{generated}} {{interest in the}} oil industry as potential additives. Many nanoparticles have been shown to improve fuel economy and engine efficiency. However, there are an infinite number of nanoparticle formulations, and to test all these would be impossible. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model which demonstrates the impact of factors such as size, concentration, and hardness on the performance of nanoparticles as oil additives. The concentrations tested were 0. 01 % and 0. 5 % by mass in PAO 4 base oil. The sizes tested were 5 - 15 nm and 20 - 50 nm. Using four compositions to approximate hardness, a 4 x 2 x 2 DOE matrix generated a predictive model of nanoparticle performance. Nanoparticles can reduce friction and physical wear, in turn improving fuel economy. A high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) was used to obtain friction coefficients and wear scar area, and a mini-traction machine with space layer imaging method (MTMSLIM) was used to observe tribofilm growth. Large, concentrated, and hard nanoparticles demonstrated the best performance as friction modifiers and wear reducers. The <b>hardest,</b> <b>zinc</b> oxide, showed the greatest friction reduction at 74 % below base oil and also exhibited 79 % reduction of wear scar area below base oil as compared to, respectively, 62 % and 35 % for the current industry standard. This project examines a limited set of concentrations and compositions, including alloys, and studies of these trends could better indicate mechanisms. Future study of zinc oxide and elements of comparable hardness are recommended and could provide a class of promising nanoparticle additives. [URL]...|$|R
30|$|NP {{composition}} and its surface chemistry are crucial factors {{in determining the}} affinities and identities of proteins that bind to NPs. Deng and co-workers have studied the binding of human plasma proteins to commercially available metal oxide NPs such as titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, and zinc oxide with the same surface charge [54]. The authors revealed that similar proteins adsorb to titanium and silicon dioxide NPs, whereas significantly different proteins composed the <b>hard</b> corona of <b>zinc</b> oxide NPs. In particular, clusterin, apolipoprotein D, and alpha- 2 -acid glycoprotein were detected in the corona of titanium and silicon dioxide NPs while those were not observed in the corona of zinc oxide. Interestingly, some other proteins like transferrin, Ig heavy chain alpha, and haptoglobin (alpha) only {{were found in the}} corona of zinc oxide NPs alone.|$|R
