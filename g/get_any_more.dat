5|$|Four matches {{followed}} the MCC fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool was rested {{for the first}} of these against Lancashire at Manchester, a rain-affected draw that was Australia's first non-victory of the season. He returned for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was drawn, but had little success, taking a total of 0/68. He failed to maximise his promotion to No. 4, making only 17 as Australia scored 400 in their only innings. McCool did not <b>get</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> opportunities to push for selection, as he was rested from the next two matches against Hampshire and Sussex. Australia won the former by eight wickets after conceding a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} the tour, before winning the second by an innings by 325 runs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} inning, the Yankees faced a new pitcher, this time southpaw Bill Hallahan, {{who served as}} both a starter and {{reliever}} for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10–4 and did not <b>get</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10–5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits. With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from National Service in 1962 Dibnah {{retrieved}} his tools from storage, bought a 1927 350cc AJS motorcycle for 21guineas and looked for more work. Bolton, however, {{was in the midst}} of post-industrial decline; between 1957 and 1965 about 70mills were closed in the town, leaving only 37mills operational and about 50disused. Initially he was unable to find much work and existed on smaller, domestic jobs, until he earned enough to buy his own set of ladders and secured his first commission while working at a local mill. He was paid £140 to point a mill tower, which he did at weekends. He struggled, however, to <b>get</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> meaningful work, until he met Lonsdale Bonner, one of his teachers from art college. The two agreed a deal whereby Bonner would be paid a commission for each job he got for Dibnah. His first job was dismantling a chimney alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway, a difficult proposition, as a mistake could force the temporary closure of the railway. The two managed to gain commissions for several jobs, but their relationship was terminated when Dibnah was called upon to undertake another six months of National Service.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{place after}} the No Man's Land story arc, Lonnie Machin decides to finally confront his {{supposed}} biological parents to uncover the truth of his lineage. He first meets with his alleged biological mother, Greta Mitchell, but finds that she is mentally unbalanced, due to {{the side effects of}} Joker venom she was exposed to years earlier. In a flashback, she tells the story of how she became pregnant by the Joker, and that due to her condition she was deemed unfit for parental responsibility and that her child was taken away from her. However, Lonnie is unable to <b>get</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> information from her. As a final recourse, Anarky breaks into Arkham Asylum using his teleporter and confronts his alleged father, now revealed to be the Joker. Meanwhile, the Joker {{is in the midst of}} a prison break with other inmates, and takes advantage of the situation to steal the teleporter, and then forces Anarky to participate. Unarmed, Anarky plays along until he manages to regain the teleporter to escape, without the Joker having given him any clear answers either. Although the story presents no evidence, Anarky asserts that he personally believes the Joker is his father, and fears that someday he may become insane as well.|$|E
25|$|Somerset {{exploited}} Essex' declarations {{to take a}} five-wicket win despite rain dominating at Colchester, Somerset's fourth win of the season. After {{the first}} day was over, Somerset's overseas player Charl Langeveldt dug out Grant Flower on the second morning, but good contributions {{from the rest of}} the batting line-up - William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 - gave Essex a relatively comfortable 220 for 5 by stumps on day two. They powered on to 400 before declaring, losing only one wicket while James Foster made 107 not out. When Somerset were asked to bat, André Nel whipped out two Somerset wickets with the first three balls of the game, but no Essex bowler could <b>get</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> wickets as James Hildreth made 76 not out before the close of day three to set Somerset to 112 for 2. Overnight, the two captains agreed to a mutual forfeiture of innings, so that Essex would not have to bat again. Hence, Somerset would have to chase 289 in a day to win, while Essex would have to bowl them out. André Nel removed Michael Wood for a duck again, but Arul Suppiah added a quick 29, and former England Under-19 player Hildreth settled in well. He made his second unbeaten score of the match, this time worth 125, guiding Somerset past the winning target in 66.1 overs with five wickets to spare. Danish Kaneria bowled 24 of Essex' 66 overs, but to little effect, ending with one wicket for 80 runs, while Nel got William Durston for a duck to end with four wickets for the match - all ducks.|$|E

After the first day was over with only three overs bowled and Alastair Cook dismissed for a duck, Somerset's overseas player Charl Langeveldt dug out Grant Flower on the second morning, but double-digit contributions {{from the rest of}} the batting line-up – William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 – gave Essex a relatively comfortable 220 for 5 by stumps on day two.

500|$|Most {{commentators}} blamed Take-Two's corporate governance; {{one analyst}} {{stated that the}} company's troubles were more [...] "company-specific than market-driven", and another declared company CEO Paul Eibeler to be the [...] "worst CEO of 2005", pointing to [...] "setbacks on the rollouts of newer games" [...] as evidence of his failure. Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and Todd Howard, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of November 6, 2005.

A commentator from Joystiq complained of the vagueness of the updates: [...] "they don't <b>get</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> specific than to say, 'There is work that {{still needs to be}} done'. In fact, they say this three times just to make sure we know how hard they are working....While it's nice to see the development team taking time out to update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather just see them spend the extra time on the actual game." ...|$|E
