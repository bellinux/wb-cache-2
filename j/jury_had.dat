5|$|On November 8, 2010, {{the jury}} {{returned}} with a recommendation that Hayes be executed. The jury recommended a death sentence {{on each of the}} six capital felony counts for which Hayes was convicted. In the sentencing phase, the <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> deliberated for about 17 hours, over the course of three and a half days, before reaching a decision.|$|E
5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice of England, {{dismissed}} the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip that the <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> had {{ample opportunity to}} form its own opinion of him. Amnesty International criticised the decision, pointing to the problems with confessions made {{in the absence of}} a lawyer, and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said Amnesty had abandoned its impartiality.|$|E

5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} {{ended with a}} guilty verdict on July 8, 1912. The defendants, including 27 leading Camorra bosses, were sentenced {{to a total of}} 354 years' imprisonment. The main defendants Enrico Alfano and Giovanni Rapi were sentenced to 30 years. The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. The <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the verdict, a furious Alfano accused the authorities to have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison. Another defendant, Gennaro De Marinas, who was sentenced to 30 years as well, slashed his throat with a piece of glass in the Court when the verdict was delivered.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} {{passed to the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) when it was {{established}} in 1997 to review alleged miscarriages of justice. The CCRC referred {{the case to the}} Court of Appeal in March 2001 on the grounds that new DNA testing on the silencer constituted fresh evidence. The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002 at the Royal Courts of Justice by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002. The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Bamber by Michael Turner QC. In a 522-point judgment, the judges said that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> been right.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Juries</b> <b>have</b> {{also refused}} to convict due to the {{perceived}} injustice of a law in general, or {{of the way the}} law is applied in particular cases. There have also been cases where the <b>jury</b> <b>has</b> refused to convict due to their own prejudices, e.g. about the race of one of the parties in the case.|$|R

5|$|Following {{his capture}} Noriega was {{transferred}} to a cell in the Miami federal courthouse, where he was arraigned on the ten charges which the Miami grand <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> returned 2 years earlier. The start of the trial was delayed until September 1991 due to complex legal maneuvering over whether Noriega could be tried after his detention as a prisoner of war, the admissibility of evidence and witnesses, and {{how to pay for}} Noriega's legal defense. The trial ended in April 1992, when Noriega was convicted on eight of the ten charges of drug trafficking, racketeering, and money laundering.|$|E
5|$|When Berkman {{was brought}} to the {{courtroom}} on September19, the <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> already been empaneled. The district attorney had selected the jury without allowing Berkman to examine prospective jurors, and the judge had no objection to the unusual procedure. Berkman was charged with six counts: felonious assault with the intent to kill Frick; felonious assault with the intent to kill Lawrence Leishman, who had been in Frick's office {{at the time of the}} attack; feloniously entering the offices of the Carnegie Steel Company on three occasions; and unlawfully carrying concealed weapons. Berkman pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E
5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} delayed {{due to the}} {{difficulties}} in bringing together witnesses, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and interpreters. The proceedings finally began in August 1828, with Judge James Duane Doty presiding. Wau-koo-kau and Man-ne-tah-peh-keh, the two warriors imprisoned for the 1826 murders of the Methode family, were released {{due to a lack}} of witnesses, as were three Ho-Chunks held for the attack on the keelboats. Only two men, Wekau and Chickhonsic, were prosecuted. According to historian Patrick Jung, it became clear during the trial that Red Bird had committed the murders at the Gagnier cabin, and that there was not enough evidence to convict Wekau and Chickhonsic. Despite this, the white and métis jury found them guilty. Judge Doty sentenced them to hang, as he was required to do by law. Their lawyer filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> ignored the evidence, and so Doty suspended the death sentences.|$|E
