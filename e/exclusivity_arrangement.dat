40|$|An input {{supplier}} {{selling to}} competing downstream firms {{would benefit from}} publicly committing at the outset to all contracts. Efficient commitment, however, would require complete contracts. The authors study instead bilateral contracting, without commitment regarding others' terms. Each firm then fears that the supplier might opportunistically renegotiate another's contract to increase bilateral profit at the firm's expense. The authors show that nondiscrimination clauses generally cannot curb such third-party opportunism, even with symmetric firms. To reassure firms, crude forms of commitment may be adopted. This could explain the pervasiveness of <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangements</b> and the striking uniformity and intertemporal rigidity of franchise contracts.

40|$|It is common, but incorrect, to view {{retailing}} as {{a highly}} competitive activity. Unlike manufacturing, retailing has displayed a trend towards much higher concentration, reinforced by actions of retailers themselves, such as emphasis on own-label brands. This may introduce distortions arising from exercise of market power or may create countervailing power to that already enjoyed by manufacturers. Acknowledging increased market power within retailing raises new issues for competition authorities. We develop a consistent framework of analysis {{and use it to}} examine two issues: attitudes to retail mergers and <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangements</b> between retailers and their suppliers.

Rockwell International's chip division developed a new driver chip set incorporating the standard and aggressively priced it. Supra, Inc. arranged a short-term <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Rockwell, and developed the SupraFAXmodem 14400 based on it. Introduced in January 1992 at $399 (or less), it was half the price of the slower V.32 modems already on the market. This led to a price war, {{and by the end of}} the year V.32 was dead, never having been really established, and V.32bis modems were widely available for $250.|$|E
50|$|Benefiting from an <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the old Battersea North {{seat was}} one of two seats in London to have had a Communist MP: Shapurji Saklatvala {{represented}} the area from 1922 to 1929. A wealthy aristocratic Indian he was among the five Communists elected to the national chamber in its history and was the third of the young Socialist Labour/Communist/Labour parties from an ethnic minority background. At first, Saklatvala had local Labour party support and was also a member of that party but then stood as a Communist in 1924 with local Labour party backing. The head office of the less radical Labour party mandated an official Labour candidate stand against him in 1929. The Battersea Labour Club (a drinking club not directly connected with the political party) had a notice on its notice board up until the 1980s banning Communists from admission to the club.|$|E

We {{examine the relationship between}} net neutrality regulation and Internet fragmentation in a game-theoretic model that considers the interplay between termination fees, exclusivity and competition between two In-ternet Service Providers (ISPs) and between two Content Providers (CPs). An <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangement</b> between an ISP and a CP reduces the CPs exposure to some end users but it also reduces competition among the CPs. Fragmentation arises in equilibrium when competition between CPs is very strong, the CPsrevenues from advertisements are very low, the content of the CPs is highly complementary, or the termination fees are high. We 8 ̆ 5 nd that the absence of fragmentation is always bene 8 ̆ 5 cial for consumers, as they can enjoy all available content. Policy interventions that prevent fragmentation are thus good for consumers. However, results for to-tal welfare are more mixed.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{dictates}} that convenience goods should be distributed as intensively as possible. Still, <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangements</b> are rapidly gaining way in grocery retailing. We discuss the possible performance outcomes of exclusivity deals, and propose a unified framework (i) {{to quantify the}} gains and losses of such arrangements in consumer-packaged-goods markets, and (ii) to decompose the total monetary gains and losses {{into a variety of}} sources. Our framework considers both the manufacturer and the retailer granted the exclusivity right, and accounts for the fact that both dyad parties may be active in multiple, inter-related, categories. We illustrate the proposed approach in the context of Unilever s decision to limit the distribution of five of its (sub-) brands to a single retailer in the Dutch market, and derive the sales and profit implications for the parties involved. In all instances,we find that intensive distribution generates higher sales for themanufacturer than the exclusive arrangement, while such an arrangement is typically appealing for the retailer granted exclusivity. To come to a win-win situation, a variety of compensatory arrangements are considered. While manufacturers should not try to have leading incumbent products de-listed, we show how extra feature support for the exclusive brand may make an otherwise harmful arrangement beneficial for the manufacturer. In addition, we show how, in a number of instances, the total dyad profitability increases under exclusive arrangements, which offers rooms for margin re-negotiations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Since the Apple iPhone’s first {{launch in}} 2007 with an {{exclusive}} arrangement with AT&T, it has garnered overwhelmingly positive responses from consumers {{and from the}} media. With its success, exclusive contracts between handset makers and wireless carriers have come under increasing scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers. Such practices have been criticized by regulators, by the media, and by “locked-out” consumers, {{due to the fact}} that a consumer has to subscribe to a particular service provider if he or she strongly prefers one handset to others. In this paper, we empirically examine the impact of handset <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangements</b> on consumer welfare. First we study consumers’ purchase decisions in mobile services that include the choice of a handset and of a service provider. We do so by combining survey data on consumers’ purchase decisions with supplemented data on prices and features of common handsets. Next, assuming a Stackelberg leader-follower relationship between the handset manufacturers and the service providers, and using our demand estimates, we recover the marginal costs for the players in the market. We then simulate what would have happened in the counterfactual scenario when the iPhone is available from all carriers. Our results suggest that, if we take into account price adjustments from handset manufacturers and service providers in response to the change in market structure, consumer welfare will increase by $ 326 million without the exclusive arrangement. We view our analysis as a starting point to a more complete characterization of consumer behavior and the complex relationships among players in this industry. ...|$|R
40|$|Exclusive dealing arrangements, {{in which}} a {{distributor}} contracts to work exclusively with a single manufacturer, can be efficiency enhancing or they canbeananticompetitivemeanstoforeclose markets. Both rationales suggest a likely cost advantage to using exclusive distributors. This paper evaluates the effect of exclusive distribution arrangements on distributor costs in the Chicago beer market in 1994. I provide a model of consumer demand and firm behavior that incorporates industry details and allows for distribution through exclusive and shared channels. The parameters of the model are then estimated using existing scanner data on beer sales combined with a new data set on sales territories. The estimates provide evidence that brewers who employ exclusive dealing arrangements have lower cost distributors relative to their competitors. The magnitude of this cost advantage {{is estimated to be}} 14 c / per 12 -oz beer, where the average 12 -oz beer has a wholesale price of 50 c/. When the sample is restricted to the major brewers in the Chicago market, exclusive distributors are estimated to confer an 8. 8 c / cost advantage. A simple test indicates that foreclosure effects do not explain these results. Counterfactual experiments suggest that regulatory intervention in distribution arrangements could increase welfare measures by up to 42 %, if exclusivity agreements merely foreclose parts of the market. Alternatively, if exclusive agreements are efficiency enhancing, intervention could decrease welfare measures by up to 21 %. These estimates provide empirical evidence that intervention in <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangements</b> can yield large welfare dividends, provided that such intervention is not misapplied. Given that the foreclosure hypothesis is not supported by these data, in this market the most likely effect of intervention would be to substantially reduce social welfare...|$|R
25|$|Their tariffs are {{difficult}} to evaluate: they varied significantly. The average charge for a prostitute in 5th and 4th century ranged from three obols to a drachma. Expensive prostitutes could charge a stater (four drachmas), or more, like the Corinthian Lais in her prime did. In the 1st century BC, the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara, cited in the Palatine anthology, V 126, mentions a system of subscription of up to five drachma for a dozen visits. In the 2nd century, Lucian in his Dialogue of the Hetaera has the prostitute Ampelis consider five drachma per visit as a mediocre price (8, 3). In the same text a young virgin can demand a Mina, that is 100 drachma (7,3), or even two minas if the customer is less than appetizing. A young and pretty prostitute could charge a higher price than her in-decline colleague; even if, as iconography on ceramics demonstrates, a specific market existed for older women. The price would change if the client demanded <b>exclusivity.</b> Intermediate <b>arrangements</b> also existed; {{a group of friends}} could purchase exclusivity, with each having part-time rights.|$|R
40|$|A patent 2 ̆ 2 pool 2 ̆ 2 is an {{arrangement}} under which patent holders {{in a common}} technology commit their patents to a single holder, who then licenses {{them out to the}} original patentees and perhaps also to outsiders. The payoffs include both revenue earned as a licensor, and technology acquired by pool members as licensees. Public effects can also be significant. For example, technology sharing of complementary patents can improve product quality and variety. In some information technology markets pools can prevent patents from becoming a costly obstacle to innovation by clearing channels of technology transfer. By contrast, a pool 2 ̆ 7 s aggregate output reduction or price fixing in a product market can produce cartel profits. A traditional justification for patent pools is that they facilitate improved products by uniting complements. Sharing of complementary patents means that licensees can then employ all the patents in their product, rather than creating silos in which each manufacturer incorporates only its own patented features. Pools created for this purpose can reduce problems of royalty stacking and holdup, as well as problems involving blocking patents. A more robust explanation for pooling in many markets comes out of the economics of transaction costs, which emphasizes the role of limited information and the costs of obtaining it, as well as uncertainty in bargaining and sharing. Pooling is an efficient solution to problems of technology development and transfer when determining patents 2 ̆ 7 validity or identifying their boundaries is costly. In this sense, patent pools function much as traditional common pool resources. An individual patent’s boundaries distinguish its protected technological embodiments from noninfringing technology. But when multiple patents are aggregated what really matters are the outer boundaries that separate the portfolio as a whole from outside patents or the public domain. So long as the relevant rights are somewhere in the portfolio, the parties do not need to delineate the boundaries of individual patents in order to strike a deal. While most patent pools are socially beneficial, certain practices or structures can pose competitive problems. The biggest antitrust risk from pooling is collusion, and its threat depends on two things. First is the market structure {{and the power of the}} pool within its market. Second is the nature of pricing and <b>exclusivity</b> <b>arrangements</b> within the pool. Pool 2 ̆ 2 exclusivity 2 ̆ 2 can take several forms. First, it can refer to the contract that each licensor has with the pool, asking whether that licensor is free to license to others outside of the pool. Second it can refer to the pool’s willingness as licensee to accept an offered technology from an outsider for inclusion in the pool. Third it can refer to the pool 2 ̆ 7 s willingness as licensor to license to outsider manufacturers. Fourth, it can refer to field-of-use or other restrictions given to licensees from the pool. A large but inconclusive literature considers the relationship between pooling and innovation. Conclusions are sensitive to assumptions about patent strength and quality, about the relationship among the patents in a pool and the strength of alternatives outside the pool, about the impact on innovation of insiders vs. outsiders to the pool, and finally, about the strategic responses of participants. Most of the literature concludes that most pools increase innovation rates. A pool should increase the demand for innovation of complements to the pool. First of all, access to the existing technology by pool members should be guaranteed and cheaper. To the extent the pool reduces licensing costs and eliminates royalty stacking the cost of further improvements should decline. When innovation is cumulative the development of new technology may require the licensing of existing technology with multiple patent holders. Pooling can reduce these costs and thus facilitate cumulative innovation...|$|R
