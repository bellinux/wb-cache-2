500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast. Rowat said, [...] "In his previous films, Marshall made {{something out of}} nothing. Here he does the opposite". The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director {{he knows how to}} extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers." ...|$|E

500|$|Back in Ainola, Sibelius busied {{himself by}} making new {{arrangements}} of old songs. However, his mind returned frequently to the now apparently moribund symphony. In February 1943 {{he told his}} secretary, Santeri Levas, that he hoped to complete a [...] "great work" [...] before he died, but blamed the war for his inability to make progress: [...] "I cannot sleep at nights when I think about it." [...] In June he discussed the symphony with his future son-in-law Jussi Jalas and provided another reason for its non-completion: [...] "For each of my symphonies I have developed a special technique. It can't be something superficial, it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that has been lived though. In my new work I am struggling with precisely these issues."

She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness.

She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: [...] "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important {{to have something to}} fall back on." [...] She did this in her own life, as she planned to [...] "fall back on" [...] another part of the entertainment industry.

[...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her. [...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her.

Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If there is to be trouble, let it be in my day, so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years.

2500|$|In early January 2009, Romney {{supported}} the $750 billion federal {{economic stimulus package}} proposed by the incoming president, Barack Obama, {{who had not yet}} taken office. Romney said at the time: [...] "I frankly wish that the last Congress would have dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president [...] could assign that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time.... I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies." [...] However, as a candidate for president in May 2012, Romney said that the economic stimulus package that had been enacted in February 2009 (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) had been a waste of money that did little to jump-start the economy, and that the federal government had inflated the numbers of jobs that had been created or preserved by the various projects funded through the stimulus program.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the final}} scene of the film that made Shinkai glad he had cast Hanazawa. He knew that when Yukari cried, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{impressive}} in order to emphasize an intense release of emotion. According to Shinkai, music alone could not produce the needed effect, and Hanazawa performed perfectly and without instruction. In an interview, he said, [...] "I believe that Ms. Hanazawa's acting on that crying scene alone completes the film." [...] This final scene, which was recorded perfectly on the first take, {{played a pivotal role}} in the casting decision for Takao's character. Though many Japanese voice actors could portray a naïve 15-year-old boy, Shinkai immediately recognized that only Miyu Irino could produce the intense emotion needed for the closing scene. Irino had also played Shun and Shin in Shinkai's Children Who Chase Lost Voices.|$|R

50|$|Concussions in England's {{professional}} rugby union are {{the most}} common injury gained. Concussion can occur where an individual experiences a minor injury to the head.

The reason being that it doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> strike you in the proximity of your brain, but can also be caused by rapid change of movement, giving the skull not enough time to move with your body, causing your brain to press against your skull.

Even to-day traditions work powerfully, through extravagance of uniform, and through survivals of that mechanical discipline that was so important in the days of hand-to-hand fighting, to keep the soldier something other than a man. For all the lessons of the Boer war we are still inclined to believe that the soldier <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> severely parallel, carrying a rifle he fires under orders, obedient to the pitch of absolute abnegation of his private intelligence.

The truth is, we didn’t just want to organize the umpteenth training camp. It <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> special. And so it came that this very compact place somehow created a special atmosphere, with all of us running into each other several times a day, with groups of six players each sharing a house.

50|$|In {{one of the}} holograms, however, a {{dark band}} was {{observed}} in the closest image to the hologram, and it <b>was</b> observed <b>to</b> shift position with perspective.

The confocal laser cavity consisted of a spherical mirror at the output end with a flat mirror {{at the center of}} curvature at the other end. Adjustment of the longitudinal spacing controlled the number of off-axis modes of oscillation, and it was observed that the laser was oscillating in more than one axis mode. The multiple laser modes were incoherent and did not interfere in the observable laser beam, so why did they interfere in the hologram reconstruction? Stetson put forth the idea that each mode existed in both the object and in the reference beam, and each pair recorded a separate hologram in the photographic plate. When these were reconstructed, both recordings reconstructed simultaneously from the same laser beam and the fields were then mutually coherent. Powell objected to this idea, because it implied that the hologram <b>had</b> the power <b>to</b> coherently reconstruct fields that were incoherent during its recording.|$|R
