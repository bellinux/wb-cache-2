At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E

At issue were restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a private, non-profit corporation established by Congress. The restrictions prohibited LSC attorneys from representing clients attempting to amend (or challenge) existing welfare law. The case was brought by Carmen Velazquez, whose LSC-funded attorneys sought to challenge existing welfare provisions, believing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to get Velazquez financial relief.|$|E

5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{analysis}} has indicated Overton {{may have been}} treated unfairly for these actions, becoming a scapegoat {{for the actions of}} many other pilots in the war. No new policies had been released warning about crossing the Chinese border, and no pilots before Overton had been punished for doing so. Overton himself expressed frustration at the move, as he had been the rearmost pilot in the formation that crossed the Yalu River on 24 January, and Mitchell himself had been known to cross the border and condoned the action. Fellow ace and unit member Francis Gabreski challenged the move, claiming that US pilots were outnumbered and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to maintain air superiority. It was later revealed that Swiss observers to the peace talks at Panmunjon were traveling through Manchuria on foot when they spotted a UN-Soviet dogfight and lodged a complaint, prompting an investigation which eventually indicted Overton.|$|E

Together they have a son, Marlon Leon Sundeep (named after the actor Marlon Brando), born in 1969, and a daughter, Angela (originally named Dandelion), born in 1972. Their third child, a son named Tara Jo Jo Gunne (after Richards' and Pallenberg's friend Guinness heir Tara Browne), died on 6 June 1976 at just over two months old of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Richards was away on tour at the time, something he said has haunted him since.

25|$|Traffic on the Trent and Mersey {{main line}} {{was such that}} it {{suffered}} from water shortage in dry periods, and water levels on the Caldon branch were often too low at such times, as the water was used to keep the main line moving. In 1796, the company {{wanted to build a}} reservoir at Rudyard, to improve the situation, and a branch to Leek was included in the Bill, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> to obtain the consent of the Leek authorities and landowners for the reservoir. The Bill was defeated in Parliament, after which the Peak Forest Canal Company proposed to build a branch of their canal from Marple to Leek, and on to join the Caldon branch. It would also have included a reservoir at Rudyard, but the plan was short-lived, as the Trent and Mersey succeeded in getting their bill passed when they submitted it to Parliament for a second time in 1797. To ensure that the water from Rudyard could be used to supply the main line, the Leek branch had to join the top level of the Caldon branch, and so the original route with the three Park Lane locks was closed and a new route built, with a three-lock staircase between the junction and the old line of the canal. This was altered again in 1841 to the present arrangement, where the canal to Froghall passes under an aqueduct on the Leek branch, and three separate locks at Hollinhurst raise the old line up to the summit level.|$|E

Battenberg wrote that a Greek purchase of modern capital ships would be [...] "undesirable from every point of view", as the country's finances could not support them and the increasing power of torpedos were making smaller ships more dangerous. Along much the same lines, Kerr suggested to Venizelos that a fleet built around smaller warships would be better suited for the constricted Aegean Sea. However, these views were strongly opposed by the Greek Navy and King Constantine I of Greece, both of whom desired a regular battle fleet, as they believed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of assuring Greek naval superiority over the Ottomans.|$|E

A female dragoon, Christian Welsh (she had disguised her true sex) remembered, [...] "Our vanguard did not come into sight of the enemy entrenchments til the afternoon; however, not to give the Bavarians time to make themselves yet stronger, the duke ordered the Dutch General Goor... to attack as soon as possible." [...] At about 17:00, as a preliminary to the attack, Marlborough's artillery commander, Colonel Holcroft Blood, pounded the enemy from a position near Berg; each salvo was countered by d'Arco's guns from Gustavus's fort and from just outside the Boschberg wood.|$|E
500|$|The {{filming of}} Inseminoid wrapped two days behind schedule.

Three pages of script, which I had to condense into one shot. Having to make such an enormous compromise was not a happy choice for me, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> of getting us back on schedule." [...] On his contribution to Inseminoid, Warren stated that Peter Boyle proved to be [...] "a pleasure to work with, {{because he had a}} natural feel for the material and managed to create just the right pace and rhythm throughout the film." [...] During the post-production process, the editing staff increased the brightness of the original print, concerned that a dim appearance would damage the chances of sales to television broadcasters, and removed the most graphic shots of the birth of the mutant children for the purposes of classification. The opening title visuals, consisting of vibrant oil frames, are a contribution of Oxford Scientific Films.|$|E
500|$|Official {{diplomatic}} recognition by other countries was key for Rhodesia as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> it could regain the international legitimacy it had lost through UDI. Recognition by the UK itself through a bilateral settlement {{would be the}} [...] "first prize", in Smith's words, as it would end sanctions and constitutional ambiguity and make foreign acceptance, {{at least in the}} West, far more likely. Considering their country a potentially important player in the Cold War as a [...] "bastion against communism" [...] in southern Africa, the RF posited that some Western countries might recognise UDI even without a prior Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement. Specifically, it expected {{diplomatic recognition}} from South Africa and Portugal, and thought that France might recognise Rhodesia to annoy Britain and create a precedent for an independent Quebec. But although South Africa and Portugal gave economic, military and limited political support to the post-UDI government (as did France and other nations, to a lesser extent), neither they nor any other country ever recognised Rhodesia as a de jure independent state. Rhodesia's unsuccessful attempts to win Western support and recognition included offers to the US government in 1966 and 1967, ignored by Lyndon B Johnson's administration, to provide Rhodesian troops to fight alongside the Americans and other anti-communist forces in Vietnam.|$|E
