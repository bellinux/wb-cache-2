50|$|The pianos have steel strings in the {{midsection}} and treble, {{and bass}} strings {{are made of}} copper-wound steel. The strings are uniformly spaced with one end coiled around the tuning pins, which in turn are inserted in a laminated wooden block called the pinblock or wrestplank. The tuning pins keep the strings tight and are {{held in place by}} friction. Steinway also employs front and rear duplex scales. C.F. Theodore Steinway was a friend of the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. The friendship led to the development and Steinway patent in 1872 of front and back aliquots, allowing the traditionally <b>dead</b> <b>sections</b> of strings to vibrate with other strings.|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} and control {{system for the}} Munich MP-Tandem is based on two bundles of acrylic light pipes running in the column structure from {{both ends of the}} tank to the <b>dead</b> <b>sections</b> and to the terminal. These light guides transmit all control signals for lenses, beam steerers, foil strippers and variable apertures as well as the readings of beam currents, charging currents, column currents, ionization currents, pump currents and voltages, and alternator frequencies. Details of the mechanical and electronic design are presented. Before the system has been installed, parts of it have passed various high voltage and radiation tests. It has gone in operation in june 1976. Operating experiences and test results are reported...|$|R

40|$|Outbreaks of defoliating insects {{periodically}} cause mass {{mortality of}} trees, thereby generating pulses of dead wood resources for saproxylic (i. e. dead-wood dependent) organisms. This {{study investigated the}} responses of saproxylic beetles to a dead wood resource pulse caused by recent (2001 - 2009) outbreaks of geometrid moths in the subarctic mountain birch forest of the Varanger region in northern Norway. A large scale (20 km) transect design, implementing window (flight interception) traps and replicated in two areas, {{was used to compare}} beetle community structure between outbreak (dead wood) and non-outbreak (live wood) locations. The overall abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles did not differ consistently between live- and <b>dead</b> wood <b>sections</b> of the transects. However, the two most common early successional saproxylic species, Hylecoetus dermestoides and Rabocerus foveolatus, were significantly more abundant in the <b>dead</b> wood <b>sections</b> of both transects, while no such responses were found in later successional saproxylic species. With respect to trophic groups, mycetophagous beetles were significantly more abundant in dead wood, but this response was entirely driven by H. dermestoides. Moreover, carnivorous beetles strongly dominated the beetle community along the entire transects, regardless of wood vitality. The lack of an overall response from saproxylic beetles to dead-wood-availability, combined with the raised abundance of a few early successional species, suggests that four to eight years after the moth outbreaks saproxylic beetle succession in the Varanger region is still in an initial phase...|$|R

5000|$|In the UK, Badham's {{work was}} {{discovered}} by the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, who staged a collaborative production of Kitchen with Nabokov Theatre in 2001. A play about marriage {{as a metaphor for}} capitalism, it then toured to the 2002 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where it became a critical success. A 2003 play, Camarilla, was a critical success at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, cementing Badham's international reputation as a proponent of radical political theatre. Badham was appointed Literary Manager of London's Finborough Theatre in 2009 and worked there until relocating to Melbourne to become an artistic associate at the Malthouse Theatre from 2011-2013.

5000|$|Generally two {{separate}} overhead wires are used, with the rail {{for the third}} phase, though occasionally three overhead wires are used. At junctions, crossovers and crossings the two lines must be kept apart, with a continuous supply to the locomotive, which must have two live conductors wherever it stops. Hence two collectors per overhead phase are used, but the possibility of bridging a <b>dead</b> <b>section</b> and causing a short circuit from the front collector of one phase to the back collector of the other phase must be avoided. The resistance of the rails used for the third phase or return is higher for AC than for DC because of the [...] "skin" [...] effect, but lower for the low frequency used than for industrial frequency. Losses are also increased, though {{not in the same}} proportion, as the impedance is largely reactive.The locomotive needs to pick up power from two (or three) overhead conductors. Early locomotives on the Italian State Railways used a wide bow collector which covered both wires but later locomotives used two pantographs side by side. In the United States, a pair of trolley poles were used. They worked well with a maximum speed of 15 mph. The dual conductor pantograph system is used on four mountain railways that continue to use three-phase power (Corcovado Rack Railway in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Jungfraubahn and Gornergratbahn in Switzerland and the Petit train de la Rhune in France).|$|E
50|$|Many of Smith's {{revisions}} to the Bible led to significant developments in the doctrines of Mormonism. During the process of translation, when he came across troubling biblical issues, Smith often dictated revelations relevant to himself, his associates, or the church. About half of the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants are in some way connected to this translation process, including background on the Apocrypha (LDS D&C section 91 CoC D&C 88), the three degrees of glory (LDS section 76 CoC Section 85), the eternal nature of marriage and plural marriage (LDS section 132), teachings on baptism for the <b>dead</b> (LDS <b>section</b> 124 CoC Section 107), and various revelations on priesthood (LDS sections 84, 88, 107 CoC Sections 83, 104).|$|R
50|$|Yury Tynyanov, who {{had been}} researching the period for his {{historical}} novels Kyukhlya (1925) and Smert Vazir-mukhtara (The death of the ambassador plenipotentiary, 1928), wrote a novella based on Dahl's story that was published in 1928 in Krasnaya Nov #1. He considerably expanded it, adding several characters (including the historical statesman Aleksey Arakcheyev), and changed the imaginary officer's name from Kizh to Kizhe (using an alternative form of the particle, zhe). In his version, along with the imaginary Kizhe there is another mistake: a Lieutenant Sinyukhaev is wrongly marked as <b>dead.</b> Several <b>sections</b> of the novella are devoted to Sinyukhaev's fruitless attempts to get himself restored (he ends up wandering the roads of Russia, living on the charity of strangers).|$|R

50|$|Low Voltage {{propulsion}} {{control was}} coming into style {{around the time}} the earliest Standards were being delivered. Therefore, {{it was no surprise}} the Standards arrived with the feature. On earlier high voltage propulsion control systems, 600 volts ran through the motorman's control stand as well as through the train via the use of jumpers between cars. This had to be the case to make the electrical contacts to allow all of the motor cars of a train to draw power in a synchronized effort from the Third rail. However, this could be dangerous for motormen and shop personnel alike by creating an electrocution hazard. Even unpowered trailer cars had to carry the 600 volts through these jumpers, because it was necessary to pass on the voltage to motor cars behind the trailer so as to synchronize them with the lead car. However, low voltage propulsion control utilized battery voltage (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This battery voltage was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the battery voltage in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the battery voltage, by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup. This also meant that Standards crossing onto a <b>dead</b> <b>section</b> of third rail would not energize it by bridging the gap between it and the previous live section. This was especially beneficial to track workers who had requested third rail power off in performing their duties. All told, Low Voltage propulsion control tremendously improved safety for train crews, shop crews, and track gangs.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of poles for yam culture is labour intensive, costly {{and difficult to}} mechanize. Furthermore, suitable bush sticks cannot always be obtained locally. These difficulties can be overcome by growing suitable trees in the field. In the Philippines farmers are using Leucaena, but other leguminous trees like Gliricidia could also be used. Yams are planted {{at the base of}} the tree, which will give some shade to the young yams and will encourage growth in the early stages. Later the tree is ring-barked about 40 cm above the ground, thereby killing all tree growth above that point. The tree stem then provides a sturdy pole to support the yam.
