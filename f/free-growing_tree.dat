40|$|All {{parts of}} Prosopis africana (Guill & Perr) Taub {{are used by}} rural {{communities}} in Nigeria, and this exposes it to degradation and a regeneration problems. There is lack of information on inventory on natural forest estates for management and decision-making. This species is facing a regeneration problem and overexploitation. The {{aim of this study}} was to developed model that can predict the growth space requirements for P. africana plantation establishment. Growing space was associated with crown size; seven crown and stem diameter relation models were tested on data recorded from P. africana trees in Makurdi-Nigeria; simple random sampling technique was used to collect data. The linear model (crown-stem diameter relation) provided the best model fitted with R 2 values of 0. 778 with adjusted R 2 0. 777. For optimum planting, fast growth and high production/yield the tree species would require a planting spacing of 4 x 4 meters; for example, that a dominant <b>free-growing</b> <b>tree</b> of diameter 52. 90 cm would required 0. 008 hectare of growing space with a stocking of 125 tree per hectare for P. africana. Stand density converges around 0. 000016 m 2. The baseline information provided by this study could serve as a guide for optimum planting distances and tree stocking in large scale plantations of P. africana species in Nigeria and international, this to avoid extinction of the economic tree...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Kano state, Nigeria with the {{objective}} of predicting crown width from diameter at breast height and the planting spacing of Parkia biglobosa (Jacq) species. This is an economic plant with multipurpose usage. This species is exposes to degradation, overexploitation and have a regeneration problems. There is lack of information on inventory for P. biglobosa (Jacq) in term of plantation establishment and management. Data from the economic tree species were collected from nine plots (sizes 100 x 100 meters each), randomly laid down. Data on trees diameter at breast height (dbh) and crown diameter were collected from each plot within the study area. The data collected were tested on five crown and stem diameter relationship models. The simple linear model was best fitted with R 2 values of 0. 69 to 0. 85. The results shows that a dominant <b>free-growing</b> <b>tree</b> species with diameter 50. 66 cm would require 0. 0066 hectare of growing space with a stocking of the stand in terms of total occupancy by tree crowns of 151 trees per hectare. For optimum planting distance, fast growth and high production/yield, P. biglobosa would require a planting spacing of 4 x 4 meters (for NTFPs purpose) and 8 x 8 meters (for timber purpose). Thus, the baseline information from this study could serve as a guide for optimum planting distances and tree density in large scale plantations for countries with similar species and forest types...|$|E
40|$|After {{species and}} {{provenance}} selection, {{the most important}} decision for a new plantation is how many trees to plant on the chosen site. A planted-forest manager’s decisions on how much growing space to provide to trees initially at planting, which is later increased through mortality and thinning, are of paramount importance. At a given site and for a specified market objective(s), desirable stand density and rotation age are well known through practical experience for many tree species grown in commercial plantations. The scientific basis of stand-density and rotation age recommendations for a given species at a given site can be explained and quantified satisfactorily, however, if {{the growth of a}} <b>free-growing</b> <b>tree</b> and the growing space that it needs to remain free of competition are known. ‘Packing’, which integrates this information, is a simple, powerful descriptor of tree growth in young, even-aged, monoculture stands, and is a useful quantitative tool to help practicing foresters make critical management decisions successfully. In this paper, we present some terminology background, and then a quantification of Langsaeter’s general relation of increment versus stand density in graphic form where neither axis of the graph was quantified. We have found a relation between stand density and increment in early monoculture plantation stands that permits quantification of Langsaeter’s relation. The increment axis is in terms of the ratio of stand increment to that of a stand full of free-growing trees, while the stand density axis is the ratio of the number of trees in the stand to the number of free-growing trees in the full stand, or “packing. ” Thus, unit stand density results in unit stand increment. Optimal stand density, i. e. a packing value of about 10, results in an increment of about 4 times the unit increment. Unit stand densities were derived from the work of O’Connor in South Africa in the early 1900 ’s...|$|E
50|$|Trees play a {{key role}} in the gardens and landscapes of Japan as well as being of {{important}} spiritual and cultural significance to its people. Fittingly, Japanese gardeners have fine-tuned a distinctive set of pruning techniques meant to coax out the essential characters of niwaki. Niwaki are often cultivated to achieve some very striking effects: trees are made to look older than they really are with broad trunks and gnarled branches; trees are made to imitate wind-swept or lightning-struck trees in the wild; Cryptomeria japonica specimens are often pruned to resemble <b>free-growing</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R

6000|$|The {{next thing}} that will strike us, after this love of clouds, is the love of liberty. Whereas the mediæval was always {{shutting}} himself into castles, and behind fosses, and drawing brickwork neatly, and beds of flowers primly, our painters delight in getting to the open fields and moors; abhor all hedges and moats; never paint anything but <b>free-growing</b> <b>trees,</b> and rivers gliding [...] "at their own sweet will"; eschew formality down to the smallest detail; break and displace the brickwork which the mediæval would have carefully cemented; leave unpruned the thickets he would have delicately trimmed; and, carrying the love of liberty even to license, {{and the love of}} wildness even to ruin, take pleasure at last in every aspect of age and desolation which emancipates the objects of nature from the government of men;--on the castle wall displacing its tapestry with ivy, and spreading, through the garden, the bramble for the rose.|$|R
40|$|During the {{development}} and lifecycle of multicellular organisms, cells have to die, and this occurs by a process called programmed cell death or PCD, which can be separated from necrosis or accidental cell death (Pennell and Lamb, 1997). Senescence is the terminal phase in {{the development}} of an organism, organ, tissue or cell, where nutrients are remobilized from the senescing parts of the plant into other parts, and the cells of the senescing organ or tissue undergo PCD if the process is not reversed in time. Leaf senescence involves cessation of photosynthesis, loss of pigments and proteins, nutrient remobilization, and degradation of the plant cells (Smart, 1994). Initiation of leaf senescence is triggered by a wide range of endogenous and environmental factors, that through unknown pathways controls the process, and regulates the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) (Buchanan-Wollaston, 1997). Autumn leaf senescence in deciduous trees is regulated by photoperiod and temperature, and is an attractive experimental system for studies on senescence in perennial plants. We have studied the process of autumn senescence in a free-growing aspen (Populus tremula) by following changes in pigment, metabolite and nutrient content, photosynthesis, and cell and organelle integrity. All data were combined in a cellular timetable of autumn senescence in aspen. The senescence process started on September 11 with degradation of pigments and other leaf constituents, and once initiated, progressed steadily without being affected by the environment. Chloroplasts were rapidly degraded, and mitochondria took over energy production after chlorophyll levels had dropped by 50 %. At the end of remobilization, around 29 th of September, some cells were still metabolically active and had chlorophyll-containing plastids. Over 80 % of nitrogen and phosphorus was remobilized, and a sudden change in the  15 N of the cellular content on September 29, indicated that volatile compounds may have been released. We have also studied gene expression in autumn leaves by analysing EST sequences from two different cDNA libraries, one from autumn leaves of a field-grown aspen and the other from young, but fully expanded leaves of a green-house grown aspen. In the autumn leaf library, ESTs encoding metallothioneins, proteases, stress-related proteins and proteins involved in respiration and breakdown of macromolecules were abundant, while genes coding for photosynthetic proteins were massively downregulated. We have also identified homologues to many known senescence-associated genes in annual plants. By using Populus cDNA microarrays, we could follow changes in gene expression during the autumn over four years in the same <b>free-growing</b> aspen <b>tree.</b> We also followed changes in chlorophyll content to monitor the progression of leaf senescence. We observed a major shift in gene expression, occuring at different times the four years, that reflected a metabolic shift from photosynthetic competence to energy generation by mitochondrial respiration. Even though autumn senescence was initiated almost at the same date each year, the transcriptional timetables were different from year to year, especially for 2004, which indicates that there is no strict correlation between the transcriptional and the cellular timetables of leaf senescence...|$|R
