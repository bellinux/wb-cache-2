40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} of notice of termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that notice of termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the notice of termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because notice of termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law of regulation of notice of termination. The main part of the thesis is contained in chapter four, which deals with the current legislation of notice of termination. This chapter, {{with the help of the}} case law, deals with formal and content page of notice of termination, her <b>delivery,</b> <b>notice</b> of termination by employees and employers, prohibiting the possibility of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the {{definition}} of adequate compensation from the viewpoints of affected landowners, property valuers and land administrators using Kotaka’s Model with special application in Kedah, Malaysia. The fact is that land is a factor of production and must be made available for the provision of infrastructure. In acquiring land for real estate development, compensation must be paid to the affected landowners. An adequate compensation in land acquisition is referred to the open market value of the land taken plus its consequences including severance, injurious affection and disturbances. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaires are distributed to the affected 40 landowners,ten property valuers and six land administrators of randomly selected land acquisition projects for public infrastructure land development in the case study areas. Data gathered are analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis to identify elements of dissatisfactions of landowners upon compensation offered to them. Findings – The findings show that there are elements of dissatisfactions to the affected landowners by way of the value of land taken, severances, injurious affections, disturbances, <b>delivery</b> of <b>notices</b> and technique of valuation. These dissatisfactions reflect the amount of adequate compensation to the affected landowners and cross-examined with property valuers and land administrators. Originality/value – The outcome of the paper will assist landowners, public, and private valuers, land administrators and other stakeholders to understand the elements of dissatisfactions in estimating adequate compensation in land acquisition for infrastructure provision. Otherwise, the affected landowners may refuse to be apart from their lands, hence, restrict the flow of land supply for real estate development. This indicates that Kotaka’s Model offers an explanatory power to understand the elements of adequate compensation in land acquisition for infrastructure provision and real estate development...|$|R

Widespread evictions from the local Keogh estate meant many poor families eked out an existence of sorts on the rough barren slopes of Carran mountain. A campaign of non-payment of rent exposed many families to such a fate, and in an effort to prevent further evictions, the Land League organised demonstrations to prevent <b>delivery</b> of eviction <b>notices</b> by local postmen, which led to several confrontations in January 1908 between a large number of citizens and the police. Court cases ensued against around two dozen locals, some of whom ended up serving hard labour in prison for up to six months. While the court cases and prison terms were ongoing, the local community rallied around the families of the prisoners, making sure their farms were worked and tilled. It was not until summer 1909 that a resolution came with the release of the last prisoners, to much local rejoicing by the parish as a whole. John C.

40|$|International audienceObjective. -To {{evaluate}} adherence of obstetricians {{from our}} maternity to French practice guidelines concerning information {{to give to}} pregnant patients {{with a history of}} scarred uterus. Materials and methods. -Observational retrospective study performed on medical files from June to August 2014 and concerning women with a scarred uterus that gave live-birth after 37 weeks of gestation. Information of patients had to concern the risks of a history of caesarean, the benefits and risks of the various delivery modes. Results. -On 758 deliveries, 77 cases were studied: 48 patients were followed up from the beginning of pregnancy, 23 from the 2 nd trimester and 6 were not followed. Among patients followed from the beginning, no data was written on medical file concerning information that should to be given in immediate post-partum, in preconception counseling, and at the beginning of pregnancy about the risks of scarred uterus and the mode of delivery. In the 8 th month, information about benefits and risks of the planned <b>delivery</b> mode was <b>noticed</b> in 45 % of files. Conclusion. -The information that need in theory to be given to the patients with scarred uterus appeared little or insufficiently noticed on medical files; which can be due either to an inaccurate information, or to a lack of transcription of the information nevertheless given. A check-list in obstetrical file would help to systematize the information to provide in scarred uterus patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|An {{innocent}} debtor, who {{is either}} ignorant of her {{constitutional right to}} the privilege against self-incrimination or ineffectual in asserting it, may find herself wrongfully convicted and imprisoned in a criminal matter, due to unwitting complicity {{in the delivery of}} testimony or documents in her bankruptcy case. This lack of understanding poses a serious risk to debtors, and especially affects the increasing number of pro se debtors in bankruptcy. The privilege extends to debtors in bankruptcy proceedings. However, a debtor who fails to properly invoke the privilege waives her rights. This possibility is made more probable because there is no requirement that she be told about the privilege prior to filing or interrogation. Without any requirement of notice, there is no application of the exclusionary rule in civil proceedings. In short, the privilege must be invoked through an unambiguous assertion in bankruptcy, or it is lost. For this reason, the Court, under its rulemaking authority, should adopt a revised Official Form B 201 A for use in consumer bankruptcy cases, to ensure the just determination of every case and protect the debtor’s privilege. The revised form would provide pre-filing notice, in writing, of the privilege against self-incrimination. To accomplish this, the Judicial Conference of the United States should promulgate the proposed form pursuant to its rulemaking authority. This form would serve to make the debtor aware of the privilege prior to filing and the consequences of invocation and waiver, so that the privilege would not be lost through ignorance, inadvertence, or lack of competent counsel. This article has four parts. Part I analyzes the scope and application of the privilege and distinguishes the privilege in bankruptcy from its counterpart in the custodial setting. Part II examines the increased risk to the pro se debtor and the value of the privilege both to the truly innocent who are seemingly guilty and the presumptively innocent regardless of guilt. Part III explores the plight of the debtor under current law and explains the risk of nondisclosure of the privilege. Finally, Part IV proposes a change in the language of Official Form B 201 A to alleviate the problems caused by nondisclosure. In short, the author’s thesis is that only through the pre-filing <b>delivery</b> of <b>notice</b> will the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s right to the privilege be meaningful...|$|R
40|$|A couple buys a couch. After <b>delivery,</b> they <b>notice</b> {{that the}} legs of the couch are not rectangular, like they ordered, but circular. After some angry calls and letters they {{introduce}} an action before the court to terminate the contract in order to get their money back. Against all expectations, the Belgian court of appeal of Ghent decides completely against the couple. According to the court, the couple disregarded the consumer sales rules in the Civil Code, implementing the EU Consumer Sales Directive. They did not respect the strict hierarchy of remedies which favors repair or replacement over termination and price reduction: the buyers should have sued for repair or replacement instead of trying to terminate the contract. Moreover, they transgressed the notification rules: they should have notified the seller about the shortcoming, before invoking a remedy. This case and many others, show that confusion reigns {{in the area of the}} organization of consumer sales remedies. The strict hierarchy of remedies imposed by the EU Consumer Sales Directive might be insufficiently protective for consumers. Moreover, after withdrawing the CESL -proposal, the EU Commission issued new projects, treating, among others, the contractual remedies in the e-commerce sector. Also in the US there is an on-going debate about the organization of remedies in contract law and the UCC. Over the last decades, many publications appeared about the irreparable injury-rule and adequacy-rule favoring damages over specific performance. It has drawn the attention of law & economics specialists, legal philosophers, and more recently the behaviorists have expressed their interest in the topic. At the same moment, academics are working on a restatement of US consumer contract law. The organization of remedies is a vivid topic, both in the US and EU. Nevertheless, a thorough cross-examination of the EU consumer sales law system (mainly based on the civil law tradition) and the US common law system is not sufficiently present in the current debate. Therefore, this paper will address this on the basis of in-depth comparative research. The paper firstly assesses the so-called 'hierarchy' of remedies that is prescribed by law. Another aspect that has an important impact on the aforementioned hierarchy of remedies are the different notification duties and their limitation periods. The last element that will be assessed and which greatly influences the hierarchy of remedies is the ability (or not) to invoke remedies extrajudicially. The main question is: what is the best possible organization of remedies to move forward to protect consumers? Answer to this question will be based on the principles of coherence of the legal system, legal certainty and the level of consumer protection. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|On 8 March 1920, the Syrian National Congress {{proclaimed the}} {{establishment}} of the Kingdom of Syria, with Faisal as king. This unilateral action was immediately rejected by the British and French. In the San Remo Conference, which was called by the Allied Powers in April 1920, the allocation of mandates in the Arab territories was finalized, with France given a mandate over Syria. France's allocation of Syria was, in turn, repudiated by Faisal and the Syrian National Congress. After months of instability and failure to make good on the promises Faisal had made to the French, General Gouraud gave an ultimatum to Faisal on 14 July 1920 demanding that he disband the Arab Army and submit to French authority by 20 July or face a French military invasion. On 18 July, Faisal and the entire cabinet, with the exception of War Minister Yusuf al-'Azma, agreed to the ultimatum and issued disbandment orders for the Arab Army units at Anjar, the Beirut–Damascus road and the hills of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains overlooking the Beqaa Valley. Two days later, Faisal informed the French liaison in Damascus of his acceptance of the ultimatum, but for unclear reasons, Faisal's notification did not reach Gouraud until 21 July. Sources suspicious of French intentions accused the French of intentionally delaying <b>delivery</b> of the <b>notice</b> to give Gouraud an official excuse for advancing on Damascus. However, there has been no evidence or indication of French sabotage. News of the disbandment and Faisal's submission led to riots in Damascus on 20 July and their suppression by Emir Zeid, which led to around 200 deaths. Al-'Azma, who staunchly opposed surrender, implored Faisal to allow him and the remnants of his army to confront the French.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{electricity distribution}} investments mean higher amounts of material deliveries. As the construction projects often have tight schedules, successful material deliveries are important. However, {{the supply chain}} that the deliveries go through is long and sometimes complex. These characteristics make the supply chain prone to phenomena called the bullwhip effect, which is caused by uncertainties in the information flow of the supply chain. Supply chain uncertainty can be decreased by sharing sufficient amount of high quality information to the different parties {{taking part in the}} supply chain. The information structure of Finnish distribution system operator Elenia’s supply chain is analysed in this thesis. The analyse is done by comparing good practices from literature to Elenia and using extended Event-driven process chains method. The findings from the analysis showed that the problems in present information flow are in transparency of the information, lack of automation in information flow control and timeliness of the information. To solve these issues three changes to the ICT-systems are proposed. The first proposed change is to introduce a supply chain portal. The portal acts as one place for transparent information for all material delivery related information such as orders, <b>deliveries</b> and dispatch <b>notices.</b> The information is available to all parties related to the supply chain. The portal also includes automation for missing information. The transparency and automatic queries for missing information decrease the uncertainty in both order management and supply chain management levels. The second proposed change is real-time and more informative metrics for the material supply chain. The real-time metering consists of supply chain wide metrics which create better understanding about the chain. The business intelligence system shares real-time data from multiple data sources inside Elenia, so that every decision can be based on the same real-time data. Business Intelligence system provides calculation and meaningful visualisations from the data. The third proposed system are the intelligent products. The intelligent products are a virtual identity to products and deliveries.

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Performance Management System (PMS) {{implementation}} in Maquassi Hills Local Municipality (MHLM) {{had been a}} problem for many years. The municipality failed to produce an annual report for three consecutive years (2006 / 2007, 2007 / 2008, 2008 / 2009) and therefore failed to account to the community on the usage of public funds. The Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 called upon all municipalities in the country to establish a PMS that correlates with resources and circumstances and which relates to the objectives in the Integrated Development Plan (IDP). Most municipalities, including MHLM, are underperforming in terms of service delivery because there are no effective and efficient tools such as PMS to enhance service delivery. PMS is a service delivery tool that will assist MHLM to improve its basic service delivery. It will also help MHLM to rectify the culture of non-performance or poor service <b>delivery</b> that is <b>noticed</b> amongst the personnel. The municipality will need workshops and induction to improve on the current status quo of non-performance. This research has identified a lack of experience and proper training among municipal officials at MHLM to implement a PMS. Because the MHLM staff and council are not competent to implement a PMS, staff are not being appraised; yet, bonuses are being paid to Article 57 managers. Performance management is not being implemented among all staff, and it is not being marketed in the community. The municipality needs to be educated and trained in the implementation of a proper PMS. Research shows that there is a gap among current staff in terms of performance management functions. Performance management refers to an ongoing process that includes setting and aligning goals, coaching and developing employees, providing feedback, formally evaluating performance, and linking performance to recognition and rewards. The lack of all these processes at MHLM prompted research on this matter. The objective of this study was therefore to assess whether a PMS {{can be used as a}} tool to enhance service delivery in MHLM. The primary objective was to investigate the challenges faced by MHLM regarding the effective application of PMS as a tool to enhance and accelerate basic service delivery. The research outcome indicates that PMS is non-functional in MHLM. It was also discovered that there is no link between IDP/PMS and service delivery. The study concludes by recommending that a balance scorecard (BSC) be implemented to improve PMS in MHLM. The BSC should be linked to the performance of all managers. Master...|$|R
