40|$|Beef {{production}} is performed in varying systems, {{with or without}} grazing, but the common goal is to obtain high-quality carcasses. Semi-natural grasslands are characterized by specific flora and fauna and they are dependent on grazing management to be maintained. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate factors influencing nature conservation, animal performance and meat quality in beef production using semi-natural grasslands in summer. In a first study, effects of breed and season on foraging behaviour and diet composition were studied in heifers grazing semi-natural grasslands. In two further studies, effects of feed intensity and length of rearing period on feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion and carcass traits were investigated. One of these studies included finishing dairy steers, which had grazed semi-natural grasslands in previous summer, and the other study included beef heifers, which were reared from weaning until slaughter including a grazing period on semi-natural grasslands. For the heifers also meat quality, as affected by feed intensity, slaughter age and suspension method, was studied. Foraging behaviour and diet composition were more influenced by season than by breed. Over the grazing period, the heifers decreased their levels of activity, but increased their time spent grazing. The grazing time composed of more eating jaw movements and fewer pauses as the grazing period progressed. Wet areas, dominated by Deschampsia cespitosa (tufted hairgrass), were consistently avoided for grazing, whereas browsing on Alnus glutinosa (alder) increased over the grazing period. Increased <b>indoor</b> <b>feed</b> intensities were accompanied by increased weight gains and improved feed conversions. In the steers, an intermediate length of finishing resulted in the best feed conversion. Carcass traits were more affected by length of rearing period than by feed intensity. A prolonged rearing period resulted in heavier and fatter carcasses with increased dressing percentages and improved conformation. Meat from pelvic suspended sides was tenderer than meat from sides suspended by Achilles tendon after 14 days of ageing. Production of quality-grade carcasses with tender meat can be combined with the management of semi-natural grasslands on the conditions of regular controls of animal weights, strategic grazing regimes and proper post-slaughter procedures...|$|R

Mathematical models for planning malaria eradication benefit from detailed representations of local mosquito populations, their natural dynamics and their response to campaign pressures. Methods A new model is presented for mosquito population dynamics, effects of weather, and impacts of multiple simultaneous interventions. This model is then embedded in a large-scale individual-based simulation and results for local elimination of malaria are discussed. Mosquito population behaviours, such as anthropophily and <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding,</b> are included to study their effect upon the efficacy of vector control-based elimination campaigns. Results Results for vector control tools, such as bed nets, indoor spraying, larval control and space spraying, both alone and in combination, are displayed for a single-location simulation with vector species and seasonality characteristic of central Tanzania, varying baseline transmission intensity and vector bionomics. The sensitivities to habitat type, anthropophily, <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding,</b> and baseline transmission intensity are explored.

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} using {{the results of}} 82 experiments (78 publications, 266 treatments) to investigate the importance of dietary C 18 fatty acids (FA) and feeding regime for milk C 18 FA profile and apparent recovery of selected FA relative to intake of these FA or their precursors. Feeding treatments based on lipid-supplemented diets were excluded. Feeding regimes were defined as grazing (including partial and full-time grazing, at dietary concentrate proportions from 0 to 44 % dry matter (DM)), forage-based <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding</b> (> 65 % forage of total DM intake, DMI) and concentrate-based <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding</b> (forage DMI ≤ 65 % of DMI). Linoleic acid (LA), α-linolenic acid (ALA) and total C 18 FA proportions in milk fat increased linearly with the respective dietary FA content in all feeding regimes tested. This effect was highest in the forage-based <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding.</b> Slopes were lowest for the grazing regimes, especially regarding ALA and {{the sum of all}} C 18 FA while the intercepts of the prediction equations of milk ALA and total C 18 FA proportions were highest for grazing regimes. This indicates that in grazing cows factors other than dietary FA contents determine the C 18 FA composition of the milk fat. At equal dietary LA contents, the type of feeding regime showed no significant effect on LA proportion in milk fat. Milk fat proportions of rumenic acid (RA) and vaccenic acid (VA) were positively related to the sum of dietary ALA and LA contents. Grazing regimes led to the strongest enrichment of RA and VA in milk fat. The apparent recovery of ALA, LA and total C 18 FA (secreted, % of intake), an estimate for transfer efficiency, decreased with increasing dietary content. This relationship followed a nonlinear decay function. When the dietary content of these FA exceeded a certain threshold (about 0. 2, 0. 8 and 2. 8 % of DM for ALA, LA and total C 18 FA, respectively) the recovery in milk remained constant at about 5, 10 and 82 % of the ingested ALA, LA and total C 18 FA, respectively. At dietary proportions below 0. 01 % ALA and 1. 5 % total C 18 FA of DM their apparent recovery in milk fat exceeded 100 %. In conclusion, a general inverse relationship between dietary C 18 FA and the corresponding apparent recovery in milk fat seems to exist. Within this frame, the impact of different types of feeding regimes to alter the eventual milk C 18 FA profile varies. Among them, grazing appears to provide the most variable properties...|$|E

40|$|Cows were {{assigned}} randomly to <b>indoor</b> silage <b>feeding</b> (with 2 h outdoor exercise) or part-time grazing treatment {{in two different}} experiments. One group was kept in confinement with ad libitum grass silage within each experiment. The other group had ad libitum grass silage indoors and they were put out on grass pasture during part of the 24 hour period, 12 hours (night, Experiment 1) and 6 hours (day, Experiment 2) in June, July and August. In Experiment 2, the concentrate (9 kg d- 1) was given at two crude protein levels: high crude protein [185 g kg- 1 dry matter (DM) ] and low crude protein (135 g kg- 1 DM). In Experiment 1, night-time grazing increased total DM intake and milk (3. 9 kg d- 1) production. There was interaction between month and forage feeding strategy, the difference in milk yield being smallest between treatments in June. In Experiment 2, day-time grazing had no significant main effect on milk production but there was significant interaction between month and forage feeding strategy showing 2. 5 kg d- 1 difference between treatments in July. High-protein concentrate tended to increase the milk yield more on the silage diet compared with the group grazing during daytime.. The differences in milk yield between the forage feeding treatments were mainly due to the higher dry matter intake and higher metabolizable energy content of the pasture grass compared with silage. The lower milk responses to concentrate crude protein in the cows grazing during daytime compared with the silage group indicate a high protein value of pasture grass. It is concluded that part-time grazing increases the milk yield and decreases the need for supplementary concentrate protein. ...|$|R

In experiment 1, 24 calves were reared in groups of 3 or individually in straw-bedded pens from age 1 to 7 wk. One-half of the calves in each treatment were provided with ad libitum cut perennial ryegrass herbage. Grass intakes and time spent eating grass were greater for grouped calves than for individual calves. Providing grass reduced concentrate intake of grouped calves and reduced the time that all calves, but particularly individual calves, spent eating straw bedding. Ruminating time was increased by offering grass to grouped calves compared with individual calves. Grass reduced the frequency of calves licking their buckets and their pen, vocalizing, and investigating their pen. Particularly for grouped calves provision of grass reduced all grooming. Group rearing reduced the frequency of calves licking their bucket, vocalizing, and investigating their pen, but {{had no effect on}} the frequency of pen licking.

The experiment lasted 230 d, with 1 to 120 d in milk (DIM) for <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding</b> (P 1), 120 to 200 DIM for mountain grazing (P 2), and 200 to 230 DIM for <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding</b> (P 3). Grass silage was fed according to appetite during <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding</b> periods. After an adjustment period (1 - 60 DIM) when the control diet {{was given to the}} goats, the animals were subdivided into 3 groups of 10 goats. Treatments (60 - 230 DIM) were (1) basal concentrate (control; no added fat); (2) control concentrate with 8 % (added on air-dry basis) hydrogenated palm oil enriched with palmitic acid (POFA); and (3) control concentrate with 8 % (added on air-dry basis) rapeseed oil (RSO). Individual energy balances based on energy intake and milk production were estimated on 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 200, and 230 DIM. At the same times, body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), body mass index, and body tissue stores using computed tomography were monitored. Silage intake was depressed by POFA throughout the experimental period. Reduced BW and body mass index were observed in the POFA and RSO groups, whereas no effect on BCS or body composition was observed throughout lactation. Generally, a minor decrease in BW was observed from 10 to 120 DIM (only 0. 6 kg on average) and the total amount of body lipid was reduced by 4. 4 kg. During the mountain grazing period, a further reduction in body lipid stores (2. 7 kg) was observed, and BW was reduced by 3. 9 kg in the same period. The goats mobilized, on average, 72 % of their fat reserves during the first 200 DIM. In this period, dietary fat supplementation did not reduce the mobilization of adipose tissue but resulted in greater milk fat yield (2 kg more, on average, compared with the control group). Milk yield was not affected by POFA or RSO supplementation. Milk fat content was higher in the POFA group than in the control and RSO groups. Milk protein and lactose contents were not affected by lipid supplements. In late lactation, a rapid accumulation of fat deposits followed the intense mobilization during the grazing period. Dietary lipid supplements had no effect on milk fat yield at this stage. Milk production depends heavily on the ability to mobilize body lipid stores, and neither POFA nor RSO supplements at rates used in our study affected this mobilization...|$|E

In a large study, sixty-four German Holstein and German Simmental bulls were randomly allocated to either an <b>indoor</b> concentrate <b>feeding</b> system or periods of pasture feeding following by a finishing period. During this period the animals got a concentrate containing linseed to improve the meat quality for the consumer and enhance the contents of beneficial fatty acids in beef. German Simmental bulls grew faster in both feeding groups (concentrate and grass-based) compared to German Holstein bulls. Because of that significantly more days of fattening were necessary to reach the slaughter weight of 620 kg. The feeding system did not affect the carcass weights of both breeds. The results of cutting according to the regulations of the Deutsche Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft (DLG-Schnittführung für die Zerlegung der Schlachtkörper von Rind, Kalb, Schwein und Schaf) showed diet effects for different cuts. Pasture feeding significantly decreased the weights of flank, flat ribs and brisket of both breeds.

Cows were equipped with collars for 96 h per measurementperiod. First 24 h were accounted as adaptation time; data of the subsequent 72 h were used for analysis. Data included ruminating, eating (min/day), rumination boli (n per day), chewing frequency and intensityduring ruminating (chews/min and chews/bolus), and activity changes (switching between ruminating,eating and idle; n per h). The constancy of parameters within cows across measurement days was testedwith linear regression models. A linear mixed-effects model was applied to estimate a regression onmeasured feed intake. Average feed intake per day across all measurements was 19. 7 kg dry matterper cow, average eating time was 389 min/day and ruminating time was 551 min/day. For most of thechewing behaviour variables, factor ‘cow’ was significant, while ‘day’ was not, indicating a between-animals variance but good consistency of the data within animal. After a stepwise backward procedure inthe mixed-effects model, the remaining significant variable was ‘chewing frequency’ (chews per minuteduring rumination).

Cows allowed grazing at pasture for 4 h moved more rapidly during pasture, moved longer distance per active hour and used a higher proportion of the time eating, both at pasture and indoor, than the cows allowed longer time at pasture. Limiting the grazing time had no influence on the urination (mean = 0. 26) and defecation (mean = 0. 37) frequency per cow per hour during pasture. Even though the proportion of time active (eating, drinking, standing or walking), and the actual time active during pasture was different for the treatments, the frequency of urination and defecation per active hour was also unaffected by the treatments. Urine and faeces were distributed in the pasture, without specific hot-spots. The estimated daily N-balance at animal level showed increased N excretion with time at pasture. Assuming that excretion follows the active periods during the day and 7000 kg DM foliage is available on yearly basis, this would result in total excretion at field level of 58, 86 and 108 kg N per ha respectively for treatment 4, 6. 5 and 9 h.

40|$|To compare quality {{traits of}} longissimus lumborum muscle of three genotypes, 20 White Mangalica (WM), 20 {{crossbred}} Duroc [*]×[*] White Mangalica (DWM) and 20 Large White (LW) pigs were allotted {{to the same}} <b>indoor</b> rearing and <b>feeding</b> conditions. Crossbred and LW pigs grew faster than WM pigs reaching 150  kg on average 168 and 288 days before WM, respectively. Meat from WM pigs had the highest intramuscular fat content and darkest and reddest colour; crosses were at an intermediate position, with significant differences among all genotypes. In addition, ultimate pH, water-holding capacity and iron content were significantly the highest in meat from WM pigs, {{compared to the other}} two genotypes. Crossing WM with Duroc had a significant effect on individual fatty acid content of meat. However, the sum of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids remained unchanged. WM and DWM pigs had significantly more tender meat than LW pigs. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were most abundant, followed by saturated (SFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in meat from all animals. Meat from WM and DWM pigs had a significantly higher percentage of MUFAs and significantly lower percentage of SFAs than LW pigs...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{understand}} the roles of miRNAs in the muscle tissue maturation and those of circulating microRNAs (c-miRNAs) in beef production of Japanese Black (JB) cattle (Wagyu), a breed with genetically background of superior intermuscular fat depot, by comparing different <b>feeding</b> conditions (<b>indoor</b> grain-feeding vs. grazing on pasture). The cattle at 18 months old were assigned to pasture <b>feeding</b> or conventional <b>indoor</b> grain <b>feeding</b> conditions for 5 months. Microarray analysis of c-miRNAs from the plasma extracellular vesicles led to the detection {{of a total of}} 202 bovine miRNAs in the plasma, including 15 miRNAs that differed between the feeding conditions. Validation of the microarray results by qPCR showed that the circulating miR- 10 b level in the grazing cattle was upregulated compared to that of the grain-fed cattle. In contrast, the levels of miR- 17 - 5 p, miR- 19 b, miR- 29 b, miR- 30 b- 5 p, miR- 98, miR- 142 - 5 p, miR- 301 a, miR- 374 b, miR- 425 - 5 p, and miR- 652 were lower in the grazing cattle than in the grain-fed cattle. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the predicted target genes of those c-miRNAs were enriched in gene ontology terms associated with blood vessel morphogenesis, plasma membrane, focal adhesion, endocytosis, collagen, ECM-receptor interaction, and phosphorylation. In the grazing cattle, the elevation of miR- 10 b expression in the plasma was coincident with its elevation in the longissimus lumborum (LL) muscle. Expression of bovine-specific miR- 2478, the most plasma-enriched miRNA, tended to be also upregulated in the muscle but not in the plasma. Furthermore, grazing caused the downregulated mRNA expression of predicted miR- 10 b and/or miR- 2478 target genes, such as DNAJB 2, PTEN, and SCD 1. Thus, the feeding system used for JB cattle affected the c-miRNAs that could be indicators of grain feeding. Among these, miR- 10 b expression was especially associated with feeding-induced changes and with the expression of the potential target genes responsible for glucose homeostasis and intramuscular fat depot in the LL muscle of JB cattle...|$|R
40|$|Continuous grazing is an {{appropriate}} pasture system for dairy cows in low input milk production systems like organic farming. If a dairy farm converts from <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding</b> based on preserved forages to a pasture-based system, cows will start grazing on cutting-managed meadows. In a three-year (2007 - 2009) field trial continuous grazing was compared to cutting management at the organic grassland and dairy farm of the AREC Raumberg-Gumpenstein. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the influence of grazing on botanical composition as well as biomass and quality yield. In this study, changes in the botanical composition were found. Typical pasture species like Lolium perenne and Poa pratensis dominated continuous grazing plots. Work under practical conditions showed no differences concerning common losses in yield between continuous grazing and the cutting regime established. Forage of continuous grazing showed a high energy density and provided the highest crude protein yield...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies show}} {{concentrations}} of nutritionally desirable fatty acids in bovine milk are lower when cows have {{no access to}} grazing, leading to seasonal fluctuations in milk quality if cows are housed for part of the year. This study investigated the potential to improve the fatty acid profiles of bovine milk by oilseed supplementation (rolled linseed and rapeseed) during a period of <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding</b> in both organic and conventional production systems. Both linseed and rapeseed increased the concentrations of total monounsaturated fatty acids, vaccenic acid, oleic acid and rumenic acid in milk, but decreased the concentration of the total and certain individual saturated fatty acids. Linseed resulted in greater changes than rapeseed, and also significantly increased the concentrations of a-linolenic acid, total polyunsaturated fatty acids and total omega- 3 fatty acids. The response to oilseed supplementation, with respect to increasing concentrations of vaccenic acid and omega- 3 fatty acids, appeared more efficient for organic compared with conventional diets...|$|E
40|$|Non-improved {{autochthonous}} sheep breeds for lamb-meat production are well-adapted {{to produce}} in harsh environments and are closely {{linked with the}} use of semi-natural and natural areas in less favoured areas. However, these sheep breeds and the traditional far-ming systems in these regions are experiencing an intensification process characterised, on the one hand, by a general selection criteria of increasing prolificacy and, on the other hand, by a significant reduction of grazing and augmentation of <b>indoor</b> <b>feeding</b> with external inputs, such as concentrates (Bernués et al., 2011). This is the case of the Spanish autochthonous sheep breed ‘Ojinegra de Teruel ’ (43 - 50 kg live weight, LW), where the use of concentrates to feed ewes has in-creased significantly, especially during the lactation period (Ripoll-Bosch et al., 2012). However, the current volatility and spikes in prices of commodities and inputs (Naylor & Falcon, 2010) further threaten the battered economic situation of many sheep-meat farms (Pardos & Fantova, 2009). In that sense, some authors Effect of concentrate supplementation and prolificacy on the productive and economic performance of autochthonous sheep breeds fed forage-based diet...|$|E
40|$|Changes {{affecting}} {{livestock farming}} systems have made farm work a central concern {{for both the}} sector and for farmers themselves. Increased pressure on farms to be competitive and productive together with farmers' demand for greater autonomy, holidays or time to spend on private activities and the family converge to underline the two key dimensions of work - productivity and flexibility - required {{for the assessment of}} work organization. This paper proposes a method called the QuaeWork (QUAlification and Evaluation of Work in livestock farms) to assess work productivity and flexibility on a farm, and its use to identify how livestock management can contribute to work organization on dairy farms. The QuaeWork method was set up through an iterative process combining surveys conducted with farmers in two regions of France, discussions with different experts and literature review. The QuaeWork was applied on a sample of seven dairy farms in the southern Massif Central in France to identify patterns of how livestock management contributes to work organization. The QuaeWork was used to analyse work organization over the year through a systemic approach to the farm, integrating interactions between herd and land management, workforce composition, equipment facilities and combinations of activities through a characterization of 'who does what, when and for how long'. The criteria for assessing work productivity were work duration (routine work, seasonal work) and work efficiency (per livestock unit or hectare of utilized agricultural area). The criteria for assessing work flexibility were room for manoeuvre and adjustments to internal and external events. The three main patterns of livestock management practices to work organization were identified. In pattern- 1, farmers used <b>indoor</b> stable <b>feeding</b> practices with delegated work, with moderate room for manoeuvre and efficiency. In pattern- 3, farmers used simplified milking, reproduction and breeding practices to seasonalize work and make it efficient with consistent room for manoeuvre. The method suggests social sustainability criteria to assess work productivity and flexibility, which are important for making reasoned decisions on livestock farm changes, especially innovations. Researchers could usefully exploit the QuaeWork to integrate work objectives (productivity, flexibility) into technical and economic goals...|$|R
