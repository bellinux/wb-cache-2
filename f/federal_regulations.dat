5|$|The HOS are issued, {{among other}} industry-related regulations, by the FMCSA. In this instance, <b>federal</b> <b>regulations</b> {{apply only to}} interstate commerce. Commerce which does not involve the {{crossing}} of state lines is considered intrastate, and is {{under the jurisdiction of}} the respective state's laws. However, most states have adopted intrastate regulations which are identical or very similar to the federal HOS regulations.|$|E

Under a new law, the California Fire Marshall will be required to review the oil pipelines conditions every year while <b>federal</b> <b>regulations</b> only mandate a review every five years. Another new law provides for making oil spill response times faster and more effective. Finally, a new law will force intrastate pipelines to use the best-known technology such as automatic shut-off valves.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} for appointment, candidates must also undergo a Candidate Fitness Assessment and a complete physical exam. Up to 60students from foreign countries are present at USMA, educated {{at the expense of}} the sponsoring nation, with tuition assistance based on the GNP of their country.

5|$|After the {{conviction}} for manslaughter in 1967 of the Christian Scientist mother of five-year-old Lisa Sheridan, who died without medical care in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the church lobbied the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) {{to add a}} religious exemption to the Code of <b>Federal</b> <b>Regulations.</b> Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent. States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding; {{the wording of the}} exemptions made clear that they referred to Christian Science.|$|E

5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use {{for any kind}} of advertising. Reproduction for corporate use was similarly prohibited and such infractions were classified as offenses against public property. The 2003 Code of <b>Federal</b> <b>Regulations</b> pertaining to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives prohibits the use of state seals or coats of arms in product branding so as not to mislead the public into thinking that a commercial product has been endorsed by a government organization.|$|E
5|$|Positive {{train control}} became a Federal mandate {{with the passing}} of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. After review, the FRA waiver was granted in May 2010, marking the first time lighter-weight EMUs were allowed to share rails with freight in the United States. The grant was {{conditioned}} on meeting nine additional requirements, including demonstrating minimum crashworthiness, seating, improving grade crossing, meeting FRA positive train control standards in Title 49 of the Code of <b>Federal</b> <b>Regulations,</b> part 236 with CBOSS, formalizing the temporal separation plan, and issuing a safety system program.|$|E
5|$|Several {{laws and}} {{specific}} regulations govern {{the management of}} free-roaming horses and burros on federal lands, both those managed by the BLM and those managed by the USFS. These include the Wild Horse Protection Act of 1959, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, as amended by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. The United States Code of <b>Federal</b> <b>Regulations</b> (CFR) addresses management of wild free-roaming horses and burros at 36 CFR 222 Subpart B.|$|E

5|$|Several {{private and}} public motor {{carriers}} such as Frito-Lay, United Parcel Service, and Werner Enterprises, have voluntarily implemented electronic on-board recorders to ensure drivers are {{in compliance with the}} <b>federal</b> <b>regulations,</b> to reduce the errors and hassles associated with paper log books, and to improve driver retention and recruitment. EOBRs automatically record the driving time and cannot be easily forged. Any violation of the HOS will automatically be recorded and reported to the company. The FMCSA is considering making EOBRs mandatory for all motor carriers.|$|E
5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified ahead of time as required by <b>federal</b> <b>regulations</b> regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under <b>Federal</b> <b>Regulations.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of Shelby's chief {{concerns}} was securing {{federal aid}} {{to defend the}} frontier. Although Kentuckians were engaged in an undeclared war with American Indians north of the Ohio River, Shelby had been ordered by Secretary of War Henry Knox not to conduct offensive military actions against the Indians. Furthermore, he was limited by <b>federal</b> <b>regulations</b> that restricted the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which was too short to be effective. With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack. Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by the British.|$|E
5|$|The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), a {{component}} of the USDA, provides the funds to the Puerto Rican government's Department of the Family to operate the program through an annual block grant, which covers the full cost of the benefits to participants, as well as fifty percent (50%) of the costs required to administer the program (the remaining 50% must be provided by the Puerto Rican government). Although <b>federal</b> <b>regulations</b> require Puerto Rico to pay the benefits during the year for which the annual block grant was awarded, since 2002 the federal government has allowed Puerto Rico to use 2% of an annual surplus for benefits in future years.|$|E
5|$|The United States Code Congressional and Administrative News (U.S.C.C.A.N.) is a West Group {{publication}} that collects selected congressional and administrative materials {{for publication in}} a single resource. U.S.C.C.A.N. {{was first published in}} 1941 with the 1st Session of the 77th Congress and has been published with every session of Congress since. U.S.C.C.A.N. is published in monthly pamphlets that contain a cumulative subject index and cumulative Table of Laws Enacted in addition to the selected documents. The pamphlets are then reissued in bound volumes after each session of Congress concludes. Among other documents, U.S.C.C.A.N. publishes the full text of new federal laws, selected committee reports from the House and Senate, signing statements, presidential proclamations, executive orders, reorganization plans, President's messages, <b>federal</b> <b>regulations,</b> proposed constitutional amendments, federal court rules, and sentencing guidelines all arranged in chronological order.|$|E

5|$|This section {{establishes}} the fact that, although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan, the individual federal grants are awarded for a specified time period, usually one year. <b>Federal</b> <b>regulations</b> prohibit {{the use of}} funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency, and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only. For example, a surplus from a federal award that starts on January 1, 2006 and ends on December 31, 2006 cannot be used after December 31, because its lifespan has terminated. This surplus must {{be returned to the}} federal agency unless otherwise authorized.|$|E
5|$|Transportation of {{hazardous}} materials {{for commercial purposes}} in the USA is regulated by Code of <b>Federal</b> <b>Regulations</b> Title 49 - Transportation, (abbreviated 49 CFR). A cylinder containing 200kPa (29.0psig/43.8psia) or greater at 20°C (68°F) of non-flammable, nonpoisonous compressed gas, and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as HAZMAT (hazardous materials) in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400psi) by several manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, <b>federal</b> <b>regulations</b> require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E
