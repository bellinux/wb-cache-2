5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its <b>fog</b> which occurs most often {{in the spring and}} early summer because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures. Argentia has 206 days of <b>fog</b> per year. <b>Fog</b> in Newfoundland is frequently accompanied by strong onshore winds; while usually winds disperse <b>fog,</b> here the <b>fog</b> is too widespread for this to occur.|$|E

The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by radioactive <b>fog.</b> Because the creatures that live inside the <b>fog</b> are unwilling to go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called <b>fog</b> condensers to turn the <b>fog</b> into liquid {{in order to protect}} its inhabitants.|$|E

40|$|All {{this time}} {{fumigation}} has been {{often used as}} the principal method of controlling DHF in some countries over half of this decade, but the results are not so satisfy, as shown {{by an increase in}} the incidence of dengue in the same time. This study aimed to evaluate focus <b>Fogging</b> usingThermalFog and ULVportable in dengue vector control. The method used is a quasi-experimental design with non-randomized control group pretest posttest design. Samples in this study are 25 houses in each application area of the whole house is in the application area. Analysis of data using different test Wilcoxon and Mc-Nemar. The results showed that {{there was no difference in}} HI, OI and the number of eggs between before <b>Fogging</b> with after 1 st <b>Fogging</b> and after 1 st <b>Fogging</b> with after 2 nd <b>Fogging</b> on both application (p value> 0. 05). On the application of ULVportable, p value before-after <b>Fogging</b> 1 : HI = 0. 063, OI = 0. 774, and the amount of eggs = 0. 649 while the p value after <b>Fogging</b> 1 -after <b>Fogging</b> 2 : HI = 1. 000, OI = 0. 289, and the amount of eggs = 0. 358, Then in ThermalFog, p value before-after <b>Fogging</b> 1 : HI = 0. 625, OI = 0. 267, and the amount of eggs = 0. 255 while the p value after <b>Fogging</b> 1 -after <b>Fogging</b> 2 : HI = 0. 500, OI = 0. 344, and the amount of eggs = 0. 683. The author suggested the city health office to further tighten supervision and evaluation of <b>Fogging</b> and to the public that rely more eradication of mosquito breeding plasce than <b>Fogging...</b>|$|R
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. Yes; I {{am going}} to live abroad again. The English climate doesn't suit me. My--heart is {{affected}} here, and that I don't like. I prefer living in the south. London is too full of <b>fogs</b> and--and serious people, Lord Windermere. Whether the <b>fogs</b> produce the serious people or whether the serious people produce the <b>fogs,</b> I don't know, but the whole thing rather gets on my nerves, and so I'm leaving this afternoon by the Club Train.|$|R

5|$|Due to the Bay Area's diverse topography, {{the result}} of the clashing tectonic plates, the region is home to {{numerous}} microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances. Within the city of San Francisco, natural and artificial topographical features direct the movement of wind and <b>fog,</b> resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks. Along the Golden Gate Strait, oceanic wind and <b>fog</b> from the Pacific Ocean are able to penetrate the mountain barriers inland into the Bay Area. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and <b>fog.</b> The microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time, when <b>fog</b> penetration is at its maximum in areas near the Golden Gate strait, while the South Bay and areas further inland are sunny and dry.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} <b>fog</b> rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense <b>fog,</b> and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cities of}} Glasgow and Edinburgh, in Scotland, {{suffered}} smoke-laden <b>fogs</b> in 1909.

40|$|Radiation <b>fogs</b> sampled at Los Angeles {{were found}} to possess low visibilities, high liquid water content (LWC), {{relatively}} small drops, narrow peaked drop-size distributions, and high concentrations of micron sized haze droplets. Typical characteristics of valley <b>fogs</b> observed at Elmira, N. Y., were low visibilities, moderately high LWC, low concentrations of haze droplets, and similar drop size distributions to those measured in Los Angeles. On the other hand, advection <b>fogs</b> observed in Vandenberg were characterized by less severe visibilities, low LWC, large drops in a broad drop-size distribution, and very low haze nucleus concentrations...|$|R

5|$|All air well designs {{incorporate}} a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that dew forms. Dew {{is a form}} of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from <b>fog,</b> in that <b>fog</b> is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E

Paet tells Edge {{he can find}} the Tower by deactivating an ancient machine, Mel-Kava, that obscures the Tower's location with <b>fog.</b> In exchange for destroying an imperial base, the leader of Zoah gives Edge access to an ancient artifact that grants a vision of Mel-Kava's location. Edge and the dragon destroy Mel-Kava, clearing the <b>fog,</b> but are attacked again by Azel and Atolm. They shoot down Atolm and rescue Azel as she falls.|$|E

5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention <b>fog,</b> a 1928 account says there was <b>fog.</b> Climatologists report no <b>fog</b> on that day in London.|$|E
