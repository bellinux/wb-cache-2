50|$|Spacers {{are usually}} {{used to put}} spaces in between teeth before braces are established. It can be {{agitating}} or painful, but patients are often warned not to pick at them or they will fall out. They are usually rubber, but sometimes they can be metal. They can be used when a patient's teeth are too close together. Although they are sometimes very painful, they are usually only in place for one to two weeks. Spacers can also cause toothache and <b>gum</b> <b>pain</b> because of the constant pressure against the patient's teeth. The gaps that the spacers create are necessary to apply certain appliances or braces. There are two common types of expanders used after the spaces have been made. One, very primitive, model is a metal bar that has a key used to tighten. Secondly, and more contemporary, there is an expander that is two 'L' shaped metal rods, attached at the molars. Brackets fit against the edges. It is secured with a spring in the middle that applies pressure.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{paradigm}} shift within orthodontics {{in the use of}} lingual fixed appliances compared with the use of labial fixed appliances on the basis of perceived benefits and acceptance by patients. A matched case-control prospective longitudinal study of adult patients treated in the Orthodontic Department, Prince Philip Dental Hospital, Hong Kong. Group A consisted of 30 patients treated with lingual orthodontic appliances. Group B consisted of 30 patients treated with labial orthodontic appliances. Data were collected at five different time points using questionnaire: pre-treatment; one week after the placement of the fixed appliance, and then at 1 -month, 3 -months, and 6 -months thereafter. The questionnaire consisted of 15 items, in which 11 items were rated on a visual analogue scale. Patients' experience of pain decreased over the study period (p 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} reported disturbance of sleep or analgesic consumption between the two groups (p > 0. 05).

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} the presence of nano-scale titanium dioxide (TiO 2) as an additive in human foodstuffs, but a practical protocol to isolate and separate nano-fractions from soluble foodstuffs {{as a source of}} material remains elusive. As such, we developed a method for separating the nano and submicron fractions found in commercial-grade TiO 2 (E 171) and E 171 extracted from soluble foodstuffs and pharmaceutical products (e. g., chewing <b>gum,</b> <b>pain</b> reliever, and allergy medicine). Primary particle analysis of commercial-grade E 171 indicated that 54 % of particles were nano-sized (i. e., < 100 nm). Isolation and primary particle analysis of five consumer goods intended to be ingested revealed differences in the percent of nano-sized particles from 32 %‒ 58 %. Separation and enrichment of nano- and submicron-sized particles from commercial-grade E 171 and E 171 isolated from foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals was accomplished using rate-zonal centrifugation. Commercial-grade E 171 was separated into nano- and submicron-enriched fractions consisting of a nano:submicron fraction of approximately 0. 45 : 1 and 3. 2 : 1, respectively. E 171 extracted from gum had nano:submicron fractions of 1. 4 : 1 and 0. 19 : 1 for nano- and submicron-enriched, respectively. We show a difference in particle adhesion to the cell surface, which was found to be dependent on particle size and epithelial orientation. Finally, we provide evidence that E 171 particles are not immediately cytotoxic to the Caco- 2 human intestinal epithelium model. These data suggest that this separation method is appropriate for studies interested in isolating the nano-sized particle fraction taken directly from consumer products, in order to study separately the effects of nano and submicron particles...|$|E
40|$|Background: Many {{symptoms}} {{had been}} associated with teething in children {{with the possibility of}} overlooking potentially fatal condition. Symptoms that had {{been associated with}} teething include diarrhoea, fever, vomiting and cough. The possibility that any of these symptoms could have been due to other causes call for thorough investigation of the child before concluding that it is only "teething". Objectives: The study was carried out to assess the beliefs of nursing mothers concerning symptoms that are associated with teething among children and to identify those that would seek medical treatments in case of their children having such symptoms during teething. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and ninety nursing mothers whose children had erupted at least a tooth were interviewed in the immunisation clinics of the University College Hospital and Adeoyo Maternity Teaching Hospital, both in Ibadan, Nigeria, on their beliefs and practice concerning teething in children. Results: One hundred and eighty-eight (64. 8 %) of the mothers associated symptoms such as fever, cough, catarrh and diarrhoea with eruption of teeth in their children. Over half of the women agreed that a child having either fever (51. 0 %), ear infection (57. 6 %) or cough (50. 3 %) should be promptly taken for medical consultation and not be tagged "teething", while for other symptoms such as <b>gum</b> <b>pain</b> (74. 5 %), sleepless night (56. 6 %), vomiting (51. 4 %) and diarrhoea (51. 7 %), over half of the mothers believed that the symptoms will resolve following the eruption of the teeth. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that mothers in the study attributes several symptoms to teething, which could be detrimental to the survival of their children as the symptom could have been due to other causes. There is, therefore, need for public enlightenment to create awareness on the possible effect of presumptuous belief that childhood diseases are due to teething process...|$|E

40|$|Millions {{of seniors}} are food {{insecure}} in the United States, meaning that scores {{do not have}} access to enough food at all times for an active, healthy life. What makes food insecurity an even more pressing issue is its association with a wide array of negative nutrition and health consequences. In earlier reports on food insecurity among seniors it was documented that food insecure seniors, even after controlling for other factors, were at higher risk of experiencing negative nutrition and health consequences than food secure seniors. In this report, we build on those earlier findings in three main directions. Namely, we add in several new health outcomes; we use four more years of data; and we examine how trends in health and nutrition outcomes among food secure and food insecure seniors have changed over the past decade. Using data from the 1999 - 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we considered the following outcomes related to nutrient intakes: energy intake, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B 6, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and iron.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Glycogen {{storage disease}} type Ib is an {{autosomal}} recessive transmitted disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by mutations in the glucose- 6 -phosphate translocase gene on chromosome 11 q 23 {{and leads to}} disturbed glycogenolysis as well as gluconeogenesis. Besides hepatomegaly, growth retardation, hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperuricemia and hyperlipidemia, patients suffer from neutropenia associated with functional defects predisposing for severe infections. In order to attenuate these complications, long-term treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is common but this is {{associated with an increased}} risk for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in patients with inherited bone marrow failures such as severe congenital neutropenia. Onset of these myeloid malignancies is linked to cytogenetic aberrations involving chromosome 7. In addition, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is known to stimulate proliferation of monosomy 7 cells in vitro. To our knowledge, we report {{for the first time a}} case report of a patient with glycogen storage disease type Ib, who developed acute myeloid leukemia with a classical monosomy 7 and acute myeloid leukemia-associated translocation t(3; 8) (q 26;q 24) after 14 years of continuous treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Case presentation A 28 -year-old Turkish man with glycogen storage disease type Ib was admitted to our department because of dyspnea and increasing fatigue. He also presented with <b>gum</b> bleeding, bone <b>pain</b> in his legs, night sweats, recurrent episodes of fever with temperatures up to 39 °C and hepatosplenomegaly. A blood count taken on the day of admission showed pancytopenia and a differential count displayed 30 % blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was taken which showed a hypercellular marrow with dysplastic features of all three cell lines, while blast count was 20 %. Classical cytogenetic analyses as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a monosomy 7 with a translocation t(3; 8) (q 26;q 24). Based on these findings, the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made. Conclusion Our observations suggest that bone marrow examinations including cytogenetic analysis should be carried out on a regular basis in patients with glycogen storage disease type Ib who are on long-term treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for severe neutropenia, since this treatment might also contribute to an increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. </p...|$|R
