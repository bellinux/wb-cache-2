This study aims to determine the prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in patients with <b>imperforated</b> <b>anus.</b> Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study on patients with <b>imperforated</b> <b>anus</b> referring to Booali hospital of Sari, IRAN from 1996 to 2003. Previous patients medical records was reviewed and physical examination and concurrently echocardiography were done for new patients. The data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis using SPSS software. Results: Ninty patients with <b>imperforated</b> <b>anus</b> were entered into the survey. Echocardiography revealed that 26 patients including 14 Female (57. 2 %) and 12 Male (42. 8 %) had CHD. 22 of CHD patients (84. 6 %) had imperforated anus(IA) of high type and 4 (15. 3 %) had IA of low type. CHD types consisted of : 7 patients (26. 9 %) ASD+PDA, 6 patients (23 %) ASD+PDA+TR, 4 patients (15. 3 %) PDA, 4 patients (15. 3 %) MR, 1 patient (3. 8 %) TF, 2 patients (7. 6 %) VSD and 2 patients (7. 6 %) ASD.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} {{the types of}} malformations resulting from the administration of retinoic acid (RA) to Swiss mice on different days of pregnancy. METHODS: Twenty-four pregnant Swiss mice were divided into 4 groups of 6 animals each. The experimental groups received a single intraperitoneal injection of RA (70 mg/kg) on gestational days 7, 8 and 9 (D 7, D 8 and D 9), while control animals (C) received only saline solution. RESULTS: Were obtained: exencephaly (C: 0; D 7 : 16. 1 %; D 8 : 25. 4 %; D 9 : 0), myelomeningocele (C: 0; D 7 : 25. 8 %, D 8 : 30. 9 %, D 9 : 0), spina bifida occulta (C: 0, D 7 : 29 %, D 8 : 41. 8 %, D 90), gastroschisis (C: 0, D 7 : 6. 4 % D 8 : 5. 4 %, D 9 : 0), omphalocele (C: 0, D 7 : 6. 4 %, D 8 : 14. 5 %, D 9 : 0), lower limb alterations (C: 0, D 7 : 74. 1 %, D 8 : 80 %, D 9 : 0), <b>imperforated</b> <b>anus</b> (C: 0, D 7 : 100 %, D 8 : 100 %, D 9 : 100 %), and tail agenesis/alteration (C: D 7 : 100 %, D 8 : 100 %, D 9 : 100 %). CONCLUSION: The experimental model using Swiss mice proved to be efficient in the induction of {{the different types of}} defects, with the eighth gestational day being the one that most favored the induction of neural tube defect, omphalocele, gastroschisis, lower limb defects, <b>imperforated</b> <b>anus</b> and tail agenesis/alteration.

40|$|Introduction Giant {{congenital}} right atrial aneurysm is a {{very rare}} congenital heart lesion, which may be asymptomatic or present a variety of symptoms, particularly supraventricular arrhythmias and intracardiac thrombosis formation. Case Presentation This is a report on a 3. 5 -month-old male infant with <b>imperforated</b> <b>anus</b> and an unusual-shaped congenital giant right atrial aneurysm with retro-ventricular extension. This unusual shape prevented appearance of cardiomegaly on the chest X-Ray. Surgical resection of the aneurysm was attempted. However, posterior descending coronary artery, which was embedded in {{the wall of the}} aneurysm, was irreversibly damaged during the operation. The patient died in the operation room. We concluded that pre-operative delineation of coronary arteries in cases with congenital giant right atrial aneurysm (CGRAA) with extension to the posterior left ventricle is mandatory. Despite the current data that surgical excision of the aneurysm is the treatment of choice, our case required simple closure of the aneurysmal neck from inside the right atrium to be an easier and safer surgical approach for treatment of CGRAA with a tricky anatomy. Conclusions This case indicates that delineation of coronary artery anatomy in atypical congenital giant right atrial aneurysm is of vital importance. Closure of the aneurysmal sac, instead of aneurysmal resection, is a safer and more simple approach in atypical cases...|$|R
