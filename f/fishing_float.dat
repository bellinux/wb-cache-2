2500|$|To {{discredit}} Chambliss's {{claims that}} Rowe had committed the bombing, prosecuting attorney William Baxley introduced two {{law enforcement officers}} to testify as to Chambliss's inconsistent claims of innocence. The first of these witnesses was a retired Birmingham police officer named Tom Cook, who testified on November 15 as to a conversation he had had with Chambliss in 1975. Cook testified that Chambliss had acknowledged his guilt regarding his 1963 arrest for possession of dynamite, but that he (Chambliss) was insistent he had given the dynamite to Rowe prior to the bombing. Following the testimony of Tom Cook, Baxley then introduced a police sergeant named Ernie Cantrell, who testified that Chambliss had visited his headquarters in 1976, where he had attempted to affix {{the blame for the}} 16th Street Baptist Church bombing upon an altogether different member of the Ku Klux Klan. Cantrell also stated that Chambliss had boasted of his knowledge of how to construct a [...] "drip-method bomb" [...] using a <b>fishing</b> <b>float</b> and leaking bucket of water. (Upon cross examination by defense attorney Art Hanes, Jr., Cantrell did concede that Chambliss had emphatically denied actually bombing the church.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the opening}} statements, the {{prosecution}} began presenting witnesses. Crucial testimony at Cherry's trial was delivered by his former wife, Willadean Brogdon, whom Cherry had married in 1970. Brogdon testified on May 16 that Cherry had boasted {{to her that}} he had been the individual who had planted the bomb beneath the steps to the church, then returned hours later to light the fuse upon the dynamite. Brogdon also testified that Cherry had informed her of his regret that children had died in the bombing, before adding of his contentment that they would never reproduce. Although the credibility of Brogdon's testimony was called into dispute at the trial, forensic experts did concede that, although her account of the planting of the bombing differed from that which had been discussed in the previous perpetrators' trials, Brogdon's recollection of Cherry's account of the planting and subsequent lighting of the bomb could explain why no conclusive remnants of a timing device were subsequently discovered after the bombing. (A <b>fishing</b> <b>float</b> attached to a section of wire which may have been part of a timing device was found 20 feet from the explosion crater following the bombing, although one of several vehicles heavily damaged in the explosion was found to have carried fishing tackle.) ...|$|E

50|$|A witch ball is {{a hollow}} sphere of colored glass {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} <b>fishing</b> <b>float.</b> Modern witches balls are decorative replicas. Some are {{made to look like}} Christmas tree baubles that contain a few thin fibers strung inside. Floating glass buoys became connected with witches during the witch hunts in England. In the late 17th century, suspected witches were tried by being tied up and thrown into water. If the water rejected them from a second baptism and they floated, then the suspects were confirmed as witches, under the rule of trial by water, and they were then hung by the neck until dead. In a like manner these heavy glass fishing floats, all tied up in a net, could not be made to sink. The water rejected them and they bobbed merrily upon its surface. Historically, witch's balls were hung in cottage windows in 17th and 18th century England to ward off evil spirits, witches, evil spells, ill fortune and bad spirits. Just as hanging a witch was believed to remove evil influences from a village, hanging a tried and tested witch's ball that had been floating in water, around a home, was believed to protect the home from similar ills. Usage has continued to a smaller extent in America up to the present day.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} the late 19th century, the natives of Lila, Bohol, began hunting whales in the Bohol Sea. By {{the turn of the}} century, this had spread to nearby Pamilacan Island and later to Sagay, Camiguin. At Pamilacan, whales were caught as early as January and as late as June, but most were taken in April and May. When a whale was spotted from shore, between 10 and 20 pump boats (boats with motors {{originally}} used for pumps) were launched in chase. When within range, a [...] "hookman" [...] jumped atop the whale's head and stabbed it with a 35-cm-long, 22.5-cm-wide stainless steel hook attached to a heavy line of 30 m with a 2 m bamboo spar buoy {{at the end of it}} - at Camiguin, they harpooned it with a toggle-headed grommet harpoon with a 2.5 m wooden shaft similar to the [...] "dolphin irons" [...] used by American whalemen in the mid-19th century, which in turn was either attached to a 140 m rope with a plastic <b>fishing</b> <b>float</b> or a 400 m rope with a plastic float or oil drum at the end. After an hour or more, the whale tired, and men took turns cutting it until it died. The boats usually towed the carcass to Lila for butchering, where it was sold and the meat eaten raw or cooked. Pamilacan hunters alone caught 10 to 20 per year, whereas at Camiguin, they caught them only sporadically.|$|E
40|$|A wooden <b>fishing</b> <b>float</b> under {{immersion}} {{in water for}} long periods is liable to absorb water, the quantity of water absorbed possibly being dependent upon the physical factors like the specific gravity and the inherent property of the material, the time of soaking and the pressure acting on it. Consequently a wooden float {{is likely to become}} heavy and loss its original buoyancy. However, when the float is removed from water and dried, the lost buoyancy is regained on complete drying. The present paper is an attempt to elucidate these two important characteristics of some of the chief wooden floating materials used on the West Coast of India...|$|E

40|$|During July and August of 2012 I {{traveled}} across Canada from Saskatchewan to Newfoundland {{and documented}} Canadians and {{their interactions with}} water. My topic was intentionally broad in scope because I didn’t want to shape my experience too much, I wanted to document what I saw of Canadians and water as I came across it. The results are a mixture of fortunate timing and casual conversation with people along the way. For example, I arrived at Fort St. Joseph on {{the southern tip of}} St. Joseph Island (the second largest island in Lake Huron) 200 years to the day of the first military action of the war of 1812. I did not plan that, but I was enthralled with the reenactments that included solders, metis and indigenous peoples along with an American frigate firing canons just off shore. 200 years ago to that day British, French Canadian voyageurs and First Nation warriors gathered together, crossed that part of lake Huron that currently separates Canada and the USA, and captured the American Fort Mackinac. Water and war. I took some photos there. I also photographed Canadians and; beaches, boats, canals, clams, ferries, <b>fishing,</b> <b>float</b> planes, mud sliding, rain, sailing, sandcastles and tidal bore rafting to name a few aquatic interactions. Now I plan on organizing the thousands of images taken and compiling them into something coherent and worth showing. With 2013 designated as the UN Year of Water Cooperation, I feel that the bulk of a Canadians and Water project documented this year would offer the opportunity to release a completed project in 2013. The scope of my project is intentionally broad encompassing many aspects of how Canadians interact with water, from work issues, to food issues, to recreation. I want to gather as much material as I can before I narrow down and select the aspects of water interactions that I’ll focus on. The goal is to create something with strong visuals that would entice a general audience to view and interact with and in doing so, learn a bit about water issues in Canada. Through the 70 ’s and early 80 ’s the government of Canada produced a series of Water Yearbooks that were very informative on water use in Canada, but rather dense and lacking in visual enticements to engage with the content. By creating a website with strong visuals or hopefully a publication highlighting Canadian’s enjoyment with water, I hope to reach a broad audience and to highlight some water issues that may not resonate currently with a general audience...|$|E
