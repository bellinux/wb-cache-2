40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} influencing the preferences of players within a Boolean game so that, if all players act rationally, certain desirable outcomes will result. The {{way in which we}} influence preferences is by overlaying games with <b>taxation</b> <b>schemes.</b> In a Boolean game, each player has unique control of a set of Boolean variables, and the choices available to the player correspond to the possible assignments that may be made to these variables. Each player also has a goal, represented by a Boolean formula, that they desire to see satisfied. Whether or not a player’s goal is satisfied will depend both on their own choices and on the choices of others, which gives Boolean games their strategic character. We extend this basic framework by introducing an external principal who is able to levy a <b>taxation</b> <b>scheme</b> on the game, which imposes a cost on every possible action that a player can choose. By designing a <b>taxation</b> <b>scheme</b> appropriately, it is possible to perturb the preferences of the players, so that they are incentivised to choose some equilibrium that would not otherwise be chosen.

40|$|Agents in a Boolean game have a {{personal}} goal represented as a propositional logic formula over a set of Boolean variables, where some of these variables are not necessarily held by the agent. The actions available to each agent are assumed to have some cost, and the agent’s secondary goal is to minimize its costs.

The proposed method transforms the Boolean game into an Asymmetric Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (ADCOP).

Finally, an experimental evaluation of the traffic light example confirms the applicability of the proposed search method and outlines some attributes of the game and the search process...|$|R
