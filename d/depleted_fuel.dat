He served as chief, training flight; chief, standardization and evaluation; and flight commander as well as chief weapon systems officer, wing standardization and evaluation, and executive officer, 28th Bomb Wing. During his service at Ellsworth, Goodfellow deployed with the 77th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron, 2nd Air Expeditionary Group to RAF Fairford in support of Operation Allied Force. During the first B-1 Bomber combat mission Goodfellow was serving as the offensive systems officer. After the attacking the first target of their mission, the bomb bay doors became stuck open. Goodfellow was able to clear the error causing the malfunction, but the doors still would not close. The crew decided to continue the mission to hit their second target due to its high priority, rather than returning to base for repairs. During the course of the mission the aircraft was targeted more than once by surface-to-air missiles, but was able to hit its second target and safely leave the area of operations. Despite being out of the combat zone, the mission still faced difficulties as the open bomb bay doors created excessive drag and <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> below the level required to return to RAF Fairford. Plotting the most efficient path back to the base coupled with coordinating in-flight refueling allowed the crew to bring the aircraft back to England.

40|$|Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp. (SWPC) {{is engaged}} in the {{development}} of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stationary power systems. SWPC has combined DOE Developmental funds with commercial customer funding to establish a record of successful SOFC field demonstration power systems of increasing size. SWPC will soon deploy the first unit of a newly developed 250 kWe Combined Heat Power System. It will generate electrical power at greater than 45 % electrical efficiency. The SWPC SOFC power systems are equipped to operate on lower number hydrocarbon fuels such as pipeline natural gas, which is desulfurized within the SOFC power system. Because the system operates with a relatively high electrical efficiency, the CO 2 emissions, {approx} 1. 0 lb CO 2 / kW-hr, are low. Within the SOFC module the desulfurized fuel is utilized electrochemically and oxidized below the temperature for NOx generation. Therefore the NOx and SOx emissions for the SOFC power generation system are near negligible. The byproducts of the power generation from hydrocarbon fuels that are released into the environment are CO 2 and water vapor. This forward looking DOE sponsored Vision 21 program is supporting the development of methods to capture and sequester the CO 2, resulting in a Zero Emission power generation system. To accomplish this, SWPC is developing a SOFC module design, to be demonstrated in operating hardware, that will maintain separation of the fuel cell anode gas, consisting of H 2, CO, H 2 O and CO 2, from the vitiated air. That anode gas, the <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> stream, containing less than 18 % (H 2 + CO), will be directed to an Oxygen Transport Membrane (OTM) Afterburner that is being developed by Praxair, Inc [...] The OTM is supplied air and the <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel.</b> The OTM will selectively transport oxygen across the membrane to oxidize the remaining H 2 and CO. The water vapor is then condensed from the totally 1. 5. DOC oxidized fuel stream exiting the afterburner, leaving only the CO 2 in gaseous form. That CO 2 can then be compressed and sequestered, resulting in a Zero Emission power generation system operating on hydrocarbon fuel that adds only water vapor to the environment. Praxair has been developing oxygen separation systems based on dense walled, mixed electronic, oxygen ion conducting ceramics for a number of years. The oxygen separation membranes find applications in syngas production, high purity oxygen production and gas purification. In the SOFC afterburner application the chemical potential difference between the high temperature SOFC <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> gas and the supplied air provides the driving force for oxygen transport. This permeated oxygen subsequently combusts the residual fuel in the SOFC exhaust. A number of experiments have been carried out in which simulated SOFC <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> gas compositions and air have been supplied to either side of single OTM tubes in laboratory-scale reactors. The ceramic tubes are sealed into high temperature metallic housings which precludes mixing of the simulated SOFC <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> and air streams. In early tests, although complete oxidation of the residual CO and H 2 in the simulated SOFC <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> was achieved, membrane performance degraded over time. The source of degradation was found to be contaminants in the simulated SOFC <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> stream. Following removal of the contaminants, stable membrane performance has subsequently been demonstrated. In an ongoing test, the dried afterburner exhaust composition {{has been found to be}} stable at 99. 2 % CO 2, 0. 4 % N 2 and 0. 6 %O 2 after 350 hours online. Discussion of these results is presented. A test of a longer, commercial demonstration size tube was performed in the SWPC test facility. A similar contamination of the simulated SOFC <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> stream occurred and the performance degraded over time. A second test is being prepared. Siemens Westinghouse and Praxair are collaborating on the preliminary design of an OTM equipped Afterburner demonstration unit. The intent is to test the afterburner in conjunction with a reduced size SOFC test module that has the anode gas separation features incorporated into the hardware...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{majority}} of area {{burned in the}} Eastern United States (EUS) results from {{a limited number of}} exceptionally large wildfires. Relationships between climatic conditions and the occurrence of very large-fires (VLF) in the EUS were examined using composite and climate-niche analyses that consider atmospheric factors across inter-annual, sub-seasonal and synoptic temporal scales. While most large-fires in the EUS coincided with below normal fuel moisture and elevated fire weather, VLF preferentially occurred during a long-term drought accompanied by more acute sub-seasonal drought realized through fuel moisture stress and elevated fire-weather conditions. These results were corroborated across the EUS, with varying influences of drought, fire danger and fire weather discriminating VLF from other large fires across different geographical regions. We also show that the probability of VLF conditioned by fire occurrence increases when long-term drought, <b>depleted</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture and elevated fire weather align. This framework illustrates the compounding role of different timescales in VLF occurrence and serves as a basis for improving VLF predictions with seasonal climate forecasts and climate change scenarios.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{critical}} loads {{may have a}} natural extension {{to the effect of}} orbital debris on space critical infrastructure. As the debris spatial density in an orbit increases, the target load with safety factor threshold would eventually be exceeded (Fig.Â  8). Satellite operators may begin to notice effects beyond this threshold with the risk of operational problems increasing. Beyond the critical load threshold in that orbit, the debilitating effects on space assets would become more pronounced. Increasingly frequent debris impacts would degrade operations or shorten mission life, catastrophic collisions could end missions, and an increased number of expensive collision avoidance maneuvers would need to be executed by operational spacecraft. Such maneuvers shorten mission life by <b>depleting</b> <b>fuel</b> reserves. Only the lowest orbits in LEO, below approximately 600 Â km, have a degree of resiliency and sustainability due to the cleansing effect of atmospheric drag and solar cycles. Resiliency of an orbit could potentially be defined as the availability of atmospheric and gravitational forces to cause debris to reenter the atmosphere in a reasonable amount of time (a few days to a few years). Unfortunately, the concept of resiliency is essentially nonexistent in higher orbits, making the accumulation of debris in these orbits problematic and reducing their sustainability.|$|R
