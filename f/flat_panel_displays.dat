25|$|Electronic {{paper and}} e-paper are display devices that mimic the {{appearance}} of ordinary ink on paper. Unlike conventional backlit <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> <b>displays</b> that emit light, electronic paper displays reflect light like paper.

The contrast ratio in electronic displays available as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly (2008) developed displays are slightly better. An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight without the image appearing to fade.|$|E

2500|$|Computer {{displays}} {{where the}} positions of individual pixels are permanently fixed such as most modern <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> <b>displays</b> can show saw-tooth edges when displaying small, high-contrast graphic elements, such as text. ClearType uses spatial anti-aliasing at the subpixel level to reduce visible artifacts on such displays when text is rendered, making the text appear [...] "smoother" [...] and less jagged. ClearType also uses very heavy font hinting to force the font {{to fit into the}} pixel grid. This increases edge contrast and readability of small fonts at the expense of font rendering fidelity and has been criticized by graphic designers for making different fonts look similar.|$|E

Polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid conductive polymer electrolytes are becoming increasingly important, especially in devices with a flat design, such as tablet PCs and <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> <b>displays.</b> Electrolytic capacitors with hybrid electrolytes are relatively new on the market. With their hybrid electrolyte system they combine the improved conductivity of the polymer with the advantage of liquid electrolytes for better self-healing property of the oxide layer, so that the capacitors have the advantages of both low ESR and low leakage current.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube used {{particularly}} for display purposes. Although {{there are still many}} televisions and computer monitors using {{cathode ray tube}}s, they are rapidly being replaced by <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> <b>displays</b> whose quality has greatly improved even as their prices drop. This is also true of digital oscilloscopes (based on internal computers and analog to digital converters), although [...] traditional analog scopes (dependent upon CRTs) continue to be produced, are economical, and preferred by many technicians. At one time many radios used [...] "magic eye tubes", a specialized sort of CRT used in place of a meter movement to indicate signal strength, or input level in a tape recorder. A modern indicator device, the vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) is also a sort of cathode ray tube.|$|E

However, since 2015 there has been a significant comeback for old crt sets (similar to the vinyl comeback) with sales of refurbished and used sets steadily increasing {{over the past couple of}} years. One cause of the small comeback is mostly due to the gaming market with gamers preferring crts due to their response time.|$|E
