50|$|The {{fruit is}} a slender samara 1.5-2.5 cm long, the seed 2 mm broad and the wing 4-5 mm broad, <b>green</b> <b>ripening</b> brown.|$|E
50|$|Wall pennywort {{grows to}} an average of 25 cm high. The pallid spikes of bell-shaped, greenish-pink flowers of this plant first appear in May, and the <b>green</b> fruits <b>ripen</b> through the summer.|$|R
50|$|Leaves stay <b>green</b> {{and fruits}} <b>ripen</b> in early autumn in Eastern Australia.|$|R
5|$|In midsummer the strigs of <b>green</b> fruit <b>ripen</b> to edible berries, {{very dark}} purple in colour, almost black, with glossy skins and {{persistent}} calyxes at the apex, each containing many seeds. An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of fruit each year.|$|R
50|$|The cones are ovoid, 5-9 cm long, <b>green</b> <b>ripening</b> brown, opening when mature {{in spring}} to 5-6 cm broad. The seeds are winged, 5-6 mm long with a 1.5-2.5 cm wing. Pollination is in late spring, with the cones {{maturing}} 20-22 months after.|$|E
50|$|Mastixia eugenioides grows as a tree {{measuring}} up to 30 m {{tall with}} a trunk diameter {{of up to}} 30 cm. The smooth bark is greyish to yellowish brown. The ovoid to oblong fruits are <b>green,</b> <b>ripening</b> purple, and measure up to 2.5 cm long.|$|E

50|$|Strychnos spinosa (Kankoroba) is a tree {{indigenous}} to tropical and subtropical Africa. It produces juicy, sweet-sour, yellow fruits, containing numerous hard brown seeds. Greenish-white flowers grow in dense heads {{at the ends}} of branches (Sep-Feb/Spring - summer). The fruits tend to appear only after good rains. It is related to the deadly Strychnos nux-vomica, which contains strychnine. The smooth, hard fruit are large and <b>green,</b> <b>ripen</b> to yellow colour. Inside the fruit are tightly packed seeds, which may be toxic, surrounded by a fleshy, edible covering.Animals such as baboon, monkeys, bushpig, nyala and eland eat the fruit. The leaves are a popular food source for browsers such as duiker, kudu, impala, steenbok, nyala and elephant. It is believed that various insects pollinate the flowers.|$|R

5000|$|Citrus hystrix is a thorny bush, 6 to 35 ft tall, with {{aromatic}} and distinctively shaped [...] "double" [...] leaves. These hourglass-shaped leaves {{comprise the}} leaf blade plus a flattened, leaf-like stalk (or petiole). The fruit is rough and <b>green,</b> and <b>ripens</b> to yellow; it is distinguished by its bumpy exterior and its small size, approximately 4 cm wide.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of pectin methyl (PE) and endopolygalacturonase (PG) was studied in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) fruit. Antidbodies {{were raised in}} rabbits to the PE 2 isoform of PE and the PG 2 isoform of PG. The antisera were used to probe PE and PG in sections of mature <b>green</b> and <b>ripening</b> tomato pericarp tissue by immunocytology. PE was detected in the cell wall of <b>green</b> and <b>ripening</b> fruit. A comparison with specific and non-specific sera indicated that the PE antigen was largely confined to the cell wall. PG was detected in the cell wall of <b>ripening</b> but not <b>green</b> tissue. Gold label was observed over both the primary wall and the middle lamella and also over the cytoplasm. In the wall region, no distinctions could be drawn between the distributions of PE and PG, but PG differed from PE in that {{a significant proportion of}} the antigen was in the cytoplasm...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{characterisation}} {{of banana}} fruits. Abstract – – Introduction. This protocol aims at measuring the mechanical characteristics of bananas, especially peel and fruit hardness, and pulp firmness; {{it can also}} allow the mechani-cal characterisation of <b>green</b> or <b>ripening</b> fruit of different pedo-climatic origins and/or varie-ties. Materials and methods. This part describes the required laboratory materials and the three steps necessary for the measurement of the mechanical characteristics of bananas...|$|R
50|$|Tonto {{is made by}} <b>ripening</b> <b>green</b> bananas in a pit {{for several}} days. The juice is then extracted, filtered, and diluted before being mixed with ground and roasted sorghum. This mixture is {{fermented}} for two to four days.|$|R
50|$|They allow many fruits to {{be picked}} prior to full ripening, which is useful, since ripened fruits do not ship well. For example, bananas are picked when <b>green</b> and artificially <b>ripened</b> after {{shipment}} by being gassed with ethylene.|$|R
50|$|The {{needle-like}} {{leaves are}} shiny grey-green, 10-17 cm long and 1.5 mm broad, usually in pairs but occasionally in threes at {{the tips of}} strong shoots on young trees. The cones are <b>green,</b> <b>ripening</b> brown about 20 months after pollination, broad ovoid, 4-6 cm long, with broad scales, each scale with a small prickle. The seeds are 6-7 mm long with a 15-20 mm wing, and are wind-dispersed.|$|E
50|$|The seed cones are berry-like, <b>green</b> <b>ripening</b> in 18 {{months to}} purple-brown; they are spherical, 8-9 mm diameter, and {{have three or}} six fused scales {{in one or two}} whorls of three; the three larger scales each bear a single seed. The seeds are {{dispersed}} when birds eat the cones, digesting the fleshy scales and passing the hard seeds in their droppings. The pollen cones are yellow, 5 mm long.|$|E
50|$|Ficus religiosa {{is a large}} dry season-deciduous or semi-evergreen tree up to 30 m {{tall and}} with a trunk {{diameter}} of up to 3 m.

The fruits are small figs 1 - 1.5 cm in diameter, <b>green</b> <b>ripening</b> to purple.|$|E
40|$|UMR AGAP - équipe DAAV (Diversité, {{adaptation}} et amélioration de la vigne) High throughput transcriptomic studies (microarray, RNA-seq) {{are powerful}} tools to decipher changes in gene expression during fruit development and to target candidate genes {{involved in the}} plant response to environmental stresses. However, the rapid RNA turnover rate constitutes a major drawback in transcriptomic studies upon introducing sensitivity to environmental and trophic changes within one day. Thus, their precision and reproducibility highly depends on the sampling protocol. The present study aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that fast transcriptomic changes induced by heat stress may vary during the day in microvine berries. Berry development was characterized with whole genome microarrays on microvine plants grown under fully controlledenvironment. Developmentally regulated transcripts could be clustered the same way independently at day and night with 20 % more transcripts identified during the night. Strikingly day-night regulation varies to a high extent between <b>green</b> and <b>ripening</b> berries. Interestingly, an important shift in the day-night regulation of secondary metabolism was observed from <b>green</b> to <b>ripening</b> berries. For the first time, the present study revealed important circadian mechanisms related to secondary metabolism changing throughout fleshy fruit developmen...|$|R
5000|$|... center The new leaf is green, a {{wonderful}} amalgam of aesthetic and spiritual beauty. It is encircled by blue on its right, yellow on its left, violet and red within its {{eastern and western}} ends. The green dynamic mind works {{a wonderful}} synthesis between the finite and the infinite, {{the east and the}} west, reminiscences and reckoning … we have look forward to the day when this <b>green</b> <b>ripen</b> to red, the buoyant vibrancy to a full-blooded vigour. This, however, can only occur if we discover our own selves and dedicate them to sublimation. Worshipping the alabaster image of the Goddess of Learning, be it of East of West, is not our cult. Instead we are solemnly placing an earthen pitcher in our temple and planting a budding green leaf in it. Unlike traditional temples, dark and dingy, ours will be a tall and stately structure, allowing profuse air and light to enter from all corners of the globe. Thus the green will flower into its fullness. Above all, people, irrespective of caste, creed and colour, will have easy access to our temple. But there will be no corner for dry leaves.
