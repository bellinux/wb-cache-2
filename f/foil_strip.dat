50|$|The {{process for}} making the {{americium}} used in the buttons on ionization-type smoke detectors begins with americium dioxide. The AmO2 is thoroughly mixed with gold, shaped into a briquette, and fused by pressure and heat at over 1470°F (800°C). A backing of silver and a front covering of gold (or an alloy of gold or palladium) are applied to the briquette and sealed by hot forging. The briquette is then processed through several stages of cold rolling to achieve the desired thickness and levels of radiation emission. The final thickness is about 0.008 inches (0.2 mm), with the gold cover representing about {{one percent of the}} thickness. The resulting <b>foil</b> <b>strip,</b> which is about 0.8 inches (20 mm) wide, is cut into sections 39 inches (1 meter) long.

5000|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} (FDR) was an antiquated analog model which used a metal <b>foil</b> <b>strip</b> scratched by moving pins. The FDR did not record vertical acceleration readings and misrecorded heading indications. The needle recorded some lines twice, initially confusing the investigators, leading the team to send the FDR to the American company which manufactured it. The manufacturer asked an ex-employee, the highest expert regarding the company's {{flight data recorder}}s, to temporarily leave retirement to examine the FDR. The expert concluded that the needle {{supposed to have been}} recording the altitude had been shaking so much that it left other stray marks on the foil. The particular FDR was able to record for hundreds of hours; further investigations found that the needle had been shaking abnormally for months. This told investigators that another component, not just the APU with the broken mount, had also been vibrating. The investigators charted the vibrations and found that two months before the crash, the vibrations stopped for two weeks, since during that period the aircraft received a major overhaul in Canada by the airline's previous owner. Afterward, the vibrations increased up to the accident flight. During the Canadian company's test flights of the aircraft and its first several passenger flights for Partnair, the FDR recorded almost no abnormal vibrations. A review of the maintenance records of the aircraft revealed that during the overhaul, the mechanic discovered wear on one of the four bolts and pins that held the vertical fin and fuselage together and replaced the ones that were worn. The vibrations stopped after the bolt and pin were replaced.|$|E

The polarization radiation was observed at 4. 2 o from the 200 MeV electron beam and at 5 o from the 6. 2 MeV electron beam. Two methods of measurement of ROPR maxima in these two cases have been used.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to develop and test {{techniques}} for the computational optimization of hydrofoil sections and lifting surfaces advancing under a free surface. A mathematical model was developed based on the extension of a two-dimensional potential flow solution to account for three dimensional effects. Prandtl's lifting line theory was used to account for induced drag and downwash {{at the leading edge}} of the <b>foil.</b> <b>Strip</b> theory was used to extend the two-dimensional wave drag solutions to three dimensions for high aspect ratio foils. A semi-empirical correction was added to account for viscous drag. The drag-to-lift ratio of foil sections and lifting surfaces were optimized using first order gradient techniques. Optimization studies involving submerged foil sections suggest that trading buoyancy for a reduction in wave drag will lead to optimal geometries. Difficulties encountered resulting from the adoption of a potential flow model were identified and discussed. The lifting surface optimization {{was carried out}} using the coefficients of Glauert's circulation series as design variables. At high speeds it was shown that non-elliptical loading can produce reductions in the drag-to-lift ratio of a lifting surface. Induced drag dominated the low-speed optimization, and elliptical loading was shown to be optimal at the low end of expected operating speeds of a hydrofoil vessel. An adjoint formulation for the problem of optimizing the shape of a lifting section under a free surface was derived for use in future research. by Gregory Michael Tozzi. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Heating of the {{transmission}} foil separating the vacuum diodes from the laser cell in electron-beam-pumped gas lasers due to electron beam attenuation necessitates an active cooling scheme to prevent its failure under repetitively pulsed operating conditions. Attenuation {{of the electron}} beam (typically 500 kV, 100 kA and 100 ns) produces a strong and pulsed volumetric heat source in the relatively thin (~ 25 μm thick) stainless-steel foil causing it to fail. An experimental and numerical investigation has been conducted to study the cooling effectiveness of high-speed near-wall jets for a single stainless-steel <b>foil</b> <b>strip</b> simulating the geometry between two hibachi ribs in the Electra KrF gas laser developed by the Naval Research Laboratory. The foil is placed inside a channel with continuous gas flow simulating the circulating laser gas. Detailed studies include two jet types (planar and circular) and two injection methods (parallel and impinging) for two designs of hibachi (flat and scalloped). The planar jet flows parallel to the circulating laser gas along the entire foil span. The other configuration uses small diameter (0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 6 mm) circular jets positioned in two staggered rows located on the foil's two edges along {{the height of the}} foil (~ 30 cm). The jets are issued obliquely towards the foil. For both jet configurations, experiments are conducted at different jet velocities, impingement angles and jet-foil spacing to identify the optimal parameters {{to be used in the}} actual hibachi foil cooling. Experimental results are also compared to the predictions from CFD simulations using FLUENT®. The results of this research show that near-wall impinging circular jets can effectively cool the foil separating the vacuum diodes from the laser cell in an electron beam pumped KrF laser under prototypical pulsed (5 Hz) operating conditions, thereby assuring the foil's survival, while minimizing the impact on electron beam quality and laser efficiency.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) encompasses different technologies, including material extrusion 3 D printing, {{a technology}} {{commonly referred to}} as fused deposition modeling (FDM), which is the focus of the work described in this manuscript. Additive manufacturing is a growing technology with many applications in numerous fields from the air force to medical offices. FDM is a process that uses thermoplastics, in this case polycarbonate (PC), where the PC is heated and selectively dispensed in a layer-by-layer process to create a 3 D printed part. Currently, FDM systems have advantages over subtractive manufacturing or machining because cavities and other components (e. g., microchips, valves, and actuators) can be inserted at any layer. ^ The FA tool was designed and implemented as an automated tool for applying copper foil onto the surface of a printed substrate. The copper foil was then machined using the CNC to create patterns. Copper foils were patterned for dissipating heat, but other potential patterns include circuits, ground planes or an electrical connection between layers, just to name a few. The FA tool included the capabilities of varying the feed rate of the dispensed copper foil, handling different copper gauge thicknesses and widths not to exceed 25. 4 mm (1 inch). The ultimate goal of these efforts was to incorporate the FA tool into the Multi 3 D Manufacturing System where a new generation of HM processes would be executed by one machine. The results of these new HM processes will ultimately culminate in the fabrication of complex parts with electrical capabilities through the embedding of copper foil. In previous work, electronic components in a 3 D printed part were manually added after pausing and removing the substrate from the printer. The manual intervention proved to introduce registration errors and was deemed to be labor-intensive and tedious. The goal of the FA tool was to create a HM system that would eliminate human interaction in the building process; therefore creating a fully automated system to mitigate registration errors and tedious operations. The result would be a completed complex print with electronic capabilities with the unique capabilities of a 3 D printer. ^ Upon completion of the FA tool, experiments were done; those of which resulted in multiple findings. First, the FA tool applied the foil to a designated position within 8 % of the specified location. Also, the addition of embedded foil decreased the flexural extension of the PC part with the increase of width of the foil. With the addition of 12. 7 mm copper foil the percent decrease of the flexural extension compared to the samples without foil was 19 % and 42 % for the 25. 4 mm foil. Tests were done to determine how straight a copper strip could be applied along a 76. 2 mm (3 inches) length. The length was user-designated and was not chosen for specific reasons. It was important to test how straight the copper <b>foil</b> <b>strip</b> was applied because different applications of the copper foil could require straight strips. Foil applications such as ground planes for antennas require specific location and dimensions of the copper for accuracy on electromagnetic response data. The copper showed a maximum horizontal displacement of 0. 4 mm on either side along its length of 76. 2 mm. Lastly, one, two and three copper foil strips were applied to three separate parts along three faces of a PC block. One of the exposed sides of the copper was positioned onto a heating plate. Thermocouples were evenly placed across three faces of the part to determine the temperature distribution across the PC part. There was a decrease of change in temperature across the copper foil with an increase of copper foil surface area. The percent difference between the part with no foil and one <b>foil</b> <b>strip</b> was a 26. 3 percent increase. The percent increase from one foil to three foils was 37. 5 %. ^ At the conclusion of the testing of the FA tool, the produced results exhibited that the FA tool could apply copper foil under a ten percent error. Electronic components, structural purposes and thermal dissipation are all within the capabilities of the FA tool in the Multi 3 D Manufacturing System. Foil embedding through the application of foil application with the FA tool has proven to be an automated process with multiple purposes. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|E
40|$|Cryopreservation {{complements}} classical conservation methods, {{which are}} {{carried out in the}} field or in vitro. It involves the storage of biological material in liquid nitrogen (- 196 °C). At this temperature all chemical and physical processes are stopped, allowing a safe storage over an unlimited period of time. The aim of our work is to understand the effects of pretreatments, by increasing the osmotic pressure of the medium, on the cryopreservation ability of potato shoot tips and more specifically to try to evaluate the effects of such pretreatments on the metabolism of potato. Indeed, drought acclimation is known to improve recovery after cryopreservation in potato and other species In vitro Désirée potato shoots were precultured for 21 days on regular MS and MS complemented with 0. 055 M, 0. 11 M, and 0. 22 M sorbitol. Directly after pre-treatment, leaf and shoot tip samples were taken and stored at 80 °C for proteomic and carbohydrate analyses. In addition, cryopreservation was carried on the precultured shoot-tips. For the cryopreservation, potato shoot tips were cut from pre-treated plants and incubated in a high osmotic Loading Solution. Afterwards, shoot tips were placed on an aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>strip</b> in droplets of Plant Vitrification Solution 2 and plunged into liquid nitrogen (Agrawal, 2004). Thawing was done in a highly osmotic Recovery Solution at room temperature, to prevent osmotic shock. After cryopreservation, shoot tips were transferred into the dark for 1 week (Panis, 2005). During the initial days of post-culture, shoot tips were maintained on MS media containing 0. 3 M sucrose. Afterwards, regular MS media were used. After 30 days, recovery was calculated as the percentage of shoot-tips forming new shoot. Proteins from shoot tip and leaf samples were extracted, using a TCA/Acetone ex-traction method. After quantification, 40 mg protein was labelled using three different fluorescent dyes (Cy 2, Cy 3 and Cy 5). In this way, 2 samples and an internal standard - containing a mix of all the samples - was loaded on the same IEF strip (pI 4 - 7). Isoelectric focusing was carried out using the GE Healthcare Ettan IPGphor. The second dimension was run in a GE Healthcare Ettan Dalt Six electrophoresis system. Gels were scanned using the Typhoon 9400 scanner and subsequently analysed with the GE Healthcare DeCyder program and EDA module. As such, differences in protein expression could be quantified and differentially expressed spots picked by the GE Healthcare Ettan Spot Handling Workstation (Renaut, 2006). In a following step, spots were digested, using Trypsin and spotted on a MALDI plate. Protein identification was done, using the Applied Biosystems MALDI 4800 TOF/TOF analyzer. For the analysis of carbohydrates and polyols, roughly 100 mg leaf samples was used for carbohydrate and polyol extractions. The following carbohydrates and polyos were measured: sucrose, glucose, fructose, galactose, stachyose, arabinose, melibiose, maltose, trehalose, inositol, mannitol, galactinol and sorbitol. Carbohydrates were analyzed on a Dionex HPLC ICS 2500 -Bio LC, using a Carbopac PA- 20 column. HPAEC-PAD analyses for polyols was conducted on a Dionex DX- 500 chromatograph, using a Dionex Car-bopac MA 1 column. Recovery rates without sorbitol were around 50 % but increased with increasing concentration of sorbitol pre-treatment up to a recovery rate up to 80 %. For 2 D-DIGE proteomics, preliminary analysis of the gels showed differences in protein patterns, when plants were precultured on different sorbitol media. Fifteen up- or downregulated proteins were isolated and identified. Interestingly, these preliminary results indicate strong alteration of the primary metabolism and more precisely in carbon fixation. These results are sustained by the carbohydrate and polyol analyses. Indeed, sucrose, glucose, fructose, mannitol, arabinose, galactinol, meli-biose and stachyose increased with increasing concentrations of exogenousely supplied sorbitol up to 0. 11 M sorbitol. At 0. 22 M sorbitol their concentrations decreased. Trehalose and sorbitol concentrations increased exponentially with an increasing molarity of sorbitol pretreatment. Maltose was only observed when plantlets were treated with 0. 22 M sorbitol. When plants were treated with up to 0. 11 M sorbitol during 21 days, carbohydrate and polyol concentrations increased. When 0. 22 M sorbitol was applied as pre-treatment, most sugar concentrations decreased. Since high intracellular osmolyte concentrations are needed to allow successful recovery after cryopreservation, the results from carbohydrate and polyol analysis (Bhandal, 1985) may explain the higher recovery rate after cryopreservation observed after sorbitol treatment. Extra cryopreservation experiments are needed to confirm these results. Beside the sugar analysis, these changes affecting the primary metabolism have been observed at the protein level by using differential in gel electrophoresis. Further experiments including also chilling pretreatments will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the physiological status of the tissue and will hopefully explain the reason of the better results of cryopreservation. vokMyyynti MTT, Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E

By using the codes ORBIT and FLUKA, the multi-turn phase space painting injection process with the <b>stripping</b> <b>foil</b> scattering for CSNS/RCS was simulated and the beam losses due to the foil scattering were obtained.

5000|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are generally called [...] "{{electrolytic capacitors}}" [...] or [...] "e-caps". The components consist of two <b>strips</b> of aluminum <b>foil,</b> {{separated by a}} paper spacer, which is saturated with a liquid or gel-like electrolyte. One of the aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>strips,</b> called the anode, chemically roughened and oxidized in a process called forming, holds a very thin oxide layer on its surface as an electrical insulator serving as the dielectric of the capacitor. The liquid electrolyte, which is the cathode of the capacitor, covers the irregular surface of the oxide layer of the anode perfectly, and makes the increased anode surface effectual, thus increasing the effective capacitance.|$|R
5000|$|A 500-kronor {{banknote}} (a new denomination) {{in a blue}} shade {{was introduced}} in 1985 with a portrait of King Charles XI and on the reverse an engraving depicts Christopher Polhem, the [...] "father of Swedish engineering". These banknotes became invalid on 31 December 1998. A 500-kronor banknote (red, but without <b>foil</b> <b>strips)</b> with the same portrait was printed 1989-2000. This banknote became invalid after 31 December 2005. A more secure version with the same portrait was introduced in 2001 and will become invalid after June 30, 2017. The banknote had some controversy in 1985 because of the executions of [...] "Snapphane" [...] guerrilla warriors that King Charles XI ordered.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{requirement}} under Rylands is {{that the}} defendant [...] "for his own purposes brings onto land and collects and keeps there". In Rylands, this was the keeping of water in a reservoir; other cases in England and Wales have illustrated what sort of material is considered. In British Celanese v AH Hunt, the accumulation was of metal <b>foil</b> <b>strips.</b> [...] "for his own purpose" [...] is not understood to be [...] "for his benefit", although that was what Blackburn was referring to at the time; in Smeaton v Ilford Corp, Rylands was held to apply to a local authority accumulating sewage on its land, {{although there was no}} benefit to the local authority from doing this.|$|R
