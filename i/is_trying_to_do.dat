500|$|For much of {{his final}} two decades, Romney {{had been out of}} the {{political}} eye, but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. [...] Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son's house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. [...] Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events. [...] When Kennedy's campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church's past policy on blacks, Romney interrupted Mitt's press conference and said loudly, [...] "I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues.

[...] The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, {{and other}} pop culture media have provided both praise and criticism on Edward's character. IGN writer Hilary Goldstein praises Edward {{as the perfect}} balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona, explaining that this allows the character to [...] "float between comical moments and underlying drama without seeming false." [...] Additionally, Melissa Harper from Anime News Network praises Edward's facial expressions {{as some of the}} most humorous highlights of the series, including also the moments in which he reacts quite violently to comments about his small stature. They also praise him for not being a stereotypical shōnen character as it is noted that he has [...] "very real skills, relationships, and personality". Samuel Arbogast from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews also comments that the interaction between the Elric brothers as they travel is interesting, and praises their humor scenes as they help to balance the dark parts of the series. Similarly, Mania Entertainment's Jarred Pine liked the dynamic between the Elrics brothers as while Edward is often faced with following [...] "dark paths" [...] {{in the same way as}} villains with the series, he is always supported by Alphonse who makes sure he is okay. Judge Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict commented on Edward's journey, considering it very complex morally because he <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> good within a morally questionable organization. Lydia Hojnacki listed Ed as one of the reasons she likes Fullmetal Alchemist, noting the progression of the character's personality throughout the series, from simple maturity to a deeper sensitivity. The character was noted to go through a notable development in the manga after meeting his father by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime as it made him decide to see the investigate from the human he and Alphonse created as children which led him to find a clue about how to recover his brother's body. On the other hand, Maria Lin from Animefringe criticized Edward's development in the first animated adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist, as in the series' finale he once again attempted to resurrect a human. When reviewing the video game Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel, RPGFan's Neal Chandran enjoyed the dynamic between the main characters both in fights as well as dialogues.|$|E

Much of these sentiments where echoed by Kate Gray of Eurogamer; she also praised the premise as interesting, but lamented that [...] "Valhallas bartending is just boring", with not enough player control to make the game feel creative. Adi Robertson of The Verge alleged that some reviewers found the game's sexualized dialogue from the female characters to be unrealistic. Ortiz responded that interactions were based upon their own interactions, including that [...] "females have always been more open about those topics than males", but he did concede that [...] "we wrote ourselves into a corner by making the cast predominantly female".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the refusal}} to honour the victims during the opening {{ceremony}} of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the Olympic truce. This {{was the first time}} that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by “honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals that have brought us together in this beautiful Olympic village" [...] and said that the Israelis “came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity.” [...] Rogge added, [...] "we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them.” In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the bare minimum,” and called it [...] "shameful." [...] Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, “This is not the right solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. We asked for a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people.” At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had [...] "submitted to terrorism", and would be [...] "written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace."

2500|$|The first sound {{adaptation}} of the play was in 1929; Sam Taylor's The Taming of the Shrew, starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (the first sound {{adaptation of}} any Shakespeare play). This version was simultaneously shot as a silent film, and, depending on whether a given theatre was equipped to screen sound films, was released both as a [...] "talkie" [...] and a silent. Using only 500 lines from the original play, and a few lines from David Garrick's 1754 adaptation of Shrew, Catharine and Petruchio, the film is primarily known for how Pickford delivers Katherina's last speech. As she moves though the litany of reasons why a woman should obey her husband, she winks toward Bianca (Dorothea Jordan), unseen by Petruchio. Bianca smiles in silent communication with Katherina, thus acknowledging that Katherina has not been tamed at all. The film opens with a Punch and Judy puppet show which several critics have argued performs a similar function to the Christopher Sly Induction in the original play, but also works to instill a sense of false anticipation in the audience; the puppet show ends with Judy sinking lovingly into Punch's arms after he beats her. In the film, Katherina never sinks into Petruchio's arms. Indeed, Pickford's Katherina is much more resistant than in many stage versions; there is an extended scene of her wrecking Baptista's home, she only agrees to marry Petruchio when he stands on her foot and her scream is taken by the priest as consent, when she falls in the mud {{on the way to}} Petruchio's house, he offers to help but she refuses, she rejects meat at the dinner table rather than being tempted by it. Most significantly, when Petruchio outlines his plan to tame her [...] "with kindness" [...] (4.1.195), which is usually a soliloquy, Katherina hears him. She then proceeds to 'out-tame' him; when he messes up the bed clothes, she overturns the entire mattress, sparking a game of one-upmanship which ends when she flings a stool at him and knocks him out. The conversation about the sun and moon, so often seen as a pivotal turning point in the taming is then delivered with a befuddled Petruchio apparently genuinely unsure whether he is looking at the sun or the moon, and a worried Katherina trying to placate him. This is immediately followed by her 'submission' speech, and her wink. Elizabeth Schafer believes this is a Katherina that has not been tamed; [...] "unlike Shakespeare's Katherina, Pickford's Katherina knows what Petruchio <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in taming her and she responds to this tactically and successfully. Her surpassing of Petruchio's outrageous behaviour leaves him nonplussed and concussed." [...] However, Pickford herself was unhappy with the film, and with how Taylor had directed her. In her autobiography, she wrote she wanted to play Katherina as a ferocious woman, but Taylor told her [...] "We don't want any of that heavy stage drama; we want the old Pickford tricks." [...] Pickford said of her performance, [...] "Instead of being a forceful tiger-cat, I was a spitting little kitten." ...|$|E
