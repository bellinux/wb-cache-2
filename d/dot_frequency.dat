In FM halftoning the dot size and shape is fixed (equal to one pixel) and the <b>dot</b> <b>frequency</b> is varied in accordance to the graylevel values of the underlying grayscale image. We generalize error diffusion to produce FM halftones with user controlled dot size and shape using block quantization and a block filter in the feedback loop.

40|$|Error {{diffusion}} halftoning is {{a popular}} method of producing frequency modulated (FM) halftones for printing and display. FM halftoning fixes the dot size (e. g. to one pixel in con-ventional error diffusion), and varies the <b>dot</b> <b>frequency</b> according to {{the intensity of the}} original grayscale image. We generalize error diffusion to produce FM halftones with user-controlled dot size and shape by using block quantization and block filtering. As a key application, we show how block error diffusion may be applied to embed information in hardcopy using dot shape modulation. We enable the encoding and subsequent decoding of information embedded in the hardcopy version of continuous-tone base-images. The encoding-decoding process is modeled by robust data transmission through a noisy print-scan channel that is explicitly modeled. We refer to the encoded printed version as an image barcode due to its high information capacity that differentiates it from common hardcopy watermarks. The encoding/halftoning strategy is based on a modified version of block error diffusion. Encoder stability, image quality vs. information capacity tradeoffs, and decoding issues with and without explicit knowledge of the base-image are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In the {{printing}} industry, {{one of the}} most common methods for reproducing halftone images using bilevel printing devices is clustered-dot ordered dithering. The images produced using this method are quite faithful to the original and are visually pleasing. Nevertheless, only rational angles are attainable with clustered-dot dithering, due to the discrete nature of the grids. This phenomenon can become detrimental in the case of four-color printing, when different screen angles and maybe even different screen frequencies are used for separate color planes, thus producing a so-called Moiré phenomenon. Another important drawback, the so-called banding or contouring effect, is related to the limited area of basic screen elements used in traditional dithering. In order to deal with these problems, we have developed, within the scope of our research, several new techniques for digital halftoning: (1) pseudo-random halftone screening, (2) a new method for generating clustered-dot halftone images having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size (CombiScreen), (3) rotated clustered-dot dithering, based on discrete one-to-one rotation, and (4) rotated dispersed-dot dither. A new method of pseudo-random halftone screening is described. It starts by obtaining the quasi-random distribution of tile centers according to some well-defined spectral characteristics. We then obtain the desired tesselation of the output device space by applying the Voronoi polygonization process. Then, an analytic black-dot curve is calculated according to the resampled input signal level and the area of each given tile. This analytic curve is scan-converted to obtain the blackened pixels. In the second approach, we associate threshold values to all pixels inside every tile according to some specially tailored analytic spot function. Then, the standard threshold comparison process is applied. Unlike known error-diffusion techniques, the pseudo-random halftone screening technique can be applied to a high resolution printing process. The characteristic screen element size can be properly chosen so as to ensure the best trade-off between {{the printing}} process constraints and the most precise printing. The described halftone algorithm seems to be appropriate for high-resolution color and black&white devices (above 1000 dpi). A new method (CombiScreen) is proposed for generating clustered-dot halftone images on raster printing devices having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size. The dither tiles generated by this method may contain several screen elements having any rational orientation and size. Threshold values are distributed among the cells of the dither tile so as to produce a large range of gray values, while at the same time preserving the clustered-dot behavior of individual screen elements. When rendering images at smoothly increasing intensity levels, this new method generates few contouring effects and other visible artifacts. The method works equally well for quadratic, rectangular, parallelogram and hexagonally shaped screen elements. Resulting dither tiles are generally either of parallelogram or of hexagonal shape. Since CombiScreen enables the screen <b>dot</b> <b>frequency</b> or orientation to be chosen independently of the number of gray levels, it has proven to be specially effective when printing at resolutions between 150 to 600 dpi with ink jet printers and at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi with xerographic printers. A new operator of discrete one-to-one rotation is described. It offers means previously unknown in the art for generating rotated screens which approximate irrational angles with high-precision, producing much less disturbing interferences and artifacts than other methods. Therefore, a carefully prepared dither tile incorporating screen elements with the desired period, initial orientation, and dither threshold values defining their screen dot shape growth behavior can be rotated by discrete one-to-one rotation and keep the desired screen element period, the number of cells per screen element and the threshold values associated with each screen element cell, thereby preserving the screen dot shape growth behavior of the original dither tile. Several different discrete one-to-one rotation variants are described: a small angle rotation technique valid for a subset of rational rotation angles, a rigid band technique and a technique based on discrete shearing transformations. The high-quality of the so rotated dither tile is due to the fact that discrete one-to-one rotation preserves the exact number of elementary cells per screen element and their exact dither threshold values. The described method provides a new range of solutions for obtaining high-quality digital angled halftone screens. High-quality solutions can be found for generating three digital angled halftone screens, each 30 ° apart from each other, as known from traditional photographic colour screening techniques. Further solutions minimizing Moiré effects may be obtained by halftone screens whose first order frequency component vectors sum up to zero. This new method has turned out to be particularly effective when printing with color ink jet printers at resolutions between 150 and 800 dpi as well as with xerographic printers at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi. Rotated dispersed-dot dither is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither, texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms. This technique has successfully been applied to in-phase color reproduction on ink-jet printers as well as to black and white reproduction on laser printers...|$|E

Les techniques de reproduction d'images noir et blanc ou couleur utilisées dans la plupart des imprimantes de bureau permettent de reproduire plus ou moins fidèlement des images, en mode tout-ou-rien. Cependant, ces techniques conventionnelles sont loin d'être parfaites: les unes souffrent d'un diapason dynamique trop limité, ce qui engendre un effet de bande ou d'autres structures visuellement gênantes; les autres produisent des effets de Moiré intolérables. Ce travail de thèse a été précédé par une analyse des problèmes liés à la nature répétitive des trames lors de la superposition de couches colorées et à la nature discrète des grilles de sortie des dispositifs de visualisation modernes. Cette analyse nous a permis d'identifier et de formuler un certain nombre de conditions à respecter, afin d'assurer une qualité de reproduction acceptable. Après avoir étudié l'état de l'art, nous avons décidé de mener notre recherche dans les directions suivantes: (1) méthode de reproduction d'images par trame pseudo-aléatoire regroupée, (2) technique combinée de génération de points de trame (CombiScreen), (3) méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective d'une trame à points dispersés, et (4) méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective d'une trame à points groupés. La méthode de reproduction d'images par trame pseudo-aléatoire regroupée, se prête bien à la reproduction couleur à haute résolution. Les épreuves en quadrichromie que nous avons pu faire, montrent une qualité acceptable dans la fidélité de rendu de nuances des teintes; elles donnent une bonne impression générale; il n'y pas d'effet de Moiré, ni d'autres artefacts visuels forts, sur les images obtenues. Par rapport à la plupart des implémentations commerciales existantes, notre méthode offre un contrôle accru sur la forme et la dispersion des éléments de trame. La méthode combinée de génération de points de trame (CombiScreen), permettant de minimiser l'effet de bandes, est utilisable dans la plupart des applications graphiques pour la reproduction d'images couleur ou noir et blanc. Cette technique permet d'obtenir des gradations de niveaux d'intensité extrêmement lisses, presque sans textures gênantes. Par ailleurs, elle permet d'utiliser des trames de base de différentes tailles, y compris de toutes petites trames, ce qui représente un avantage considérable. Les trames obtenues par la méthode CombiScreen peuvent également servir de base de départ pour d'autres méthodes de tramage, et, notamment, pour la méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective. Un nouvel opérateur de rotation discrète bijective développé dans le cadre de cette recherche, permet d'appliquer des transformations proches des rotations, sur les ensembles discrets, et, notamment, sur les matrices de seuillage utilisées dans les algorithmes de reproduction. Trois types différents de rotations discrètes bijectives sont décrits en détail: la rotation discrète bijective par bandes rigides, la rotation discrète bijective de type a, b, b+ 1, et la rotation discrète bijective par cisaillements discrets successifs XYX. Grâce à cet opérateur, et en l'appliquant au plan des valeurs de seuil, on obtient plusieurs variantes de technique de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective, à points groupés ou dispersés. Les trames obtenues par ces techniques peuvent être appelées semi-régulières, car, tout en héritant d'un élément régulier des trames non-tournés, elles présentent une périodicité sur des périodes beaucoup plus grandes que celles de la trame de base. Les erreurs de dicrétisation, inhérentes à la rotation discrète bijective, perturbent la régularité initiale, sans la détruire complètement. La méthode de tramage régulier par matrice de seuillage dispersée tournée offre une qualité d'image améliorée. Les petits détails sont bien rendus et l'aspect visuel est assez plaisant. En outre, la courbe de reproduction obtenue par cette technique est nettement supérieure à celle de la méthode de Bayer, pour s'approcher des courbes de reproduction qui caractérisent les méthodes de reproduction par trame à points regroupés. Différentes méthodes de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective de la trame à points groupés permettent de satisfaire les critères de qualité de trames formulés au début de notre recherche, tels que l'élimination de l'effet de bande et la minimisation de l'effet de Moiré dans la reproduction en quadrichromie. Certains échantillons, produits avec cette méthode, atteignent une qualité visuelle considérable, proche de celle obtenue à résolution élevée...|$|E

40|$|We report fast, {{simultaneous}} charge sensing {{and transport}} measurements of gate-defined carbon nanotube quantum <b>dots.</b> Aluminum radio <b>frequency</b> single electron transistors (rf-SETs) capacitively coupled to the nanotube dot provide single-electron charge sensing on microsecond timescales. Simultaneously, rf reflectometry allows fast measurement of transport through the nanotube dot. Charge stability diagrams for the nanotube dot in the Coulomb blockade regime show extended Coulomb diamonds into the high-bias regime, {{as well as}} even-odd filling effects, revealed in charge sensing data. Carbon nanotubes are promising systems {{on which to base}} coherent electronic devices [1 – 3]. Due to a combination of strong confinement, quantized phonon spectrum [4], and zero nuclear spin, carbon nanotubes are likely to exhibit long-lived coherent states. Key to the success of this technology is the ability to manipulate electron states within a nanotube and perform fast, efficient readout. Recent advances in device fabrication [3, 5 – 8] allo...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} photon-assisted {{tunneling}} (PAT) experiments in a carbon nanotube quantum <b>dot</b> using microwave <b>frequencies</b> between 20 and 60 GHz. In {{addition to the}} basic PAT effect, revealed {{by the appearance of}} two extra resonances in the current through the dot, we use PAT for spectroscopy of excited states. The experimental data are in good agreement with simulations. High-frequency transport properties of carbon nanotube devices have received {{a lot of interest in}} connection with, e. g., the performance of radio frequency field effect transistors (rf-FETs) 1, 2 and nano electromechanical systems. 3 Most of the experiments have been carried out at frequencies below 1 GHz. Only very recently, frequencies of 10 GHz and more have been used in ac transport 4 and with rf-FETs. 5 All these studies have been done at room temperature. However, the response of a carbon nanotube in the low-temperature quantum transport regime is very interesting for future devices such as radio frequency single electron transistor...|$|R
40|$|Electron spins {{in quantum}} dots under {{coherent}} control exhibit {{a number of}} novel feedback processes. Here, we present experimental and theoretical evidence of a feedback process between nuclear spins and a single electron spin in a single charged InAs quantum dot, controlled by the coherently modified probability of exciting a trion state. We present a mathematical model describing competition between optical nuclear pumping and nuclear spin-diffusion inside the quantum dot. The model correctly postdicts the observation of a hysteretic sawtooth pattern in the free-induction-decay of the single electron spin, hysteresis while scanning a narrowband laser through the quantum <b>dot’s</b> optical resonance <b>frequency,</b> and non-sinusoidal fringes in the spin echo. Both the coherent electron-spin rotations, implemented with off-resonant ultrafast laser pulses, and the resonant narrow-band optical pumping for spin initialization interspersed between ultrafast pulses, {{play a role in}} the observed behavior. This effect allows dynamic tuning of the electron Larmor frequency to a value determined by the pulse timing, potentially allowing more complex coherent control operations...|$|R
40|$|We {{fabricated}} an acousto-optic semiconductor hybrid {{device for}} strong optomechanical coupling of individual quantum emitters and a {{surface acoustic wave}}. Our device comprises a surface acoustic wave chip made from highly piezoelectric LiNbO$_ 3 $ and a GaAs-based semiconductor membrane with an embedded layer of quantum dots. Employing multi-harmonic transducers, we generated sound waves on LiNbO$_ 3 $ {{over a wide range}} of radio frequencies. We monitored their coupling to and propagation across the semiconductor membrane both in the electrical and optical domain. We demonstrate enhanced optomechanical tuning of the embedded quantum <b>dots</b> with increasing <b>frequencies.</b> This effect was verified by finite element modelling of our device geometry and attributed to an increased localization of the acoustic field within the semiconductor membrane. For moderately high acoustic frequencies, our simulations predict strong optomechanical coupling making our hybrid device ideally suited for applications in semiconductor based quantum acoustics.

40|$|Study of {{interaction}} between high absorption matter and microwave radiated energy is a subject of great importance. Especially, this concerns microwave spectroscopic characterization of biological liquids. Use of effective testing methods to obtain information about physical properties of different liquids on the molecular level {{is one of the}} most important problems in biophysics. However, the standard methods based on the microwave resonant techniques are not sufficiently suitable for biological liquids because the resonance peak in a resonator with high-loss liquids is so broad that the material parameters cannot be measured correctly. Although molecular vibrations of biomolecules may have microwave frequencies, it is not thought that such resonant coupling is significant due to their low energy compared with thermal energy and the strongly dampening aqueous environment. This paper presents an innovative microwave sensing technique for different types of lossy materials, including biological liquids. The technique is based on the combination of the microwave perturbation method and the Fano-resonance effects observed recently in microwave structures with embedded magnetic-dipolar quantum <b>dots.</b> When <b>frequency</b> of the magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) resonance is not equal to the cavity resonance frequency, one gets Fano transmission intensity. With tuning, by a bias magnetic field, the MDM resonance frequency to the cavity resonance frequency, one observes a Lorentz line shape. Use of an extremely narrow Lorentzian peak allows exact probing the resonant frequency of a cavity loaded by a high-lossy-material sample. For different kinds of samples, one has different frequencies of Lorentzian peaks. This gives a picture for precise spectroscopic characterization of high absorption matter in microwaves...|$|R
2500|$|The S-parameter matrix {{describing}} an N-port {{network will}} be square of dimension N and will therefore contain [...] elements. At the test frequency each element or S-parameter {{is represented by}} a unitless complex number that represents magnitude and angle, i.e. amplitude and phase. The complex number may either be expressed in rectangular form or, more commonly, in polar form. The S-parameter magnitude may be expressed in linear form or logarithmic form. [...] When expressed in logarithmic form, magnitude has the [...] "dimensionless unit" [...] of decibels. The S-parameter angle is most frequently expressed in degrees but occasionally in radians. Any S-parameter may be displayed graphically on a polar diagram by a <b>dot</b> for one <b>frequency</b> or a locus {{for a range of}} frequencies. If it applies to one port only (being of the form [...] ), it may be displayed on an impedance or admittance Smith Chart normalised to the system impedance. The Smith Chart allows simple conversion between the [...] parameter, equivalent to the voltage reflection coefficient and the associated (normalised) impedance (or admittance) 'seen' at that port.|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} a fast {{high-frequency}} read-out of high impedance devices, such as quantum dots, necessitates impedance matching. Here we use a resonant impedance matching circuit (a stub tuner) realized by on-chip superconducting transmission lines to measure the electronic shot noise of a carbon nanotube quantum <b>dot</b> at a <b>frequency</b> close to 3 GHz in an efficient way. As compared to wide-band detection without impedance matching, the {{signal to noise ratio}} can be enhanced by as much as a factor of 800 for a device with an impedance of 100 kΩ. The advantage of the stub resonator concept is the ease with which the response of the circuit can be predicted, designed and fabricated. We further demonstrate that all relevant matching circuit parameters can reliably be deduced from power reflectance measurements and then used to predict the power transmission function from the device through the circuit. The shot noise of the carbon nanotube quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime shows an oscillating suppression below the Schottky value of 2 eI, as well an enhancement in specific regions.
