To study edge fracture behavior of AHSS, a comprehensive hole <b>expansion</b> <b>test</b> (HET) program has been carried out on a DP 780 sheet. Specimen with three different edge conditions (milled edge, water jet cut edge and punched edge) are manufactured and tested. Results reveal that the hole expansion ratio (HER) of the present DP 780 sheet is around 38  % for milled specimen and water jet cut specimen, and about 14  % for punched specimen. A novel method of a central hole specimen tension is also introduced for edge fracture study, showing a similar trend as found in HET. The paper briefly presents a procedure and the results for a full calibration of the DP 780 sheet for plasticity and fracture, where a hybrid testing/simulation method is used to obtain parameters for Hill 48 plasticity model and modified Mohr–Coulomb fracture model. The finite element simulation gives an accurate prediction of HER, as well as the load displacement response and specimen deflection distribution in the hole expansion tests on uncracked material.

However, the feasibility of estimation programs always has fluctuation and due to some inherent defects of programing and training methods, the simulated results from estimation programs might have some extent of differences compared with the test results. Thus, thorough analysis of these differences and accuracy improvement of estimation programs are essential. In this master thesis, five different sheet steels and seven HER estimation programs are selected to analyze the feasibility of the estimation programs. The thesis includes theoretical, experimental and discussion parts. Theoretical parts will introduce theoretical backgrounds which relate to the thesis topic. Experimental parts comprise tensile <b>tests,</b> hole <b>expansion</b> <b>tests,</b> HER program estimations and microscopy.

However, some certain programs can predict the HER for certain sheet steel with high accuracy, for example the program 6 for DX 56 D, which showed almost the same result as the test result. Based on the fracture and microstructure analysis, the ductility of sheet steels seems to be the main factor which affects the feasibility of an estimation program.
