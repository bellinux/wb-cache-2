25|$|The {{case for}} the <b>duodecimal</b> system was put forth at length in F. Emerson Andrews' 1935 book New Numbers: How Acceptance of a <b>Duodecimal</b> Base Would Simplify Mathematics. Emerson noted that, due to the {{prevalence}} of factors of twelve in many traditional units of weight and measure, many of the computational advantages claimed for the metric system could be realized either by the adoption of ten-based weights and measure or by {{the adoption of the}} <b>duodecimal</b> number system.|$|E

25|$|For example, in <b>duodecimal,</b> 1/2 = 0.6, 1/3 = 0.4, 1/4 = 0.3 and 1/6 = 0.2 all terminate; 1/5 = 0.2497 repeats with period 4, in {{contrast}} with the equivalent decimal expansion of 0.2; 1/7 = 0.186ᘔ35 has period 6 in <b>duodecimal,</b> just as it does in decimal.|$|E
25|$|The {{engineer}} Herbert Ashe, an English {{friend of}} Borges' father with a peculiar interest in <b>duodecimals,</b> dies of an aneurysm rupture, leaving in a pub a packet containing a book which is found (and inherited) by Borges months after. This book is {{revealed to be}} the eleventh volume of an English-language encyclopedia entirely devoted to Tlön, one of the worlds in which Uqbar's legends are set. The book contains two oval blue stamps with the words Orbis Tertius inscribed in blue. From this point, part two comprehensively describes and discuss Tlön's culture, history, languages and philosophy, which form the central focus of the story as Borges reads the tome, eager to finally know about the obscure subject he sought for so long, {{which turned out to}} be a whole new world alien to his own.|$|R
25|$|The Dozenal Society of America {{argues that}} factors of 3 are more {{commonly}} encountered in real-life division problems than factors of 5. Thus, in practical applications, the nuisance of repeating decimals is encountered less often when <b>duodecimal</b> notation is used. Advocates of <b>duodecimal</b> systems {{argue that this}} is particularly true of financial calculations, in which the twelve months of the year often enter into calculations.|$|E
25|$|According to Tolkien, the elves {{preferred}} <b>duodecimal</b> counting (base 12) to the decimal system (base 10: Quenya maquanotië, *quaistanótië), {{though both}} systems {{seem to have}} coexisted. The numbers 1–12 are presented below (reconstructed forms are marked with an asterisk *), {{as well as a}} few other known higher numbers.|$|E
25|$|Borges also {{mentions}} {{in passing}} the <b>duodecimal</b> system (as well as others), but never elaborates {{on the fact}} that this is inherently a refutation of the changeability of things due to nomenclature - a number may be renamed under a different counting schema, but the underlying value will always remain the same.|$|E
25|$|In Jorge Luis Borges' {{short story}} Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius Herbert Ashe, a melancholy English engineer, {{working for the}} Southern Argentine Railway company, is {{converting}} a <b>duodecimal</b> number system to a hexadecimal system. He leaves behind on his death in 1937 a manuscript Orbis Tertius that posthumously identifies {{him as one of}} the anonymous authors of the encyclopaedia of Tlön.|$|E
25|$|In Leo Frankowski's Conrad Stargard novels, Conrad {{introduces}} a <b>duodecimal</b> system of arithmetic {{at the suggestion}} of a merchant, who is accustomed to buying and selling goods in dozens and grosses, rather than tens or hundreds. He then invents an entire system of weights and measures in base twelve, including a clock with twelve hours in a day, rather than twenty-four hours.|$|E
25|$|As for irrational numbers, none of {{them have}} a finite {{representation}} in any of the rational-based positional number systems (such as the decimal and <b>duodecimal</b> ones); this is because a rational-based positional number system is essentially nothing but a way of expressing quantities as a sum of fractions whose denominators are powers of the base, and by definition no finite sum of rational numbers can ever result in an irrational number. For example, 123.456 = 1 × 102 + 2 × 101 + 3 × 100 + 4 × 1/101 + 5 × 1/102 + 6 × 1/103 (this is also the reason why fractions that contain prime factors in their denominator not in common with those of the base do not have a terminating representation in that base). Moreover, the infinite series of digits of an irrational number does not exhibit a strictly repeating pattern; instead, the different digits often succeed in a seemingly random fashion. The following chart compares the first few digits of the decimal and <b>duodecimal</b> representation of several of the most important algebraic and transcendental irrational numbers. Some of these numbers may be perceived as having fortuitous patterns, making them easier to memorize, when represented in one base or the other.|$|E

500|$|According to Christopher Tolkien: [...] "the Eldar {{used two}} systems of numerals one of sixes (or twelves), {{and one of}} fives. (or tens)." [...] That is a <b>duodecimal</b> {{counting}} (base 12), and a decimal system. J.R.R. Tolkien coined a word for the 'decimal system of counting' maquanotie.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to Talleyrand's proposal of 1790, the Assemblée {{set up a}} new committee {{under the auspices of the}} Académie to investigate weights and measures. The members were five of the most able scientists of the day—Jean-Charles de Borda, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Gaspard Monge and Condorcet. [...] The committee, having decided that counting and weights and measures should use the same radix (numerical base), debated the use of the <b>duodecimal</b> (base 12) system as an alternative to the decimal system. Eventually the committee decided that the advantages of divisibility by three and four was outweighed by the complications of introducing a <b>duodecimal</b> system and on 27 October 1790 recommended to the Assemblée that currency, weights and measures should all be based on a decimal system. They also argued in favour of the decimalization of time and of angular measures. The committee examined three possible standards for length – the length of pendulum that beat with a frequency of once a second at 45° latitude, a quarter of the length of the equator and a quarter of the length of a meridian. [...] The committee also proposed that the standard for weight should be the weight of distilled water held in cube with sides a decimal proportion of the standard for length. The committee's final report to the Assemblée on 17 March 1791 recommended the meridional definition for the unit of length. Borda, inventor of the repeating circle was appointed chairman. The proposal was accepted by the Assemblée on 30 March 1791.|$|E
500|$|In pre-revolutionary Europe, {{each state}} {{had its own}} system of units of measure. Some countries, such as Spain and Russia, saw the {{advantages}} of harmonising their units of measure with those of their trading partners. However, vested interests who profited from variations in units of measure opposed this. This was particularly prevalent in France where the huge inconsistency {{in the size of}} units of measure was one of the causes that, in 1789, led to the outbreak of the French Revolution. During {{the early years of the}} revolution, savants including the Marquis de Condorcet, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Adrien-Marie Legendre, Antoine Lavoisier and Jean-Charles de Borda set up a Commission of Weights and Measures. [...] The commission was of the opinion that the country should adopt a completely new system of measure based on the principles of logic and natural phenomena. Logic dictated that such a system should be based on the radix used for counting. Their report of March 1791 to the Assemblée nationale constituante considered but rejected the view of Laplace that a <b>duodecimal</b> system of counting should replace the existing decimal system; the view such a system was bound to fail prevailed. The commission's final recommendation was that the assembly should promote a decimal-based system of measurement. The leaders of the assembly accepted the views of the commission.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{in order}} to do this sum and {{recompose}} the number, now the addition tables for the <b>duodecimal</b> system have to be used, instead of the addition tables for decimal most people are already familiar with, because the summands are now in base twelve and so the arithmetic with them has to be in <b>duodecimal</b> as well. In decimal, 6 + 6 equals 12, but in <b>duodecimal</b> it equals 10; so, if using decimal arithmetic with <b>duodecimal</b> numbers one would arrive at an incorrect result.

2500|$|The number twelve, a {{superior}} highly composite number, {{is the smallest}} number with four non-trivial factors (2, 3, 4, 6), and the smallest to include as factors all four numbers (1 to 4) within the subitizing range. As {{a result of this}} increased factorability of the radix and its divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers (whereas ten has only two non-trivial factors: 2 and 5, and not 3, 4, or 6), <b>duodecimal</b> representations fit more easily than decimal ones into many common patterns, as evidenced by the higher regularity observable in the <b>duodecimal</b> multiplication table. As a result, <b>duodecimal</b> has been described as the optimal number system. Of its factors, 2 and 3 are prime, which means the reciprocals of all 3-smooth numbers (such as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9...) have a terminating representation in <b>duodecimal.</b> In particular, the five most elementary fractions ( [...] , , , [...] and [...] ) all have a short terminating representation in <b>duodecimal</b> (0.6, 0.4, 0.8, 0.3 and 0.9, respectively), and twelve is the smallest radix with this feature (because it is the least common multiple of 3 and 4). This all makes it a more convenient number system for computing fractions than most other number systems in common use, such as the decimal, vigesimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal systems. Although the trigesimal and sexagesimal systems (where the reciprocals of all 5-smooth numbers terminate) do even better in this respect, this is at the cost of unwieldy multiplication tables and a much larger number of symbols to memorize.|$|E

2500|$|In a <b>duodecimal</b> place system twelve {{is written}} as 10, {{but there are}} {{numerous}} proposals for how to write ten and eleven. The simplified notations use only basic and easy to access letters such as T and E (for ten and eleven), X and Z, t and e, d and k, others use A and B or a and b as in the hexadecimal system. Some employ Greek letters such as δ (standing for Greek δέκα 'ten') and ε (for Greek ένδεκα 'eleven'), or τ and ε. Frank Emerson Andrews, an early American advocate for <b>duodecimal,</b> suggested and used in his book New Numbers an X (from the Roman numeral for ten) and a script E (ℰ, [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>duodecimal</b> system (also {{known as}} base 12 or dozenal) is a {{positional}} notation numeral system using twelve as its base. In this system, the number ten may be {{written by a}} rotated [...] "2" [...] (2) and the number eleven by a rotated [...] "3" [...] (3). This notation was introduced by Sir Isaac Pitman. These digit forms are available as Unicode characters on computerized systems since June 2015 as ↊ (Code point 218A) and ↋ (Code point 218B), respectively. Other notations use [...] "A", [...] "T", or [...] "X" [...] for ten and [...] "B" [...] or [...] "E" [...] for eleven. The number twelve (that is, the number written as [...] "12" [...] in the base ten numerical system) is instead written as [...] "10" [...] in <b>duodecimal</b> (meaning [...] "1 dozen and 0 units", instead of [...] "1 ten and 0 units"), whereas the digit string [...] "12" [...] means [...] "1 dozen and 2 units" [...] (i.e. the same number that in decimal is written as [...] "14"). Similarly, in <b>duodecimal</b> [...] "100" [...] means [...] "1 gross", [...] "1000" [...] means [...] "1 great gross", and [...] "0.1" [...] means [...] "1 twelfth" [...] (instead of their decimal meanings [...] "1 hundred", [...] "1 thousand", and [...] "1 tenth").|$|E
2500|$|However, when {{recurring}} fractions {{do occur}} in <b>duodecimal</b> notation, {{they are less}} likely to have a very short period than in decimal notation, because 12 (twelve) is between two prime numbers, 11 (eleven) and 13 (thirteen), whereas ten is adjacent to the composite number 9. Nonetheless, having a shorter or longer period doesn't help the main inconvenience that one does not get a finite representation for such fractions in the given base (so rounding, which introduces inexactitude, is necessary to handle them in calculations), and overall one is more likely to have to deal with infinite recurring digits when fractions are expressed in decimal than in <b>duodecimal,</b> because one out of every three consecutive numbers contains the prime factor 3 in its factorization, whereas only one out of every five contains the prime factor 5.

2500|$|... {{influence}} the relative likeliness of encountering recurring digits (any irreducible fraction that contains {{any of these}} other factors in its denominator will recur in either base). Also, the prime factor 2 appears twice in the factorization of twelve, whereas only once in the factorization of ten; which means that most fractions whose denominators are powers of two will have a shorter, more convenient terminating representation in <b>duodecimal</b> than in decimal representation (e.g. 1/(22) = 0.25 ten = 0.3 twelve; 1/(23) = 0.125 ten = 0.16 twelve; 1/(24) = 0.0625 ten = 0.09 twelve; 1/(25) = 0.03125 ten = 0.046 twelve; etc.).|$|E
2500|$|This {{decomposition}} {{works the}} same {{no matter what}} base the number is expressed in. Just isolate each non-zero digit, padding them with as many zeros as necessary to preserve their respective place values.

2500|$|As {{explained}} in recurring decimals, whenever an irreducible fraction {{is written in}} radix point notation in any base, the fraction can be expressed exactly (terminates) {{if and only if}} all the prime factors of its denominator are also prime factors of the base. Thus, in base-ten (=2×5) system, fractions whose denominators are made up solely of multiples of 2 and 5 terminate: [...] =, = and = can be expressed exactly as 0.125, 0.05 and 0.002 respectively.
