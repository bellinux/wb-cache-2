50|$|The {{building}} has a hipped ribbed metal roof with projecting gables and verandahs to both levels around {{the southeast and}} northeast, with chamferboards to verandah walls and weatherboards to exposed walls. The gables have <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> with timber cover strips and eave brackets. Both {{the east and west}} elevations are symmetrical.|$|R
50|$|Bay 1 is {{currently}} {{used as a}} tourist information centre and library. The south-eastern wall of the information centre has exposed framing lined externally with wide chamferboards (behind the corrugated iron to the facade). The remaining walls are lined with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> except for {{a section of the}} north-east wall where the horizontal tongue and groove board lining has been left exposed. A ceiling of tongue and groove boards is fixed between the bottom chord of the trusses with a section of double beaded boarding over the entrance to the middle bay. The library walls and ceiling are lined with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> and the timber floor throughout is lined with carpet. There are two later offices in the library that are not of cultural significance, one in the western corner and one in the eastern corner which has a raised floor level.|$|R
50|$|The front {{elevation}} is clad in timber chamferboards, and the sides with weatherboards. The rear verandah wall retains exposed timber studs, however {{the southern end}} has had a modern accessible bathroom inserted within the verandah space. This bathroom is clad with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> and the verandah?s two-rail dowel balustrade and stop-chamfered posts are retained.|$|R
5000|$|The {{projection}} room, with {{walls and}} ceilings lined with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> and timber Battens is located over the entrance foyer with the mezzanine [...] "dress circle" [...] either side accessed via timber {{steps from the}} aisles. The dress circle extends several metres along {{the walls of the}} auditorium and its solid balustrade is surmounted by a timber railing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> {{lines the}} walls of the {{enclosed}} rear verandah to a height of about 2.5 metres above floor level. Above, the timber framing is exposed to the northern side while timber boarding lines the southern wall. Beyond this lounge is a narrow verandah with a skillion roof that incorporates a toilet, the rear stairs, and the kitchen pantry and stove recess.|$|R
50|$|Open verandahs on {{each level}} of the two-storeyed section face the street, {{returning}} around the northeast elevation. The curved verandah roof is set down below a main roof of hipped perimeter. One chimney rises above the ridges. The verandahs have cast iron balustrade, brackets and valance, alluding to, but differing from, an earlier design. Below the balustrade is a patterned boarded timber frieze. Rear and southwest verandahs are enclosed with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{south-western}} elevation is clad with {{corrugated iron}} except for sections {{at the front}} and rear that are clad with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting.</b> There are sets of louvres towards the front of the elevation and a timber- framed sash window at about the midpoint. Two sets of louvres at the very front are covered with sheeting. A section towards the rear of the elevation is recessed by about 4m; a timber-framed sash window is located at the midpoint of this section.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the house, {{walls and}} ceilings, {{including}} the raked verandah ceilings, are generally lined with painted v-jointed {{tongue and groove}} timber boards and clear finished skirtings and architraves, except in the formal living and dining rooms and the rear informal lounge where there is <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting.</b> The timber floors throughout have been clear finished. In wet areas vinyl tiles have been laid. The joinery of the core rooms is generally clear finished with early brass hardware, while the verandah joinery is painted.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the {{interior}} of the first floor, floors are polished timber and walls are vertical timber tongue and groove boards finished with chamfered timber detailing: picture rail, architraves and wide skirtings. Generally, <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> with timber cover battens line the walls between bedrooms and the ceilings. Internal doors are high-waisted timber panelled doors with early door hardware. All unaltered bedrooms have a timber built-in corner cupboard and small basin. At the intersection of the two wings there is a lounge room with built-in cupboards along two walls.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A pre-WW2 {{house in}} Darwin. The roof is sheeted with {{corrugated}} fibro sheets {{and the walls}} with <b>flat</b> fibro <b>sheeting,</b> with fibro battens covering the joints.|$|R
50|$|A pair {{of doors}} from the foyer open into the auditorium, the main volume {{of which is}} {{separated}} from the aisles by timber arcades with slatted timber valances. At the south-eastern end of the auditorium furthest from the entrance doors is a hardwood stage, with a later stage area in front. The walls, balcony balustrade and ceiling of the auditorium are lined with v-jointed tongue and groove boarding and the external walls of the aisles are clad with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting.</b> In {{the centre of the}} ceiling, a ventilation panel of timber lattice runs the length of the auditorium.|$|R
50|$|Shops {{occupy the}} ground floor of 14 Logan Road. The first floor is divided into tenancies by {{recently}} constructed timber and glass partitions. Exposed steel beams supported on concrete blocks set into the walls hold up the floor above. Casement windows {{have been added to the}} eastern sidewall. The second floor is a single open space with new glass and timber partitions built around the stair. The ceiling is lined with timber boards at the southern end and <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> at the northern end. A large skylight sheeted in green fibreglass illuminates the northwest end of the space.|$|R
50|$|Some of the building's timber verandahs were {{originally}} enclosed with weatherboarding, {{while others have}} been more recently enclosed with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> or chamferboards. Original timber verandah decoration, including stop chamfered posts, decorative post capitals and brackets, and solid timber valances, remains {{in many parts of}} the building, particularly on the facade addressing Cunningham Street. The ground floor verandah ceilings are lined with ripple iron sheeting, whilst those on the first floor are raked and have v-jointed timber board linings. Areas of unenclosed verandah have exposed timber floors. An early timber tank stand remains at the rear of the north-eastern wing.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{elevation}} is unenclosed {{at ground level}} with a garden laid {{out in front of}} the line of timber stumps. The enclosed first floor verandah is clad in <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> to sill height with a continuous bank of glass-louvered windows above. The north-east corner of the verandah is chamfered, marking the position of the original gun-post enclosure. The name [...] "MUSGRAVE" [...] is discernable on the roof, painted in large green lettering. Three windows with individual hoods open out of the western facade of the upper floor, which appears to be clad in corrugated iron sheeting.|$|R
5000|$|Internally {{the theatre}} retains {{many of its}} early features, {{including}} entrance foyer, auditorium, projection-room above the entrance foyer, mezzanine [...] "dress circle", stage, seating and dressing rooms.The entrance foyer has clear finished hardwood floors, the joinery is painted and walls and ceiling are lined with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> and cover strips. The northern side of the foyer contains a ticket box and the 1930s Simplex projector is on display. A kitchen {{is located on the}} southern side of the foyer together with a door leading to the southern aisle and to the mezzanine stairs in the auditorium.|$|R
50|$|Attached by a secondary, timber-framed stair hall to {{the rear}} of the {{apartment}} stair hall is a single-storey service wing. A rendered brick building with hipped roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting, it comprises two rooms (originally a servant's bedroom and kitchen) separated by a pantry with verandahs on its eastern and western sides. A brick chimney is located in the south east corner of the kitchen which has a coved ceiling lined with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> and at the rear of the kitchen is a bathroom housed in a timber-framed, skillion roofed structure. The stair from the service wing to the mid-level landing of the main stair has been removed.|$|R
50|$|Jones, and {{his brother}} John, founded the Corrugated Iron Company in 1857, specialising in <b>flat</b> or {{corrugated}} <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{report in}} 1984 stated that some old kilns in the Majors Creek area were then {{being used as}} storage sheds on farms. However, it is {{probable}} that the brick tobacco kiln at 12 Chisholm Trail is the only kiln in the area still containing remnants of flues and some tier poles, which indicates that it was never reused for other purposes. It was probably built sometime in 1933. A piece of iron visible in the top vent clearly shows an imprint of the queen's head with the number 33 underneath. This is a well known Lysaght insignia for its <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting,</b> and the number indicates that it was produced in 1933. With the tobacco industry in decline after 1932, {{it is unlikely that the}} kiln was built much later than this.|$|R
50|$|The building's 1909 core {{comprises}} six {{rooms and}} a central hall leading off the east-facing front verandah {{to one of}} the rooms, a large laboratory, to the west. The hall has a decorative timber battened arch with moulded brackets and architrave. All rooms (except the laboratory) have pressed metal ceilings, pressed metal cornices, and decorative, ventilated ceiling roses some of which have evidence of gas pendant lights which are not extant. The ceiling of the former laboratory is lined with <b>flat</b> <b>sheeting</b> with no cornice. The other rooms, formerly laboratories and store rooms, have plastered walls with rounded corners which are stop-chamfered near the ceiling. The hall walls are timber, vertically-jointed boards. There are no skirtings or rails throughout and all walls and ceilings are painted. The floors are lined with non-original carpet or vinyl, coverings which are not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
50|$|On the interior, {{the floor}} of the main room is tiled and {{ceilings}} and most walls are lined with <b>flat</b> plasterboard <b>sheeting.</b> Dividing the large front living room from the rear bathroom is a v-shaped concrete wall of the same finish and materials as the base structure. The bathroom contains recent fixtures and fittings.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{is built}} on a concrete slab on the ground, measuring 6.4 metres by 3.9 metres. It is an approximately 4 metres high timber framed structure enclosed on the east, south and west sides with <b>flat</b> asbestos <b>sheeting</b> and hessian, and {{on the north side}} with birdwire and hessian. The structure has a super-6 corrugated asbestos cement gable roof.|$|R
50|$|The St Peters Lutheran College Chapel {{was built}} in 1968 to a design of the Austrian-born {{architect}} Karl Langer. Langer's work was in a distinctive sub-tropical modernist style and this was his last built project. The building has a large well-lit nave with a choir loft, vestry and meditation chapel and features a large bell tower. It is constructed of load-bearing face brick with a roof of <b>flat</b> metal <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} is via the north-western elevation. A stair, running {{parallel to the}} elevation, rises to a timber landing covered by a corrugated iron skillion roof. A single timber door opens to the interior from the landing. The elevation consists of a front verandah that has been enclosed with sheeting. Two windows {{to the left of}} the entrance are aluminium-framed sliding windows; on the right, there are eight sets of louvres. The window hoods consist of <b>flat</b> metal <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{intention}} was to have people {{with little or no}} fabrication experience start with a set of comprehensive plans and work up to a bolt-together operation, with complex components provided from the factory. [...] In order to simplify construction, there were few curved surfaces and most of the fuselage was made up of <b>flat</b> aluminum <b>sheeting.</b> The only major components with compound curves were the engine cowling and landing gear spats which were made of fiberglass. The fuselage is constructed of aluminum angle braces bolted together to form a truss frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is timber-framed, primarily clad with chamferboards, and is elevated on concrete stumps with timber batten infill panels. Timber stairs with no handrails are located at front and rear. The building has a corrugated, galvanised-iron, hipped roofline that extends {{across the front}} and rear verandahs. The verandah is partially enclosed with shutters and open areas are shaded by timber blinds and awnings of <b>flat</b> metal <b>sheeting.</b> The west end of the rear verandah is built-in with chamferboards along its side and fibrous-cement sheeting on the rear. The house has casement windows and a brick chimney.|$|R
50|$|The {{two other}} meathouses are {{south-west}} of the homestead and are located adjacent {{to one another}} on different levels. Both are of timber frame and slab construction. The low-set meathouse has vertical timber slabs with wire netting infill above, while the high-set meat house is of drop-slab construction. Numerous artefacts {{from the days when}} the meathouses were in constant use remain within the two buildings, including chopping blocks, hooks for hanging meat, and wooden draining tables. Some of the cracks between the slabs have had <b>flat</b> iron <b>sheeting</b> fixed over to prevent the meat becoming fly-blown.|$|R
5000|$|The BD-4 {{used more}} {{conventional}} construction techniques, {{based on a}} simple high-wing design, and had few curved surfaces. Most of the fuselage was <b>flat</b> aluminum <b>sheeting,</b> the only major components with compound curves being the fiberglass engine cowling and landing gear pants. One innovation was [...] "panel-rib" [...] construction which reduced building time of the wing. The wing was constructed in sections using ribs whose upper lip was [...] "extended" [...] horizontally to form part of the wing surface as well. The wing was built up by sliding these sections together over the tubular spar and joining them where they met.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{is built}} on a concrete slab on the ground, measuring 5.2 metres by 4.5 metres. It is an approximately 3 metres high timber framed structure enclosed along the western half with <b>flat</b> asbestos cement <b>sheeting</b> and along the eastern half with chickenwire. The structure has a super-6 corrugated asbestos cement skillion roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} measures 3.3 metres by 2.2 metres. It is an approximately 2.5 metres high, timber {{framed structure}} with timber boarding {{to the lower}} walls and angled metal mesh above the north side. The south side is fully enclosed with <b>flat</b> asbestos cement <b>sheeting.</b> The skillion roof is sheeted with super-6 corrugated asbestos cement.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} has an earth {{floor and}} measures 4.2 metres by 2 metres. It is an approximately 2.5 metres high timber framed structure with <b>flat</b> asbestos cement <b>sheeting</b> to the south-east corner and chickenwire {{to the remaining}} walls. The structure has a super-6 corrugated asbestos cement skillion roof to the east end with chickenwire to the west end.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{is built}} on a concrete slab on the ground, measuring 5.5 metres by 1.7 metres. It is an approximately 3 metres high tubular steel-framed structure covered in chainwire. The south half of the gable roof is covered with super-6 corrugated asbestos cement sheeting. The upper parts of the south wall are enclosed with <b>flat</b> asbestos cement <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
25|$|When completed, the {{parabolic}} {{roof was}} clad in <b>flat</b> aluminium <b>sheeting,</b> folded over angled timber fillets which ran horizontally {{along the length}} of the roof. Panels of translucent corrugated fibreglass sheeting ran along the apex and in six vertical strips at the southern end. By 1968, problems with leaking led to the roof sheeting being replaced with corrugated aluminium. Repairs and changes have been made since and all of the original translucent sections of the parabolic roof have been replaced with opaque sheeting. Thus, internal features such as the side-lighting of the sanctuary wall and indirect light along the apex of the parabolic ceiling have been lost.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{is built}} on a concrete slab on the ground, measuring 1.6 metres by 1.4 metres. It is an approximately 2 metres high timber framed structure with walls enclosed on the east, south and west sides with <b>flat</b> asbestos cement <b>sheeting.</b> It {{is open to the}} north side. The structure has a super-6 corrugated asbestos cement skillion roof attached to the house.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} measures 4.6 metres by 2.5 metres. It is an approximately 2.5 metres high {{structure with}} concrete blockwork base walls and tubular steel posts supporting upper level metal mesh and a super-6 corrugated asbestos cement skillion roof. <b>Flat</b> asbestos cement <b>sheeting</b> {{is located on}} the west wall. The enclosure has elaborate timber perches and a steel framed and sheeted gate.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{is built}} on a concrete slab on the ground, measuring 4.4 metres by 1.8 metres. It is an approximately 3 metres high timber framed structure with walls enclosed to the eastern half with <b>flat</b> asbestos cement <b>sheeting</b> and on the western half with birdwire. The structure has a super-6 corrugated asbestos cement gable roof to the eastern half and birdwire to the western half.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{is built}} on a concrete slab on the ground, measuring 1.2 metres by 1.2 metres. It is an approximately 1.2 metres high timber framed structure on concrete base walls. The east and west walls are enclosed with <b>flat</b> asbestos cement <b>sheeting.</b> The north and south walls are open. The structure has a super-6 asbestos cement skillion roof. The enclosure contains an early chopping block possibly from the house.|$|R
