40|$|<b>Intershaft</b> {{squeeze film}} dampers were {{investigated}} for damping of dual rotor aircraft jet engines. It {{was thought that}} the <b>intershaft</b> damper would enhance {{the stability of the}} rotor-bearing system. Unfortunately, it was determined that the <b>intershaft</b> squeeze film damper was unstable above the engine's first critical speed. Here, a stability analysis of rotors incorporating <b>intershaft</b> squeeze film dampers is discussed. A rotor model consisting of two Jeffcott rotors with two <b>intershaft</b> squeeze film dampers was investigated. Examining the system characteristic equation for the conditions at which the roots indicate an ever-growing unstable motion results in the stability conditions. The cause of the instability is identified as the rotation of the oil in the damper clearance. Several proposed configurations of <b>intershaft</b> squeeze film dampers are discussed, and it is shown that the <b>intershaft</b> dampers are stable supercritically only with a configuration in which the oil film does not rotate...|$|E
40|$|An {{instability}} {{associated with}} an <b>intershaft</b> squeeze film damper is described. The squeeze film is located between the <b>intershaft</b> bearing outer race and the low-speed shaft of a five-bearing, two-spool test rig. The instability is dominated by response of the third system mode to destabilizing excitation of the type described by Hibner, et al. Installing a spring cage {{in place of the}} <b>intershaft</b> damper removes the instability and produces satisfactory performance throughout the operating range...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic {{analysis of a}} two-spool gas turbine helicopter engine incorporating <b>intershaft</b> rolling element bearings between the gas generator and power turbine rotors. The analysis includes the nonlinear effects of a squeeze film bearing incorporated on the gas generator rotor. The analysis includes critical speeds and forced response {{of the system and}} indicates that substantial dynamic loads may be imposed on the <b>intershaft</b> bearings and main bearing supports with an improperly designed squeeze film bearing. A comparison of theoretical and experimental gas generator rotor response is presented illustrating the nonlinear characteristics of the squeeze film bearing. It was found that large <b>intershaft</b> bearing forces may occur even though the engine is not operating at a resonant condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{pursuit of}} high Mach number flight {{presents}} several {{challenges to the}} airframe and engine design engineers. Most obvious is the resulting high temperatures encountered as the aircraft approaches Mach 3 and above. The encountered high temperatures and shaft speeds of engines require rethinking {{in the areas of}} material selections, component design and component operating life. In the area of sump compartment sealing, {{one of the most difficult}} sealing applications is the sealing of an engine s rear sump. Normally this sump will need some method of sealing between two rotating shafts. This sealing operation is done with an <b>intershaft</b> seal. The aft sump region also presents an additional design requirement for the <b>intershaft</b> seal. This region has to absorb the engine s thermal growth, which means that in the seal area, axial movement, on the order of 0. 30 in., between the rotating shafts must be tolerated. A new concept or new technology of sealing an <b>intershaft</b> sump configuration is being developed. This concept, called a rotating <b>intershaft</b> brush seal has key attributes that will allow this seal to perform better, in the demanding environment of sealing an aft sump with two rotating shafts, when compared to today s sealing technology of labyrinth and carbon se...|$|E
40|$|The Lubrication Branch has two active {{programs}} that are developing gas turbine engine mainshaft air/oil seals. Both of these programs, {{one of which is}} with General Electric Aircraft Engines and the other with Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, are addressing counter-rotating <b>intershaft</b> applications which involve very high rubbing velocities. The objectives and requirements of these efforts are briefly addressed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} study of a dual rotor test rig. This machine, which was developed and built at the Laboratoire de Tribologie et Dynamique des SystÃƒÂ¨mes, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, will be first presented. It is composed of two coaxial shafts that are connected by an <b>intershaft</b> bearing and rotate independently, each one driven by its own motor. Their lateral vibrations and whirling motion are coupled by the <b>intershaft</b> bearing. The experimental tests consisting in run-ups and the associated measured unbalance response of the dual rotor will be investigated. The influence of the rotation of each rotor on the critical speeds and the associated amplitudes will be discussed. Moreover, this paper presents a numerical model of the dual rotor. Correlations between the experimental and numerical tests will be investigated. The objective {{is to be able}} to predict phenomena observed in experiments, starting from a rather fine numerical model...|$|E
40|$|A {{dual shaft}} test rig with an <b>intershaft</b> bearing is studied. A {{squeeze film damper}} (SFD) is {{installed}} {{on one of the}} bearings of the rig. Firstly, the design approach is presented which consists to determine the appropriate damping level for the SFD with respect to the eigenmodes of the studied structure and SFD internal design. Secondly, the experiment results are presented and discussed {{from the point of view}} of the successfullness of the SFD design and the validity of used models...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Fundamental rotor tones are {{generally}} the dominant components in engine vibration spectra, consistent with linear systems. On one airplane model, multiple harmonics and sum and difference tones occasionally appeared, indicating a non-linear me&-nism within the engine/airframe system. Associated cabin noise squawks {{led to an}} investigation to determine {{the sources of the}} non-line&ties and the controlling parameters. A gap in an <b>intershaft</b> bearing, connecting the high and low engine rotors, was theo-rized to be the smuce. A math model with a non-linear bearing conJirmed the expected behavior and fulther reinforced the theory. Rotor unbalance influence coefficients, derived from a system model, demon-strated how a statistically low probability combination o...|$|E
40|$|Seal {{technology}} development {{is an important}} part of the Air Force's participation in the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) initiative, the joint DOD, NASA, ARPA, and industry endeavor to double turbine engine capabilities by the turn of the century. Significant performance and efficiency improvements can be obtained through reducing internal flow system leakage, but seal environment requirements continue to become more extreme as the engine thermodynamic cycles advance towards these IHPTET goals. Brush seal technology continues to be pursued by the Air Force to reduce leakage at the required conditions. Likewise, challenges in engine mainshaft air/oil seals are also being addressed. Counter-rotating <b>intershaft</b> applications within the IHPTET initiative involve very high rubbing velocities. This viewgraph presentation briefly describes past and current seal research and development programs and gives a summary of seal applications in demonstrator and developmental engine testing...|$|E
40|$|The 2007 NASA Seal/Secondary Air System {{workshop}} {{covered the}} following topics: (i) Overview of NASA's new Orion project aimed at {{developing a new}} spacecraft that will fare astronauts to the International Space Station, the Moon, Mars, and beyond; (ii) Overview of NASA's fundamental aeronautics technology project; (iii) Overview of NASA Glenn s seal project aimed at developing advanced seals for NASA's turbomachinery, space, and reentry vehicle needs; (iv) Reviews of NASA prime contractor, vendor, and university advanced sealing concepts, test results, experimental facilities, and numerical predictions; and (v) Reviews of material development programs relevant to advanced seals development. Turbine engine {{studies have shown that}} reducing seal leakage as well as high-pressure turbine (HPT) blade tip clearances will reduce fuel burn, lower emissions, retain exhaust gas temperature margin, and increase range. Turbine seal development topics covered include a method for fast-acting HPT blade tip clearance control, noncontacting low-leakage seals, <b>intershaft</b> seals, and a review of engine seal performance requirements for current and future Army engine platforms...|$|E
40|$|About {{four years}} ago, work was {{completed}} on a 36 inch diameter gas to gas carbon ring seal used to buffer low pressure turbine {{air at the}} rim of the forward outer flowpath on the GE 36 unducted fan (UDF) engine. At about the same time, we were developing a long life counter-rotating <b>intershaft</b> air-oil seal of approximately 7. 6 inch diameter for operation at 800 fps, 800 F, and 50 psid. Although we were successful in meeting most program goals with a split ring seal of the axial bushing type, the seal with the greatest payoff in life and air leakage rates, bearing many features in common with the GE 36 seal, could not be successfully tested because of the structural weakness of the primary seal ring carbon material. This was a split ring seal using a hybrid combination of orifice compensated hydrostatic and shrouded hydrodynamic gas bearings. We are presently working to develop this design in conjunction with high strength materials being developed by Pure Carbon Co. In the area of engine secondary gas flow path-sealing for performance improvement, we are currently working with carbon and all metal face seals. A 15 inch diameter all metal 'aspirating' face seal, using self-acting hydrostatic bearings, was successfully tested to 700 fps, 100 psid, and 1000 F, demonstrating long life at flow reduction of 86 percent compared to a 'best' labyrinth. This seal will be developed through 1400 F, 900 fps, and 350 psid. The seal 'aspirates' closed at about idle speed pressure during engine start and reopens at engine shutdown. A hydraulic thrust balance seal, currently using orifice compensated hydrostatics, is under development. Other aspects of these projects are briefly covered...|$|E
