2500|$|Varieties of Asia Minor Greek are {{now almost}} extinct, but were widely spoken until 1923 in central Turkey, and {{especially}} in Cappadocia, forming a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> influenced by the Turkish language. In this group, linguists include not only the Cappadocian Greek but also the dialect spoken in Pharasa (Develi in Kayseri) and other nearby villages (Afshar-Köy, Çukuri), and the dialect of Sille (near Iconium). In 1923 Asia Minor Greek speakers were forced to emigrate to Greece after the Greek Genocide (1919–1921) during the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. In 2005, professors Mark Janse and Dimitris Papazachariou discovered {{that there are still}} native speakers of the Mistiot dialect of Cappadocian in Central and Northern Greece. Cappadocian Greek diverged from the other Byzantine Greek varieties earlier, beginning with the Turkish conquests of central Asia Minor in the 11th and 12th centuries, and so developed several radical features, such as the loss of the gender for nouns. Having been isolated from the crusader conquests (Fourth Crusade) and the later Venetian influence of the Greek coast, it retained the Ancient Greek terms for many words that were replaced with Romance ones in Demotic Greek. The poet Rumi, whose name means [...] "Roman", referring to his residence amongst the [...] "Roman" [...] Greek speakers of Cappadocia, wrote a few poems in Cappadocian Greek, leaving one of the earliest attestations of the dialect.|$|E

50|$|DNA {{profiling}} {{from the}} 1990s {{has revealed that}} many classical grape varieties are crosses with parents in both the Frankish and Hunnic groups.

Thus, the Frankish <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> {{does not have a}} totally separate pedigree from the Hunnic group. This has led to a resurged interest in the Hunnic grapes, many of which lead a dwindling existence and are on the brink of becoming extinct.|$|E
