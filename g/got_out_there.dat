2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on August 8, 2006. Cassie made television appearances on MTV's Total Request Live and BET's 106 & Park to support the album on its release week. Her first televised performances were described as [...] "rocky" [...] and [...] "less-than-stellar," [...] but Diddy {{said that it was}} due to her inexperience, continuing that he would be [...] "with her through her development," [...] and has no [...] "question on her ability [...]" [...] Cassie later added: [...] "I don’t think I should have done those shows. But I didn't know I had a choice. I would sit in rehearsals and sing full songs a cappella. I wasn't Beyoncé, but I wasn't fucking up. Then I <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and was like, 'Oh my God, millions of people are watching me right now. I have stage fright.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2006, Dobson {{returned}} to the studio to finish her second album, Sunday Love. [...] Musicians and songwriters she collaborated with during the recording process include Holly Knight, Nina Gordon, Kay Hanley, John 5, Billy Steinberg, Matthew Wilder, Cyndi Lauper, Courtney Love, Joan Jett, and Rancid's Tim Armstrong. Sunday Love was not released at the time, due to Dobson being terminated by Island Records {{just days before the}} album was scheduled for release. The album was reviewed favorably in both Spin and Vibe magazine. [...] "My real good fans, my hardcore fans, have it, so that's most important," [...] Dobson says. [...] "At least it <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to a few hands, and now it's time to make a record on my own terms." [...] "It was sad," [...] says Dobson. [...] "But instead of sitting there and being depressed and begging people for the record, I went back to the studio, got people that I knew, friends that I knew, and I started again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Know Belllounds? Me? Wal, he's {{the best}} friend I ever had when I was at Kremmlin'. I lived there several years. My husband had stock there. In fact, Bill started us in the cattle business. But we <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of <b>there</b> an' come here, where Bob died, an' I've been stuck ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The news of {{the battle}} came next day; He was {{scheduled}} missing. I hurried away, <b>Got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> visited the field, And sent home word that a search revealed He {{was one of the}} slain; though, lying alone [...] And stript, his body had not been known.|$|E
6000|$|... “They {{look in a}} slovenly state indeed,” he said to himself, “infinitely {{worse than}} the Chilian ships did when we first <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> There are two or three by the flag-ship that look in a fair state of order, but the rest might be a fleet of big colliers, with their yards up and down anyhow, their rigging all slack, and {{everything}} dirty and untidy.” ...|$|E
60|$|So once--it {{was late}} on a Thursday evening in autumn, and wild weather outside, terribly dark, and raining so heavily and blowing so hard that {{the walls of the}} cottage shook again--they were all sitting {{together}} by the fireside, each of them busy with something or other, when suddenly some one rapped three times against the window-pane. The man went out to see what could be the matter, and when he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> stood a great big white bear.|$|E
60|$|DAWKER. [Sullenly] It's not my fault, ma'am; he shouldn't have {{threatened}} and goaded me on. Besides, it's <b>got</b> <b>out</b> that <b>there's</b> a scandal; common {{talk in the}} village--not the facts, but quite enough to cook their goose here. They'll have to go. Better have done with it, anyway, than have enemies at your door.|$|R
5000|$|... "Every {{time one}} of the Flames left, it was on account of money. (Brown) didn't want to pay the money that was {{supposed}} to be paid to us. He stiffed the heck out of us man. (Brown's family), now they're fighting over our (the Flames') money. We <b>got</b> money <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and still can't receive it. We're owed so much money, it ain't funny." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, you've <b>got</b> {{to stand}} <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and give orders and 'tend {{to your own}} {{business}} afore you think o' speaking to your own flesh and blood," [...] he said aggrievedly. [...] "That's all YOU care!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot suggest anything. I will go ashore at once. The waterman at our {{landing stage}} must have noticed if two ladies <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> He {{could hardly have}} helped doing so, for it would be curious, their coming ashore alone after dark. Then I {{will go to the}} other landing places and ask there. There are always boys hanging about to earn a few pence by taking care of boats. I will be back as soon as I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We would rather, if possible, be put {{on board}} some ship {{on her way to}} Portugal," [...] Terence said. [...] "If we landed in England, we should have to report ourselves, and might be sent to a depot, and be months before we <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> again. I spoke to the captain of the Cerf about it, this morning; and he was good enough to promise that, as soon as he had {{repaired}} damages, he would run out into the Bay, and put us on board the first ship he overhauled bound for the Peninsula." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{tears came}} into Northwick's eyes, {{and he tried}} to say, [...] "Why, thank you, Elbridge," [...] but the door shut upon his failure, and Elbridge mounted to his place and drove away. Northwick had been {{able to get out of}} his house only upon {{condition}} that he should behave as if he were going to be gone on an ordinary journey. He had to keep the same terms with himself on the way to the station. When he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> he said to Elbridge, [...] "I've left a note for you on my desk. I'm sorry to be leaving home--at such a time--when you've--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my dear, or Mr. Ruskin {{would not}} have let him go. I saw him as he went out, and shook hands with him and, except that nasty bandage over his face, he looked quite himself again. As I told you, a broken {{collarbone}} is a mere nothing and, now we know where the bullet went and have <b>got</b> it <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> is no occasion for the slightest anxiety.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I've <b>got</b> {{a friend}} <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that's <b>got</b> a coal mine, {{and he thinks}} he can work me in somehow. I guess he can: I've tried pretty much everything. Why don't you come <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and start a newspaper? We've got a town that's bound to grow." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first two}} rows ... were {{occupied}} by the other dressers, and behind a second partition stood the pupils, packed like herrings in a barrel, but not so quiet, as those behind them were continually pressing on those before and were continually struggling to relieve themselves of it, and had not infrequently to be <b>got</b> <b>out</b> exhausted. <b>There</b> was also a continual calling out of [...] "Heads, Heads" [...] to those about the table whose heads interfered with the sightseers.|$|R
6000|$|... "And, moreover," [...] Captain O'Connor went on, [...] "even {{if he did}} do this, which I don't know, for I {{never asked}} him" [...] ("Trust you for that," [...] the colonel muttered), [...] "you are not his {{commanding}} officer, though you are mine, {{and that is the}} matter that I came to speak to you about. You see there is no one in whose charge I can leave him, and the lad wants to go with us; he would enlist as a drummer, if he could go no other way, and when he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> I should get the adjutant to tell him off as my soldier servant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At Reading I had {{to change}} not only my {{carriage}} but my station. However, I was {{in time for the}} last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only passenger who <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> {{and there was no one}} upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go." ...|$|E
60|$|All who did so were, {{without the}} loss of a minute's time, thrown down into the hold of their ship, and the hatches secured over them. It had before been {{arranged}} that Ralph should take the command of the corsair, having with him France, Auvergne, and Germany. As soon, therefore, as the captives were fastened below, Gervaise called the knights of the other four langues back to the deck of the galley. The lashings were cast off, she was pushed {{from the side of the}} prize, and the oars were <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> was no time to be lost, for the largest of the three pirate ships, which had, directly it was seen that her consort was captured, poured two heavy broadsides into the prize, was now approaching--rowing but slowly, however, for the third vessel to come up.|$|E
5000|$|Berman later {{addressed}} Safran's {{description of}} the controversial scene. [...] "Considering how terrified Blair looked {{at the end of}} their encounter, and how quickly she <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of <b>there,</b> the show is sending a mixed message at best." [...] She went on to state, [...] "We have no right to expect Gossip Girl to be a paragon of morality, or even realism, but the idea that true love requires taking a shard of glass to the face is disturbing even in this alternate, soap-opera dimension." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, quite well," [...] {{the lady}} answered, {{arranging}} my footstool more comfortably as she spoke. [...] "He's <b>got</b> a farm <b>out</b> <b>there</b> now, and hardly practises at all. How queer it is! One always finds one knows people in common. Is Dr. Ivor {{a friend of}} yours?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Saturday Night Fish Fry" [...] {{was first}} {{recorded}} by Eddie Williams and His Brown Buddies, which featured the talk-singing vocals of Ellis Walsh. The act had {{recently had a}} number 2 R&B hit with the song [...] "Broken Hearted", and [...] "Saturday Night Fish Fry" [...] {{was intended to be}} the band's followup. However, the acetate for the Williams band version found its way to Louis Jordan's agent and as Williams later recalled, [...] "They <b>got</b> theirs <b>out</b> <b>there</b> first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to bother}} you much with what {{happened}} to me personally," [...] he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to hear; [...] "yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me--and into my thoughts. It was somber enough too--and pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.|$|E
6000|$|And then--he did {{not quite}} know how--insulated from the January air by {{laughter}} and the scent of fur and violets, he was between them walking to their tram. It was like an experience out of the [...] "Arabian Nights," [...] or something of that sort, an intoxication which made one say one was going their way, though {{one would have to}} come all the way back in the same beastly tram. Nothing so warming had ever happened to him as sitting between them on that drive, so that he forgot the note in his pocket, and his desire to relieve the anxiety of the [...] "old man," [...] his father. At the tram's terminus they all <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> issued a purr of invitation to come and see them some time; a clear: [...] "Jock'll love to see you!" [...] A low laugh: [...] "You awful gairl!" [...] And a flash of cunning zigzagged across his brain. Taking off his hat, he said: ...|$|E
60|$|They drove quite {{down to the}} end of the Cascine, and <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{to admire}} the gay monument, with the painted bust, of the poor young Indian prince who died in Florence. They strolled all about, talking of the old times in the Cascine, twenty years before; and walking up the road beside the canal, while the {{carriage}} slowly followed, they stopped to enjoy the peasants lying asleep in the grass on the other bank. Colville and Effie gathered wild-flowers, and piled them in her mother's lap when she remounted to the carriage and drove along while they made excursions into the little dingles beside the road. Some people who overtook them in these sylvan pleasures reported the fact at a reception to which they were going, and Mrs. Amsden, whose mind had been gradually clearing under the simultaneous withdrawal of Imogene and Colville from society, professed herself again as thickly clouded as a weather-glass before a storm. She appealed to the sympathy of others against this hardship.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for the Los Angeles Times, Judy Berman {{addressed}} Safran's description of Blair during the scene. [...] "Considering how terrified Blair {{looked at the}} end of their encounter, and how quickly she <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of <b>there,</b> the show is sending a mixed message at best."

60|$|Captain Hampton's {{arrangements}} occupied him {{little more}} than half-an-hour. He bought a case of cartridges for his revolver, took a passage for himself, {{and one in the}} steerage for Jacob. He hesitated as to whether to get the boy some more clothes, but decided to put that off till he <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> as <b>there</b> might be some slight difference in make that would attract attention; the only thing he bought for him was a small portmanteau. After taking his passage, therefore, he went home and read the paper till Jacob came in.|$|R
5000|$|Stone went undrafted in the 2011 NBA draft. On December 9, 2011, Stone {{signed a}} two-year, $1.1 million {{contract}} with the Denver Nuggets. During training camp, Stone was quoted as saying, [...] "You <b>got</b> to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and give it your all on every possession. You can’t have any bad days.” ...|$|R
60|$|In {{passing the}} garden to reach the road, {{at a place where}} a bridle hook is driven into the wall, I saw {{something}} white moved irregularly, evidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world. My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than vision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the animal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could have <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and what mischievous person had treated it so. While untying the knot round the hook, {{it seemed to me that}} I repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o'clock in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Signor Charles, I {{was keeping}} a good lookout, {{and it is}} lucky that I was. I was farther away than I ought to have been,--I know that, for the signor {{told me not to}} go far; but I knew that the rise that I took them to was the highest in that direction, and that I could see for miles away into the Indian country. So I <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and Pedro and Gomez had got the sheep and cattle all well together, and there was no fear of them straying, for the grass there is very good. So the men lay down for their siesta, and I was {{standing}} by my horse looking over the campo. Some of the beasts seemed uneasy, and I thought that there must be a lion somewhere about. So I got on my horse, and just as I did so I heard a noise; and looking behind, where I had never dreamt of them, I saw a lot of Indians coming up at full gallop from the hollow. The cattle went off at the same instant; and I gave a shout to the men, and stuck my spurs into Carlos. It was a near touch of it, and they gave me a hard chase for the first mile; but my horse was fresher than theirs, and they gave it up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, {{though it}} was still more cold and blustering than the day before, we took to the Deserts again, for we spent our days wholly out of doors, in the sun when there was any, and in the wind which never failed. After {{threading}} the shrubby hill country at the southwest end of the town, west of the Shank-Painter Swamp, whose expressive name--for we understood it at first as a landsman naturally would--gave it importance in our eyes, we crossed the sands to the shore south of Race Point and three miles distant, and thence roamed round eastward through the desert to where we had left the sea the evening before. We travelled five or six miles after we <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> on a curving line, and might have gone nine or ten, over vast platters of pure sand, from the midst of which we could not see a particle of vegetation, excepting the distant thin fields of Beach-grass, which crowned and made the ridges toward which the sand sloped upward on each side;--all the while {{in the face of}} a cutting wind as cold as January; indeed, we experienced no weather so cold as this for nearly two months afterward. This desert extends from the extremity of the Cape, through Provincetown into Truro, and many a time as we were traversing it we were reminded of [...] "Riley's Narrative" [...] of his captivity in the sands of Arabia, notwithstanding the cold. Our eyes magnified the patches of Beach-grass into cornfields in the horizon, and we probably exaggerated the height of the ridges on account of the mirage. I was pleased to learn afterward, from Kalm's Travels in North America, that the inhabitants of the Lower St. Lawrence call this grass (Calamagrostis arenaria), and also Sea-lyme grass (Elymus arenarius), seigle de mer; and he adds, [...] "I have been assured that these plants grow in great plenty in Newfoundland, and on other North American shores; the places covered with them looking, at a distance, like cornfields; which might explain the passage in our northern accounts [he wrote in 1749] of the excellent wine land [Vinland det goda, Translator], which mentions that they had found whole fields of wheat growing wild." ...|$|E

The next one was an aunt of Davy Crockett, and asked eight dollars {{a day for a}} room {{furnished}} in imitation of the Alamo, with prunes for breakfast and one hour's conversation with her for dinner.

50|$|Roxxi {{was exposed}} to the music styles of various DJs at her mother's club. She taught herself how to play by researching and {{watching}} other DJs perform. From 2005 to 2006 Roxxi played at many low-key promotions at her mother's club gaining confidence and skills through each event. Very soon word <b>got</b> <b>out</b> that <b>there</b> was an Indian female DJ around and journalists were interested in hearing her story.
