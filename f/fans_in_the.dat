5|$|After the match, which Galatasaray won 4–1 on penalties, {{approximately}} 300 Arsenal <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Finsbury Park area of Islington in London attacked Turkish {{restaurants and}} businesses, with bottles {{being used to}} break windows. They then broke into an apartment building to threaten Kosovan refugees with a knife, mistakenly believing them to be Turkish. Six people were arrested and three Metropolitan Police officers were injured. In Turkey, nine people were accidentally shot and injured by Galatasaray fans firing guns in celebration despite police warning them not to.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls.

5|$|Pre-game media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn being left out of the national championship game, a point of controversy for Auburn <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weeks leading up to the game. Much was made of that and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom was considered among the best at his position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall had a record-breaking season. Both teams also had high-ranked defenses, and Tech's appearance in the 2000 Sugar Bowl also was mentioned {{in the run-up to the}} game.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{has been}} dubbed into several other languages, {{including}} Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It {{is also one of}} the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong Simpsons <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the day {{large numbers}} of fans, both English and Turkish, were seen {{throughout}} the city and at the airport. Later, {{large numbers of}} Galatasaray fans congregated in Copenhagen's City Hall Square, raising the Turkish flag in the square. Arsenal fans congregated in nearby bars. Galatasaray fans attempted to provoke the Arsenal <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bars, and the two sides began chanting at each other until bottles were thrown from both sides around 16:00. The Danish police then moved in to separate the fans, and moved the Galatasaray fans back towards the square.|$|E
5|$|Away {{fans are}} {{normally}} accommodated {{in the corner}} of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, such as the Old Firm derbies, the whole of the Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host countries. During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to grow up and mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E
5|$|Chicago White Sox manager Al López {{watched the}} game {{along with his}} {{pitching}} coach to scout their potential NL opponents for the World Series. The start of Game 1 was delayed 45 minutes due to rain, leaving only 18,297 <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stadium once the game was underway. The Dodgers opened the game quickly as Charlie Neal singled with one out, advanced to second base on a ground out, and scored on a single by Norm Larker to give the Dodgers an early 1–0 lead. Dodgers starter Danny McDevitt held the Braves scoreless in the first inning, but was driven from {{the game in the}} second. After a line out to open the inning Johnny Logan walked, Del Crandall singled, and Bill Bruton singled to bring home Logan and tie the game at 1. Larry Sherry entered in relief of McDevitt, who pitched just 1 innings. Carl Willey, the Braves' pitcher, reached base on an error to load the bases. Crandall then scored on a ground out by Bobby Ávila to give the Braves a 2–1 lead before Sherry finished out the second.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord had {{its first}} {{training}} {{session in the}} Kuip on 26 June 2013 in front of 5,000 <b>fans.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first half of July they played and won four friendly games against amateur sides. Feyenoord played Eerste Divisie side FC Dordrecht to close out their Dutch summer friendlies and drew the game away in Dordrecht. On 21 July Feyenoord had its annual Open Dag (Open Day) which was visited by 40,000 fans. Four new players were flown into the Kuip per helicopter and the full team was officially presented to the fans. Feyenoord then went on a training camp in Levico Terme and played the Italian side Hellas Verona there, a game that ended in a defeat. Feyenoord ended the pre-season preparation with a 3–1 home win over Getafe.|$|E

5|$|Hamm was a {{key part}} of the U.S. team at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta; this was the first Olympic tournament to include women's soccer. The U.S. faced Denmark in their first {{preliminary}} round match. Hamm scored a goal and served an assist to Tiffeny Milbrett to lead the U.S. to a 3–0 win. The team defeated Sweden 2–1 next at the Orlando Citrus Bowl. After tying China 0–0 in their final preliminary round match, the U.S. finished second in Group E. Defeating Norway in the semi-finals, the team faced China in the final. Hamm played despite having foot and groin injuries, suffered during team training and the match against Sweden. Although she was carried off by stretcher in the final minute, her team won their first Olympic gold medal with a 2–1 win witnessed by 76,481 <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stadium – the largest crowd for a soccer event in the history of the Olympics and the largest crowd for a women's sports event in the United States.|$|E
5|$|He won {{his first}} title with Galatasaray on 5 May, with a 4–2 win over Sivasspor. In Galatasary's derby match against Istanbul rivals Fenerbahçe on 12 May, Drogba and his Ivorian {{teammate}} Emmanuel Eboue were subjects of racist chants from opposing <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team's 2–1 loss, but no fine or bans were handed down to the supporters or the club. On 11 August, he scored the only goal in the 2013 Turkish Super Cup against the same opponents, and he scored two second-half goals in a 2–1 away win against fellow city rivals Beşiktaş on 22 September, although the match was abandoned due to hooliganism from fans of the opponents.|$|E
5|$|In week 9, the Pros battled the Decatur Staleys {{in front}} of 3,000 <b>fans.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first quarter, Staley back Ralph Lanum scored a 23-yard rushing {{touchdown}}. This touchdown was Lanum's only score of the entire 1920 season. Ed Sternaman of the Staleys scored a 10-yard rushing touchdown in the second quarter. Also, George Halas caught a 15-yard receiving touchdown from Jimmy Conzelman to have the game 21–0 going into halftime. In the third quarter, the Staleys did not score, but the Pros put points on the board. Wally Hess caught a 15-yard pass from Emmett Specht for a touchdown. In the final quarter, Halas scored a 26-yard receiving touchdown, and the game ended 28–7.|$|E

2500|$|An {{additional}} {{method of}} long-term ocean-based sequestration is to gather crop residue such as corn stalks or excess hay into large weighted bales of biomass and deposit it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alluvial <b>fan</b> {{areas of the}} deep ocean basin. [...] Dropping these residues <b>in</b> alluvial <b>fans</b> would cause the residues to be quickly buried <b>in</b> silt on <b>the</b> sea floor, sequestering the biomass for very long time spans. [...] Alluvial <b>fans</b> exist <b>in</b> all of <b>the</b> world's oceans and seas where river deltas fall {{off the edge of}} the continental shelf such as <b>the</b> Mississippi alluvial <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gulf of Mexico and <b>the</b> Nile alluvial <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea. A downside, however, would be an increase in aerobic bacteria growth due to the introduction of biomass, leading to more competition for oxygen resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep sea, similar to the oxygen minimum zone.|$|R
40|$|We generalize the Allais common {{consequence}} {{effect by}} describing three common consequence effect conditions and characterizing their {{implications for the}} probability weighting function in rank-dependent expected utility. The three conditions—horizontal, vertical, and diagonal shifts within the probability triangle—are necessary and sufficient for different curvature properties of the probability weighting function. The first two conditions, shifts in probability mass from the lowest to middle outcomes and middle to highest outcomes respectively, are alternative conditions for concavity and convexity of the weighting function. The third condition, decreasing Pratt-Arrow absolute concavity, is consistent with recently proposed weighting functions. The three conditions collectively characterize where indifference curves fan out and where they <b>fan</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> common consequence conditions indicate that for nonlinear weighting functions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of rank-dependent expected utility, there must exist a region where indifference curves <b>fan</b> out <b>in</b> one direction and <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other direction...|$|R
