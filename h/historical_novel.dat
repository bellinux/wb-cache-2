40|$|For anyone {{interested}} {{in the past and}} its representation, <b>historical</b> <b>novels</b> are difficult to ignore. Unlike a multitude of other alternative representations of the past that have been brought into historical view, however, <b>historical</b> <b>novels</b> have been largely excluded from scholarly historical analysis. Although historians might find <b>historical</b> <b>novels</b> fascinating, might read them voraciously, might teach courses on or around them, and might even write them while on sabbaticals, this engagement is not reflected in the pages of their work.

He also wrote the short <b>historical</b> <b>novels</b> Hudi časi (1894, {{describing the}} time of the Illyrian provinces) and Takšni so (1900, about Catholic martyrs in the Protestant era, but they are thought to be lacking in terms of content.|$|R

5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} <b>{{historical}}</b> <b>novel</b> {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other <b>historical</b> <b>novel,</b> Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E
