5|$|Immediately {{following}} the tornado in Comfrey there was {{uncertainty about the}} town's long-term survival. Then in the week {{following the}} tornado the town decided to rebuild the school, {{and as a result}} most of Comfrey's businesses decided to follow suit. Ground was broken on the new school early the next year, and it opened to students on October 4, 1999. The population of Comfrey is down to 367 from the 425 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tornado hit.|$|E

25|$|The {{function}} {{of art as}} a formative model was something about which Bournonville felt very strongly.

25|$|With its decline, {{the area}} was {{gradually}} incorporated into the Iberian kingdom forming one of its duchies (saeristavo) in the 5th century and its peoples were eventually assimilated into the Georgians proper. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> name Hereti {{first appeared in the}} Georgian sources.

Shortly, before the Byzantines took the area back, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partly built edifice, and turned it into a garbage dump, which is what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Caliph Omar took the city in the 630s.|$|E
25|$|Prodi {{had built}} his {{government}} around a coalition called The Union, {{which consisted of}} a large number of smaller parties.

His sister released a photograph of Waskow taken while he was a lieutenant, after adding another bar to reflect his captain's rank when he died.|$|E
25|$|Cantonese {{people also}} {{have their own}} schools of kung fu. Originally disorganized, the {{fighting}} techniques of Cantonese people were grouped into different schools between 18th to 19th century. At that time, due to ineptitude of the Qing Empire's government, pirates and bandits were rampant in the empire's fringe regions such as Lingnan. This resulted in Cantonese starting to want to protect themselves, and thus the proliferation of martial arts learning. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Cantonese people organized their fighting techniques into schools, forming the martial arts schools seen among Cantonese today. Martial arts folk heroes from that period, such as Wong Fei-hung, are now popular topics of Cantonese films.|$|E
25|$|Within Iraq, Annandale {{collected}} his specimens from a sandy lake-bed deposit, in {{the vicinity}} of Nasiriyah on the Euphrates. Eames and Wilkins found the species in borings made in the Hammar Marshes, and Plaziat and Younis found it in other localities of the Hammar Formation; they described it as a typical species of this formation. The deposits in Iraq where the species has been found are in brackish habitat (although Annandale believed the deposits to be freshwater, this was due to reworking), toward the outer edge of tidal influence in the Euphrates and Tigris. Much of the species' former habitat, as evidenced by subfossil remains, is now less brackish than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> fossils were deposited, meaning it is less likely to be extant in such places.|$|E

25|$|In 610, the Sassanid Empire {{drove the}} Byzantine Empire {{out of the}} Middle East, giving the Jews control of Jerusalem {{for the first time}} in centuries. The Jews in Palestine were allowed to set up a vassal state under the Sassanid Empire called the Sassanid Jewish Commonwealth which lasted for five years. Jewish rabbis ordered the restart of animal {{sacrifice}} for the first time since the time of Second Temple and started to reconstruct the Jewish Temple. Shortly before the Byzantines took the area back five years later in 615, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partially built Jewish Temple edifice and turned it into a garbage dump, which is what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Rashidun Caliph Umar took the city in 637.|$|E
25|$|India, which boasted a substantion East Syrian {{community}} {{at least as}} early as the 3rd century (the Saint Thomas Christians), became a metropolitan province of the Church of the East in the 7th century. Although few references to its clergy have survived, the colophon of a manuscript copied in 1301 in the church of Mar Quriaqos in Cranganore mentions the metropolitan Yaqob of India. The metropolitan seat for India at this period was probably Cranganore, described in this manuscript as 'the royal city', and the main strength of the East Syrian church in India was along the Malabar Coast, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese arrived in India {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century. There were also East Syrian communities on the east coast, around Madras and the shrine of Saint Thomas at Meliapur.|$|E

After Lobsang Gyatso's mortal passing in 1682, which was kept a secret for 15 years, there was a period of anarchy and invasions that eventually led to the establishment of Qing protectorate over Tibet in 1720 that would reach its peak in the 1790s in response to attacks by Nepal, be renewed in 1903 when the British invaded, and would last until 1912. Tibet became independent with the demise of the Manchu Qing dynasty and would remain so until 1950.|$|E

The survey was part of a monograph on the castle detailing its history and the phasing of the structure. Brougham is one of only a few castles in Cumbria to have undergone extensive archaeological investigation. Today, the castle is open to the public, and a museum is run by English Heritage, the successor of the Office of Works.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Tenkaichi Budōkai {{martial arts}} tournament began that Dragon Ball truly became popular, having {{recalled}} the races and tournaments in Dr. Slump. Anticipating that readers would expect Goku {{to win the}} tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw. Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans. Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created {{around the time of the}} Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the [...] "worst kind of people." [...] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. He added time travel next, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.|$|E
