5|$|Soils in {{the river}} and its basin reflect past {{glaciation}} in the area. <b>Glacial</b> <b>till</b> covers much of the river bottom in its headwaters. Further downstream there is stratified drift and alluvium in the sediments.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} the area {{consists}} of Permo-Triassic sandstones and particularly Triassic mudstones. These old rocks lie beneath sea-level and are invisible beneath drift made up of <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> deposits and post-glacial colluvium and alluvium deposits; there is a smaller amount of peat.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} is underlain by the St Maughan's Formation of the Lower Devonian age. <b>Glacial</b> <b>till</b> {{deposits of}} the Devonian age {{form part of}} the northern shore of the reservoir. The reservoir {{may be on the}} northern limb of the Cowbridge anticline.|$|E
50|$|As {{developed}} between 1894 and 1909, the Kansan Stage {{was based on}} a model that assumed that the Pleistocene deposits contained only two <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and one volcanic ash bed within Nebraska and Kansas. Of these two proposed <b>glacial</b> <b>tills,</b> the Kansan till, which defined the Kansan Stage, was the upper of the two <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and the Nebraskan till, which defined the Nebraskan Stage, was the lower of the two <b>glacial</b> <b>tills.</b> It was argued that a single paleosol developed in the Nebraskan till and interglacial deposits separated the Kansan and Nebraskan tills. The paleosol and deposits were used to define the Aftonian (interglacial) stage that separated the Kansan and Nebraskan stages.|$|R
25|$|Soil in Hamilton is predominately {{derived from}} glacial drift (glaciolacustrine sediments {{in the lower}} city; <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> in the upper city) and from {{limestone}} and shale erosion.|$|R
50|$|The {{differences}} between paraconglomerates and orthoconglomerates reflect {{differences in how}} they are deposited. Paraconglomerates are commonly either <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> or debris flow deposits. Orthoconglomerates are typically associated with aqueous currents.|$|R
5|$|While {{historically}} pure, {{the stream}} now suffers from urban stream syndrome, partially {{due to the}} amount of impervious surfaces within its watershed. Flowing over <b>glacial</b> <b>till,</b> the stream's bed is rich in cobbles and the kill supports populations of benthic macroinvertebrates, trees, shrubs, fish, birds, snapping turtles, and frogs. As of 2016, a Vassarâ€“Cornell University program is monitoring the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill.|$|E
5|$|Layers {{deposited}} {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, {{and are the}} product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area. The thickness of the <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet (30 and 270 m). This till is also what makes agriculture more prevalent in eastern South Dakota as it is extremely fertile.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} events elsewhere {{interacted with}} groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters. Many of these pit craters {{have been filled}} with water creating several crater lakes. In some places <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> and fluvial sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows that form the volcanic field. Paleosols are found, but are rare. Glaciation has left a thick blanket of till over {{nearly all of the}} volcanic deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to cliffforming exposures in several valleys.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Predicting the {{occurrence}} {{and development of}} fractures is difficult because fracturing in <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and other unconsolidated materials has been observed across many geographic areas, climates, land uses, soil types, and till units. This difficulty led to a statistical investigation of historic geologic and soil data. Soil textures and fracture depths from 9 field sites and 45 soil pedons (140 sample points) were analyzed using statistical and graphical methods. When plotted on the USDA soil texture ternary diagram, the data indicate that tills having less than 10 % clay or greater than 52 % sand are unlikely to support fracturing; conversely tills having greater than 10 % clay or less than 52 % sand {{are more likely to}} do so. Based on the 95 % hexagonal confidence region for soil texture data, tills with less than 55 % sand, 20 - 65 % silt, and 5 - 53 % clay {{would be more likely to}} form fractures. The texture classes of tills predicted to sustain fracturing were mainly clay, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, and silty clay. The depth of <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> having observed fractures ranged from 0. 5 to 215 ft. These results are useful to explain and document how fractures are created in <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and may be a useful tool for field engineers and geologists allowing them to anticipate fractures in <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> in Ohio and beyond...|$|R
50|$|The {{region of}} {{coastline}} {{is known as}} the Holderness Coast; geologically the land is formed of <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> (boulder clay), which are subject to coastal erosion. Now at sea, areas around the site are being drilled for natural gas.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of its}} length, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the vicinity}} of Fades Creek consists of alluvium, Wisconsinan Ice-Intact Stratified Drift, and resedimented or <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> such as Wisconsinan Till and Wisconsinan Bouldery Till. However, bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale also occurs in the surficial geology in the creek's vicinity, as do a few small patches of wetland.|$|R
5|$|Part of the Kingston Peak resembles <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> {{by being}} poorly sorted {{and other parts}} have large boulder-sized dropstones resting in a {{fine-grained}} matrix of sandstone and siltstone. Similar deposits are found over North America during the same period, some 700 to 800 mya. Geologists therefore hypothesize that the world {{at that time was}} affected by a very severe glaciation, perhaps the most severe in geologic history (see Snowball Earth). The youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are from basaltic lava flows.|$|E
5|$|The Proterozoic {{sedimentary}} formations of the Pahrump Group were {{deposited on}} these basement rocks. This occurred following uplift and erosion of any earlier sediments from the Proterozoic basement rocks. The Pahrump {{is composed of}} arkose conglomerate (quartz clasts in a concrete-like matrix) and mudstone in its lower part, followed by dolomite from carbonate banks topped by algal mats as stromatolites, and finished with basin-filling sediment derived from the above, including possible <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> from the hypothesized Snowball Earth glaciation. The very youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are basaltic lava flows.|$|E
5|$|The main {{settlement}} {{on the island}} today is Biggings, which overlooks Housa Voe and is surrounded by in-bye land {{to the east of}} the hill dyke (which runs south from West Voe). To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length. Much {{of the rest of the}} area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from <b>glacial</b> <b>till.</b> There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile. The lack of peat led to 'turf scalping' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior.|$|E
50|$|The {{superficial}} geology beneath Tottington consists of Devensian <b>glacial</b> <b>tills,</b> which overlie the Lower Pennine Coal Measures; the same sequences of sandstones, mudstones and coal seams {{that form the}} Lancashire Coalfield. There is no history of coal mining in Tottington, although most original buildings such as the dungeon are built from sandstone and gritstone quarried locally.|$|R
5000|$|The McMurdo Dry Valleys are {{a row of}} snow-free valleys in Antarctica {{located within}} Victoria Land west of McMurdo Sound. [...] The Dry Valleys {{experience}} extremely low humidity and surrounding mountains prevent the flow of ice from nearby glaciers. The rocks here are granites and gneisses, and <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> dot this bedrock landscape, with loose gravel covering the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Westwold is an unincorporated {{settlement}} in the Interior of British Columbia. A small farming and logging community, it is located between Kamloops and Vernon on Highway 97. The original name for the settlement was [...] "Grand Prairie". [...] <b>Glacial</b> <b>tills</b> near the townsite of Westwold have provided fossils from the Sangamon interglacial period 130,000 years ago.|$|R
5|$|The town is sited on {{the hills}} {{adjoining}} the flood plain of the River Nene. In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils {{seems to have been}} good for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with boulder clay or <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> during the recent glaciations. On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} times, massive ice sheets {{at least one}} {{kilometer}} thick ravaged {{the landscape of the}} state and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. This area is known as the Driftless Zone for its absence of glacial drift. Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50feet (15m) or more of <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling. Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences earthquakes infrequently, {{and most of them are}} minor.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{is a state}} {{located in}} the north-central United States. It is usually {{considered}} {{to be in the}} Midwestern region of the country. The state can generally be divided into three geographic regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. Eastern South Dakota is lower in elevation and higher in precipitation than {{the western part of the}} state, and the Black Hills are a low, isolated mountain group in the southwestern corner of the state. Smaller sub-regions in the state include the Coteau des Prairies, Coteau du Missouri, James River Valley, the Dissected Till Plains, and the Badlands. Geologic formations in South Dakota range in age from two billion-year-old Precambrian granite in the Black Hills to <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> deposited over the last few million years. South Dakota is the 17th-largest state in the country.|$|E

5000|$|This climatic and chronological {{framework}} {{was composed}} of four glacial and interglacial stages. It was developed between 1894 and 1909 by geomorphologists and Quaternary geologists to subdivide glacial and nonglacial deposits within the United States of America. From youngest to oldest, they were the Wisconsin glaciation, Sangamonian (interglacial), Illinoian Stage (glacial), Yarmouthian, Kansan glaciation, Aftonian (interglacial), and Nebraskan stages. The Yarmouthian (Yarmouth) Interglacial was defined first {{on the basis of}} [...] "interglacial" [...] sediments encountered in wells dug in southeasterm Iowa. Later the Yarmouth (Yarmouthian) stage in Illinois was defined {{on the basis of the}} Yarmouth Paleosol (Soil) developed in the surface of what were thought at that time to be [...] "Kansan" [...] <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and buried by Illionian <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> of the Glasford Formation in southeast Iowa and east-central Illinois. At this time, it was incorrectly presumed that the Yarmouth Paleosol formed during a single interglacial stage that separated a younger glacial stage, the Illinoian Glaciation, represented by the sediments of the Glasford Formation in Illinois and the glacial deposits of an older glacial stage, called the [...] "Kansan Glaciation".|$|R
