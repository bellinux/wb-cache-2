6000|$|M. Golberry {{describes}} Bambúk in gloomy and sombre colours. Its gold {{is distributed}} amongst low ranges of peeled and sterile hills. Probably this results from fires and disforesting. It {{occurs in the}} shape of spangles, grains, and pépites (nuggets), whose size increases with the depth of the digging. In the Matakon mine the dust adhered to fragments of iron, emery, and lapis lazuli, from which it was easily detached and washed. The less valuable Semayla placer produced dust in a hard reddish loam, mixed with still more refractory materials; it was crushed in mortars with rude wooden dollies or with grain-pestles. The pits, six feet in <b>diameter,</b> <b>reached</b> a depth of from ten to twelve yards, where they were stopped by a bed of hard reddish marle; this the Frenchman held to be the hanging wall of a much richer lode. The people used ladders, but they neglected to collar or brace the mouth, and the untimbered pit-sides often fell in; hence fatal accidents, attributed to the 'earth-spirits.' They held gold to be a capricious elf, and when a rich vein suddenly ran barren they cried out, 'There! he is off!' ...|$|E

Guazuma ulmifolia can be cultivated by either directly planting seeds or cuttings of the plant, {{as well as}} root stumps and bare-root seedlings.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} the fabrication of κ-carrageenan fibers by a wet-spinning method and discusses three important spinning parameters: coagulation bath composition, spinning rate and post-spinning mechanical drawing. The as-spun fiber diameter decreased with KCl and ethanol {{concentration in the}} coagulation bath. In general, the ultimate tensile stress and elongation at break both increased for KCl concentration from 0. 1 to 0. 5 M with and without ethanol, with no significant change above 0. 5 M. Spinning rate affected the dope flow and thus the polymer orientation (apparent viscosity) and fiber morphology. At spinning rates between 0. 25 mL/min and 0. 33 mL/min, the fiber <b>diameter</b> <b>reached</b> a minimum and the fiber surface was smooth. Both an increase and decrease from this spinning rate range increased the fiber diameter and roughness of the fiber surface.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{products}} are dried due several reasons as preservation, weight reduction and improvement of stability. However, on the market are not offered low-cost and high quality products simultaneously. Although there are effective methods of dehydrating foods such as freeze drying, which preserves the flavor, color and vitamins, they are poor accessibility technologies. Therefore, alternative processes are required to be efficient and economical. The aim {{of this research was}} compare drying kinetics of sliced of breadfruit (Artocarpus communis) using the technique of Refractive Window® (VR) with the tray drying. To carry out this study, sliced of 1 and 2 mm thick were used. Refractive window drying was performed with the water bath temperature to 92 °C; and tray drying at 62 °C and an air velocity of 0. 52 m/s. During the Refractive window drying technique, the moisture content reached the lower than tray drying levels.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the impact dynamics of drops of complexed surfactant solutions. Dilute to semi-dilute solutions of rod-like to worm-like micelles of equimolar cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (Nasal) in water (CTAB-NaSal (1 : 1)) {{have been dropped}} onto a smooth hydrophobic surface. The variations in impact behaviour of each solution are {{discussed in terms of}} the dynamic surface tension and viscoelastic properties. Increases in the concentration of CTAB-NaSal (1 : 1) in solution resulted in enhanced reduction in the maximum height achieved during recoil, even though the maximum <b>diameter</b> <b>reached</b> during spreading was equivalent for all solutions over the range of concentrations explored. The equivalence in the maximum diameter during spreading is due to the loss of fluid structure at high extension rates, whilst the resulting reduction in rebound tendency is due to a rapid restructuring of the fluid post impact. The drop impact of such complexed surfactant solutions provides significant insight into the contributions of a 2 ̆ 7 dynamic 2 ̆ 7 fluid microstructure to the rebound behaviour of dilute 2 ̆ 7 living polymer 2 ̆ 7 solutions.
