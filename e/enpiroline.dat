40|$|To {{identify}} common {{spatial and}} structural features of amino alcohol antimalarial agents with the eventual goal of designing more effective drugs and {{a better understanding of}} the mechanism of action of this class of antimalarial agents, the three-dimensional crystal and molecular structure of <b>enpiroline,</b> a new antimalarial agent active against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, was determined by X-ray crystallography and compared with the crystal structures of the cinchona alkaloids and of the new antimalarial agent WR 194, 965. The aromatic rings of the phenyl-pyridine ring system of <b>enpiroline</b> are twisted from each other by approximately 18 degrees. The intramolecular aliphatic N-O distance in <b>enpiroline</b> was 2. 80 A (1 A = 0. 1 nm), which is close to the N-O distance found in the antimalarial cinchona alkaloids. <b>Enpiroline</b> contains both an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the aliphatic nitrogen and oxygen atoms and an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the aliphatic nitrogen and oxygen atoms of two neighboring molecules. One enantiomer of <b>enpiroline</b> superimposed best with quinine, and the other enantiomer of <b>enpiroline</b> superimposed best with quinidine, suggesting that both enantiomers of <b>enpiroline</b> possess antimalarial activity. Since a common feature of the crystal structures of the amino alcohol antimalarial agents is the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the common spatial direction of hydrogen bond formation indicates the potential ability of these antimalarial agents to bind to a common receptor site. The crystallographic parameters were as follows: C 19 H 18 F 6 N 5 O; Mr = 404. 3; symmetry of unit cell, monoclinic; space group, P 2 (1) /a; parameters of unit cell [...] -a = 9. 454 +/- 0. 004 A, b = 18. 908 +/- 0. 008 A, c = 10. 300 +/- 0. 004 A, and beta = 96. 55 +/- 0. 03 degrees: V (volume of unit cell) = 1829. 2 A 3; Z (number of molecules per unit cell) = 4; Dchi (calculated density) = 1. 46 g cm- 3; source of radiation, CuK alpha (lambda = 1. 54178 A); mu (absorption coefficient) = 11. 49 cm- 1; F(000) (sum of atomic scattering factors at zero scattering angle) = 832; room temperature; final R = 8. 7 % for 1, 798 reflections with [F 0] > 3 sigma...|$|E
40|$|Interesting antischistosomal {{properties}} {{have been}} documented for the antimalarial mefloquine, a 4 -quinolinemethanol. We evaluated the antischistosomal activities of nine mefloquine related compounds, belonging to the 4 -pyridinemethanols, 4 -phenanthrenmethanols and related 4 -quinolinemethanols. Eight compounds revealed high activities against Schistosoma mansoni in vitro, with two drugs (4 -quinolinemethanols WR 7573 and WR 7930) characterized by significantly lower IC(50) s (2. 7 and 3. 5 muM, respectively) when compared to mefloquine (11. 4 muM). Mefloquine and WR 7930 showed significantly decreased IC(50) values when incubated {{in the presence of}} hemoglobin. High worm burden reductions (WBR) were obtained with <b>enpiroline</b> (WBR: 82. 7 %, dosage 200 mg/kg), its threo-isomers ((+) -threo WBR: 100 %, (-) -threo WBR: 89 %) and WR 7930 (WBR: 87 %, dosage 100 mg/kg) against adult S. mansoni in mice. Furthermore excellent in vitro and in vivo antischistosomal activity was observed for two WR 7930 related structures (WR 29252, WR 7524). In addition, mefloquine (WBR: 81 %), <b>enpiroline</b> (WBR: 77 %) and WR 7930 (WBR: 100 %) showed high activities on S. haematobium harbored in mice following single oral doses of 200 mg/kg. These results provide a deeper insight into the structural features of the aminoalcohols that rule antischistosomal activity. Further studies should be launched with <b>enpiroline</b> and WR 793...|$|E
40|$|Chronic Schistosoma mansoni infections lead {{to severe}} tissue {{destruction}} of the gut wall and liver and can influence drug disposition. This study aimed to investigate {{the impact of a}} chronic S. mansoni infection on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of two promising antischistosomal lead candidates (mefloquine and <b>enpiroline)</b> in mice. Studies were conducted in two different mouse cohorts (S. mansoni-infected and uninfected mice) for both drugs. Plasma samples were collected at various time points after oral treatment (200 mg/kg of body weight) with study drugs. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was validated to analyze <b>enpiroline</b> and mefloquine in plasma. Livers and intestines were collected from infected animals to determine the onset of action, hepatic shift, and worm burden reduction. Following mefloquine administration, hepatic shifting and significant worm burden reductions (79. 2 %) were observed after 72 h. At 1 week posttreatment with <b>enpiroline,</b> the majority of worms had migrated to the liver and significant worm burden reductions were observed (93. 1 %). The HPLC method was selective, accurate (87. 8 to 111. 4 %), and precise (> 10 %) for the analysis of both drugs in plasma samples. The PK profiles revealed increased values for half-life (t 1 / 2) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for both drugs in infected animals compared to the t 1 / 2 and AUC values in uninfected animals. Considerable changes were observed for mefloquine, with a 5 -fold increase of t 1 / 2 (182. 7 h versus 33. 6 h) and 2 -fold increase of AUC (1, 116, 517. 8 ng · h/ml versus 522, 409. 1 ng · h/ml). S. mansoni infections in mice influence the PK profiles of <b>enpiroline</b> and mefloquine, leading to delayed clearance. Our data confirm that drug disposition should be carefully studied in schistosomiasis patients...|$|E
