25|$|At {{the time}} of opening in 1910, the {{addition}} was of French Renaissance design, carried out {{in a general way}} in the interior though there was a slight leaning toward the Spanish in the exterior details. The addition and the older structure were connected with a large courtyard between the two buildings, forming an angle at this point. The ground floor contained a large lobby. To its right was the main dining room and to the left, the Broadway Cafe. Just underneath the Broadway Cafe, down a flight of marble stairs, was the Grill. The Broadway Cafe contained walls of light, artificial stone and its ceiling was treated in the Italian Renaissance style, ornamented in low relief. The corridor walls were of Greek Skyros marble in gray and yellow with a slight veining of purple. The coffered ceiling carried out this color scheme. The large dining room was modelled after the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre. The first floor contained a foyer in Louis XIV style, with carved, dark oak woodwork and walls completely covered in tapestries of the period. From this foyer opened out the Tea Room whose walls of artificial stone were covered with wooden <b>grillage,</b> painted green while the skylight over the entire room was concealed by rafters and <b>grillage</b> with entwined vines. Adjoining this was a Flemish-style Banquet Room in dark oak. Carved wooden doors were set with panelled mirrors in the foyer hall. Elevator doors were of bronze.|$|E
500|$|As {{the master}} artisan, Root drew upon {{a variety of}} {{influences}} in designing the interior and exterior spaces, including Moorish, Byzantine, Venetian and Romanesque motifs.

[...] The term {{for the type of}} foundation that Root designed is <b>grillage</b> foundation, a foundation where iron rails and the structural beams are combined in a crisscross pattern and encased in concrete to support the building's immense weight without heavy foundation stones.

40|$|Abstract: The {{volume of}} <b>grillages</b> with stress {{constraints}} is minimized. An optimal beams system or plate with reinforced ribs is obtained {{to present the}} optimal structure. A grillage-like continuum material model is adapted. Structure is analyzed by finite element method with triangle plate elements. The geometric matrix of triangle plate element in explicit formulation about area coordinates is presented. The stiffness matrix of grillage-like continuum material model is derived. The material distribution field in design domain is optimized by fully-stressed criterion. The densities and orientations of the beam or reinforced ribs at nodes in <b>grillages</b> are taken as design variables. The densities and orientations vary in design domain continuously. The optimal distribution fields of bend moments, flexure displacement and material are obtained simultaneously. Subsequently the discrete structures are founded based on the optimal material distribution fields. The performances of different elements are compared.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an application of}} the Mobility Approach {{to the analysis of}} the power flow through grillage-like structures. Such structures are usually found in offshore platforms, supporting large and heavy machines. Different wave kinds (longitudinal, flexural and torsional) were initially considered in the power flow analysis between two beams joined in L. Beams excited by an in-plane point force showed strong coupling between longitudinal-flexural waves, while that for out-of-plane point force excitation, flexural-torsional waves coupling represents the most important mechanism of energy transmission. The response determination of <b>grillages</b> by the mobility approach requires the structure to be separated into simple beam-like structural components. Equations for rotations and displacements at the joints of all beams are written for as mobility functions, and moments and forces acting at the joints. A system of equations relating all such internal forces and moments is obtained. This approach was applied to simple <b>grillages.</b> Response results showed good agreement when compared to those provided by Finite Elements...|$|R
