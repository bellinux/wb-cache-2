50|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of online gambling is debated and can {{vary from state to}} state. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) limits the ability of banks and payment processors to transact with internet gambling sites that are unlawful under any federal or state law. However it does not define {{the legality}} or otherwise of an internet based gambling site. It was commonly assumed that the Federal Wire Act prohibited all forms of online gambling. However, in December 2011, the United States Department of Justice released a statement clarifying that the Wire Act applied only to sports betting sites and not to online casinos, poker, or lottery sites, leaving the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> up to individual states. Certain states such as Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have started the process of legalising and regulating online gambling and it is expected that regulation will continue on a state by state basis.|$|E
50|$|Vicki Schultz {{states that}} we collectively have a shared {{knowledge}} about most concepts. How we interpret {{the reality of}} our actual understanding of a concept manifests itself through the different individual narratives that we tell about the origins and meanings of a particular concept. The difference in narratives, about {{the same set of}} facts, is what divides us. An individual has the ability to frame, or understand, something very differently than the next person. Evidence does not always lead to a clear attribution of the specific cause or meaning of an issue - meanings are derived through narratives. Reality, and the facts that surround it, are personally subjective and laden with assumptions based on clearly stated facts. Anna-Maria Marshall states, this shift in framing happens because our perceptions depend “on new information and experiences;” this very idea is the basis of Ewick and Sibley <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> - our everyday experiences shape our understanding of the law.|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} legal {{positions}} regarding the <b>definition</b> and <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> sexual intercourse between {{persons of the}} same sex or gender. For example, in the 2003 New Hampshire Supreme Court case Blanchflower v. Blanchflower, it was held that female same-sex sexual relations, and same-sex sexual practices in general, did not constitute sexual intercourse, based on a 1961 definition from Webster's Third New International Dictionary that defines sexual intercourse as coitus; and thereby an accused wife in a divorce case was found not guilty of adultery. Some countries consider same-sex sexual behavior an offense punishable by imprisonment or execution; this is the case, for example, in Islamic countries, including LGBT issues in Iran.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{legality}} {{is a crucial}} one for the definition of many shared-memory consistency conditions. As originally defined, a sequence of operations on a given object is legal {{if it is in}} the set of valid sequences specified for that object. Being thus defined on totally ordered sets of operations, the notion of legality is not fully realistic, because parallel executions on sharedmemory multiprocessing systems are best represented by partially ordered sets of operations. It is conceivable, therefore, that the eventual derivation of practical systems based on consistency models that rely on some form of legality will tend to be excessively heavy on the required synchronization. In this paper, we introduce an alternative <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> that is based on partially ordered sets of operations. Our treatment starts with a system model that makes very few assumptions on machine architecture, and proceeds to employ a graph-theoretic formalism to handle the normally troublesome issue of write multiplicity and to characterize legality. Using this same formalism, we argue that the novel <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is consonant with the one on totally ordered sets of operations, so it carries the same intuitive appeal intended by the original definition...|$|E
40|$|Legality {{is a key}} {{concept for}} the {{definition}} of many shared-memory consistency conditions. As originally defined, a sequence of operations on a given object is legal {{if it is in}} the set of valid sequences specified for that object. Because legality is defined on totally ordered sets of operations, the actual derivation of algorithms and protocols to implement the consistency models that rely on some form of legality may tend to "exaggerate" the amount of synchronization that they eventually require. In this paper we introduce an alternative definition for legality that is based on partially ordered sets of operations representing parallel executions on shared-memory multiprocessing systems. Using a graph-theoretic formalization, this novel <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is shown to be consonant with the one on totally ordered sets of operations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn several {{application}} fields, sentences can assume, {{besides the}} usual values true and false, a third value that signals their unacceptability. This may happen when a query to a database violates the database constraints or in typed logic programming, where a goal {{which does not}} satisfy the type constraints can be considered unacceptable. Here a three-valued Horn logic is presented, where the third value has the meaning of “illegal”, i. e. unacceptable. The extension of the conventional logic operators is considered, and a model-theoretic semantics for three-valued Horn programs is provided, which allows a formal <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> (i. e. acceptability) of logic formulas and programs. For the class of legal three-valued logic programs {{the use of the}} traditional SLD resolution algorithm is proven to be sound. Finally, it is shown that the legality check of a three-valued logic program can be also carried out through SLD resolution...|$|E
50|$|In this case, if the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> rape {{were to be}} {{developed}} retrospectively it would offend the constitutional principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> as I have demonstrated above. On the other hand, {{if we were to}} accept that the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is a bar {{to the development of the}} common law, the Courts could never develop the common law of crimes at all. In my view, such a conclusion would undermine the principles of our Constitution which require the courts to ensure that the common law is infused with the spirit, purport and objects of the Constitution. The impasse can be avoided by accepting that in these circumstances it is appropriate to develop the law prospectively only.|$|R

40|$|Bringing {{together}} perspectives from {{a variety}} of disciplines, this book provides an interdisciplinary approach to the emerging discussion on Indigenous nationhood. The contributors argue for the centrality of nationhood and nation building in molding and, concurrently, blending the political, social, economic, and cultural strategies toward Native American self-definitions and self-determination. Included among the common themes is the significance of space—conceived both as traditional territory and colonial reservation—in the current construction of Native national identity. Whether related to historical memory and the narrativization of peoplehood, the temporality of indigenous claims to sovereignty, or the demarcation of successful financial assets as cultural and social emblems of indigenous space, territory constitutes an inalienable and necessary element connecting Native American peoplehood and nationhood. The creation and maintenance of Native American national identity have also overcome structural territorial impediments and may benefit from the inclusivity of citizenship rather than the exclusivity of ethnicity. In all cases, the political effectiveness of nationhood in promoting and sustaining sovereignty presupposes Native full participation in and control over economic development, the formation of historical narrative and memory, the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality,</b> and governance.

40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} {{what level of}} development has the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> reached in national jurisdictions {{as well as in}} international law.   The study analyses the developments and treatment of the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> in international criminal law by means of an analysis of several national jurisdictions and international law;  in Scotland, England, the United States, Mexico and South Africa.   After this, the deduction of the rules <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> were identified and compared with international developments in international human rights law and international criminal law was made and conclusions formulated. The various legal systems represent different ways of considering the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality,</b> taking into account the general aspects of retroactivity, strict construction and foreseeability as guidelines for this study.   Therefore, {{it was not possible to}} extract a general understanding of the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality,</b> and even the consideration of minimum standards was a complex task. Despite these obstacles some conclusions could be reached regarding the evolution of the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> in international criminal law.   The Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> seems to be in a very early state of development in international criminal law.   There seem to be some basic rules that are recognised in treaties, but the courts and the drafters <b>of</b> criminal <b>definitions</b> have not given the Principle the same scope at domestic legislatures and courts.   However, the Rome Statute seems to provide for a system where the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> could be respected, since its text gives the broadest scope of any treaty so far.   However, for now there is still a lot of work to be done, if we aspire to create a respectful system of international criminal law, since the existing rules do not comply with the expected minimum standards.

40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is {{a principle}} of social and State life consisting in the compliance with the legal norms by all participants in social relations.

The order of law is another legal category close as concept to legality. It is an essential element in society’s life.

The order of law is a status of social relations governed by legal rules that correspond to the requirements of laws and other normative acts.
