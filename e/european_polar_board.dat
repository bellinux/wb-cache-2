For more information download the agenda of the EU-PolarNet General Assembly: [URL] About EU-PolarNet EU-PolarNet is a project funded under H 2020. EU-Polarnet is the world’s largest consortium of expertise and infrastructure for polar research. Seventeen countries are represented by 22 of Europe’s internationally-respected multi-disciplinary research institutions. From 2015 - 2020, EU-PolarNet will develop and deliver a strategic framework and mechanisms to prioritise science, optimise the use of polar infrastructure, and broker new partnerships that will lead to the co-design of polar research projects that deliver tangible benefits for society. By adopting a higher degree of coordination of polar research and operations than has existed previously the consortium engages in closer cooperation with all relevant actors on an international level. EU-PolarNet moreover benefits from its close cooperation with the <b>European</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Board</b> (EPB), as outcomes from EU-PolarNet will add long-term value to EPB activity in providing strategic science policy advice to the European Commission and other international bodies. A major benefit of the involvement and support of the EPB is that the legacy of EU-PolarNet can be reliably sustained by the Board into the future...|$|E

Study of the variability of GSDW formation is relevant for understanding the impact ofthe circulation in the <b>European</b> <b>Polar</b> seas on regional and global deep water characteristics. New long-term multitracer observations from the Greenland Sea show that GSDW formation indeed was greatly reduced during the 1980 s.

40|$|PERSPECTIVE OF ARCTIC DEEP-SEA DRILLING AND THE AURORA BOREALIS PROJECTThe {{geologic}} and paleoenvironmental {{histories of}} the Arctic Ocean basin are largely unknown because, in contrast to other oceans, {{it has not been}} possibleto sample and date the sedimentary record preserved in the basin beyond the length of a single core. As a result, the bulk of the Cenozoic record and all of theMesozoic record have not been studied. Paleoclimatic questions posed by scientific ocean drilling at lower latitudes require answers that can only be obtained by drilling deep beneath the Arctic Ocean seafloor. Restricted by the circulating sea ice, scientific drilling has been slow to arrive in the Arctic Ocean. After JOIDES RESOLUTION (escorted by an icebreaker; ODP Leg 151) had drilled the Yermak Plateau, it was not until 2004 that the famous ACEX expedition (an ECORD effort based on a drill ship escorted by 2 icebreakers) penetrated several hundred meters into the sedimentary sequence on top of Lomonosov Ridge, thereby proving that deep-sea drilling in permanently sea ice-covered ocean basis is feasible. Inspired by these successes, the <b>European</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>Board</b> of ESF and ECORD several years ago developed a plan for future work in the central Arctic Ocean which called for a novel research ship, known as the AURORA BOREALIS. This ship would be able to operate independently year-round in the Arctic Ocean. It would alsobe able to carry out deep-sea drilling expeditions during the favorable summer months with optimal ice conditions. It could become one of the alternate IODP mission specific drilling platforms. Funding is presently available to develop the technical specifications and preliminary design of the ship. European funding is sought for to prepare for the financial, legal and operational framework of the ship which will require the formation of an international consortium of interested partners. A dedicated Arctic Ocean drillship would require a pool of prepared sites ready for drilling. The preparation of drill sites requires substantial site survey work, but sufficient seimic reflection lines from the major structural units of the central Arctic Ocedan are available to define locations with great scientific promise. Several examples of potential drill sites will be presented...|$|E

40|$|Within ESA's Earth Observation programme, the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) {{is one of}} the payload {{components}} of the <b>European</b> <b>polar</b> platform ENVISAT- 1.

This red edge provides useful information on the physiological status of the vegetation. Two different data sets are explored for simulating the red edge using MERIS spectral bands. Results show that the maximum first derivative and a three-point Lagrangian technique are not appropriate measures for the red edge index. A 'linear method', estimating the inflexion point as the reflectance midpoint between the NIR plateau and the red minimum, is a more robust method. Results also show that the MERIS bands at 665, 705, 753. 75 and 775 nm can be used for applying the linear method for red edge index estimation. However, since the band at 753. 75 nm is located very close to the oxygen absorption feature of the atmosphere, an atmospheric correction must be applied previous to calculating the position of the red edge using the MERIS bands...|$|R
