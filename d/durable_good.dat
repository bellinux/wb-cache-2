60|$|Let it be said, however, that Condorcet showed himself no pedantic nor fastidious trifler {{with the}} {{tremendous}} movement {{which he had}} contributed to set afoot. The same practical spirit which drove him into the strife, guided him {{in the midst of}} it. He never wrung his hands, nor wept, nor bewailed the unreason of the multitudes to whom in vain he preached reason. Unlike the typical man of letters--for he was without vanity--he did not abandon the cause of the Revolution because his suggestions were often repulsed. 'It would be better,' he said to the Girondins, 'if you cared less for personal matters and attended only to public interests.' Years ago, in his éloge on L'Hôpital, he had praised the famous Chancellor for incurring the hostility of both of the two envenomed factions, the League and the Huguenots, and for disregarding the approbation or disapprobation of the people. 'What operation,' he asked, 'capable of producing any <b>durable</b> <b>good,</b> can be understood by the people? How should they know to what extent good is possible? How judge of the means of producing it? It must ever be easier for a charlatan to mislead the people, than for a man of genius to save it.'[27] Remembering this law, he never lost patience. He was cool and intrepid, if his intrepidity was of the logical sort rather than physical; and he was steadfast to one or two simple aims, if he was on some occasions too rapid in changing his attitude as to special measures. He was never afraid of the spectre, as the incompetent revolutionist is. On the contrary, he understood its whole internal history; he knew what had raised it, what passion and what weakness gave to it substance, and he knew that presently reason would banish it and restore men to a right mind. The scientific spirit implanted in such a character as Condorcet's, and made robust by social meditation, builds up an impregnable fortitude in the face of incessant rebuffs and discouragements. Let us then picture Condorcet as surveying the terrific welter from the summer of 1789 to the summer of 1793, from the taking of the Bastille to the fall of the Girondins, with something of the firmness and self-possession of a Roman Cato.|$|E

Using monthly US data on {{personal}} expenditures on <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> and the housing market, we estimate from a VAR the dynamic responses of the price and quantity of <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> and housing to money supply shocks, assuming only that money is neutral in the long-run. We then estimate the parameters of the basic forward-looking model of consumption, extended to include the consumption of <b>durable</b> <b>goods,</b> by fitting the predicted responses of the theory to those estimated from the VAR. We find that money has important and plausible dynamic effects on the markets for <b>durable</b> <b>goods,</b> that the basic theory provides a reasonable framework for interpreting these responses, and that the supply of <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> and housing is highly elastic in the short-run...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study whether trade {{frictions}} in <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> markets help account for the patterns of household consumption expenditures observed in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), namely that the response of <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> expenditures to income shocks is 78 percent larger than that of nondurable goods and the variance of the idiosyncratic part of log <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> expenditures is four times as high as that of log nondurable goods expenditures. To do so, I develop a model with a continuum of households that purchase durable as well as nondurable goods. The key assumption is that <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> cannot be rented or sold after purchase.

Previous research has identified that a <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> manufacturer can mitigate the potential for its own opportunistic behavior with respect to consumers by leasing instead of selling its product.
