50|$|The AN/SLQ-25A Nixie is a clean-sheet design when {{compared}} to the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie. Apart from a few minor mechanical components, they share no common parts. The AN/SLQ-25A utilises a fiber optic tow cable (FOTC) and a 10 horsepower RL-272C double <b>drum</b> <b>winch.</b> Several engineering changes resulted in COTS equipment being utilised extensively in the system. A diagnostic program can be initiated locally or from the remote control station, and tests all electronic functions.|$|E

50|$|The older chain boats on the Elbe, {{the chain}} steamers on the Neckar {{and the three}} craft on the Main {{belonging}} to the Hessian Mainkette company used a <b>drum</b> <b>winch</b> to transfer power. In order to ensure the necessary traction on the chain on the driving drums, the chain was wound several times around two traction drums placed one behind {{the other in the}} centre of the boat. The chain ran in four to five grooves and was alternately wound over the front and rear drums.|$|E
50|$|Motor-assist systems {{very closely}} {{resemble}} standard counterweight fly systems described above, however a <b>drum</b> <b>winch,</b> typically mounted behind the locking rail below the arbor, {{is used to}} drive a steel cable purchase line. The purchase line is still terminated {{at the top and}} bottom of the arbor, but a rope lock is not used on the motor-assist line set. Weight on the arbor helps balance the batten load so that hoist motor size can remain relatively small. It is often feasible to retrofit a standard counterweight line set to become a motor-assist set.|$|E
50|$|The chain {{was raised}} {{out of the}} water over a boom at the bow of the ship and led over the deck along the ship's axis to the chain engine amidships. The {{transfer}} of power from the steam engine to the chain was usually achieved using a <b>drum</b> <b>winch.</b> From there the chain was led over the deck to another boom at the stern and lowered once more into the river. By moving the stern boom and the two rudders, front and aft, from side to side it was possible to replace the chain in the centre of the river again, even when negotiating river bends.|$|E
50|$|This {{branch of}} {{products}} effectively ceased {{in the early}} 1980s when new product development at Land Rover and a trend for manufacturers to build accessories in-house forced Fairey {{to drop out of}} the sector. The American company Superwinch bought the Tavistock works and continued making Fairey-designed winches for a few years. The site is now Superwinch's European base and manufacturing facility. Fairey-designed hydraulic winches are still in production, but the large majority of manufacture is of Superwinch-designed electric <b>drum</b> <b>winches.</b> The Fairey Overdrive is still in production in America.|$|R
40|$|The {{work was}} turned near Crotone (KR), in a 20 year-old {{plantation}} of Eucalyptus occidentalis Endl. positioned in hill zones, with average slope next to 27 %. The utilisation system was the Full Tree System (FTS). The felling {{on the six}} yards {{has been done by}} chainsaw and the first coppice bunching was manual. fts 1, 2 - The extraction has been done by one <b>drum</b> forest <b>winch</b> applied to the three point hitch of a wheeled farm tractor forest version. fts 3, 4 - The extraction has been done by two <b>drums</b> forest <b>winch,</b> applied to the three point hitch of a wheeled farm tractor forest version. fts 5, 6 - The extraction has been done by light tower yarder powered by one <b>drum</b> forest <b>winch</b> applied to the three point hitch of a wheeled farm tractor forest version. fts 1, 3 and 5 - At the landing the coppice have been processed by chainsaw in 2 meters length trunks. The slash accumulated and the trunks staked manually. fts 2, 4 and 6 - At the landing the coppice have been chipped by drum chipper with manual feed. The machine was a tractor powered chipper. At the landing the wood has been differentiated in two types. The type from the yards “fts 1, 3, 5 ” were 2 meters length trunks and the other type from the yards “fts 2, 4, 6 ” were chips for energy production. For the 2 meters length trunks the transport has been done by truck with 16 t of load capacity, and hydraulic crane. This material at the staple will be chipping by drum chipper with autonomous engine and mechanical feed. The chips transport will be done by truck with 17 t of load capacity. From the working times analysis and the wood quantitative obtained we studied the energy balance in the yards. We used the GER (Goss Energy Requirement) method. From the results obtained, the best work methodology seems to be that of full trees chipping directly at the landing and the chips transport at the staple. For the bunching and the extraction the best productivity result is given from the tractor with one <b>drum</b> forest <b>winch.</b> Considering the energy balance the yard that guarantees the greater efficiency is the “fts 4 ”, where has been employed for the extraction the tractor with two <b>drums</b> forest <b>winch.</b> The mechanization typology that supplied the better energy efficiency is that of the yards “fts 2, 4 and 6 ” where the full trees has been chipped to the landing...|$|R
50|$|A mixture {{between an}} {{inclined}} lift and a funicular with two cars {{was the second}} Angels Flight in Los Angeles. The funicular closed in 1969 and was reinstalled in 1996 using separate cables for each car, which were winched on separate <b>winch</b> <b>drums</b> in the station at the top. The <b>winch</b> <b>drums</b> were connected to the drive motor and the service brake by a gear train. The system failed because of gear train breakage, causing a fatal accident in 2001. The funicular was then closed until 2010, and since 5 September 2013.|$|R
50|$|The chain boat hauled itself {{along by}} means of a chain laid in the river bed. In order to do this, the chain was lifted out of the water by a boom at the bow of the vessel and ran down the deck, {{following}} the longitudinal axis of the ship, to the chain drive in the middle. Power was transferred from the steam engine to the chain primarily through a <b>drum</b> <b>winch.</b> From there, the chain was led across the deck to the boom at the stern and back down to the river bed. Due to the lateral movement of the boom and the two rudders mounted at the front and rear, it was possible to relay the chain {{in the middle of the}} river again even at river bends.|$|E
5000|$|The passive receive array {{consisted}} of ten strings of hydrophones mounted on 200 eighty-foot towers {{laid down the}} side of Plantagenet Bank in Bermuda. The strings were laid {{on the side of the}} bank using the U.S. Navy large covered lighter YFNB-12, reconfigured with a long overhead boom to handle the towers. Each cable had special takeouts built into it at intervals from which wires to the hydrophones were connected. Each tower was clamped onto the special cable with takeouts. At the upper end of the approximately 4 in cable a wire rope was attached and led to an explosively embedded anchor shot into the flat coral top of Plantagenet Bank. Tension of more than 40,000 lb was applied to the wire rope and cable to lay it {{down the side of}} the bank in the straightest line possible. At one point all further construction ceased while a stopper was placed on the special cable because most of the connection to the wire rope had broken and the string was being held by a few strands of wire on the double <b>drum</b> <b>winch</b> on YFNB-12. The YFNB-12 was held in place with four Murray and Tregurtha Diesel outboard engines placed on the corners and capable of 360 degree rotation, developing tremendous thrust in any direction. The cables led to Argus Island tower, from which the signal was conducted to the United States listening post located at Tudor Hill, Southampton, Bermuda (...) that had opened on June 1, 1955. At the time the post was classified top secret. Tudor Hill Naval Facility Bermuda was closed in 1995. The facility shares a short road with the Pompano Beach Club.|$|E
50|$|Fairing a cable can {{increase}} {{the complexity of the}} handling system. An unfaired cable can be wrapped many times on a <b>winch</b> <b>drum.</b> Some types of faired cable may only permit a single wrap.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem with}} <b>drum</b> <b>winches</b> was the {{relatively}} large length of chain - 30 to 40 m - {{that had to}} be wound several times around the two drums. If the chain boat was only used to haul barges upstream, it could not simply reduce the amount of chain needed for the drums on the way back otherwise, after a certain time, the surplus chain would pile up {{at the head of the}} operating section and there would be no slack at the start. In order to try and avoid this problem, the chain boat always carried the corresponding section of chain with it downstream and dropped it at the start of the chain route. As a result, there was a continual movement of the chain, that made control more difficult in more dangerous sections of the river, such as rapids. In particular, reinforced chain sections that were deliberately used, moved continually upstream. Also jettisoning the chain temporarily when two chain boats met was relatively difficult due to the multiple windings of the chain round the two drums.|$|R
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} these engines are very large rear driving wheels fitted with solid rubber tyres, three-speed gearing (most traction engine types {{have only two}} gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> on the back axle. This {{can be used by}} removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing the drive train to power the <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> instead of the wheels.|$|R

40|$|Proper winding of {{the steel}} rope around the <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> is great importance, mostly for: prolonging the service life of the rope, {{reduction}} of deformations {{of the body and}} the sides of the drum if the winding of the rope is multilayered, increasing of the safety factors, easier unwinding of the rope while lowering the load, even running of the drive unit, etc. The focus of this paper is on the analysis of the friction which occurs in the process of winding and unwinding the rope around the <b>winch</b> <b>drum.</b> Friction force is in its highest intensity when the rope passes from one layer to another, if the winding of the rope is multilayered. As the result of the research, certain mechanisms of winding of the rope from the aspects of the friction force were obtained, and the effects of the forces {{on the sides of the}} drum were analyzed...|$|R
25|$|Squid jiggers – have {{single or}} double <b>drum</b> jigger <b>winches</b> lined along the rails around the vessel. Strong lamps, up to 5000 W each, {{are used to}} attract the squid. These are {{arranged}} 50–60 centimetres apart, either as one row in {{the centre of the}} vessel, or two rows, one on each side. As the squid are caught they are transferred by chutes to the processing plant of the vessel. The jigging motion can be produced mechanically by the shape of the drum or electronically by adjustment to the winch motor. Squid jiggers are often used during the day as midwater trawlers and during the night as jiggers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{band brake}} {{is a primary}} or {{secondary}} brake, consisting of a band of friction material that tightens concentrically around a cylindrical piece of equipment to either prevent it from rotating (a static or [...] "holding" [...] brake), or to slow it (a dynamic brake).

60|$|Steam was up {{when the}} Enchantress rose with the tide, and shortly {{afterward}} the engines began to throb.

40|$|The US Coast Guard {{approached}} NIOSH {{about an}} increase in the number of winch entanglement injuries being reported among commercial shrimp fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. In August of 2012, a 15 year-old boy, fishing on a shrimp boat, died when his clothing became caught in an operating deck winch. This fatality received widespread coverage within the industry and further highlighted the need for action. Using the NIOSH Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID), researchers at the Alaska Pacific Office began studying the incidence of shrimp winch entanglements and found a total of 35 severe work-related injuries, including eight fatal injuries, caused by deck winches reported in the Southern shrimp fleet from 2000 - 2011. In the fall of 2013, a NIOSH contractor conducted dock side surveys to identify three of the most common <b>drum</b> <b>winches</b> used on Gulf of Mexico side-trawl shrimp vessels. The survey identified particular main-winches for guarding: the McElroy/Catchot 505, and 503 and the Stroudsburg 515 1 / 2 T winches. NIOSH engineers designed standardized stationary guarding for each identified main-winch and built initial prototype guards for each model to be sea-tested. NIOSH formed partnerships with boat owners to test the guard designs on each type of winch. The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fleet is diverse, both geographically and culturally. NIOSH sought to find boat owners from the various cultural groups to collaborate with the winch-guard testing. Three working side-trawl shrimp boats were chosen as test vessels operating out of Dulac, LA, Port Arthur, TX and Chauvin, LA. NIOSH has completed initial designs for stationary-winch guards for three of the most commonly used models of winches currently used by the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fleet. Through collaborations and partnerships with shrimper associations and safety groups, the successfully tested winch guard design plans will also be made available to shrimpers via various internet websites. NIOSH intends to release the information in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese to better reach the target audience. The refined designs, including material specifications and estimated building costs, are scheduled to be available without charge to fishermen. NIOSHTIC No 2004721...|$|R
50|$|Draglines {{fall into}} two broad categories: those {{that are based on}} standard, lifting cranes, and the heavy units which have to be built on-site. Most crawler cranes, with an added <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> on the front, can act as a dragline. These units (like other cranes) are {{designed}} to be dismantled and transported over the road on flatbed trailers. Draglines used in civil engineering are almost always of this smaller, crane type. These are used for road, port construction, pond and canal dredging, and as pile driving rigs. These types are built by crane manufacturers such as Link-Belt and Hyster.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inclined}} lift, or inclined elevator—occasionally inclinator—is not a funicular, {{since it}} has only one car carrying payload on the slope. The car is either winched up to the station {{on the top of}} the incline where the cable is collected on a <b>winch</b> <b>drum,</b> or the single car is balanced by a counterweight and operated the same way as a funicular with two cars. Many inclined lifts were constructed along the pressure lines of storage power plants for transporting building materials. Examples are the Gelmerbahn leading to the Gelmersee and the Funicolare Piora-Ritom leading to Lago Ritom, both in Switzerland.|$|R

40|$|A Zimbabwian {{designer}} {{has been}} testing a two-wheeled winch tractor on small farms {{for the last}} few years, with encouraging results. Small farmers in tropical regions with distinct dry and rainy seasons often experience great difficulty in field preparation. During the dry season, animal-powered tillage is usually not possible, as the animals become weak due to the shortage of green fodder and deep ploughing in dry soil usually needs a heavy tractor, which is too expensive. A small tractor incorporating a winch and anchor permits a light- weight machine to exert a high pull which can be used for deep ploughing during the dry season. Two people are required to operate a winch tractor, a driver and a plough controller. The plough is attached {{to the end of the}} winch chain which is wrapped around the <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> on the traction unit. As the tractor driver propels his machine forward the winch chain unwinds from the drum and the plough remains at rest. When the chain is unwound from its drum the driver disengages the power from the wheels and engages it to the <b>winch</b> <b>drum.</b> The tension in the chain digs the tractor anchor into the ground and then, as the chain re winds onto its <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> the plough is controlled by its operator as it is pulled up to the anchored tractor unit The two processes of driving the traction unit forward and then pulling the plough up to the anchored traction unit are repeated across the length of the field, until the machine is turned at the ends of the field. The area ploughed in a day is similar to when using animals and the fuel consumed is similar to that used when ploughed with a medium-sized tractor. The deep ploughing obtained from using the winch tractor permits the crop to be planted at the start of the rainy season and also encourages soil moisture conservation and plant root establishment.
