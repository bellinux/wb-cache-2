5|$|Written by Marc Platt, this {{unsolicited}} {{story was}} submitted to script editor Robert Holmes in late 1975 {{and dealt with}} a sentient star using the Time Lord libraries {{as a means of}} invading Gallifrey. Holmes felt that it lacked action and drama, and was in need of a proper antagonist. Even so, Robert Holmes thought that <b>Fires</b> <b>of</b> the Starmind had more potential than most of the other amateur submissions and he encouraged Marc Platt to continue writing. <b>Fires</b> <b>of</b> the Starmind was rejected on 15 December.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, a Nazi {{task force}} assaults the Natural History Museum in London, {{which has been}} overrun by monsters. Later action would have {{involved}} {{the discovery of a}} secret chamber beneath the museum. This episode was written by Mark Gatiss and planned to air in the fourth series of Doctor Who, but was replaced by The <b>Fires</b> <b>of</b> Pompeii. Elements of the story were later reused in Steven Moffat's The Big Bang, the finale of Series 5.|$|E

5|$|Flooding is a {{frequent}} occurrence in Kuala Lumpur whenever there is a heavy downpour, especially in the city centre and downstream areas. Smoke from forest <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> nearby Sumatra sometimes casts a haze over the region. It is {{a major source of}} pollution in the city together with open burning, emission from motor vehicles and construction work.|$|E
5|$|Prometheus– Punished by Zeus {{for giving}} mankind the <b>Fires</b> <b>of</b> Olympus, Prometheus was made mortal, and was {{attacked}} by an eagle that ripped out and ate his liver, which regrew instantly, on a daily basis. Kratos encountered Prometheus near Typhon's lair. Prometheus was eventually freed by Kratos, died by self-immolation in fire, and his ashes empowered Kratos, giving him the ability called the Rage of the Titans. The character was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in God of War II.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.|$|E

5|$|During the Civil War, and {{the siege}} of Basing House between 1643 and 1645, the town played host to large numbers of Parliamentarians. During this time, St. Michael's Church was damaged whilst being used as an {{explosive}} store and lead was stripped {{from the roof of}} the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke leading to its eventual ruin. It had been incorporated in 1524, but was effectively out of use after the Civil War. The 17th century saw serious damage to much of the town and its churches, because of the great <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1601 and 1656. Cromwell is thought to have stayed here towards the end of {{the siege of}} Basing House, and wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons addressed from Basingstoke.|$|E
5|$|Following the Yellowstone <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1988, Henry (Rich Sommer) takes {{a job in}} 1989 as a Shoshone National Forest fire lookout, {{after his}} wife Julia (Larissa Gallagher) {{develops}} early-onset dementia. On the first day, his supervisor Delilah (Cissy Jones) contacts him via walkie-talkie and asks that he investigate illegal fireworks at a nearby lake. There he detects teenage girls skinny dipping, who accuse him of leering. On his way back, he finds a locked gate in a cave and spots a shrouded figure. Henry discovers his watchtower ransacked at arrival. The next day, Delilah sends him to a downed communication line. It is found cut, along with {{a message from the}} girls. He and Delilah plot to scare them off, but Henry finds their campsite abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Large fruitings of {{the fungus}} are often {{associated}} with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies {{were more likely to}} be found in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the Yellowstone <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1988.|$|E
50|$|Fire is {{also known}} as Agni and is the fourth element. It is also eternal and perishable. The {{essential}} character <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> is to generate heat. According to Hindu Mythology, Agni is one of the Eight guardians who guards our universe and is known as Asta-dik-palakas. In Indian mythology there are mentions of various types <b>of</b> <b>fires.</b> The four important ones are <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the earth, <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the sky, <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the stomach, which can mean hunger or digestive power, and the fire we commonly use.|$|R

50|$|Kenabeek and the {{surrounding}} area was hit by the Great <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1922 (the Haileybury <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> 1922) which wiped out hundreds of acres of land and many homes in and around Kenabeek.|$|R
5|$|On May 13, 1851, Antoine-Olivier Berthelet {{purchased}} land on {{the corner}} of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint-André Street (in Montreal) for use by the Misericorde Sisters, and in December 1851, following renovations to the two pre-existing structures on the land, the Sisters moved to the new address. In 1853 work began on a Mother House (or convent) for the Institute. The Motherhouse was planned to be a multistory building, built of grey stone, financed by borrowed money. Plans for the motherhouse had been drawn up in 1852 but the Montreal <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> July 8, 1852, which destroyed around 11,000 homes along with the Saint-Jacques Cathedral, had the result of delaying construction projects throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had {{surveyed}} approximately {{ninety percent}} of the park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed– most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Creek {{fire started}} on June 14 well {{north of the}} park in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also {{threatening}} the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve the <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6.|$|E

5000|$|The {{department}} {{was the first}} in the world to utilize the telegraph to alert <b>fire</b> fighters <b>of</b> an emergency, installing the system in 1851. [...] The first fire alarm was transmitted via the Fire Alarm Telegraph system on April 29, 1852. The famous Boston <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> 1872 led to the appointment of a board <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> commissioners. The Boston Fire Department also provided assistance in the Great Chelsea <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1908 and the Great Salem <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1914. The department purchased its first steam fireboat in 1873, and installed fire poles in the stations in 1881.|$|R
50|$|The Rough Fire was {{a devastating}} <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the 2015 California {{wildfire}} season. The fire burned 151,623 acre of land, {{making it the}} largest <b>fire</b> <b>of</b> the year in California, involving up to 3,742 firefighters.|$|R
5|$|The Yellowstone <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1988 {{together}} {{formed the}} largest wildfire in the recorded history of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Starting as many smaller individual fires, the flames quickly spread {{out of control}} with increasing winds and drought and combined into one large conflagration, which burned for several months. The fires almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and, on September 8, 1988, the entire park was closed to all non-emergency personnel {{for the first time}} in its history. Only the arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought the fires to an end. A total of , or 36percent of the park was affected by the wildfires.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} has festivals {{representing}} its cultural heritage. Twice each year, {{there is a}} Tejikara Fire Festival. It first occurs on the second Saturday of April at Tejikarao Shrine and it again occurs on the second Sunday of August at Nagara River Park. Half-naked men ring bells, and carry shrines and other devices that shoot off large sparks. Near the end of August, the city sponsors Takigi Noh, a traditional form of Japanese theater that takes place {{on the banks of}} the Nagara River, lit only by the surrounding bonfires and the <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> cormorant boats.|$|E
5|$|The {{park service}} gave {{priority}} {{to life and}} property {{in their efforts to}} suppress the <b>fires.</b> <b>Of</b> the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during the fires.|$|E
50|$|The {{street was}} {{destroyed}} in the Copenhagen <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1728 but {{was not part of}} the area that {{was destroyed in}} the <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> 1795. Several buildings along the street were demolished in the 1950s.|$|R

5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail has a tiny global range with {{a single}} population. Though still common within its tiny range, with around 5,600 adult birds in the world, the species is {{considered}} to be vulnerable if an invasive species were to reach Inaccessible Island. Insular rails, particularly flightless species, are vulnerable to extinction. House mice, feral cats and brown rats, all of which would be a serious threat to this species, are not present on the island, nor have they ever been, but are present on nearby Tristan da Cunha, and could reach the islands via fishing vessels or other boats visiting the island (mice have been found on boats visiting the neighbouring Nightingale Island). Because of this vulnerability, this species is rated as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. <b>Fires</b> <b>of</b> tussock grass, which were recorded in 1872 and 1909, are assumed to have killed large numbers of rails, but have not occurred since. In the 1950s they were highly sought after for scientific collections, but permits to do so were rarely granted.|$|E
5|$|The story {{follows a}} Shoshone National Forest fire lookout named Henry in 1989, {{following}} the Yellowstone <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> 1988. A month {{after his first}} day at work, strange things begin happening to both him and his supervisor Delilah, which connects to a conspired mystery that happened years ago. Henry interacts with Delilah using a walkie-talkie, with the player choosing from dialog options to communicate. His exchanges with Delilah inform {{the process by which}} their relationship is developed. The game was directed by Olly Moss and Sean Vanaman, written by Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Moss and Vanaman, and produced by Gabe McGill and artist Jane Ng. The game's environment was modelled by Ng, based on a single painting by Moss. The design draws inspiration from New Deal advertisements by the National Park Service and field research conducted in Yosemite National Park.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{passed through}} the area still {{occupied}} by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow Washington towards {{the western side of}} Savo Island until 23:35, when Washington changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. South Dakota tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid Benham, which resulted in the ship's being silhouetted by the <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.|$|E
5000|$|David E. James {{described}} <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> Waters {{as one of}} Brakhage's {{most interesting}} films, in large part due to its use of sound. Phil Solomon's experimental film Night Lights was inspired by <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> Waters. Daniel Barnett, in his book Movement as meaning: in experimental film, wrote of his first encounter with <b>Fire</b> <b>of</b> Waters, [...] "I can't ever remember art making me so angry," [...] citing the film's apparent incomprehensibility on initial viewing.|$|R
