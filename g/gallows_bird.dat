6000|$|... 'Will you indeed?' {{said the}} <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird.</b> 'I will wager you a hundred silver pieces {{that you can}} do nothing of the sort.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{it is you}} who are {{the clever}} boy'; and they divided the spoil and the Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird</b> had one half and the Shifty Lad the other half.|$|E
60|$|But no whistle came, {{and soon}} the legs ceased to shake and to kick, for the Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird</b> was dead, as the Shifty Lad {{intended}} he should be.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why not?' asked Hans. 'Those <b>gallows</b> <b>birds</b> hang {{high in the}} air, and my camp {{will be on the}} ground; {{we shall}} {{have nothing to do with}} each other.' As he spoke, he turned his back on the minister, and went his way.|$|R
60|$|He spoke loudly, and the Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird</b> heard, {{and ran out}} of the loft, {{dragging}} the big leather hide after him which the Shifty Lad had sewed to his coat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-morning to you,' {{said the}} woman as she reached {{the place where the}} Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird</b> lived when he was not away on his business. 'My son has a fancy to learn your trade. Will you be kind enough to teach him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before you go," [...] said Bishop, [...] "and to {{save you}} from any idle rashness, I'll {{tell you that the}} Harbour-Master and the Commandant have their orders. You don't leave Port Royal, my fine <b>gallows</b> <b>bird.</b> Damme, I mean to provide you with {{permanent}} moorings here, in Execution Dock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, it {{must have}} got its feet loose, and have strayed after all,' thought the man; and he put the kid {{on the grass and}} hurried off in the {{direction}} of the bleating. Then the boy ran back and picked up the kid, and took it to the Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird.</b>|$|E
60|$|Every {{evening after}} dark the Shifty Lad {{went to the}} home of the Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird,</b> and many were the new tricks he learned. By-and-by he was allowed to go out with the Bird and watch him at work, and at last there came a day when his master though that he had grown clever enough to help in a big robbery.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{he is to}} be a thief at all, he {{had better}} be a good one. And who is there that can teach him?' the mother asked herself. But an idea came to her, and she arose early, before the sun was up, and set off for the home of the Black Rogue, or <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird,</b> who was such a {{wonderful}} thief that, though all had been robbed by him, no one could catch him.|$|E
60|$|A {{few weeks}} after that the Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird</b> had news of a wedding {{that was to be}} held near the town; and the bridegroom had many friends and {{everybody}} sent him a present. Now a rich farmer who lived up near the moor thought that nothing was so useful to a young couple when they first began to keep house as a fine fat sheep, so he bade his shepherd go off to the mountain where the flock were feeding, and bring him back the best he could find. And the shepherd chose out the largest and fattest of the sheep and the one with the whitest fleece; then he tied its feet together and put it across his shoulder, for he had a long way to go.|$|E
6000|$|Conachar arose sullenly {{upon hearing}} this threat, and, {{approaching}} the smith, {{who had just}} taken the tankard in his hand, and was raising it to his head, he contrived to stumble against him and jostle him so awkwardly, that the foaming ale gushed over his face, person, and dress. Good natured as the smith, {{in spite of his}} warlike propensities, really was in the utmost degree, his patience failed under such a provocation. He seized the young man's throat, being the part which came readiest to his grasp, as Conachar arose from the pretended stumble, and pressing it severely as he cast the lad from him, exclaimed: [...] "Had this been in another place, young <b>gallows</b> <b>bird,</b> I had stowed the lugs out of thy head, as I have done to some of thy clan before thee." ...|$|E
60|$|There was no moon, {{and it was}} {{the night}} of Hallowe'en, and {{everyone}} was burning nuts and catching apples in a tub of water with their hands tied, and playing all sorts of other games, till the Shifty Lad grew quite tired of waiting for them to get to bed. The Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird,</b> who was more accustomed to the business, tucked himself up on the hay and went to sleep, telling the boy to wake him when the merry-makers had departed. But the Shifty Lad, who could keep still no longer, crept down to the cowshed and loosened the heads of the cattle which were tied, and they began to kick each other and bellow, and made such a noise that the company in the farmhouse ran out to tie them up again. Then the Shifty Lad entered the room and picked up a big handful of nuts, and returned to the loft, where the Black Rogue was still sleeping. At first the Shifty Lad shut his eyes too, but very soon he sat up, and taking a big needle and thread from his pocket, he sewed the hem of the Black Gallows Bird's coat to a heavy piece of bullock's hide that was hanging at his back.|$|E

50|$|In his semi-autobiographical books Galgenaas (<b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird)</b> and Recht Op Antwoord (A Right To An Answer) he chronicled his {{experiences}} of the justice system, prisons and the psychiatric institutions {{where he had been}} placed.

5000|$|A widow {{wanted her}} son to learn a trade. He insisted {{that he wanted to}} be a thief. She {{predicted}} he would end up hanging from a bridge. One day he did not go to church, and told her that the first trade she heard when she came out would be his. He came to the path and shouted [...] "Thievery" [...] in a disguised voice. She again predicted he would hang from the bridge but gave him to the Black <b>Gallows</b> <b>Bird</b> to learn the trade. The man taught him, and then said they must rob a man who had sold his cattle. On Halloween, they hid in the loft. The shifty lad went down and stirred up the cattle, sending people out; while they were gone, he stole nuts and sewed a leather hide to the thief. He cracked nuts, though the thief warned him he would be heard. He was heard, and the people came, and the thief ran off with the hide still attached. The people said he was stealing the hide and chased him. The Shifty Lad stole the gold and silver while they were gone, and brought them to the thief; they split them.|$|E
