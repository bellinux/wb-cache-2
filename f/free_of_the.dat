5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E

Antony and his {{remaining}} forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins on}} April 1, with Makoto {{awakening}} from a nightmare {{of a girl}} dying on April 6 with a bell in her hand. As the week goes on, he occasionally experiences premonitions of the future, all of which come true. Depending on the player's choices, Makoto ends up getting close {{to one of the}} girls, and on April 5, the story branches into different routes focusing on one of them. In each route, the girl Makoto was close to dies on April 6 with a bell in her hand. Afterwards, Makoto finds that he has traveled back in time to April 1, retaining the memories of the previous six days. Concluding that he is trapped in an infinite loop, he vows to keep the girl alive and break <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop. He does so by rebuilding his relationships with her while dealing with the emotional problem troubling her. On April 6, the girl ends up in a situation similar to when she died in the last loop, but Makoto saves her, breaking <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop and becoming her boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses to {{the crash}} were in {{universal}} agreement that the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway.

Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Druckenmiller got Virginia Tech's drive {{started with}} a first-down pass to the Tech 42-yard line. After a short run by Edmonds, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass, setting up a third-and-seven for Virginia Tech's offense. During the third-down play, wide receiver Bryan Still broke <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Texas defense and caught a 55-yard pass from Druckenmiller for Tech's second offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was successful, and Tech took a 2110 lead with 12:28 remaining in the game.|$|E

Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would have to have been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's post-score kickoff was fielded at the five-yard line by Kendrick and {{returned}} to the Tech 25-yard line. The first play of the drive was an option run with Vick and Kendrick, who broke <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clemson defense for a 45-yard run and a first down at the Clemson 29-yard line. Two short rushes were followed by a pass to fullback Cullen Hawkins at the 10-yard line for a first down. Clemson committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then Ferguson ran straight ahead for a touchdown. The extra point kick was good, and Tech took a 3413 lead with 5:14 left in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was bobbled by kick {{returner}} Andre Kendrick at the Tech one-yard line, but Kendrick broke <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clemson {{defense for}} a 34-yard {{return to the}} 35-yard line. Tech's first play after the return was an 11-yard run by Lee Suggs up {{the right side of}} the field. After the first down, Suggs ran straight ahead for a short gain, then Vick scrambled to the Clemson 37-yard line and another first down. Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run to the left side of the field. At the Clemson 19-yard line, Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard, then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards. The third-down play was an incomplete pass, and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick bounced off the field goal crossbar but did not cross it, thus denying the Hokies three points. With 10:33 remaining in the half, Tech still had a 147 lead.|$|E

He almost met his end before he had started; he was apprehended by the local communists in Mỹ Tho, who saw his French-style dress and mistook him for a colonial agent. They tied him up and chained him to a block of stone before throwing him into a river to drown. However, Thảo broke <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weight and swam to safety.
