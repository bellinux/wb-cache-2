5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Rusty was a strong, slow-moving {{tropical}} cyclone that produced record duration gale-force winds in Port Hedland, Western Australia in late February2013. Originating {{as an area}} of low pressure on 22February well to the northwest of the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the precursor to Rusty steadily developed within a favourable environment. Gradually decreasing surface pressures in the region signaled intensification and the low was classified as Tropical Cyclone Rusty on 23February. Although a large, sprawling system, near-record high sea surface temperatures enabled Rusty to quickly deepen. Becoming essentially stationary on 25February, the system acquired hurricane-force winds as <b>its</b> <b>core</b> improved in structure. The cyclone achieved its peak intensity two days later with maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a barometric pressure of 944hPa (mbar; 27.88inHg). Thereafter, interaction with land caused <b>its</b> <b>core</b> to collapse before the system made landfall near Pardoo Station. Rusty weakened below cyclone strength on 28February. Its remnants persisted over Western Australia for several more days before being absorbed into an extra{{tropical cyclone}} on 5March.|$|E
