25|$|Several peoples saw a {{much larger}} {{decrease}} than {{can be explained by}} the low fertility rates and high mortality rates in Russia <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> Emigration and assimilation contributed to the decrease in numbers of many peoples. Emigration was the most important factor for Germans, Jews and Baltic peoples (Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians). The number of Germans halved between 1959 and 2010. Their main country of destination is Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{main idea}} behind neurocriminology is that crime is only {{partially}} {{a social and}} environmental problem, and biological factors along with medical conditions play a significant role. Deviant brain theories have {{always been part of}} biocriminology, which explains crime with biological reasons. Neurocriminology has become mainstream <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> since contemporary biocriminologists focus almost exclusively on brain due to significant advances in neuroscience. Even though neurocriminology is still at odds with traditional sociological theories of crime, it is becoming more popular in the scientific community.|$|E
25|$|Theoretical and {{computational}} sciences {{are highly}} developed in Iran. Despite the limitations in funds, facilities, and international collaborations, Iranian {{scientists have been}} very productive in several experimental fields such as pharmacology, pharmaceutical chemistry, and organic and polymer chemistry. Iranian biophysicists, especially molecular biophysicists, have gained international reputations since the 1990s. High field nuclear magnetic resonance facility, microcalorimetry, circular dichroism, and instruments for single protein channel studies have been provided in Iran <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> Tissue engineering and research on biomaterials have just started to emerge in biophysics departments.|$|E

25|$|The fast-fashion brands are not {{the only}} one who involve with sweat factories. The German {{sportswear}} giant, Adidas, was blamed for Indonesian sweatshops in 2000 (Osborn, 2000). Adidas was subjected to the issues of underpayment, overtime working, physical abuse and child labour. Another sportswear giant, Nike, is recently facing a heavy wave of anti-sweatshops protests in the US. They are organised by the United Student Against Sweatshops (USAS) and were held in Boston, Washington D.C., Bangalore and San Pedro Sula. They claimed that workers in Nike’s contract factory in Vietnam are suffering from wage theft, verbal abuse and harsh working conditions with ‘temperatures over the legal limit of 90 degrees’(Bain, 2017). Since the 1990s, Nike was reported of employing sweat factories and child labour. Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike’s image has been affected by the issue <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers’ life in 1996. It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on monitoring and management of labour rights (Nisen, 2013). To improve its brand image of being immoral, Nike has been publishing annual sustainable business reports since 2001(Project Just, 2016) and annual corporate social responsibility report continuously since 2005, mentioning its commitments, standards and audit (Nisen, 2013).Yet, the issue of sweatshops continues to bother Nike. Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.|$|E

[...] Their image and long-running success for nearly ten years have influenced many K-pop girl groups of the new generation, including GFriend, Melody Day, and Apink. The New York Daily News selected them {{as one of the}} prominent girl groups of the 2010s along with Fifth Harmony and Little Mix. They were named among the most powerful and influential people in their native country: the Sisa Journal named the group as the most influential entertainers of 2011 and 2012, while Asia Today placed the group at number forty on their 50 Korean Power Leaders list in 2011. Since 2007, Girls' Generation has consistently ranked in the top five of Gallup Korea's [...] "Artist of the Year" [...] and topped the list from 2009 to 2011. The group also consistently appeared on the top ten of Forbes [...] Korea Power Celebrity from 2010 to 2016, topping the list in 2011, 2012, and 2014, and placing second in 2010 and 2013. In 2011, the Korean Institute for Industrial Policy Studies named the group as one of South Korea's [...] "super brands." [...] In 2012, Girls' Generation became the first Korean celebrity to have official postage stamps distributed by the Korea Post.

Floods in November 1990, February 1996, December 2007, and January 2009 each caused temporary closures of I-5 between the Kelso-Longview and Chehalis-Centralia areas.

2500|$|According to one {{description}} in 1996, [...] "The area dies at night ... It needs a neighborhood, a community." [...] <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> {{there has been}} a shift towards greater residential living areas in the Wall Street area, with incentives from city authorities in some instances. Many empty office buildings have been converted to lofts and apartments; for example, the office building of Harry Sinclair, the oil magnate involved with the Teapot Dome scandal, was converted to a co-op in 1979. In 1996, a fifth of buildings and warehouses were empty, and many were converted to living areas. Some conversions met with problems, such as aging gargoyles on building exteriors having to be expensively restored to meet with current building codes. Residents in the area have sought to have a supermarket, a movie theater, a pharmacy, more schools, and a [...] "good diner". The discount retailer named Job Lot used to be located at the World Trade Center but moved to Church Street; merchants bought extra unsold items at steep prices and sold them as a discount to consumers, and shoppers included [...] "thrifty homemakers and browsing retirees" [...] who [...] "rubbed elbows with City Hall workers and Wall Street executives"; but the firm went bust in 1993.|$|E
