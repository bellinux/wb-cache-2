5|$|Today, many flags used in Poland {{are based}} on the design of the {{national}} flag. This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services, such as the naval ensign – a swallow-tailed horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe. Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag. Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship – a horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of the voivodeship – or the flag of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship – a horizontal tricolor of white, yellow and red with the yellow stripe <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> as any of the other two.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the standard two outer pockets and breast pocket, some suits have a fourth, the ticket pocket, usually located just above the right pocket and roughly <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide.</b> While this was originally exclusively a feature of country suits, used for conveniently storing a train ticket, it is now seen on some town suits. Another country feature also worn sometimes in cities {{is a pair of}} hacking pockets, which are similar to normal ones, but slanted; this was originally designed to make the pockets easier to open on horseback while hacking.|$|E
25|$|Fennel, Foeniculum vulgare, is a {{perennial}} herb. It is erect, glaucous green, and grows to heights {{of up to}} 2.5m, with hollow stems. The leaves grow up to 40cm long; they are finely dissected, with the ultimate segments filiform (threadlike), about 0.5mm wide. (Its leaves {{are similar to those}} of dill, but thinner.) The flowers are produced in terminal compound umbels 5–15cm wide, each umbel section having 20–50 tiny yellow flowers on short pedicels. The fruit is a dry seed from 4–10mm long, <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> or less, and grooved.|$|E
5000|$|The egg is truncate, <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>wide,</b> {{and with}} two {{vertical}} and sloping and two horizontal faces.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Washington trailed early as Giants quarterback Eli Manning {{completed}} a 40-yard {{touchdown pass to}} wide receiver Amani Toomer. New York kicker John Carney also scored on a 31-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Redskins continued to trail as Carney kicked a 38-yard field goal. Washington would close out the <b>half</b> <b>as</b> rookie <b>wide</b> receiver Devin Thomas ran for a 29-yard touchdown.|$|R
50|$|A {{swimming}} {{machine is}} a resistance swimming apparatus, often self-contained, enabling the swimmer {{to swim in}} place. This may be accomplished either by accelerating the water past the swimmer or by supporting the swimmer, either in water or on dry land. The first type, known as a countercurrent swimming machine, usually consists of a water tank {{at least twice as}} long and about one and a <b>half</b> times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> an average person with the limbs extended. The swimmer swims unrestrained against an adjustable stream of water set in motion by means of mechanical devices, such as jets, propellers or paddle wheels.|$|R
25|$|Of the {{respiratory}} system {{little has been}} preserved. No traces of the lungs have survived, nor of any air sacks. The sole element still present consists of a seven millimetre long piece of the trachea of which about ten tracheal rings are visible, the most anterior of which are open at the top, giving them a C-shape. They have an average length of 0.33 millimetres and are separated by 0.17 millimetre thick interspaces. The trachea is quite thin, with a preserved width of one millimetre about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> {{as would be expected}} for an animal the size of the holotype, and positioned rather low in the neck base, embedded in connective tissue.|$|E
500|$|The humeri, {{which have}} a length of about , are oval in cross-section, and about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> as they are long at the widest point. Their leading edges are curved in an S-shape, a trait also seen in Leptocleidus, Hastanectes, polycotylids, and the elasmosaurid Wapuskanectes, but not in Nichollssaura. The only femur that is {{presently}} available is [...] long; it is concave on one edge, whereas the other edge is straight near the top but curves sharply near the bottom. The rest of the long bones of the limb have been lost. Allegedly, the radius was similar to but smaller and straighter than the tibia, {{and there was a}} hole present between the tibia and fibula. The 14 preserved phalanges, which likely include elements from both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs, are long and hourglass-shaped.|$|E
500|$|Although most of {{the roads}} in the area date from the 20th century, there are many older roads formed from ancient routes, some as old as Roman. Cheadle Road {{possibly}} originated in Roman times and Ack Lane (formerly Hack Lane) is named after Hacon, a local Saxon landowner. Hulme Hall Road is named for the landmark it runs through and has existed {{since at least the}} 18th century. Until the 20th century, the roads were little more than country lanes, and most traffic consisted of horsedrawn carriages, carts, and milk floats. The roads were about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> as they are currently, and have all since been widened to accommodate the increasing amount of traffic. The first cars appeared in Cheadle Hulme in the early 1900s, but horse-drawn vehicles were the main form of transport until the 1920s. A bus, known as the [...] "Rattler" [...] was introduced around this time, and ran a service through the area. It was, however, very slow and noisy, as its name suggests.|$|E

40|$|A new dajid, Aspidophryxus izuensis sp. n., is {{described}} from seven females and six males found infesting the dorsal carapaces of specimens of Mysidella hoshinoi Shimomura, 2016 (Mysidae: Mysidellinae) {{associated with an}} unidentified species of sea anemone (Haloclavidae) from Izu-Oshima Island, Sagami Sea, central Japan. Aspidophryxus izuensis sp. n. differs from its congeners in having a body length about <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>wide,</b> widest at the anterior part in females; an elongate frontal part of the cephalon, <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> in females; the frontal margin of the cephalon exceeding the anterior margins of lateral lamellae in females; an unsegmented, vermiform, elongate pleon in females; and a uropod composed of a protopod and an inner and outer ramus in males.

50|$|Body {{moderately}} stout and compressed, preoral snout moderately long, {{about half}} of distance from mouth to pectoral origins; mouth narrowly arched, nearly <b>half</b> <b>as</b> high <b>as</b> <b>wide.</b> Second dorsal fin somewhat larger than first; pectoral apices when laid back ending about opposite to first dorsal spine origin. Caudal peduncle moderately long, distance from second dorsal insertion to upper caudal origin {{about as long as}} distance from eye to third gill slits. Lateral trunk denticles close-set, conical and with hooked cusps. Colour blackish, without white fin tips or prominent black markings on underside of body and sides oftail. Size moderate, adults- about 50 cm.|$|R

[...] It is nearly as wide on its north side, along Commercial Street, but less than <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> on its south and east sides. [...] The original exterior color was mainly white, with gray on the first two floors.|$|E
2500|$|When the Bayonne Bridge opened, it was {{the longest}} steel arch bridge in the world, barely surpassing its more massive-arched [...] "sister bridge" [...] in Australia—the Sydney Harbour Bridge—by [...] and taking the {{distinction}} from the Hell Gate Bridge a few miles to the northeast. The American Institute for Steel Construction selected the Bayonne Bridge as the [...] "Most Beautiful Steel Bridge" [...] in 1931, choosing it over the George Washington Bridge for that status.

2500|$|The Kuvasz {{is a large}} {{dog with}} a dense double, odorless coat which is white in color and can range from wavy to {{straight}} in texture. Although the fur is white, the Kuvasz’s skin pigmentation should be dark and the nose should be black. The eyes should have an almond shape. Females usually weigh between 32–41kg (70–90 pounds) while males weigh between 45–52kg (100–115 pounds) with a medium bone structure. The head should be <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> as it is long with the eyes set slightly below {{the plane of the}} muzzle. [...] The [...] (where the muzzle raises to the crown of the head) should be defined but not abrupt. The precise standard varies by country. (See the Breed Standards for a more precise description.) To a casual observer, the Kuvasz may appear similar to a Great Pyrenees, Akbash, a Maremma Sheepdog, Slovak Cuvac and the Polish Tatra Sheepdog, all of which are similar in size, coat color, and general appearance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{illustration}} {{is split}} in two, {{with the bottom}} half of the image showing Manhattan's 9th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and the Hudson River (appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing [...] "Jersey", the names of five cities (Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas; Kansas City; and Chicago) and three states (Texas, Utah, and Nebraska) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps <b>half</b> again <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the Hudson, separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho! Ho!" [...] yelled the Mormon, again setting {{into motion}} the fiendish echoes. He was naked to the waist; {{he had lost}} flesh; he was haggard, worn, dirty, wet. While he pulled on a shirt Nas Ta Bega made the rope fast to a snag of a log of {{driftwood}} embedded in the sand, and the boat swung to shore. It was perhaps thirty feet long by <b>half</b> <b>as</b> many <b>wide,</b> crudely built of rough-hewn boards. The steering-gear was a long pole with a plank nailed to the end. The craft was empty save for another pole and plank, Joe's coat, and a broken-handled shovel. There were water and sand on the flooring. Joe stepped ashore and he was gripped first by Shefford {{and then by the}} Indian. He was an unkempt and gaunt giant, yet how steadfast and reliable, how grimly strong to inspire hope! ...|$|R
5000|$|The Navarin Canyon is a {{submarine}} canyon in the Bering Sea. It is just <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> {{but less than}} <b>half</b> <b>as</b> deep as the Zhemchug Canyon, {{which is the largest}} canyon in the world.|$|R
60|$|Peduncle, rather longer than, and {{not above}} <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> as, the capitulum; {{the latter being}} nearly 2/10ths of an inch in length: the {{membrane}} of the peduncle is thin, naked and structureless.|$|E
60|$|Rostrum (fig. 1 b´, a), rudimentary; in one {{specimen}} it {{was about}} 1/50th of an inch in width; it is either as wide, or only <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide,</b> as the subjacent scale on the peduncle.|$|E
60|$|The {{march was}} resumed, {{and now they}} dove {{straight}} into {{the interior of the}} island, which was about {{a mile and a half}} long and <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide.</b> At some points the path was choked with weeds and trailing vines, and they progressed with difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Fresh {{off their}} {{dominating}} {{win over the}} Jaguars, the Seahawks stayed at home for a Week 6 NFC West duel with the Arizona Cardinals. Seattle would trail {{in the first quarter}} as Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, followed by running back Tim Hightower's 2-yard touchdown run. Arizona would increase its lead in the second quarter with a 29-yard field goal from kicker Neil Rackers. The Seahawks would then get on the board as kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 28-yard field goal. However, the Cardinals took control in the second <b>half</b> <b>as</b> Warner found <b>wide</b> receiver Steve Breaston on a 16-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, followed by Rackers' 31-yard field goal in the fourth.|$|R
60|$|Going to this precipice, we saw no cave until Nuflo had {{cut away}} {{two or three}} tangled bushes, {{revealing}} an opening behind, about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> high and twice <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the door of an ordinary dwelling-house.|$|R
50|$|Tariccoia arrusensis {{is between}} 2.5 and 6 cm along the axis, almost <b>half</b> a <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> long. The dorsal {{exoskeleton}} {{consists of a}} cephalon, a pygidium {{and two or three}} thoracic somites with articulating half-rings, all non-calcified. The cephalon is sub-semicircular, widest near the rounded genal angles. The cephalon is wider than the pygidium. Eyes are absent. Antennas are not known. The body is constricted at the two or three thoracic somites, so the animal gives the impression to have a waist. The pygidium is widest before midlength. The pygidium has a mid-ridge.|$|R
60|$|With some {{exertion}} he drew down a cobwebbed object curiously {{framed in}} iron, which clanked {{as he moved}} it. It was about three feet in length and <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide.</b> Tim contemplated {{it as well as}} he could in the dying light of day, and raked off the cobwebs with his hand.|$|E
60|$|Rostrum (Pl. VIII, fig. 1 a´, a, {{and greatly}} {{magnified}} 1 b´) very narrow; rarely {{more than two}} or three layers of growth are preserved; the sides are deeply sinuous, owing to each zone widening downwards; basal margin rounded; in width equalling about two and a half of the uppermost scales of the peduncle, and about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> as the latera.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now!" [...] Bayley {{slid his}} arm through mine {{and led me}} across a riding road towards a stretch of rough common (singularly {{out of place in}} a park) perhaps three-quarters of a mile long and <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide.</b> On the {{encircling}} rails leaned an almost unbroken line of men and women--the women outnumbering the men. I saw the Guard battalion move up the road flanking the common and disappear behind the trees.|$|E
60|$|Terga sub-triangular, short, nearly <b>half</b> <b>as</b> broad as long; {{three or}} four times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the carina, and rather wider than the occludent segment of the scuta; occludent margin single, arched; carinal margin {{slightly}} arched; basal angle bluntly pointed.|$|R
6000|$|... "The gorge {{above is}} {{a quarter of}} a mile through, and very {{difficult}} to pass. It is half-blocked with great rocks in two or three places, and there would be immense difficulty in getting the mules over. Beyond that it widens again, but the extent is not more than half what it is here. The walls are almost perpendicular, and I do not think that it would be possible to climb them at any point. Farther up there is another ravine. It is very narrow--not <b>half</b> so <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> this--and the stream rushes with great velocity along it. Two hundred yards from the entrance the rocks close in completely, and there is a fall of water sixty or seventy feet high." ...|$|R
2500|$|The RF {{bandwidth}} of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, {{but only}} considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or [...] "baseband") signal, since {{the upper and}} lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using frequency modulation (FM), it is twice <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> single-sideband techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only <b>half</b> <b>as</b> many transmissions (or [...] "channels") can thus be accommodated. For this reason analog television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as vestigial sideband, somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) {{in order to reduce the}} required channel spacing.|$|R
60|$|Blinky {{accompanied}} Pan to {{the ridge}} which they climbed {{at a point}} opposite camp. Probably it was four or five hundred feet high, and provided a splendid prospect of the valley. Pan could scarcely believe his eyes. He saw wild horses--so many that {{for the time being}} he forgot the other important details. He counted thirty bands in a section of the valley no more than fifteen miles long and less than <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide.</b> These were individual bands, keeping to themselves, each undoubtedly having a leader.|$|E
60|$|Margaret {{remained}} an inmate of this cave for two days. The place {{is known to}} this day as Margaret's Cave. It stands in a very secluded spot {{on the banks of}} a small stream. The ground around it is now open, but in Margaret's time it {{was in the midst of}} the forest. The entrance to the cave is very low. Within, it is high enough for a man to stand upright. It is about thirty-four feet long, and <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide.</b> There are some appearances of its having been once divided by a wall into two separate apartments.|$|E
6000|$|He {{went down}} to the clump of bushes, still holding his gun in {{readiness}} for instant use. The patch was but some thirty feet long by <b>half</b> <b>as</b> <b>wide.</b> He walked backwards and forwards among the low bushes, but the fugitive was certainly not there. Going {{to the end of the}} patch he could see plainly enough the track where the man had entered, for although there was little snow on the top of the ground it lay among the tufts of grass. He walked round the clump, but there were no signs of any footsteps leaving it. [...] "This is the rummest thing I ever saw," [...] he muttered; [...] "the fellow can't have flown away; yet, he certainly has not walked off." ...|$|E
30|$|Antennules (Fig.  2 (h)). Slightly {{exceeding}} {{the tip of}} the rostrum, about two times <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>wide,</b> with three rows of short setules on antennular body; seven (juvenile) to nine (adult) aesthetascs of different sizes (none of these aesthetascs exceeds the length of antennules). Two lateral aesthetascs of different sizes, about <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long as antennular body; sensory seta long, about 1.4 times shorter than antennular body. Male seta short, thick, about 4.6 times shorter than length of antennular body, inserted at three thirds of antennular length, counting from base.|$|R
50|$|The yellowish-white {{shell is}} {{moderately}} large and measures 3.9 mm. It is elongate-ovate. The nuclear whorls are decollated. The six post-nuclear whorls are well rounded, appressed at the summit. They {{are marked by}} four equally strong but not equally spaced, incised, spiral lines between the sutures. The fourth of these is immediately above the periphery, while the first is as far below the summit as the third is posterior to the fourth. The second line divides {{the space between the}} first and third into equal halves, which are about one and a <b>half</b> times <b>as</b> <b>wide</b> <b>as</b> the spaces included between the third and fourth incised spiral. In addition to the spiral sculpture the whorls are crossed by numerous, fine, decidedly retractive, incremental lines. The periphery of the body whorl is somewhat inflated, well rounded. The base of the shell is moderately long and moderately rounded, crossedby 8 strongly incised, equal, spiral lines, which are a little stronger than those occurring on the spire. These lines become exceedinglyclosely spaced between the periphery and the umbilical area. The axial sculpture on the base is of the same character and strength as that appearing on the spire. All of the incised, spiral lines on base and spire are crossed by very slender, axial threads, which lend these channels a somewhat pitted appearance. The sutures are well impressed. The aperture is moderately large, oval, and effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The inner lip oblique, moderately long, somewhat reflected, and re-enforced for the greater part of its length by the attenuated base, provided with an oblique fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is glazed with a thin callus.|$|R
60|$|Scuta.--The two {{segments}} {{stand at}} right-angles to each other; the basal segment is linear and pointed, fully <b>half</b> <b>as</b> long, {{but only one}} third <b>as</b> <b>wide,</b> <b>as</b> the occludent segment. The point of junction of the two segments is wider {{than the rest of}} the basal segment. This latter segment lies some little way above the top of the peduncle. The occludent segment is bluntly pointed; it is directed a little inwards from the edge of the orifice towards the terga; the apex reaches up just above the slightly reflexed lower point of the terga. The adductor muscle is fixed under the point of junction of the two segments.|$|R
