50|$|In geology, a sill is a tabular sheet {{intrusion}} {{that has}} intruded between older layers of sedimentary rock, beds of volcanic lava or tuff, or even along {{the direction of}} foliation in metamorphic rock. The term sill is synonymous with concordant <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet.</b> This means that the sill does not cut across preexisting rocks, in contrast to dikes, discordant intrusive sheets which do cut across older rocks. Sills are fed by dikes, except in unusual locations where they form in nearly vertical beds attached directly to a magma source. The rocks must be brittle and fracture to create the planes along which the magma intrudes the parent rock bodies, whether this occurs along preexisting planes between sedimentary or volcanic beds or weakened planes related to foliation in metamorphic rock. These planes or weakened areas allow the intrusion of a thin sheet-like body of magma paralleling the existing bedding planes, concordant fracture zone, or foliations.|$|E
40|$|The {{exceptional}} 3 -d exposures of the mid-Tertiary <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> network on {{the southern}} margin of Mount Hillers, Henry Mountains, southern Utah, have undergone no syn- or post-emplacement deformation. The sills and dikes, which formed above the underlying Mount Hillers laccolith, therefore provide an ideal opportunity to study purely magmatic processes in a shallow crustal <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> network. For this study, field work and laboratory analysis were employed to constrain the timing, emplacement mechanisms, and internal flow characteristics of these sills and dikes. Detailed geologic mapping of cross-cutting relationships, in addition to qualitative textural analysis in the field, indicate that younger, relatively fine-grained dikes cross-cut older, relatively coarse-grained sills. Crystal size distribution, thin section petrography, and major and trace element geochemistry all suggest two distinct batches of magma (one coarse- and one fine-grained) {{were involved in the}} construction of the sill/dike complex. Field fabrics and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility fabrics suggest complex internal flow of the intrusive sheets throughout the growth of the central intrusive igneous body. Field observations indicate that intruding magma exploited radial fractures and bedding planes in the sedimentary host rock. In addition, rigidity contrasts in the host rock were likely an important control on the stratigraphic level of sill emplacement and on <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness. The proposed construction model for the <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> network consists of an initial phase of dike-fed sill emplacement in subhorizontal strata. During subsequent growth of the underlying main laccolithic body, which included uplift and rotation of the overburden, continued sill emplacement was followed by radial dike intrusion.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} magmatic {{intrusions}} concentrate on geometry and internal architecture: {{only a few}} {{pay particular attention to}} emplacement-related deformation structures in the host rock that record how magma is accommodated within the crust. This research aims to develop a greater understanding of how igneous intrusive bodies are emplaced and accommodated within the shallow crust, using classic exposures found in the Henry Mountains, Utah. Two satellite intrusions to the Mt Hillers intrusive centre show highly contrasting geometries, host-rock deformation and accommodation structures and apparent emplacement mechanisms. Trachyte Mesa, the most distal satellite intrusion of Mt Hillers, has a relatively simple elongate (NW-SE) geometry, concordant with the Entrada Sandstone it intrudes. The intrusion is comprised of multiple, stacked <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets.</b> Syn-emplacement deformation structures observed in the host rocks consist of a conjugate set of intrusion margin-parallel deformation bands and extensional brittle faults, the latter occurring at the tips of <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets.</b> These structures, along with a post¬emplacement set of intrusion margin parallel and perpendicular tensile joints, indicate extensional strain normal to the intrusion margin, consistent with a two-stage growth mechanism for individual sheets as well as the overall intrusion. In comparison, Maiden Creek shows a more complex intrusion geometry, including: lobate morphologies; steps and broken bridges; inclined sill sheets; and concave-upwards 'Iaccolithic' morphologies. A new model is proposed for the emplacement, evolution and final geometry of the intrusion, with a central elongate NE-SW lobe resulting from a principal north-easterly propagating magma flow. Lateral growth of the Maiden Creek intrusion resulted from radial spreading of magma from this main north-easterly flow trend towards the east and north-west. It is proposed that the southern Maiden Creek intrusion is comprised of two westerly-derived (saucer-shaped?) sills. Overlying these deeper-rooted sills is the newly identified Maiden Creek Shear Zone (MCSZ). This structure is an antithetic accommodation structure to magma flow. Substantial amounts of strain observed through microstructural analysis of shear zone samples suggest that the MCSZ {{played a critical role in}} accommodating magma emplacement.

40|$|The Sonju Lake {{intrusion}} (SLI) is a 1200 -m-thick, shallow-dipping, sheet-like intrusion {{that forms}} {{part of the}} Beaver Bay Complex (RI- 58, Chapter 7). Although its exposed strike-length is only about 3 km (Fig. 3 - 1), the SLI has a distinctive aeromagnetic signature that can be traced for at least 20 km beneath a cover of glacial drift. The nearly constant width of its aeromagnetic anomaly suggests that the <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> retains a fairly uniform thickness and dip angle over most of this distance. The eastern margin of the SLI is abruptly truncated by the Beaver River diabase dike. The base of the SLI is in intrusive contact with a complex mixture of gabbroic to dioritic rocks, granophyre, and volcanic hornfels. The top of the SLI is in gradational contact with a granophyric quartz ferromonzodiorite phase of the Finland granite.

40|$|Examination of the opaque {{minerals}} in an <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> of analcite dolerite {{shows that}} they consist partly of a cubic solid solution, referred to for brevity as 'magnetite', and partly of a rhombohedral solid solution referred to as 'ilmenite'. Systematic variation of {{the properties of the}} 'magnetites' indicates an increase in titanium dontent towards the more slowly cooled central part of the sheet. 'Ilmenite' usually occurs as oriented intergrowths in 'magnetite’ crystals and contains 10 - 20 % ferric oxide in solid solution. Less commonly, ‘ilmenite' also occurs as a discrete phase believed to have crystallised before the formation of the 'magnetite'-'ilmenite' intergrowths, and this seems not to contain ferric oxide in solid solution. 'Magnetite’ -'ilmenite' relationships are considered in terms of an Fe(_ 3) O 9 _ 4) -FeTiO(_ 3) phase diagram constructed from the experimental data of previous workers. The content of opaque minerals decreases regularly from 9 % in the marginal rocks to less than 1 % at the centre of the intrusion. The intensity of natural remanent magnetization decreases systematically away from the margins of the sheet and is clearly dependent on the content of 'magnetite' in the intrusion. The intrusion is reversely magnetized and has a mean direction of magnetization that confirms its age as Tertiary in agreement with geological data. However, there is considerable variation in the palaeomagnetic directions within the sheet due to the multiple natures of the intrusive processes. This is especially clear in the inclinations. The contact relations of the intrusion suggest that the reverse magnetization is a primary feature although the possibility of self-reversal cannot be ruled out entirely. Constructional details are given of instruments designed for the accurate automatic measurement of the Curie temperature of a minute ferromagnetic sample, and for the determination of the saturation magnetization of such samples at room temperature...|$|E

Geologic age Stratigraphic division Geologic relation Recent Alluvial bed and talus deposit Raised coral reef Miocene? Intrusive igneous rocks Uotsuri-jima formation unconformity unconformity intrusion The geologic map of the Uotsuri-jima and its adjacent area is shown in Fig. 2. 2. The Uotsuri-jima formation is mainly made of sandstone with intercalation of conglomerate, rarely with thin coal bed and siltstone. 3. The Uotsuri-jima formation shows a trend of SW-NE, EW and NW-SE strikes, and generally inclining at the angle of less than 20 ° N. It indicates dome structure in the Uotsuri-jima, and slight folding in other islands. 4. Intrusive igneous rocks, such as hornblende dioritic porphyrite and its associated rocks, occur as <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> in the Uotsuri-jima formation of the Uotsuri-jima and Minami-kojima. Essential constituent minerals of these rocks are hornblende, plagioclase and magnetite phenocrysts or microphenocrysts. The groundmass showing horocrystalline texture is composed of hornblende, plagioclase, quartz, magnetite and secondary minerals viz. calsite, chlorite and other clay minerals. 5. The chemical and normative mineral compositions of intrusive igneous rocks are shown in Table 2. As seen from the Table, they are generally rich in Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, MgO and CaO contents, while poor in FeO, total FeO, TiO 2 and K 2 O contents. 6. The natural remanent magnetic properties of intrusive igneous rocks from the Senkaku Retto are shown in Table 3, and also their stereographic projections in Fig. 7. That indicates just four samples (no. SU- 1 in the Uotsuri-jima) are magnetized reversely, while others are normally.

40|$|The {{deformed}} Permian Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt (DMOB) {{forms the}} basement of the Dun Mountain-Maitai terrane and is traceable through the entire length of New Zealand. The DMOB contains a variably serpentinised mantle portion and a crustal portion containing gabbros, dolerites, cross cutting dikes and extrusives, together they are similar to oceanic crust. The initial crustal portion, however, is atypical when compared to other ophiolites, being thin and lacking a sheeted dike complex, but has well spaced inclined <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> and sills. At least four post-Permian deformation periods affect the DMOB; collision and rotation during emplacement of the DMOB on the Gondwana margin, compression during Mesozoic orogenies, extensional deformation during the Gondwana break-up and transpressive deformation related to the modern plate boundary through New Zealand. Structural work in the Northern Bryneira Range focused on well preserved outcrops to investigate crustal growth and contemporaneous deformation during the Permian. Structural evidence of Permian deformation was determined by examination of pseudostratigraphy, structures constrainable to the Permian, and the geometric relationships with the overlying Maitai sedimentary sequence. Crosscutting by intrusive phases was used to determine a chronological order of crustal growth and deformation episodes. It was concluded that all deformation was extensional and that two major phases of magmatism were separated by a period of deformation and were followed by ongoing syn-sedimentary deformation during the deposition of the Maitai Group. After removal of Mesozoic rotation, the resulting orientations of paleo-horizontal markers and diverse orientations of <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> were analysed. Two hypothesises were tested to assess the origin of inclined intrusive sheets: a) that the diverse orientations were the result of tectonic rotation coeval with the intrusion of dikes. b) that primary orientations of the sheets had been diverse. Results show that the sheets were intruded with diverse orientations, probably related to variation in the principle horizontal stress over time. Further rotation of the assemblage of sheets occurred during the last stages of magmatism and during the subsequent period of sedimentation. The last stage probably relates to large scale normal faulting during the development of the sedimentary basin. ii...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} three mid-Tertiary intrusions {{from the}} Henry Mountains (Utah, USA) that were assembled from amalgamation of multiple horizontal sheet-like magma pulses {{in the absence}} of regional deformation. The three-dimensional intrusion geometries are exceptionally well preserved and include: (1) a highly lobate sill; (2) a laccolith; and (3) a bysmalith (a cylindrical, fault-bounded, piston-like laccolith). Individual <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> are recognised on the margins of the bodies by stacked lobate contacts, and within the intrusions by both intercalated sedimentary wallrock and formation of solid-state fabrics. Finally, conduits feeding these intrusions were mostly sub-horizontal and pipe-like, as determined by both direct observation and modelling of geophysical data. The intrusion geometries, in aggregate, are interpreted to reflect the time evolution of an idealised upper crustal pluton. These intrusions initiate as sills, evolve into laccoliths, and eventually become piston-like bysmaliths. The emplacement of multiple magma sheets was rapid and pulsed; the largest intrusion was assembled in less than 100 years. The magmatic fabrics are interpreted as recording the internal flow of the sheets preserved by fast cooling rates in the upper crust. Because there are multiple magma sheets, fabrics may vary vertically as different sheets are traversed. These bodie...|$|R

40|$|The Dufek intrusion, in the {{northern}} part of the Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica, is part of an extensive, Middle Jurassic igneous province that was related to, and emplaced just prior to Gondwana break-up. It has been described as one of the largest layered gabbro intrusions in the world, and is exposed as two non-overlapping gabbro sequences in the Dufek Massif and the Forrestal Range. A new compilation of aeromagnetic data over the Dufek intrusion and surrounding region is based on mapping at two scales, a 2 km grid spacing over the Dufek intrusion, and a 6 km grid spacing over the surrounding region. Advanced processing of the data is used to produce an analytical signal and a terrace map as a basis for a new interpretation. Modelling and interpretation of the data show that the Dufek intrusion is not as extensive as was thought, and that it is more similar in size to the Stillwater Intrusion in North America, than to the Bushveld Complex in South Africa to which it has previously been compared. The reduced size of the Dufek intrusion is due to reinterpretation of an anomaly over Berkner Island, to the north of the Pensacola Mountains, as that of an uplifted basement block rather than a continuation of the Dufek intrusion. The Dufek intrusion is modelled as two separate intrusive phases of a composite intrusion. The main part is a dipping <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> displaced by a normal fault which accounts for two parallel magnetic anomalies over the Forrestal Range. The minor part forms the Dufek Massif itself, which the magnetic data show was emplaced on a separate trend and is of a shallower origin than the Forrestal phase. Magnetic lineaments on the compilation map are used to establish a possible chronology of events. We suggest that the emplacement of both phases of the Dufek intrusion was preceded by a period of extensional block faulting which uplifted the Berkner Island basement block, and was succeeded by a further period of extensional faulting involving a component of strike–slip deformation during the initial stages of Gondwana break-up...|$|E
40|$|The Mount Ayliff Complex (MAC) is {{situated}} {{on the border between}} Kwa-Zulu Natal and the Eastern Cape provinces in the Republic of South Africa, approximately 90 km due west of Port Shepstone. The Complex forms part of the Karoo Igneous Province and includes five lobes (Ingeli, Insizwa, Tonti, Tabankulu, and Horseshoe) that are the remnants of a single continuous <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheet</b> that had an original extent of 18, 000 km 2 • The current outcrop is estimated at 800 km 2 • The lobes all show extensive internal differentiation, from basal ultramafic cumulates to diorites and monzonites at the top, while most other intrusions in the Karoo Igneous Province cooled rapidly enough to produce relatively homogenous dolerites. Most work conducted on the Complex thus far has centered on the Insizwa lobe due to the presence of a Ni-sulphide occurrence near the base of the lobe at Waterfall Gorge. The setting of the ores has analogies to the Noril'sk-Talnakh deposits, which has raised considerable exploration interest on the Mount Ayliff Complex over the last century. The current study investigates the Ni-Cu sulphide potential of the Ingeli and Horseshoe lobes, which have been poorly studied in the past. To this effect, a stream sediment survey was conducted around the Ingeli lobe to try and detect potentially hidden magmatic sulphide ores. Further, the five lobes of the Complex have been compared in terms of lithology and lithogeochemistry. Analytical techniques used for the current study include: XRF, ICP-MS and electron microprobe. Stream sediment samples were analysed using XRF and ICP-OES. Olivines from the ultramafic cumulates of the Ingeli and Insizwa lobes are undepleted in Ni, whereas olivines from the Horseshoe and Tabankulu lobes are strongly depleted in Ni. This suggests that the rocks of the latter two lobes crystallized from parental magmas that interacted with a sulphide liquid and that the magmatic flow direction was from the north to the south. The data indicate that the ultramafic rocks of the Complex plot on or near control lines between olivine and Karoo dolerite indicating that the rocks are mixtures of cumulus olivine and trapped melt of Karoo dolerite composition. There appears to be a copper enrichment towards the top of the ultramafic package in the Ingeli lobe. This pattern corresponds to other studies conducted in the InsiZWa lobe and suggests that the two lobes had originally been connected. The lowermost cumulates of the Ingeli lobe contain an enhanced crustal component suggesting some in situ contamination. No significant sulphide enrichments were encountered in the Basal Zone rocks of the Ingeli lobe. However, the stream sediment data indicate localized PGE enrichment indicating the possible presence of a localized hidden sulphide occurrence of the type found at Waterfall Gorge. Small amounts of sulphides were found associated with the Basal Zone rocks in the Horseshoe lobe consistent with the trends of Ni-depletion of olivines. However, a lack of Co depletion in the ultramafic rocks of this lobe suggests that any sulphide segregation event that did take place was of a relatively small scale.

These structures first appear {{to be the result of}} stretching and boudinage of <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> or dykes. However, closer examination reveals that they are not boudins, but are instead primary intrusive structures. A detailed study was performed on a swarm of pegmatite intrusions at Cap de Creus. Layering is often continuous between beads, and, in some cases, individual beads exhibit a very irregular shape. These observations are shown to be incompatible with an origin by boudinage. Analogue experiments were used to test the effect of the two models (boudinage and emplacement) on the structures around beads, and show that an emplacement model of local expansion and collapse of magmatic sheets is the most compatible with field observations. Such structures can only form when dykes intrude hot rocks, when magma solidifies slowly enough to allow enough ductile flow of the wall rock to accommodate the formation of the beads. The fact that the pegmatite bead strings are not boudins has repercussions for the interpretation of the deformation at Cap de Creus and necessitates caution in the interpretation of deformation based on apparent boudins in intrusive rocks in other areas. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of eruption forecasting is predicting the path of propagating dikes. We show how lateral dike propagation can be forecast using the minimum potential energy principle. We compare theory to observed propagation paths of dikes originating at the Bárðarbunga volcano, Iceland, in 2014 and 1996, by developing a probability distribution for the most likely propagation path. The observed propagation paths agree well with the model prediction. We ﬁnd that topography {{is very important for}} the model, and our preferred forecasting model considers its inﬂuence on the potential energy change of the crust and magma. We tested the inﬂuence of topography by running the model assuming no topography and found that the path of the 2014 dike could not be hindcasted. The results suggest that lateral dike propagation is governed not only by deviatoric stresses but also by pressure gradients and gravitational potential energy. Furthermore, the model predicts the formation of curved dikes around cone-shaped structures without the assumption of a local deviatoric stress ﬁeld. We suggest that a likely eruption site for a laterally propagating dike is in topographic lows. The method presented here is simple and computationally feasible. Our results indicate that this kind of a model can be applied to mitigate volcanic hazards in regions where the tectonic setting promotes formation of laterally propagating vertical <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

The plugs form the distinctive peaks along U.S. Highway 101 just south of San Luis Obispo and south of State Highway 1 from San Luis Obispo to Morro Bay. The rock is composed of dacite, a felsic extrusive rock, intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite, {{and is a member of}} the igneous family. Its lithology and composition is a groundmass of plagioclase with amphibole (hornblende), biotite, pyroxene (augite), quartz, and glass; phenocrysts of plagioclase, amphibole and often quartz.

The Lloyds River Fault Zone comprises three high-strain zones, dominantly composed of mylonitic amphibolites, separated by less deformed plutonic rocks. Structural, age and metamorphic data suggest the Lloyds River Fault Zone accommodated sinistral-oblique underthrusting of ophiolites underneath the Dashwoods microcontinent prior to 471 ± 5 Ma at 800 °C and 6 kbar. Plutonic rocks within the Lloyds River Fault Zone comprise two suites dated at 464 ± 2 plus 462 ± 2 and 459 ± 3 Ma, respectively.

Three nested Christmas-tree laccoliths made up of separated, shallow-level felsic sheets were emplaced at 2 - 3 km depth with associated roof uplift. Then, at a deeper level, a granite pluton was constructed over a short time span by three magma pulses stacked downward as subhorizontal <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets,</b> with space for magma generated mostly by roof uplift and tectonic-gravitational displacement of the overburden. Length-to-thickness relationships for individual laccolith layers, {{as well as for}} pluton sheets, show a power-law correlation interpreted as the frozen evidence for the occurrence of a vertical inflation stage during intrusion growth. We infer that laccolith sheets failed to coalesce and form a larger pluton because their magma driving pressure exceeded the lithostatic load in a crustal section rich in subhorizontal magma traps (a thrust stack of bedded rocks). However, the driving pressure of the first magma batch of the Monte Capanne pluton was presumably enhanced by an increased magma supply rate, so that the driving pressure exceeded the load at the level of a deeper magma trap represented by a major thrust fault. The following magma batches arrived in rapid succession and were not able to penetrate the still mushy tabular mass. Thus the laccolith sheets and the sheeted pluton represent different outcomes of similar processes occurring under slightly different conditions...|$|R
40|$|AaSrRACr: An {{arenaceous}} diamictite {{rests on}} fissile silty mudstone and argillaceous diamictite, and is overlain by a laminated muddy siltstone east of Helpmekaar in the Dundee district of northern Natal. The argillaceous deposits originated {{either in the}} subglacial or proglacial zone of a partly grounded marine ice sheet, where sediment was supplied by debris-laden floating ice, meltwater plumes, and turbidity currents. The arenaceous diamictite isthe product of melt-out debris released close to the grounding line of the ice sheet, where it was subjected to overriding by the ice and slumping and rcdeposition by sediment gravity flow. The laminated siitstone represents sediment that was deposited in a low-energy setting by turbidity currents and suspension settling downslope from a retreating rounding line. Dispersed ice-ratted clasts occur in these fine-grained eposits. The upper surface of the arenaceous diamictite displays regularly spaced linear undulations that are parallel to the former ice-flow direction, as are corrugations in discrete subhonzontal slip planes in its upper part. Dikelike bodies of this diamictite {{are found in the}} underlying mudstone and argillaceous diamictite. These dikes, or wedge-shaped sheets, of sandy diamictite are nearly vertical in their upper parts but at depth curl to the southeast to form sill-like bodies. These intrusive diamictites record a novel, and previously undescribed, form of subglacial bed shear by repeated hydraulic injections which shuffled the upper layers of the substrate to the south-southeast. Bed compaction and shear beneath the grounded ice is recorded by folds in steepened portions of the clastic <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> and by pinch-and-swell (and folded pinch-and-swell) of the clastic sills.

40|$|The Annieopsquotch {{ophiolite}} exposes a c. 5. 5 -km-thick {{section of}} tholeiitic gabbros, sheeted dykes and pillow basalts. Based on the along-strike consistency in {{thickness of the}} major crustal units, and lack of significant throw on spreading-related normal faults, the Annieopsquotch ophiolite is interpreted to have formed at an intermediate- to fast-spreading ridge. The upper c. 400 m of the gabbro zone is composed of massive, texturally heterogeneous gabbros with compositions that approach those of the sheeted dykes and basalts. Below this is c. 1. 6 km of 10 – 30 -m-thick planar <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> or sills. The lowermost part of the gabbro zone is composed of gabbroic rocks with relict troctolite and troctolitic gabbro enclaves, which are veined and partly replaced by gabbro and pyroxenite. Sill contacts within the central, sill-dominated part of the gabbro zone are sub-parallel to boundaries between the major ophiolite lithostratigraphic units. The upper and lower contacts of individual gabbro sills may have finer grain sizes, indicating that the intrusions cooled from the top and bottom. Locally well-preserved comb structures (crescumulates) indicate downward growth, supporting a sill interpretation. The sills are composed of weakly or un-deformed plagioclase+clinopyroxene ±olivine cumulates. Trace element modeling suggests that the parental magmas of these cumulates had compositions {{very similar to the}} overlying sheeted dykes and basaltic lavas, as do dykes emplaced within the gabbro zone. Model liquids calculated from the gabbroic sills generally become more evolved up-section, indicating that magma evolution in the Annieopsquotch ophiolite was dominated by fractionation in lower crustal conduits, below the level of a putative axial melt lens (AML). The model liquids, sheeted dykes and basalts preserve a similar, wide range of compositions, which may indicate that aggregation, homogenization and fractionation in an AML was inefficient. Similar intra-conduit fractionation of mantle-derived melts might also contribute to MORB evolution at mid-ocean ridges...|$|R
40|$|The Siletz terrane, a {{predominantly}} mafic accreted oceanic terrane, {{is located in}} the Cascadia Forearc region of Oregon, Washington and Vancouver Island. The terrane represents a late Paleocene – Eocene large igneous province that consists of pillow lavas, massive flows and <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets.</b> Previously it has been proposed that the Siletz terrane represents either an accreted oceanic plateau, hotspot island chain, backarc basin, island arc, or a sequence of slab window volcanics. A province-wide geochemical reassessment of the terrane, including new high precision Sr-Pb-Nd-Hf isotope, has been used to assess the validity of the proposed tectonomagmatic models for the Siletz terrane. The trace element data show little evidence of crustal contamination, or an arc signature, and the samples have rare earth element (REE) patterns that are flat to light REE enriched. These features are similar to other oceanic plateaus such as the Ontong Java and the Caribbean. Initial isotope ratios range from 206 Pb/ 204 Pb: 18. 751 to 19. 668, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb: 15. 507 – 15. 661, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb: 38. 294 – 39. 2128, 176 Hf/ 177 Hf: 0. 28300 – 0. 28316 (εHf: 9. 0 to 14. 5), 143 Nd/ 144 Nd: 0. 51282 – 0. 51299 (εNd: 5. 0 to 8. 1) and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr: 0. 70302 – 0. 70380. These data are consistent with a mantle source of the Siletz terrane that appears to have been heterogeneous and slightly enriched. The enriched signature has characteristics of both EM 2 and HIMU components and this, combined with a calculated mantle potential temperature well above ambient mantle, indicates derivation of the Siletz magmatism from a mantle plume, possibly the Yellowstone Hotspot. We therefore conclude that the Siletz terrane represents an accreted oceanic plateau...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with {{the lower part of the}} Eastern Layered Series (LELS) of Rhum, and with the marginal relationships of the ultrabasic complex in eastern Rhum. The Lower Eastern Layered Series comprises approximately Units 1 - 5 of previous workers. Remapping has revealed considerable along-strike lithological variation in the units of the L. E. L. S. It is suggested, on the basis of field and geochemical evidence, that two layers formerly regarded as 'conformable <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> of fine grained olivine gabbro'. may be evolved allivalite layers rather than later intrusions. Xenolith suites in these layers and elsewhere, indicate a component derived from the roof or walls of the magma chamber. Cryptic variation is more extensive in the L. E. L. S. than in other parts of Rhum: olivine forsterite content varies from 85. 6 to 70, and clinopyroxene MgX 100 /(Mg+Fe) varies from 88 to 74. Post-cumulus effects and sub-solidus re-equilibration have altered the initial compositions of the mineral phases. The migration of interstitial liquids has had a major effect on mineral chemistry. Replacement of plagioclase-rich rocks by peridotite is a significant process in parts of the sequence. This is ascribed to disequilibrium between migrating pore liquids and plagioclase. The data are consistent with a model of repeated replenishment by picritic magma, although the replenishing liquids may have been slightly less magnesian than those subsequently available during the formation of the upper ELS. Re-examination of the eastern margin of the ultrabasic complex suggests that the ultrabasic rocks formed more or less in situ, and that fragments of the roof to the intrusion occur in places. Locally under these roof fragments variolitic olivine-rich gabbros are developed, which may represent the chilled margin to the ultrabasic complex...|$|R
40|$|The Taishu Group, which {{consists}} of conformable series of sandstones and mudstones of about 6100 - 6750 meters in thickness, is stratigraphically divided into the following six formations and represents a major cycle of sedimentation. Upper Lower Shiohama Formation (950 m+thick) Yoshigaura Formation (700 - 1000 m thick) Kechi Formation (1500 - 1700 m thick) Wakata Formation (850 - 900 m thick) Sasu Formation (1400 - 1500 m thick) Komoda Formation (800 m+thick) a) The Komoda Formation consists of bluish gray fine-grained banded sandstone containing often granules or sometimes thin conglomerate beds and black mudstone or shale. The sandstone bed is mostly an alternation of banded sandstone, 10 to 20 cm in thickness, and thin black shale, and occasionally massive, more than 20 m in thickness. The sandstone is often ripple-marked and cross-laminated. A thin coaly shale bed occurs between Komo-dahama and Onozaki. Molluscan and plant fossils are found beside the way, north of Kozuki. b) The Sasu Formation is mainly composed of some sandstones, black sandy mudstone, and black mudstone. Many sole marks, being longitudinal current-ridge marks, and other marks are found on the lower surface of sandstone beds, or the upper surface of mudstone beds. Many ripple marks are preserved on the upper surfaces of sandstone beds. Some marine molluscan fossils were reported by S. KANNO (1955) from the Shintomi pit of the Taishu mine. He wrote that {{the age of the}} Taishu Group is Upper Oligocene to early Miocene. Some plant fossils occur in the black shale bed in the coast between Kozuki and Kunehama. c) The Wakata Formation consisting of the lower platy banded shale and upper massive mudstone with some interbeded sandstones, is intruded by some <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> of quartz porphyry. Sabalites taishuensis TAKAHASHI was reported by the author (1958) from Wakata. Its age may be Oligocene. d) The Kechi Formation consists predominantly of black shale and mudstone with some alternating beds of banded sandstone and shale. The upper horizon is occupied often by alternations of sandstone and shale. The upper sandstone is often coarser than that in the lower horizon. Some fossils of mollusca, echinus, and plants are found at many localities, but there are no fossils for determining its geological age. e) The Yoshigaura Formation begins with the predominant alternation of beds of sandstone and shale, getting thin gradually northward and disappearing finally. The mudstone becomes thick in the northern area. The sandstone beds often make some crossbeddings (see text-fig. 6). f) The Shiohama Formation consists of prominent sandstone-beds with thin shale, but in the northern area the shale gets somewhat thicker. The sandstone is white gray color, fine to medium grain, and sometimes massive, containing often sand pipes. No fossils are found. The hornfels rock, thermally altered by the biotite granite, occupies the southeast area of this present district and trends to the northeastward of major anticline and syncline axes. The hornfels rocks are dark brown and very fine, recrystallizing biotite. Quartz porphyry occurs as the <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> or sills, intruded often into the Sasu and Wakata Formations. There are other intruded igneous rocks, that is, diorite, porphyrite, aplite, granodiorite porphyry, doleritic rock, and fine-grained gabbroic rock. The major structure of the Taishu Group in the east-side area of the Komoda tectonic line, is the large and gentle syncline and anticline trending NE-SW. The northwest side of the Komoda tectonic line is the violent folded and faulted area. The fold axis trends almost NE to NEE, and the fault of NE or NEE trend is the most predominant. In the Taishu mine area, there are two fault systems; one is the normal N-S fault and the other is the reversed strike fault accompanying more or less minor drag folds...|$|R
40|$|The {{base of the}} 10 - 20 km thick, batholithic, Western Fiordland Orthogneiss (WFO) {{is exposed}} in {{northern}} Fiordland as the Mount Daniel Complex (MDC). It forms a 100 -metre thick, sheeted complex between the WFO and the underlying dominantly dioritic basement of Arthur River Complex (ARC). Although previously called a migmatite aureole at the WFO base, field relations show it formed after the WFO was solidified and injected by numerous rectilinear trondhjemitic dykes. U-Pb zircon analysis confirms emplacement of the WFO at 125 Ma, with MDC formation slightly later, between 120 - 112 Ma. Successive dyke injection and sheeting during tight to isoclinal folding, and fold asymmetry, indicates that the MDC was emplaced syn-tectonically into an active, sinistral reverse shear zone associated with exhumation of the WFO. The MDC is composed almost entirely of <b>intrusive</b> metre-scale <b>sheets,</b> ranging in composition from mafic dykes, low-Na and high-Na intermediate (trondhjemitic) dykes, high-K granitic dykes and the dominant intermediate-composition Mt Daniel Sheets (MDS) of the complex 55 - 65...|$|R

40|$|The North Cape massif {{consists}} of a semi-conformable sequence of serpentinite, gabbro, sheeted sill and dike units, and pillow lavas. Although structurally disrupted, they can be interpreted {{in terms of an}} idealised ophiolite sequence and represent the most complete sequence in the Northland Ophiolite. Their age is considered to be Late Cretaceous - Paleocene on the basis of microfossils in associated sediments. Early Miocene K-Ar ages from igneous rocks are thought to reflect the time of emplacement as a thrust sheet of oceanic crust and upper mantle. The gabbros are divided into a lower unit characterised by well-developed cumulate layering and an upper unit which is massive; the sheeted sills and dikes are quartz-diorite and microgabbro interleaved with minor pillow lava. Two phases of alteration are observed, a pervasive low-grade greenschist metamorphism attributed to sea-water interaction after formation as oceanic crust, and an overprinting zeolitic alteration which is possibly post-emplacement. Their tholeiitic nature as well as overlapping geochemical compositions suggest that the gabbros and sheeted dikes and sills represent ditferent components of a single magmatic system related by simple fractionation processes. Several lines of evidence suggest that the magmas that formed the North Cape gabbro and <b>sheeted</b> <b>intrusives</b> have subduction-related chemical characteristics. In the gabbro, calcic plagioclase (An) and depleted Zr and Y abundances, and in the <b>sheeted</b> <b>intrusives</b> depleted high field strength element abundances relative to typical MORB, is indicative of a subduction signature. The presence of subduction- 2 ̆ 7 elated characteristics within the Northland Ophiolite suggests that it may have originated at a back-arc basin rather than a major ocean ridge spreading centre...|$|R
40|$|The {{emplacement}} mechanism, geometry, and {{isotope geochemistry}} of plutons of the Wiley Glacier complex suggest that new continental crust grew by multiple injection of tonalitic dykes during dextral transtension in the Antarctic Peninsula magmatic are in Early Cretaceous times. The suggested mechanism {{is analogous to}} basalt dyke injection during sea-floor spreading. During normal-dextral shear, the Bums Bluff pluton, a sheeted, moderately east-dipping, syn-magmatically sheared tonalite- granodiorite intruded syn-magmatically sheared quartz diorite of the Creswick Gap pluton and 140 +/- 5 Ma homblende gabbro. U-Pb dating of zircon and Ar-Ar dating of hornblende and biotite suggest that both granite s. l. plutons were emplaced between 145 and 140 Ma, but that extensional shearing was active {{from the time of}} emplacement until ca. lu Ma. The Bums Bluff pluton is chilled at its margin, and grades through mylonitised, porphyritic tonalite-granodiorite sheets and tonalite-granodiorite sheets with minor chilling, to a kilometre-scale body of coarse-grained, hypidiomorphic tonalite-granodiorite Co-magmatic microdiorite forms dykes and abundant synplutonic mafic enclaves. These dykes opened as echelon veins during episodic dextral shear and were deformed to trains of enclaves during continued normal-dextral shear. Pluton-marginal porphyritic and hypidiomorphic tonalite- granodiorite forms large, fault-hosted sheets emplaced progressively under extension with minor dextral shear. Kinematic indicators from pluton-marginal granite s. l. dykes suggest that early in pluton accretion, <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> cooled rapidly, with simple shear prior to full crystallisation changing to ductile simple shear during cooling. Kinematic indicators towards the pluton core suggest that as the pluton grew, and cooled more slowly, emplacement switched from sheeting to in situ inflation with simple shear distributed across a broad zone prior to full crystallisation of magma. Cross-cutting relationships with the coeval, syn-extensional, Creswick Gap pluton suggest that the Bums Bluff pluton was emplaced in a steeper, second generation shear structure, like those in normal fault systems. This suggests that the Wiley Glacier complex was emplaced above the base of the brittle- ductile transition zone (15 - 18 km depth). The Bums Bluff pluton has Nd and Sr isotope values that range from mantle dominated (is an element of Nd- 141 = + 3. 8, Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 (141) = 0. 70468) to more crustally influenced (is an element of Nd- 141 = - 1. 7, Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 (141) = 0. 70652) This range probably represents different degrees of mixing between mantle-derived magma and lower crustal partial melts generated in the garnet-stability zone (40 + km depth). Addition of new crustal material by mafic underplating {{at the base of the}} crust and by redistribution of granitic s. l. and mafic, modified, underplated magma to mid- crustal levels along extensional shear zones as the are 'spread' were the primary mechanisms of crustal growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{evolution of}} the Ox Mountains Granodiorite { 478 ± 12 Ma) during and after its emplacement is described. This pluton has been emplaced within and synchronously with, a major transpressional shear zone which is expressed as a 11 km wide belt of strongly deformed NE-SW striking, steeply dipping metasediments. The steep shear zone cleavage is intensified to a mylonitic fabric in a braided system of high strain zones formed through out the Ox Mountains Inlier. Pervasive ductile, sinistral deformation in the shear zone is interupted by the emplacement of the pluton and by the synchronous development in the country rocks of series of brittle thrust structures, which produced a displacement upwards and towards {{the centre of the}} shear zone. These thrusts are intimately associated with the emplacement of moderately inclined granodiorite sheets belonging to the main intrusive phase indicating a component of vertical extension in the country rocks at this time. The CMC is a heterogeneous, four component pluton internally composed of a series of large sheets or dykes. Minor muscovite granite sheets emplaced along the northern contacts, preceeded the main <b>intrusive</b> <b>sheets</b> of Group 1 and Group 2 granodiorite with associated diorites. Sheets of tonalites and minor components completed the emplacement history. A prolonged history of sinistral transpressional shearing has deformed the pluton. Discrete sinistral shears indicate an early localization event is overprinted by a main ductile penetrative fabric which cross-cuts ail internal contacts. This fouation is deformed by extensive sinistral S-C fabrics. Later deformation becomes increasingly partitioned into late sinistral and dextral shear zones which are locally mylonitic. Microstructural evidence suggests that the main foliation was formed under lower amphibolite facies and deformed by a steady state flow process. The S-C fabric and late shear zone formation, best developed in the granodiorites and granites, may have been initiated by a switch in the predominant alkalifeldspar deformation mechanism from crystal plastic to a diifusive mass transfer process. This may be a retrogessive effect, and the product is a grain size reduction which may lead to ultramylonite production. The emplacement model for the Ox Mountains Granodiorite is constrained by the original geometry of the dykes or sheets. These data rule out emplacement of the OMG in a releasing bend or pull-apart structure. Strain data does not allow a forceful mechanism and a permissive emplacement model is preferred, in which vertical extension during the intrusive episode created an area of dilation in which dyking occurred. This was caused by oblique movements on two upwardly converging high strain zones outside the pluton. Two satellite plutons, the Lough Talt Adamelhte and the Easkey Lough Adamellite were emplaced in extensional cavities created by reactivated sinistral movements on one of the high strain zones at a much later date. (c 400 Ma). Transpressional shear zones may initiate or enhance melting in the lower crust and mantle lithosphere where thermal perturbation has occurred. The shear zones may provide conduits for the melts and emplacement sites, especially where high transpressional strains are accommodated by vertical uplift...|$|R
