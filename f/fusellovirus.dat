This is especially true for crenarchaeal viruses from the family Fuselloviridae, which possess spindle-shaped capsids and genomes that harbor a great number of uncharacterized genes. The functions of these unidentified gene products are of interest as they have the potential to provide valuable insights into the <b>fusellovirus</b> infection cycle and archaeal viruses in general. In an effort to better characterize the genetic requirements of the Fuselloviridae, we have performed genetic and biochemical experiments using the best studied <b>fusellovirus,</b> Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus 1 (SSV 1). A comprehensive genetic analysis of SSV 1 was conducted using long inverse PCR and transposon mutagenesis. The results of this work illustrate that SSV 1 is highly tolerant of mutagenesis. A robust protocol for the purification of recombinant VP 2 protein from E. coli was developed and should be useful for future studies aimed at characterizing the biochemical and structural characteristics of this SSV 1 structural protein. Finally, the first insights into a <b>fusellovirus</b> infection are presented and provide the framework for a detailed characterization of the <b>fusellovirus</b> infection cycle.

SSV 1 contains a 15. 5 -kb double-stranded DNA genome that encodes 34 proteins with greater than 50 amino acids. A site-specific integrase and a DnaA-like protein have been previously identified by sequence homology, and three structural proteins have been isolated from purified virus and identified by N-terminal sequencing (VP 1, VP 2, and VP 3). The functions of the remaining 29 proteins are currently unknown. To assign functions to these proteins, we have initiated biochemical and structural studies on the SSV 1 proteome. Here we report the structure of SSV 1 D- 63. The structure reveals a helix-turn-helix motif that dimerizes to form an antiparallel four-helix bundle. Mapping residues conserved among three <b>fusellovirus</b> isolates onto the structure shows that one face of the rod-shaped molecule is highly conserved. This conserved surface spans the dimer axis and thus exhibits 2 -fold symmetry. Two smaller conserved patches, also related by 2 -fold symmetry, are found on the opposite face of the molecule. All of these conserved surfaces are devoid of clefts or pockets typically used to bind small molecules, suggesting that D- 63 may function as an adaptor protein in macromolecular assembly...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>fusellovirus</b> SSV 2 and the {{integrative}} plasmid pSSVi, which {{constitute a}} unique helper-satellite virus system, replicate in Sulfolobus solfataricus P 2. In this study, we investigated the interplay among SSV 2, pSSVi and their host by transcriptomic analysis. Following infection of S. solfataricus P 2, SSV 2 activated its promoters in a temporal and distributive fashion, {{starting from the}} transcription of ORF 305. Expression of several host genes encoding DNA replication and transcription proteins was up-regulated, suggesting that SSV 2 depended heavily on the host replication machinery for its replication. SSV 2 gene expression appeared to follow a similar pattern in S. solfataricus P 2 harboring pSSVi to that in S. solfataricus P 2 lacking the plasmid. Several early genes of the virus were transcribed earlier and more efficiently {{in the presence of}} pSSVi than in its absence.

40|$|<b>Fuselloviruses</b> SSV 1 and SSV 2 are model {{systems to}} {{investigate}} virusehost relationships in stably infected cells {{thanks to their}} temperate nature. Although they are very similar in morphology, genome organization and gene synteny, their replication is induced by different stimuli, i. e. : by UV-light exposure (for SSV 1) and by the growth progression of the host (for SSV 2). In this study, we have analysed global gene expression in SSV 1 - and SSV 2 -lysogens of Sulfolobus solfataricus P 2 {{in the absence of}} any stimuli. Additionally, the interplay among SSV 1, SSV 2 and the host has been investigated in a double-infected strain to explore both virusehost and virusevirus interactions. Whereas SSV 1 did not induce major changes of the host gene expression, SSV 2 elicited a strong host response, which includes the transcriptional activation of CRISPR loci and cas genes. As a consequence, a significant decrease of the SSV 2 copy number has been observed, which in turn led to provirus-capture into the host chromosome.

TPV 1 is the first virus isolated and characterized from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeal genus Thermococcus. TPV 1 particles have a lemon-shaped morphology (140  nm ×  80  nm) similar to the structures previously reported for <b>Fuselloviruses</b> and for the unclassified virus-like particle PAV 1 (Pyrococcus abyssi virus 1).

The TPV 1 genome encompasses 28 predicted genes; the protein sequences encoded in 16 of these genes show no significant similarity to proteins in public databases.

40|$|SSV-type integrases, encoded by <b>fuselloviruses</b> which infect the hyperthermophilic archaea of the Sulfolobales, are archaeal {{members of}} the {{tyrosine}} recombinase family. These integrases catalyze viral integration into and excision from a specific site on the host genome. In the present study, we have established an in vitro integration/excision assay for SSV 2 integrase (IntSSV 2). IntSSV 2 alone was able to catalyze both integration and excision reactions in vitro. A 27 -bp specific DNA sequence is minimally required for {{the activity of the}} enzyme, and its flanking sequences influence the efficiency of integration by the enzyme in a sequence-nonspecific manner. The enzyme forms a tetramer through interactions in the N-terminal part (residues 1 to 80), interacts nonspecifically with DNA and performs chemical catalysis in the C-terminal part (residues 165 to 328), and appears to recognize and bind the specific site of recombination in the middle portion (residues 81 to 164). It is worth noting that an N-terminally truncated mutant of IntSSV 2 (residues 81 to 328), which corresponded to the putative product of the 3 =-end sequence of the IntSSV 2 gene of the integrated SSV 2 genome, was unable to form tetramers but pos-sessed all the catalytic properties of full-length IntSSV 2 except for the slightly reduced recombination activity.

After infecting its host, the virus multiplied rapidly to high titers (> 1010 PFU/ml). Replication of the virus retarded host growth but did not cause lysis of the host cells. STSV 1 did not integrate into the host chromosome and existed in a carrier state. The STSV 1 DNA was modified in an unusual fashion, presumably by virally encoded modification systems. STSV 1 harbors a double-stranded DNA genome of 75, 294 bp, which shares no significant sequence similarity to those of <b>fuselloviruses.</b> The viral genome contains a total of 74 open reading frames (ORFs), among which 14 have a putative function.

Here, we describe the isolation, characteristics and genome sequence of His 2, a spindle-shaped halovirus, and compare it to the previously reported halovirus His 1. Their particle dimensions, host-ranges and buoyant densities were found to be similar but they differed in their stabilities to raised temperature, low salinity and chloroform. The genomes of both viruses were linear dsDNA, of similar size (His 1, 14, 464  bp; His 2, 16, 067  bp) and mol% G + C (∼ 40 %), with long, inverted terminal repeat sequences. The genomic termini of both viruses are likely to possess bound proteins. They shared little nucleotide similarity and, except for their putative DNA polymerase ORFs, no significant similarity at the predicted protein level. A few of the 35 predicted ORFs of both viruses showed significant matches to sequences in GenBank, and these were always to proteins of haloarchaea. Their DNA polymerases showed 42 % aa identity, and belonged to the type B group of replicases that use protein-priming. Purified His 2 particles were composed of four main proteins (62, 36, 28 and 21  kDa) and the gene for the major capsid protein was identified. Hypothetical proteins similar to His 2 VP 1 are present in four haloarchaeal genomes but are not part of complete prophages.

In this work, the satellite virus was engineered to obtain an Escherichia coli-Sulfolobus solfataricus shuttle vector for gene transfer and expression in S. solfataricus by fusing site-specifically the pSSVx chromosome with an E. coli plasmid replicon and the ampicillin resistance gene. The pSSVx-based vector was proven functional like the parental virus, namely it was able to spread efficiently through infected S. solfataricus cells. Moreover, the hybrid plasmid stably transformed S. solfataricus and propagated with no rearrangement, recombination or integration into the host chromosome. The high copy number of the artificial genetic element was found comparable with that calculated for the wild-type pSSVx in the new host cells, with no need of genetic markers for vector maintenance in the cells and for transfomant enrichment.

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{model for}} investigating virus-host interactions in hyperthermophilic Archaea is the Fusellovirus-Sulfolobus system. The host, Sulfolobus, is a hyperthermophilic acidophile endemic to sulfuric hot springs worldwide. The Fuselloviruses, {{also known as}} Sulfolobus Spindle-shaped Viruses (SSVs), are 2 ̆ 2 lemon 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 spindle 2 ̆ 2 -shaped double-stranded DNA viruses, which are also found worldwide. Although {{a few studies have}} addressed the host-range for the type virus, Sulfolobus Spindle-shaped Virus 1 (SSV 1), using common Sulfolobus strains, a comprehensive host-range study for SSV-Sulfolobus systems has not been performed. Herein, we examine six bona fide SSV strains (SSV 1, SSV 2, SSV 3, SSVL 1, SSVK 1, SSVRH) and their respective infection characteristics on multiple hosts from the family Sulfolobaceae. A spot-on-lawn or 2 ̆ 2 halo 2 ̆ 2 assay was employed to determine SSV infectivity (and host susceptibility) in parallel challenges of multiple SSVs on a lawn of a single Sulfolobus strain. Different SSVs have different host-ranges with SSV 1 exhibiting the narrowest host-range and SSVRH exhibiting the broadest host range. In contrast to previous reports, SSVs can infect hosts beyond the genus Sulfolobus. Furthermore, geography {{does not appear to be}} a reliable predictor of Sulfolobus susceptibility to infection by any given SSV. The ability for SSVs to infect susceptible Sulfolobus host does not appear to change between 65 °C and 88 °C (physiological range); however, very low pH appears to influence infection.

40|$|Sulfolobus {{spindle-shaped}} virus 1 (SSV 1) is {{the prototype}} {{and the most}} characterized member of the Fuselloviridae family (1). Upon infection, this <b>fusellovirus</b> establish a steady lysogenic state into the host cells. In particular, one copy of the viral genome site-specifically integrates into the host genome at an arginyl-tRNA gene, whereas 4 - 6 copies of the viral genome are maintained as episomal DNA. SSV 1 is so far {{the only member of}} the Fuselloviridae family to show an UV-inducible life cycle, indeed, its replication is strongly enhanced by UV-light irradiation (1). The physical map of all the SSV 1 transcripts (T 1 - 9, Tx and Tind) has been determined (2) and their expression profile has been investigated before and after UV-irradiation (3), Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the regulation of the viral life cycle are still poorly understood. Recently, a genome-wide microarray analysis led to the identification of a novel SSV 1 transcript expressed in the lysogenic host cells and termed Tlys (4). This transcript is expressed from a region lying nearby the UV-inducible Tind, whose expression is, in turn, shut off in lysogenic cells. Interestingly, Tlys encodes for a 6. 3 -kDa protein (F 55) which has been predicted to adopt the Ribbon-Helix-Helix fold (RHH). This fold is a hallmark of negative transcription regulators that forms two-fold symmetric dimers (RHH) 2 capable to bind at multiple operators arranged as inverted or tandem repeats. Noteworthy, tandem-repeated sequences have been identified in the promoters of T 5, T 6, Tind and Tlys transcripts. EMSA assays confirmed that F 55 is able to bind these targets showing a concentration-dependent affinity, which reflects their sequence conservation in respect of a consensus. In particular, F 55 showed high affinity towards targets of T 5 and T 6 that are overall identical to the consensus, whilst displayed a lower affinity for the target of Tind and Tlys. Consequently, a regulation mode for F 55 has been proposed to explain its involvement in controlling the SSV 1 lysogeny (4) Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) confirmed the in vivo interaction of F 55 with these regulative sequences in SSV 1 -lysogenic cells. Moreover, it has been revealed that, soon after the UV irradiation, an apparent degradation of Tlys is induced and a consequently drop in the F 55 concentration has been observed. This is consistent with the dissociation this regulator from its relative targets, thus allowing the expression of the UV-inducible transcript Tind as well as of the early transcripts T 5 and T 6. The physiological role of F 55 in the maintenance of the SSV 1 lysogeny will be discussed. References: 1. Martin A., (1984) EMBO J. 3, 2165 - 2168. 2. Reiter W.
