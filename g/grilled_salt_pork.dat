40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was {{analysed}} chemical and physical parameters of dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham and neck. Dry-cured meat is a traditional dry-cured product obtained after 12 - 24 months of ripening under controlled environmental conditions.   Ham and neck was salted by nitrite salt mixture during 1 week. Salted meat products were dried at 4 °C and relative humidity 85 % 1 week after salting. The quality of dry-cured meat is influenced by the processing technology, for example length of drying and ripening period. The average moisture of dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham was 63. 77 % and dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck was 59. 26 %. The protein content was 24. 87 % in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham and significantly lower (20. 51 %) in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck. The value of intramuscular fat in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham was 4. 97 % and 14. 40 % in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck. The <b>salt</b> content was 5. 39 % in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham and 4. 83 % in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck. The cholesterol content was 1. 36 g. kg - 1 in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham and significant lower in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck (0. 60 g. kg - 1). The value of lightness was 44. 36 CIE L* in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham and significantly lower in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck (40. 74 CIE L*). The pH value was 5. 84 in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham and 5. 80 in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck. The shear work was 9. 99 kg. s - 1 in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham and 6. 34 in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck.

50|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>pork</b> is salt-cured pork. It is {{prepared}} {{from one of}} three primal cuts: pork side, pork belly, or fatback. Depending on the cut, respectively, <b>salt</b> <b>pork</b> may be lean, streaky or entirely fatty. Made from the same cuts as bacon, <b>salt</b> <b>pork</b> resembles uncut slab bacon, but is considerably saltier and not bacon-cured or smoked. It is thus virtually identical to the Slavic food salo, which also displays similar variation in meat-to-fat ratio. Long used as a shipboard ration, <b>salt</b> <b>pork</b> now finds use in traditional American cuisine, particularly Boston baked beans, pork and beans, and to add its flavor to vegetables cooked in water, or with greens as in soul food. It is also central to the flavoring of clam chowder. It generally is cut and cooked (blanched or rendered) before use.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was {{analysed}} and evaluated chemical and physical parameters of dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck and ham. Dried salted meat is one of the main meat products typically produced with a variety of flavors and textures. Neck (14  samples) and ham (14 samples) was salted by nitrite salt mixture during 1 week. The nitrite salt mixture for salting process (dry salting) was used. This salt mixture contains: salt, dextrose, maltodextrin, flavourings, stabilizer E 316, taste enhancer E 621, nitrite mixture. The meat samples were dried at 4 °C and relative humudity 85 % after 1 week salting. The weight of each sample was approximately 1 kg. After salting were vacuum-packed and analysed after 1 week. The traditional dry-cured meat such as dry-cured ham and neck obtained after 12 - 24 months of ripening under controlled conditions. The average protein content was significantly (p < 0. 001) lower in dried pork neck in comparison with dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham. The average intramuscular fat was significantly (p < 0. 001) lower in dried pork ham in comparison with dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck. The average moisture was significantly lower (p ≤ 0. 05) in dried salted ham in comparison with dried pork neck. The average pH value was 5. 50 in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> ham and 5. 75 in dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck. The content of arginine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and threonine in dried salted ham was significantly lower (p < 0. 001) in comparison with dried <b>salted</b> <b>pork</b> neck.
