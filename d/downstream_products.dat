5000|$|As {{these terms}} are under discussion, {{another way of}} looking at these {{activities}} is upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>product</b> management, where 'upstream' is referring to any activity that helps to define, create, or improve the product, while 'downstream' refers to any activity that promotes the product.

The confusion stems mainly from the mix up between the term [...] "Marketing" [...] as a discipline, comprising Product Management, MarCom (Marketing Communications), etc. and using the same term 'Marketing' as a synonym for 'Promotion' or 'advertising', i.e. taking a product to the market (i.e. 'downstream').|$|R

Consequently, the export supply schedule of country F’s <b>downstream</b> <b>product</b> to country H would experience a downward/rightward shift caused by lower prices of the upstream product. This downward/rightward shift would increase exports and, hence, the regional market share of country F’s downstream agricultural industry. Then, the previously discussed dynamic patterns could prevail once again where increases in market shares would further stimulate country F’s downstream agricultural industry to upgrade its technology and productivity.

The R&D behavior of supplier and buyer firms is characterized by switching equilibria, thereby providing support for the notion of distinct technological regimes. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Diversity of {{palm oil}} product in Indonesia is still limited, {{therefore}} it is needed to take an advantage {{of the development of}} <b>downstream</b> <b>product</b> of crude palm oil by esterification reaction. Esterification reaction is a reaction between carboxylic acid and alcohol to form ester. One of the emerging <b>downstream</b> <b>product</b> fatty acid alkyl ester is plasticizer. Plasticizer is an additive compound added to polymer to improve flexibility and workability. In this study, plasticizer was synthesized by esterification of oleic acid and isopropanol, using activated natural zeolite catalyst. The process was done with a variation of reaction time (4 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours) and mole ratio (1 : 6, 1 : 9, and 1 : 12), with reaction temperature at 80 oC, stirring speed at 200 rpm and 15 % of composition of oleic acid based catalyst as fixed variables. From the analysis of the results showed that the esterification reaction time and mole ratio affect the product conversion. The best operating condition obtained in this research was 4 hours of reaction time and 1 : 12 of mole ratio which resulted the conversion of reaction was 67. 09 %. Characteristics of plasticizer produced from this research were viscosity (at 20 oC) 2. 405 to 2. 803 mPa. s and Specific Gravity (at 20 oC) from 0. 863 to 0. 872...|$|R
40|$|The NLRP 3 inflammasome is a multi-protein {{complex that}} assembles in {{response}} to tissue damage or infection, triggering activation of caspase- 1, an enzyme that converts interleukin (IL) - 1 beta into its active form. A role for the NLRP 3 inflammasome is emerging in inflammatory pain, but its influence in other pain types is largely unexamined. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the role of the NLRP 3 inflammasome and its <b>downstream</b> <b>product,</b> caspase- 1 in a model of acute burn-induced pain in male mice. A superficial burn was induced on the plantar surface of the left hind paw using a hot plate set at 52. 5 C for 25 s. Development of burn-induced mechanical allodynia, thermal allodynia, edema and weight bearing changes was assessed in Nlrp 3 (-/-) and caspase- 1 -deficient (Ice(-/-)) mice, and in mice administered the selective NLRP 3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC 950. Burn-induced mechanical and thermal allodynia developed normally in NIrp 3 (-/-) and Ice(-/-) mice and mice administered MCC 950. Bum-induced edema was significantly reduced in Ice-/- mice only. Bum-induced weight bearing changes were attenuated in Nirp 3 (-/-) mice and mice administered MCC 950 72 h after burn only. This study suggests that NLRP 3 and its <b>downstream</b> <b>product</b> caspase- 1 have a limited role in the development of burn-induced pain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

50|$|The main {{method of}} {{synaptic}} signaling in the NMJ is {{through use of}} the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and its receptor. The CNS homolog is glutamate and its receptors, and one of special significance is the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.

Experiments conducted with estradiol show that exposure to the estrogen significantly increases synaptic density and protein concentration.|$|E
