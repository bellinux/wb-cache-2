5|$|John's {{personal}} life greatly affected his reign. Contemporary chroniclers state that John was sinfully lustful {{and lacking in}} piety. It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses, but chroniclers complained that John's mistresses were married noblewomen, which was considered unacceptable. John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester, and two of those mistresses {{are known to have}} been noblewomen. John's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of Angoulême is less clear, however. None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried, and there is no actual <b>documentary</b> <b>proof</b> of adultery after that point, although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period. The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries the British {{recruited}} {{large numbers}} of South Indians, primarily Indian Tamils, to work in tea, coffee, rubber and coconut plantations in Ceylon. Ceylon's majority Sinhalese viewed Indian Tamils with deep suspicion, fearing that they would dominate the island's central highlands and ally themselves with the indigenous Ceylon Tamils, increasing the latter's political strength. Following independence from Britain in February 1948, Ceylon's Sinhalese dominated government introduced the Ceylon Citizenship Bill which {{had the effect of}} denying citizenship and making stateless the country's Indian Tamils, who by now accounted for 11% of the population. The bill provided for citizenship by descent or registration but both required <b>documentary</b> <b>proof,</b> something that was difficult for most Indian Tamils, many of whom were illiterate. The ACTC opposed the bill which was passed by Parliament at its second reading on 20 August 1948. Shortly afterwards Ponnambalam decided to join the United National Party (UNP) led government which caused a split in the ACTC. Eventually the ACTC dissidents, led by Chelvanayakam, E. M. V. Naganathan and C. Vanniasingam formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK, Federal Party) on 18 December 1949.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explore approaches to create unique identities by the de-duplication process using multi-modal biometrics. Various government sectors in the world provide different services and welfare schemes for the beneffit {{of the people in}} the society using an identity number. A unique identity (UID) number assigned for every person would obviate the need for a person to produce multiple <b>documentary</b> <b>proofs</b> of his/her identity for availing any government/private services. In the process of creating unique identity of a person, there is a possibility of duplicate identities as the same person might want to get multiple identities in order to get extra beneffits from the Government. These duplicate identities can be eliminated by the de-duplication process using multi-modal biometrics, namely, iris, ngerprint, face and signature. De-duplication is the process of removing instances of multiple enrollments of the same person using the person's biometric data. As the number of people enrolledinto the biometric system runs into billions, the time complexity increases in the de duplication process. In this thesis, three different case studies are presented to address the performance issues of de-duplication process in order to create unique identity of a person...|$|R

In addition to Greene, Martin Slater, Aaron Holland (a servant of the Earl of Devonshire as well as a Queen's Man), and Thomas Swinnerton were involved in the planning. Perhaps because they had learned from Philip Henslowe's recent problems with neighbourhood opposition in building the Fortune, they did not approach the court for approval until they had already placated their parish neighbours—as Henslowe had—by contributing liberally to poor relief.|$|E
40|$|The {{legitimacy}} {{of power is}} a feature of authority, which is obtained and exercised in compliance with human rights and principles of legality. Election, in democratic states, {{is a way of}} achieving power, when people give power to persons whom they consider to be honest, just and able to rule the state. There are various conditions and types of the {{legitimacy of}} power according to M. Weber, D. Beetham, J. d'Aspremont and others, but prerequisite to recognize that power (legitimacy of power) are results of elections which are considered being fair. In my opinion, contemporary elections {{have a significant impact on}} recognition of the power legitimacy. International community recognizes the legitimacy of power relying on voting results as a decision of citizens. Problem of power legitimacy in case of falsification of the election results is hidden information about it. Often there is no <b>documentary</b> <b>proofs</b> considered that results are falsified. Authorities have too much impact on recognition of legitimacy and citizens often don't have possibility to prove illegitimacy. If legitimacy is regarded as equivalent to legality, then its other characteristics are dismissed. In this paper the legitimacy and the legality are divided. Falsifications violate human rights and such power can't be recognized as legitimate. Persons who achieve power in an unfair way usually conduct unfair politics. In the paper positions of aforementioned scholars concerning the legitimacy of power, election reality and contemporary process recognition of the legitimacy are analyzed. Types of the legitimacy taking into account the election results, hidden information about falsifications, counterfeit legality, fundamentals of power legitimacy according to natural law viewpoint and people’s positions to power legitimacy. Elections falsifications without proofs is background for recognition of illegitimacy of power. This research is a new viewpoint on the problem of the legitimacy of power...|$|R

6000|$|The {{organization}} of labor {{is one of}} the chief acknowledged factors in the retrogression of British trade. The workers have become class conscious as never before. The wrong of one is the wrong of all. They have come to realize, in a short-sighted way, that their masters' interests are not their interests. The harder they work, they believe, the more wealth they create for their masters. Further, the more work they do in one day, the fewer men will be needed to do the work. So the unions place a day's stint upon their members, beyond which they are not permitted to go. In [...] "A Study of Trade Unionism," [...] by Benjamin Taylor in the [...] "Nineteenth Century" [...] of April, 1898, are furnished some interesting corroborations. The facts here set forth were collected by the Executive Board of the Employers' Federation, the <b>documentary</b> <b>proofs</b> of which {{are in the hands of}} the secretaries. In a certain firm the union workmen made eight ammunition boxes a day. Nor could they be persuaded into making more. A young Swiss, who could not speak English, was set to work, and in the first day he made fifty boxes. In the same firm the skilled union hands filed up the outside handles of one machine-gun a day. That was their stint. No one was known ever to do more. A non-union filer came into the shop and did twelve a day. A Manchester firm found that to plane a large bed-casting took union workmen one hundred and ninety hours, and non-union workmen one hundred and thirty-five hours. In another instance a man, resigning from his union, day by day did double the amount of work he had done formerly. And to cap it all, an English gentleman, going out to look at a wall being put up for him by union bricklayers, found one of their number with his right arm strapped to his body, doing all the work with his left arm--forsooth, because he was such an energetic fellow that otherwise he would involuntarily lay more bricks than his union permitted.|$|R

40|$|Na temelju fotografija interieura iz 1884. Milana Vranyczany-Dobrinovića, sina baruna Ljudevita Vranyczany-a, od kojih se neke po prvi put objavljuju, autorica analizira unutarnje uređenje palače Vranyczany u Zagrebu. Posebno istražuje ikonografski i stilski stropnu sliku nad reprezentativnim stubištem palače, do sada takoder neobjavijenu. Sliku nepoznatog autora "Midin sud" pripisuje venecijanskom baroku i datira je približno krajem 17. i poč. 18. st. The {{reviews of}} the history of {{building}} of the mansion of Baron Ljudevit Vranyczany-Dobrinović in the former Kuković street in Zagreb give the years form 1881 to 1884 as the dates of completion of the construction. The mansion has been built in the hystoric style and since 1934 has been used by Gallery of Modem Art to present Croatian art of the 19 th and 20 th century. On the basis of <b>documentary</b> <b>proofs</b> in archives, articles published in "Narodne Novine" (1881 — 1882) and of original documents referring to the construction of the mansion on 12, Strossmayer square that are being kept in the National Archives in Zagreb, it is possible to conclude that a part of the mansion was used as an apartment house from 24 th March 1883 on. The mansion was completed in June 1883 which is proved by the fact that Baron Vranyczany on that date applied to the Committee of Building and Fire fighting of the City of Zagreb to be issued a "residence permit" for the whole building. The existing research papers concerning the building do not mention the internal decoration of the mansion. In the photographs that are being published in this paper and which were, together with a description, donated to the Museum of the City of Zagreb by Ljudevit 2 ̆ 7 s son Dr. Milan Vranyczany-Dobrinović (album: Palais Ludwig Baron Vranyczany in Agram), an exceptional elegance of the interior can be perceived — luxurious furniture, abundance of paintings which show the Baron 2 ̆ 7 s collecting passion and the beauty of decorations — stucco works with groups of figures and ornaments made of white plaster. Greater part of the text deals with the painting by an unknown author (oil on canvas) situated on the mirror ceiling of the main staircase in a double stucco frame of leaves. The painting has not only the function to decorate the entrance in the palace but also has the significance of an imprese — the Baron 2 ̆ 7 s personal and cherished characteristics and slogan. The painting is interesting as an iconographic and attributive problem. It is an illustration of the story of "Midas 2 ̆ 7 Judgment" — a Greek legend about a musical contest between Apollo and Pan and of Frigian king Midas who was, preferring the Panpipe, given donkey 2 ̆ 7 s ears. Giving the available data about the painting, the author leaves open the question of attribution. Dr. Milan Vranyczany called it a "Venetian painting". Considering the dimensions of figures and their arrangement there opens a possibility that the eclectic method (pastiche), in which a painter of academic education gathers together all the protagonists, has been used. It was customary to use ready made patterns for the whole composition as well as for individual figures. Another possibility is that the painting "Midas 2 ̆ 7 Judgment" is an authentic work dating from the late Baroque (end of the 17 th or beginning of the 18 th century) by an academically educated Italian painter...|$|R

500|$|Most of the impostors were dismissed; however, Anna Anderson's claim persisted. Books and {{pamphlets}} {{supporting her}} claims included Harriet von Rathlef's book Anastasia, ein Frauenschicksal als Spiegel der Weltkatastrophe (Anastasia, a Woman's Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe), {{which was published}} in Germany and Switzerland in 1928, though it was serialized by the tabloid newspaper Berliner Nachtausgabe in 1927. This was countered by works such as La Fausse Anastasie (The False Anastasia) by Pierre Gilliard and Constantin Savitch, published by Payot of Paris in 1929. Conflicting testimonies and physical evidence, such as comparisons of facial characteristics, which alternately supported and contradicted Anderson's claim, were used either to bolster or to counter the belief that she was Anastasia. In the absence of any direct <b>documentary</b> <b>proof</b> or solid physical evidence, the question of whether Anderson was Anastasia was for many a matter of personal belief. As Anderson herself said in her own idiomatic English, [...] "You either believe it or you don't believe it. It doesn't matter. In no anyway whatsoever." [...] The German courts were unable to decide her claim one way or another, and eventually, after 40 years of deliberation, ruled that her claim was [...] "neither established nor refuted". Dr. Günter von Berenberg-Gossler, attorney for Anderson's opponents in the later years of the legal case, said that during the German trials [...] "the press were always more interested in reporting her side of the story than the opposing bench's less glamorous perspective; editors often pulled journalists after reporting testimony delivered by her side and ignored the rebuttal, resulting in the public seldom getting a complete picture." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{major problem}} impeding Nansen's {{work on behalf}} of {{refugees}} was that most of them lacked <b>documentary</b> <b>proof</b> of identity or nationality. Without legal status in their country of refuge, their lack of papers meant they were unable to go anywhere else. To overcome this, Nansen devised a document that became known as the [...] "Nansen passport", a form of identity for stateless persons that was in time recognised by more than 50 governments, and which allowed refugees to cross borders legally. Among the more distinguished holders of Nansen passports were the artist Marc Chagall, the composer Igor Stravinsky, and the dancer Anna Pavlova. Although the passport was created initially for refugees from Russia, it was extended to cover other groups. After the Greco-Turkish wars of 1919–1922 Nansen travelled to Istanbul to negotiate the resettlement {{of hundreds of thousands of}} refugees, mainly ethnic Greeks who had fled from Turkey after the defeat of the Greek Army. The impoverished Greek state was unable to take them in, and so Nansen devised a scheme for a population exchange whereby half a million Turks in Greece were returned to Turkey, with full financial compensation, while further loans facilitated the absorption of the refugee Greeks into their homeland. Despite some controversy over the principle of a population exchange, the plan was implemented successfully over a period of several years. In November 1922, while attending the Conference of Lausanne, Nansen learned that he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1922. The citation referred to [...] "his work for the repatriation of the prisoners of war, his work for the Russian refugees, his work to bring succour to the millions of Russians afflicted by famine, and finally his present work for the refugees in Asia Minor and Thrace". Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts.|$|E
