5|$|This {{meeting was}} also the first-ever match-up between the twostoried programs; the twoteams had {{combined}} to play 1,594games before meeting. For Texas, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> playing a second Big Ten Conference powerhouse soon after winning the first-ever matchup between Texas and the University of Michigan {{at the end of}} the 2004 season.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|Property in the County of Tripoli, {{granted to}} the Knights in the 1140s, {{included}} the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa'a plain separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> Homs was close {{enough for them to}} raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.|$|E
5000|$|Collaborative Network - “This {{system is}} meant to {{accomplish}} more alignment among community needs, strategies of service agencies, priority outcomes, and resource allocation. <b>It’s</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to accomplish building social capital; integration of human service delivery; and interconnected strategies for relationship building, learning processes, and measurement and modeling among the participants.” ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{follows the}} plot of the novel by Alexandre Dumas. <b>It</b> is <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> as a parody of the {{previously}} released 1921 film The Three Musketeers, starring Douglas Fairbanks.|$|R
50|$|Trouble was {{considered}} by Marvel's editorial group as the possible origin of Spider-Man. <b>It</b> was <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to re-popularize romance comics (which were {{very popular in}} the 1950s, selling millions of copies), but failed.|$|R
5|$|Tax {{revenue from}} the Belgian Congo enabled the Belgian {{government}} in exile and Free Belgian Forces to fund themselves, unlike most other states in exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the Belgian gold reserves, which had been moved to London in 1940, were not needed to fund the war effort, and therefore were still available {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Two plagues afflicted coastal New England in 1614 and 1617, {{possibly}} {{transmitted from}} British and French fishermen to natives {{on the shore}} (although no concrete evidence exists to prove such a connection). The plague killed between 90% and 95% of the local Wampanoag inhabitants. The near disappearance of the tribe from the site left their cornfields and cleared areas vacant for the Pilgrims to occupy; <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the Native Americans were in no condition to resist {{the arrival of the}} colonists.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was originally}} planned as a three-act opéra comique for the Opéra-Comique theatre. Meyerbeer stopped {{work on the}} opera in 1827 when the theatre underwent financial difficulties. In August 1829, the composer and librettists agreed to refashion the work in a five-act form {{to meet the requirements}} of the Paris Opéra. This entailed some significant rewriting of the storyline, reducing the essentially comic role of Raimbaut (who vanishes after Act 3 in the final version, but whose antics – including the spending of Bertram's money – continued throughout in the earlier libretto). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the traditional 'pairing' of lovers in opéra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled throughout by the 'lower-class' Raimbaut/Alice) was swept aside in favour of concentration on the more sensational story-line of Robert's diabolic ancestry.|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} {{he has said}} of his work: [...] "They're meant to be artificially luminous, a metaphor perhaps {{for the loss of}} that utopian vision of the future after the millennium bug threat, the dot com crash, the collapse of Enron, the war on terror- and all before the current recession. Yet <b>it's</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to suggest a glimmer of hope." [...] Cheung received an MFA from the Royal College of Art in 2001, and currently lives and works in London.|$|R
50|$|The {{cartridge}} {{was based}} on the German 9×19mm Parabellum, but is significantly less powerful, as <b>it</b> is <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to be used in blowback pistols, which are easier and less expensive to manufacture than locked breech firearms.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} iD as a name {{is related to}} {{popularity}} of getElementById in JavaScript, combination of iPad with Système D, and {{a tribute to the}} Citroen iD car model. <b>It</b> was <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to be easier to pronounce than Potlatch.|$|R
5|$|A {{first team}} regular {{alongside}} defensive partners Neil Aspin and Dean Glover, in summer 1992 {{he helped the}} club to win the pre-season TNT Tournament. His performances in the 1992–93 season saw him awarded {{a place on the}} PFA Second Division team. He was man of the match in the League Trophy final victory over Stockport County – despite suffering from a double hernia and being hungover from a secret boozing session the night before. The season finished on a negative note though, {{in the second half of}} the 1993 Second Division play-off final against West Bromwich Albion, with the game still goalless, Swan was sent off after bringing down Bob Taylor – who was through on goal. This proved to the turning point in the game as West Brom went on to win 3–0 to secure promotion at Vale's expense. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that he went down in history as only the third Englishman to be sent off at Wembley, after Kevin Keegan and Lee Dixon.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1881, Blaine and Garfield {{were walking}} through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington when Garfield was shot by an assassin, Charles J. Guiteau. Guiteau, a {{deranged}} man who had earlier pestered Blaine and other State Department officials to be appointed to ambassadorships {{for which he was}} grossly unqualified, believed that by assassinating the President he could ingratiate himself with Vice President Arthur and receive his coveted position. Guiteau was captured immediately and hanged just short of a year later; he survived longer than Garfield, who lingered for two-and-a-half months, then died on September 19, 1881. Garfield’s death was not just a personal tragedy for Blaine; <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> the end of his dominance of the cabinet and the end of his foreign policy initiatives. With Arthur’s ascent to the presidency, the Stalwart faction now held sway and Blaine’s days at the State Department were numbered. Arthur asked all of the cabinet members to postpone their resignations until Congress recessed that December; Blaine nonetheless tendered his resignation on October 19, 1881 but agreed to remain in office until December 19, when his successor was in place. Blaine’s replacement was Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Stalwart. Arthur and Frelinghuysen undid much of Blaine’s work, cancelling the call for a Pan-American conference and stopping the effort to end the War of the Pacific, but they did continue the drive for tariff reductions, signing a reciprocity treaty with Mexico in 1882.|$|E
50|$|Kebble was the {{controversial}} {{patron of the}} Brett Kebble Art Awards which he established in 2003 to provide a showcase for established artists, and to help those less known to attain recognition. <b>It</b> was <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to build a non-racial bridge into the 21st century.|$|R
5000|$|The {{entrance}} to the station was designed as an arch bridge (from [...] "qiao" [...] in Banqiao, meaning [...] "bridge"). <b>It</b> is <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to represent a [...] "cloud wall", a characteristic of traditional Chinese gardening; the station is located next to Yuanzhi Memorial Garden.|$|R
50|$|The {{philosophy}} of environment {{is a trend}} of free thought located between philosophy, epistemology and anthropology. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, {{philosophy of}} evolution and environmental humanism. <b>It</b> is <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.|$|R
5|$|The ten {{pre-production}} gliders {{were eventually}} {{delivered by the}} end of 1942, and the first production glider was put together between March and April 1943. Production of parts and the building of complete gliders continued throughout 1943, but production schedules continued to fall behind, particularly when the United States Army Air Forces became interested in the glider, requiring a significant number to be completed for Operation Overlord, the airborne landings in Normandy, and a number of others {{to be used in the}} Far East. This placed further pressure on GAL and the Hamilcar Production Group, as the USAAF demands would require further production and new flight trials to see if the glider would operate effectively in a tropical climate. In late 1943 the USAAF required 140 Hamilcars, which would be used to transport bulldozers and other construction equipment for airfield building, and in November it was agreed that 50 would be supplied to them by June 1944. However, the continued slow production of the gliders so concerned the USAAF that it cancelled its requirement in February 1944; this meant that American personnel who had been helping with the production of the gliders were withdrawn and production times were further delayed. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that only British airborne forces would use the Hamilcar. By January 1944 only 27 Hamilcars had been erected and were ready for use; a total of 53 had been produced, but the rest were in storage awaiting parts to complete them or to be erected. Finding personnel to erect the gliders, and airfields to store them, continued to be a problem. By June, however, eighty of the gliders had been manufactured and erected and were ready for use in airborne operations, in time for a small number to be used during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. Production continued throughout the conflict and finally ended in 1946, with a total of 344 being produced.|$|E
25|$|This insured {{that the}} Senate vote {{would be put}} off till the second session in December. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the tariff would be a {{prominent}} issue in the 1860 election.|$|E
25|$|By {{winning the}} 1998 US Open title, Hingis {{completed}} the doubles Career Grand Slam, becoming the 17th female player {{in history to}} achieve this, {{as well as the}} youngest. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> she completed the Calendar Year Grand Slam, becoming the fourth woman in history to achieve the feat.|$|E
50|$|Gadget Racers (known in Japan as Choro Q HG 3) is a role-playing, racing {{game for}} the PlayStation 2. It is the sequel to Road Trip Adventure. <b>It</b> was <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to be {{published}} in North America by Conspiracy Entertainment under the title Road Trip: Adventure Avenue but was cancelled.|$|R
5000|$|Jombok Hoas {{has many}} {{physical}} activities and challenges including abseiling, high ropes course, zip-line, high swing, a cable bridge, giant spider web and others. There are also other exercises which emphasize problem solving skills. Leadership and team building skills are emphasized, {{as well as}} personal growth and self-confidence. <b>It</b> is <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to be enjoyable! ...|$|R
40|$|The {{currency}} turmoil in East Asia {{over the last}} six months has involved a major realignment of currencies in the region. <b>It</b> has <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the IMF and others have had to take active steps to restructure the debts of some countries in the region.

25|$|In 1925, Spedan Lewis {{devised the}} slogan 'never knowingly undersold' at Peter Jones. Intended mainly {{as a control}} on {{sourcing}} merchandise, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that customers could shop knowing {{that they were not}} paying more at Peter Jones than they could buy identical goods for at other stores. Trade improved and profit sharing was resumed.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of temple altars and corpulent human representations {{suggests that some}} type of cult existed on the islands of Malta and Gozo in prehistory. Given the corpulency of the statues {{it may be that}} the cult was tied to a fertility rite. Fertility at this time must have been very important since, apart from family growth, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> the reproduction of crops and animals.|$|E
25|$|The four {{remaining}} members were adamant {{that the group}} would carry on and that their approaching North American tour would continue as normal. However, Halliwell's departure threw most of the group's plans into disarray. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> {{that most of the}} material the group had recorded throughout the first half of 1998 at Dublin's Windmill Lane Studios with longtime collaborators Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe was scrapped. A rumoured animated venture by Disney also failed to materialise.|$|E
50|$|The Real Cittadella {{was built}} by the Spanish Empire (who {{controlled}} the Kingdom of Sicily) between 1680 and 1686. It was built to defend the port of Messina, but <b>it</b> was <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to establish a strong garrison {{in the city to}} prevent the population from revolting, as had happened a few years earlier in 1674.|$|R
50|$|Their {{daughter}} (Manju) {{played by}} Sai Tamhankar {{who is married}} to a guy from a different cast who is elder to her (referred as of Father's age in one scene) will be coming home and meeting the family after 6 years. <b>It</b> is <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to be an opportunity for the patriarch Bhai to forgive their daughter.|$|R
5000|$|The event, the world's first {{organized}} fashion week, {{was called}} [...] "Press Week", and {{was created to}} attract attention away from French fashion during World War II, when fashion industry insiders were unable to travel to Paris to see French fashion shows. <b>It</b> was <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to showcase American designers for fashion journalists, who had neglected U.S. fashion innovations.|$|R
25|$|Resulting {{from the}} petition, in December 2012 {{the club was}} granted a Royal charter, two {{previous}} attempts having been unsuccessful. As a result, the club became an incorporated association and is now able to hold assets, including the Lord's ground, in its own name instead of via a custodian trustee. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the individual members, as the club's owners, ceased to have a potential liability should the club ever get into serious financial trouble.|$|E
25|$|The Irish {{banks had}} {{invested}} heavily in loans to property developers and were facing ruin as result of the property markets' collapse and also the international 'Credit crunch' or drying up of loans from abroad. Much of the Irish economy and public finances had also depended on the property market and its collapse {{at roughly the same}} time as the banking crisis impacted all parts of the Irish economy. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that revenue collected by the state fell radically.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of larger {{removable}} and fixed disk drives, disk de-blocking formulas were employed which resulted in more disk blocks per logical file allocation block. While this allowed for larger file sizes, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> that the smallest file which could be allocated increased in size from 1KB (on single-density drives) to 2KB (on double-density drives) and so on, up to 32KB for a file containing only a single byte. This made for inefficient use of disk space if the disk contained {{a large number of}} small files.|$|E
5000|$|The Social Credit System is a {{proposed}} Chinese government initiative {{for developing a}} national reputation system. It {{has been reported to}} be intended to assign a [...] "social credit" [...] rating to every citizen based on government data regarding their economic and social status. [...] In addition, <b>it</b> is <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to rate businesses operating on the Chinese market.|$|R
5000|$|Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a {{commercial}} cloud computing service that provides users a virtual private cloud, by [...] "provisioning a logically isolated section of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud". Enterprise customers {{are able to}} access the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) over an IPsec based virtual private network. Unlike traditional EC2 instances which are allocated internal and external IP numbers by Amazon, the customer can assign IP numbers of their choosing from one or more subnets. By giving the user the option of selecting which AWS resources are public facing and which are not, VPC provides much more granular control over security. For Amazon it is [...] "an endorsement of the hybrid approach, but <b>it's</b> <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to combat the growing interest in private clouds".|$|R
50|$|During ancient times, {{the fires}} were always set near {{water and the}} temples (see also: Fire temple). The fire {{originally}} meant to assist the revival of sun and bring back the warmth and light of summer. <b>It</b> was <b>also</b> <b>meant</b> to drive off the demons of frost and cold, which turned water to ice, and thus could kill the roots of plants.|$|R
