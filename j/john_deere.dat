5|$|The <b>John</b> <b>Deere</b> House and Shop is {{historically}} significant for its {{influence in the}} areas of commerce, agriculture, industry, and invention. The site was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964. The Landmark designation was assigned by the U.S. Department of Interior because of the House and Shop's association with <b>John</b> <b>Deere,</b> founder of the <b>John</b> <b>Deere</b> Company and inventor of the first steel plow. His invention was of significance to the entire United States and made large scale cultivation of areas in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio possible. When the U.S. National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966 the <b>John</b> <b>Deere</b> House and Shop was among the first properties to join that list. It was added to the National Register on October 15, 1966, the same day the National Register was established.|$|E

5|$|The <b>John</b> <b>Deere</b> House and Shop {{is located}} in the unincorporated village of Grand Detour, Illinois, near the Lee County city of Dixon. The site is known as the {{location}} where the first steel plow was invented by <b>John</b> <b>Deere</b> in 1837. The site includes Deere's house, a replica of his original blacksmith shop, a gift shop, and an archaeological exhibit showing the excavation site of his original blacksmith shop. The Deere House and Shop is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it joined that list in 1966, the year the Register was established. Prior to that, it was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964.|$|E

5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter <b>John</b> <b>Deere</b> set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E

50|$|Although {{today the}} state's largest {{population}} center is around Chicago {{in the northern}} part of the state, the state's European population grew first in the west, with French Canadians who settled along the Mississippi River, and gave the area the name, Illinois.

At the Hinsdale, Illinois, Testing Farm, IH entertained over 12,000 dealers from over 25 countries. IH showed off their new [...] "60" [...] series of tractors: including the big, first-of-its-kind, six-cylinder 460 and 560 tractors. The joy of the new line of tractors was short lived, though. One of the first events that eventually led to the downfall of IH presented itself in 1959. In June of that year, IH recalled the 460, 560, and 660 tractors: final drive components had failed. IH, which wanted to be the first big-power manufacturer, had failed to drastically update the final drives on the new six-cylinder tractors. These final drives were essentially unchanged from 1939 and would fail rapidly under the stress of the more powerful 60-series engines.

Most of these facilities were used by the Colasta Corporation from the mid-1920s until the late 1950s. This company manufactured radio parts.
