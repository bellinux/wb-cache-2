40|$|Background Cixutumumab (IMC-A 12), a fully human {{immunoglobulin}} G 1 (IgG 1) monoclonal antibody, exerts preclinical {{activity in}} several sarcoma models {{and may be}} effective {{for the treatment of}} these tumours. Methods In this open-label, multicentre, phase 2 study, patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, adipocytic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma or <b>Ewing</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> received intravenous cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) for 1 h every other week until disease progression or discontinuation. The primary end-point was the progression-free survival rate (PFR), defined as stable disease or better at 12 weeks. In each tier of disease histology, Simon's optimum 2 -stage design was applied (PFR at 12 weeks P 0 = 20 %, P 1 = 40 %, α = 0. 10, β = 0. 10). Stage 1 enrolled 17 patients in each disease group/tier, with at least four patients with stable disease or better required at 12 weeks to proceed to stage 2. Results A total of 113 patients were enrolled; all tiers except adipocytic sarcoma were closed after stage 1 due to futility. The 12 -week PFR was 12 % for rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 17), 14 % for leiomyosarcoma (n = 22), 32 % for adipocytic sarcoma (n = 37), 18 % for synovial sarcoma (n = 17) and 11 % for <b>Ewing</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> (n = 18). Median progression-free survival (weeks) was 6. 1 for rhabdomyosarcoma, 6. 0 for leiomyosarcoma, 12. 1 for adipocytic sarcoma, 6. 4 for synovial sarcoma and 6. 4 for <b>Ewing</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours.</b> Among all patients, the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were nausea (26 %), fatigue (23 %), diarrhoea (23 %) and hyperglycaemia (20 %). Conclusions Patients with adipocytic sarcoma may benefit from treatment with cixutumumab. Cixutumumab treatment was well tolerated, with limited gastrointestinal AEs, fatigue and hyperglycaemia. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of paediatric tumours including the small round cell tumours (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and the <b>Ewing</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours),</b> brain tumours, germ cell tumours and anaplastic large cell hymphoma can pose particular diagnostic dilemmas, especially in cases with undifferentiated morphology. Substantial improvements {{have been made}} in the treatment and long term survival of paediatric patients with these tumours, however, these are based on disease and even stage specific treatments. Accurate diagnosis and prognosis can now be aided by identifying specific genotypic and phenotypic criteria using cytogenetics, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation, reverse transcription PCR and novel immunophenotypic markers.

40|$|AIMS: The {{localisation}} of the translocation breakpoint <b>of</b> the <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> shows significant variability on {{relatively large}} regions of fusion partner genes. As a consequence, many {{alternative forms of}} EWSR 1 -ETS translocation exist which make the RNA-based molecular diagnostics <b>of</b> <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> complicated. In addition to the heterogeneity of fusion transcripts, the degradation of RNA also presents a significant difficulty in the molecular analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Our aim was to establish a sensitive method which is able to identify all combinatorially possible EWSR 1 -FLI 1 and EWSR 1 -ERG translocation transcripts in FFPE tissue samples despite significant RNA-degradation. METHODS: The combination of fluorescent multiplex PCR with laser-induced capillary electrophoresis was used to detect and identify EWSR 1 -FLI 1 and EWSR 1 -ERG chimeric transcripts {{on the basis of}} amplicon size, and forward primers labelled by distinct fluorophores. RESULTS: Using this method, we processed 60 FFPE samples <b>of</b> <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours,</b> and identified six types EWSR 1 -FLI 1 and one type EWSR 1 -ERG chimeric transcripts acceptable for RT-PCR analysis in 27 out of 45 samples. This result shows 60 % sensitivity for detecting the most frequent <b>Ewing</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> (EFT) -related fusion transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: The utilisation of fluorescent multiplex PCR and laser-induced fluorescent capillary electrophoresis is effective for the diagnosis of EFT in FFPE tissue, and after the defined modifications it can offer a sensitive method to overcome the diagnostic difficulties connected with heterogeneity of the variant translocations in EFT...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{strengths}} of our study {{is that we have}} only included patients with histopathological proven tumours belonging to the <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> (Murphey et al., 2013).

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the demographics <b>of</b> <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> (ESTF) patients, treatment alternatives, clinical outcomes, and prognostic factors for survival. Material and methods : We retrospectively reviewed 39 patients with ESFT who were admitted to our institute between September 2008 and September 2012. Results: The patients included 32 (82. 1 %) males and seven (17. 9 %) females of median age 24 (range, 18 – 66) years. Among the 27 patients with a primary osseous localization, 17 (43. 5 %) had a central axis localization. Fifteen patients (38. 5 %) had metastases at the time of diagnosis. Patients were followed up for a median period of 18 (range, 2 – 134) months. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 23 (range, 1 – 64) months, and the 1 - and 4 -year EFS were 60 % and 48 %, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 91 (range, 1 – 188) months, and the 1 - and 4 -year OS were 78 % and 54 %, respectively. Gender, age, primary tumor site, and local treatment modalities, either alone or in combination, did not have a significant effect on OS (p = 0. 210, p = 0. 617, p = 0. 644, and p = 0. 417, respectively). In contrast, osseous site of peripheral localization, limited stage, and metastasis to the bone significantly affected OS (p = 0. 015, p < 0. 001, and p = 0. 042, respectively). Discussion : ESFTs are aggressive tumors with a high rate of relapse and metastatic potential. Patients with peripheral bone involvement and limited stage had a good prognosis.

40|$|Background: Ewing sarcoma is {{a primary}} bone neoplasm, which is a high grade {{aggressive}} small round blue cell tumour, and is currently recognized {{as a part of}} the <b>Ewing</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours.</b> It is the most lethal bone tumor, and is a rare malignant bone tumor accounting for 10 % of all primary bone tumors, and 6 % of malignant bone tumors. It has an average annual incidence of 3 per 1 million, found almost exclusively in Caucasians. It commonly occurs in long bones and pelvis but rarely involves the scapula. 85 % of cases have metastasis within 2 years of diagnosis, rarely involving the meninges. Case presentation: We report a case of a 25 year old Sinhalese Sri Lankan female, presenting with a 1 day history of bilateral lower limb weakness and urinary incontinence. She had a sensory level with flaccid paralysis of lower limbs and a painless bony lump in the left dorsal scapula. Investigations showed scapular primary Ewing sarcoma giving rise to spinal intradural metastasis. For the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of a scapular Ewing sarcoma with spinal intradural metastasis presenting with lower limb paralysis. Conclusion: Intradural spinal metastasis of Ewing sarcoma presenting with lower limb weakness, without a history of pain, though rarely, can be the first presentation, and can rapidly progress to brainstem involvement and death...|$|E

30|$|Ewing sarcoma {{is a rare}} {{malignant}} tumour arising from neuroectodermal-derived cells in bone or soft tissue. The <b>Ewing</b> sarcoma <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>tumours</b> comprises the four tumour entities: Ewing sarcoma of bone, extra skeletal Ewing sarcoma, Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumour (PNET), and Askin tumour (Murphey et al., 2013). Histological examination of a biopsy specimen with detection of a specific fusion transcript involving the Ewing sarcoma RNA (ribonucleic acid) binding protein 1 gene (EWSR 1 gene; Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) is mandatory for diagnosis (Potratz et al., 2012). Ewing sarcoma constituted 1.6 % of all cancers in Norwegian children below 15  years {{of age in the}} period 1985 – 2015 (Nasjonalt kvalitetsregister for barnekreft, Kreftregisteret, 2015). Median age at presentation was 14  years (Helsedirektoratet Avdeling sykehustjenester Oslo Norway, 2015). Patients with local disease have a five-year survival rate of 65 – 75 %, which has improved over the last decades (Group EESNW, 2014; Gaspar et al., 2015). 25 % of the patients will have detectable metastases at presentation (Potratz et al., 2012). With the presence of pulmonary metastases five-year survival is reduced to 30 % while patients with both pulmonary and skeletal metastases have a five-year survival rate of less than 10 % (Helsedirektoratet Avdeling sykehustjenester Oslo Norway, 2015). In addition to the presence of metastases, the most important negative prognostic factors are: large tumour volume, high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, tumour in axial skeleton and age[*]>[*] 15  years (Group EESNW, 2014). Correct staging of the disease is paramount to correct treatment allocation. The Norwegian National Guidelines (Helsedirektoratet Avdeling sykehustjenester Oslo Norway, 2015) are largely based on protocols from the Italian and Scandinavian Sarcoma Groups (ISG/SSG) (Italian Sarcoma Group (Bologna Italy), Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (Oncologic Center Lund Sweden), 1999 a; Italian Sarcoma Group (Bologna Italy), Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (Oncologic Center Lund Sweden), 1999 b) and recommend a combination of some, or all, of the following imaging modalities for staging of Ewing Sarcoma: Radiography, ultrasound, CT, MRI, skeletal scintigraphy with 99 mTc- labelled bisphosphonates (bone scan) and 18 F- FDG PET-CT. Radiography, CT and MRI <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> site, affected limb and adjacent joints, and skeletal scintigraphy are considered mandatory examinations while ultrasound <b>of</b> <b>tumour</b> site, angiography <b>of</b> affected limb, abdominal CT (in patients with lesions not involving the abdomen) and 18 F-FDG PET-CT are optional.|$|R

40|$|Giant-cell tumor of bone (GCT) is {{a locally}} {{aggressive}} neoplasm of unknown etiology and pathogenesis. Cytogenetically, no consistent chromosomal alterations, apart from telomeric associations involving various chromosome ends, have been described.

Tumor genotyping using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 6. 0 Genechip identified deletions of both chromosomal regions involved in the translocation, resulting in partial deletion of ETV 4, but an uninvolved EWSR 1 gene. The creation of a fusion between EWSR 1 and an ETS family gene consecutive to a chromosomal translocation is characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>Ewing</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> tumors (EFT). This is the first report of a deletion involving the two breakpoints in an EWS-ETS translocation. To date, only two cases of t(17; 22) (q 21;q 12) in Ewing sarcoma have been reported, with no associated deletion. Interestingly, both cases had also occurred in soft tissue tumors, which are less common than their bone-involving counterparts...|$|R
