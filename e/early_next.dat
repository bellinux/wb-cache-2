5|$|On 25 September 1915 in Fauquissart, France, Rifleman Thapa, {{having been}} wounded himself, found a wounded soldier of The Leicestershire Regiment behind {{the first line}} German trench. Although urged to save himself, the Gurkha stayed with the wounded man all day and night. <b>Early</b> <b>next</b> day, in misty weather, he took him through the German wire and, leaving him {{in a place of}} {{comparative}} safety, returned and brought in two wounded Gurkhas, one after the other. He then went back, and, in broad daylight, fetched the British soldier, carrying him most of the way under enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} Category5 {{status for}} about 12hours, Ivan began a steady weakening trend due to another eyewall replacement cycle until reaching winds of 140mph (225km/h) on September 10. <b>Early</b> <b>next</b> day, the hurricane reorganized as it reached winds {{just shy of}} Category5 status. However, weakening occurred again due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and at 0330UTC on September 11 Ivan passed 23miles (37km) south of Portland Point, Jamaica, its closest approach, with winds of 150mph (240km/h). The hurricane was previously forecast to make landfall on the island, though the weakening and a turn to the west kept the strongest winds offshore; however, sustained winds of Category4 status were reported. While passing {{to the south of}} the island, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, with several stations reporting over 2feet (60cm) of precipitation. Ivan's last-minute turn to the west was due to a mid-level high pressure system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. A slight weakening trend continued after passing the island, due to its northern outflow being disrupted by an upper-level low over the Bahamas. As it tracked further away from Jamaica, Ivan again rapidly intensified to Category5 status, and early on September 12 it reached its peak intensity of 165mph (265km/h) with a pressure of 910mbar (26.87inHg).|$|E
5|$|John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open {{rebellion}} against the rule of Mary and her mother {{in the spring of}} 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia. The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana, forcing John of Palisna to flee to Bosnia. The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary, who had been present during the siege along with her mother, on 4November. To strengthen Mary's position against Charles of Naples, Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened negotiations on the marriage of Mary to the younger brother of CharlesVI of France, Louis, who had once been engaged to Mary's sister, Catherine. Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia <b>early</b> <b>next</b> year. Queen Elizabeth replaced Stephen Lackfi with Thomas Szentgyörgyi, who used draconian measures {{to put an end to}} a conspiracy against the queens in Zadar in May 1384.|$|E

5|$|However, the Americans {{were not}} {{counting}} on Thảo {{and his fellow}} Catholic Phát trying to seize power on an explicitly religious platform, claiming fidelity to slain former Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm and promising to recall Khiêm from the US to lead the new regime. This caused alarm among the Buddhist majority, who had campaigned heavily against Diệm's discriminatory religious policies {{in the months leading}} up to his ouster in November 1963. Although they wanted Khánh gone, the Americans did not want Thảo and Phát to succeed, so they sought out Kỳ and Thi in an attempt to have them defeat the original coup and then depose Khánh. During the initial attack, Thảo and Phát tried to capture both Khánh and Kỳ, but both men escaped narrowly, although some of their colleagues in the Armed Forces Council were arrested. Although the rebels were able to take control of Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the largest in the country and the military headquarters of South Vietnam, Kỳ was able to regroup quickly and retain control of the nearby Bien Hoa Air Base, using it to mobilize air power and stop the rebel advance with threats of bombing. Late in the night, Thảo and Phát met Kỳ in a meeting arranged by the Americans, where an agreement was reached for the coup to be ended in return for Khánh's ouster. By <b>early</b> <b>next</b> morning, the bloodless military action was over as Thảo and Phát went into hiding, and the junta voted to sack their leader Khánh, who was absent on a military inspection tour, thinking that Kỳ and Thi were on his side.|$|E
25|$|<b>Early</b> <b>next</b> morning {{an enemy}} plane spotted Harder. The {{submarine}} soon sighted another destroyer searching {{the area for}} her.

The sub fired three torpedoes at short range, {{and two of them}} struck amidships, one detonating the ship's magazine with a tremendous explosion. Hayanami sank a minute later. Following the inevitable depth charge attack, Harder transited the Sibutu Passage after dark and steamed to the northeast coast of Borneo. There on the night of 8 June she picked up six Australian Coastwatchers, and <b>early</b> <b>next</b> day she headed once more for Sibutu Passage.|$|E

In their second innings, the Australian batting order collapsed for a mere 131 and India won the match by an innings and 135 runs, thus, gaining a lead of 2–0 in the series.

25|$|Len Hutton (80) and Bill Edrich (20) saw England {{though to}} stumps {{and took the}} score to 60 the next morning before the first wicket fell. Cowdrey (79) added 99 with Hutton looking certain for a century before he smashed the ball into Alan Davidson's back, where it lobbed up for an easy, if painful, catch. Colin Cowdrey and Denis Compton (44) took the score to 230/3 {{by the end of}} the day and England were {{confident}} of a first innings lead, but they both fell <b>early</b> <b>next</b> morning and though the lower middle order all got going the tail collapsed again and the last four wickets fell for 20 runs and the last seven wickets for 111. Still 341 was England's highest score so far in the series and gave them a slim 18 run lead, the leg-spinner Richie Benaud (4/120) doing most of the work.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 1922 the Irish Civil War (1922–1923) began. County Wexford's Civil War was {{far more}} viciously fought than its War of Independence – with many more deaths (on both sides). Again it was a guerrilla war. After {{the signing of the}} Treaty, the I.R.A. as a whole in County Wexford was divided. The North Wexford and South Wicklow Brigade of the I.R.A., led by Joseph Cummins, {{supported}} the Treaty, but the South Wexford Brigade of the I.R.A., led by Thomas O’Sullivan, opposed it. Anti-Treaty I.R.A. units in the county were organized into the Enniscorthy, Murrintown, Kyle, and New Ross Flying Columns, consisting of about 12–20 men each. Numerous attacks on the county's Railways by anti-Treaty I.R.A. units were a major feature of the War in County Wexford. A vicious circle of reprisal killings soon ensued – a sample of these are as follows. On 24 July 1922, an anti-Treaty I.R.A. unit ambushed a train near Killurin Railway Station and 3 Free State soldiers were killed. On 10 October 1922, a senior Free State army officer, Commandant Peter Doyle, of Ballinakill, Marshalstown, was shot in the grounds of St. Aidan’s Cathedral, Enniscorthy, by anti-Treaty I.R.A. On 13 March 1923, the Free State side executed 3 anti-Treaty I.R.A. prisoners held in Wexford Jail – James Parle, John Creane, and Patrick Hogan. In a reprisal killing, on 23 March 1923 anti-Treaty I.R.A. took 3 Free State soldiers from a Public House at Ballagh, parish of Adamstown. They were taken to the village of Adamstown where they were shot dead <b>early</b> <b>next</b> morning, on 24 March 1923. The 3 men were Parick Horan, Edward O'Gorman, and Thomas Jones. A fourth Free State soldier, John Croke, was also wounded at the Pub. There were many other killings also. Some of these were stated to be 'accidental'. A number of large houses were burnt down by anti-Treaty I.R.A. units – most notably Castleboro House (February 1923), owned by the Carews, Wilton (March 1923), owned by the Alcocks, and Ballynastragh (March 1923), owned by the Esmondes. The Free State side also imprisoned many suspects.|$|E
