5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling.</b> Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. <b>Evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is needed}} by many birds {{although}} their mode of excretion {{and lack of}} sweat glands reduces the physiological demands. Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> or panting. Seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling.</b> They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E

5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling.</b> Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E
5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Rolls-Royce started {{planning}} its future aero-engine development programme and realised {{there was a}} need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296cu in) Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft. Consequently, work was started on a new -class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for Private Venture, 12-cylinder, as the company received no government funding for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane (serial number K3036) on 21 February 1935. The engine was originally designed to use the <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> system then in vogue. This proved unreliable and when ethylene glycol from the U.S. became available, the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid-cooling system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin testbed, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.|$|E

25|$|Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease {{is caused}} by a {{waterborne}} bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{adiabatic}} cooling {{that requires a}} lifting agent, there are three major non-adiabatic mechanisms for lowering {{the temperature of the}} air to its dew point. Conductive, radiational, and <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> require no lifting mechanism and can cause condensation at surface level resulting in the formation of fog.|$|E
50|$|The <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooler</b> is a wetted rigid media {{where water}} is {{distributed}} throughout the header and where air passes through the wet porous surface. Part of the water is evaporated, absorbing the sensible heat from the air and increasing its relative humidity. The air dry-bulb temperature is decreased but the wet-bulb temperature is not affected. Similar to the fogging system, the theoretical limit is the wet bulb temperature, but performance of the <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooler</b> is usually around 80%. Water consumption is {{less than that of}} fogging cooling.|$|R

This study aimed to determine effect of water sprayer on the direct <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooler.</b> The study was conducted with the experiment. Research variable is the type of water sprayer with a variation of 1, 5 and 7 holes. The data captured includes data input temperature, RH input, output temperature and RH output.

At the bottom, the widening {{of the tower}} provides a large area for installation of fill to promote thin film <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> of the circulated water. As the water first evaporates and rises, the narrowing effect helps accelerate the laminar flow, and then as it widens out, contact between the heated air and atmospheric air supports turbulent mixing.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat pipe}} {{typically}} {{consists of a}} sealed pipe or tube at both the hot and cold ends. Heat pipes utilize <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. They are fundamentally better at heat conduction over larger distances than heat sinks because their effective thermal conductivity is several orders of magnitude {{greater than that of}} the equivalent solid conductor.|$|E

Nonetheless, a certain variant of the indirect type - namely dew-point <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooler</b> - is found to be the most effective amongst all. The dehumidifier and the regenerator can be of the same type of equipment: packed tower and falling film are popular choices, especially when fitted with an internal heat exchanger.

25|$|Another very {{important}} reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of Legionella, including species that cause legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease, most notably L. pneumophila, or Mycobacterium avium. The various Legionella species are the cause of Legionnaires' disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to aerosols—the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources of Legionella include cooling towers used in open recirculating <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> water systems, domestic hot water systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply.

25|$|The {{principle}} {{is to allow}} water to evaporate {{at the top of}} a tower, either by using <b>evaporative</b> <b>cooling</b> pads or by spraying water. Evaporation cools the incoming air, causing a downdraft of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building. Airflow can be increased by using a solar chimney on the opposite side of the building to help in venting hot air to the outside. This concept has been used for the Visitor Center of Zion National Park. The Visitor Center was designed by the High Performance Buildings Research of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).|$|E

Preventative measures include adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for 120°F (50°C) at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.|$|E
