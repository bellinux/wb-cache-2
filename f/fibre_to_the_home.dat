25|$|Digicel {{entered the}} {{broadband}} market in 2010 by offering WiMAX broadband, capable {{of up to}} 6 Mbit/s per subscriber. To further their broadband share post-LIME/FLOW merger in 2014, the company introduced a new broadband service called Digicel Play, which is Jamaica's second FTTH offering (after LIME's deployment in selected communities in 2011). It is currently only available in the parishes of Kingston, Portmore and St. Andrew. It offers speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s down, 100 Mbit/s up via a pure fibre optic network. Digicel's competitor, FLOW Jamaica, has a network consisting of ADSL, Coaxial and <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> (inherited from LIME) and only offers speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW has committed to expanding its Fibre offering to more areas in order to combat Digicel's entrance into the market.|$|E
25|$|The National Broadband Network was {{initially}} a <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> (FTTH) open-access network {{in planning and}} trial operation in Australia by the federal government. The national broadband network aimed to provide up to 1000 Mbit/s speeds and to connect to 93% of Australian households and businesses. This has since been revised under a Coalition government to a Mixed-Technology system relying largely on Australia's existing and largely depreciated Copper networks. This revision aims for 25 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s, with consumer reports ranging from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. The Australian government had previously called for proposals to build a Fibre to the Node (FTTN) broadband network providing download speeds up to 100 and upload speeds up to 40Megabits per second. The government also utlilises fixed wireless technology and satellite technology to provide fast broadband connection in rural area and very remote area. Fixed wireless provides speeds up to 50/20 Mbit/s. Satellite technology uses sky muster communication satellite which was launched in October 2015 to provide fast broadband in very remote area. It provides speeds up to 25/5 Mbit/s. The network {{will be the largest}} single infrastructure investment in Australia's history. In February 2017, the Federal Government of Australia funded the project for the NBN in order to build a mixed technology network.|$|E
2500|$|Virgin Broadband in cabled {{areas is}} marketed as [...] "fibre optic broadband". It is a FTTN network, where fibre optic trunk lines {{are used to}} connect the area's headend to {{cabinets}} on the street. It is not a <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> service like Verizon FiOS; instead, {{the link between the}} cabinet and the customer uses DOCSIS 3.0 over coaxial copper cable.|$|E
50|$|Selected {{areas of}} Point Cook are {{currently}} {{taking part in}} Telstra's FTTP broadband network. Up to 1,500 Point Cook homes now {{have access to a}} download capacity of up to 100 Mbit/s. This will involve replacement of the copper with <b>fibre</b> line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> This delivers Internet, digital free-to-air TV, Foxtel from Telstra and multiple HomeLine services all from one cable with no need for rooftop antennas or dishes. Telstra has also recently introduced ADSL 2+ to several areas of Point Cook.|$|R
50|$|While ADSL2+ with {{speeds up}} to 20/1 Mbit/s {{is still the most}} widely common {{subscription}} available in Italy, the main telephone company in the country (TIM or Telecom Italia) is investing 12 billion € in the period of 2016-2018, with the aim of reaching 84% of <b>the</b> <b>homes</b> with broadband connection (100 Mbit/s) before the end of 2018. Despite this, there's a debate going because the company is still investing on copper and on the fiber-to-the-cabinet (FTTC) technology, instead of bringing <b>fibre</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>home</b> everywhere. <b>The</b> FTTC and VDSL2 technologies can currently bring up to 100/20 Mbit/s connections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final customer. TIM and Fastweb have plans to increase FTTC speeds with vectoring to up to 200/50 Mbit/s streams before the end of 2016.|$|R
40|$|The use of fibre will be {{inevitable}} for transporting hundreds of Mb/s {{to and from}} end-users, {{but this does not}} necessary mean that <b>fibre</b> has <b>to</b> be deployed all <b>the</b> way up <b>to</b> a point into <b>the</b> <b>home.</b> An alternative is bringing <b>fibre</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> (Hybrid FttH) and reusing existing telephony wiring for abridging the last 20 - 200 m. A new transmission technique is developed making this possible, G. Fast. We developed a techno-economic model to see whether this technique is feasible from an economic point of view. In this model we introduce a new method to estimate churn rates. We conclude that G. Fast is for most operators economic feasible on the short term, but more important, especially for operators who are limited in deployment of FttH by working capacity, using Hybrid Fibre has a great effect on their market share. Hybrid FttH, using G. Fast, might be the straw that has to be caught by the European telecom operators <b>to</b> survive <b>the</b> competition with the cable TV operators...|$|R

From 2011, iiNet also sold services on the NBN Interim Satellite Service; however, demand for these connections exceeded the available capacity, severely congesting the service. As a result, iiNet withdrew the product from sale in November 2013, and NBNCo issued a cease sale for all RSPs in December 2013.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades the demand for {{bandwidth}} for Internet access has been growing at an unprecedented rate, and this growth is not likely to slow down in the near future. Rolling out <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet/Curb networks quickly will be the only way for telecom operators <b>to</b> meet <b>the</b> growing customer demand. This requires a <b>fibre</b> connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cabinets or even closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>homes.</b> This raises <b>the</b> important question which cabinets should be provided with fibre and active equipment if <b>the</b> operator wants <b>to</b> reach as many customers with as little investment as possible. To this end, we formulate the problem as the new Partly Covered Single Source Capacitated Facility Location Problem. Since this problem is shown NP-hard, we develop a very fast heuristic <b>to</b> approximate <b>the</b> optimal solution. Extensive experiments with a number of real-life data sets of Dutch cities have been performed <b>to</b> benchmark <b>the</b> results against the optimal solution. The results show that the heuristic performs well, and leads to close-to-optimal solutions with negligible computation times...|$|R
