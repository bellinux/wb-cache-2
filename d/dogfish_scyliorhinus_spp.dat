A total of ten parasite species was found using a relatively rapid host examination technique suitable for non-parasitologists. On the basis of established criteria, larval anisakid nematodes and the copepod Lernaeopoda galei were selected as being potentially useful as stock discrimination tools.

40|$|Dermal denticles {{are unique}} tooth-like {{structures}} {{embedded in the}} skin of sharks and rays that protect them from predators and ectoparasites, reduce mechanical abrasion and possibly minimize swimming-induced drag. Here, we show that juvenile lesser spotted <b>dogfish</b> (<b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula) also use this body armour to anchor food items near their tail so that bite-sized pieces can be torn away by rapid jaw and head movements. This scale-rasp behaviour is novel among fishes and suggests a new role for skin in the feeding ecology of sharks. Scale rasping may be important ecologically because it could function to increase the dietary breadth and growth potential of juveniles...|$|R

The Gulland and Holt (1959) method produced the most convincing estimates of VBGF parameters for sex combined (L¥ closer to observed data), although all the models underestimate the L¥.

In contrast to this, the white twitch fibres of the myotome are innervated focally, by 2 nerve fibres passing to the same motor end-plate. These 2 fibres contain vesicles of different types. One type of nerve terminal contains vesicles around 50 nm in diameter; these terminals resemble those upon the red fibres.

40|$|Introduction The {{activity}} level of fish is, among other factors, influenced by temperature (Sullivan, 1954; Bryan et al. 1990) and oxygen availability (Randall, 1970; Metcalfe and Butler, 1984; Kutty, 1968; Fisher et al. 1992; Nilsson et al. 1993). The swimming activity of red hake Urophycis chuss (Bejda et al. 1987) and skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis (Dizon, 1977) {{has been reported}} to increase when the fish are exposed to hypoxia.

40|$|Many {{marine organisms}} {{accumulate}} {{high concentrations of}} solutes in their tissues to maintain osmotic balance. Osmoregulatory solutes are usually end-products of metabolism rather than inorganic ions (Prosser, 1973). For example, skeletal muscle from marine elasmobranchs, holocephalans and the coelacanth contains high con-centrations of both urea (300 - 600 HIM) and methylamine compounds, such as tri-methylamine oxide (175 - 250 mM) (Pang, Griffith & Atz, 1977). Urea is a potent protein destabilizer, and most elasmobranch enzymes examined are inhibited by urea (Yancey, 1978). However, it has recently been found that TMAO acts as a general protein stabilizer and can offset the effects of urea on enzyme Km and maximal velocity in vitro (Yancey & Somero, 1979, 1980). Skinned fibres provide a more complex and more physiological model than isolated proteins, and {{in the present study}} the effects of osmoregulatory solutes on tension generation in skinned fibres isolated from dogfish myotomal muscle have been investigated. <b>Dogfish,</b> <b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula. 55 - 65 cm long, were obtained from the Millpor...|$|R

The eosinophilic G 3 granulocyte was also tested using the same assay but results were inconclusive. The effect of LTB 4 on dogfish G 1 and G 3 granulocytes was also monitored with the bipolar shape formation (BSF) assay. LTB 4 induced BSF in both granulocyte types, and this method appeared to be more sensitive than the migration under agarose assay.

The results show conserved expression of FoxL 1, FoxF, and FoxC genes in different compartments of the mesoderm and of FoxQ 1 in pharyngeal endoderm and its derivatives, confirming these as ancient sites of Fox gene expression, and also illustrate multiple cases of lineage-specific expression domains.

We found that the temporal shift of Shh activity altered the size of endoskeletal elements in paired fins of zebrafish and dogfish. Thus, a threshold level of hox expression determines the onset of shh expression, and the subsequent heterochronic shift of Shh activity can affect the size of the fin endoskeleton.

40|$|Previous work in <b>dogfish,</b> <b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula, has {{identified}} the testicular germinative area as the {{spermatogonial stem cell}} niche. In the present study, an in vitro co-culture system of spermatogonia and somatic cells from the germinative area was developed. Long-term maintenance of spermatogonia has been successful, and addition of GDNF has promoted the develop-ment of clones of spermatogonia expressing stem cell charac-teristics such as alkaline phosphatase activity and has allowed maintenance of self-renewal in spermatogonia for at least 5 mo under culture conditions, notably by decreasing cell apoptosis. Furthermore, clones of spermatogonia expressed the receptor of GDNF, GFRalpha 1, {{which is consistent with}} the effect of GDNF on cells despite the lack of identification of a GDNF sequence in the dogfish’s transcriptome. However, a sequence homologous to artemin has been identified, and in silico analysis supports the hypothesis that artemin could replace GDNF in the germinative area in dogfish. This study, as the first report on long-term in vitro maintenance of spermatogonia in a chondrichthyan species, suggests that the GFRalpha 1 signaling function in self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells is probably conserved in gnathostomes. culture, dogfish, GDNF, self-renewal, spermatogonial stem cell...|$|R

This study examined mechanisms of urea transport in red blood cells and hepatocytes from the lesser spotted <b>dogfish</b> (<b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula), Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina), turbot (Scopthalmus maximus), redfish (Scianops ocellatus), gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) and oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau).

We have studied the secretion of the flexural organ and the subcommissural organ in <b>dogfish</b> (<b>Scyliorhinus</b> canicula) embryos using three different antisera and the lectins concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin. AFRU is an antiserum against the bovine Reissner's fiber; Ab- 600 is an antiserum against 600 kDa dogfish subcommissural organ glycoproteins; and APSO is an antiserum against immunoaffinity purified bovine subcommissural organ secretory glycoproteins. These three antisera immunostained the flexural organ indicating that it contains epitopes similar to those present in bovine and dogfish subcommissural organ glycoproteins. It seems highly probable that the flexural or an and the subcommissural organ of dogfish embryos secrete similar compound(s). Other ependymal regions were also immunostained with Ab- 600 and APSO antisera. Then, Reissner's fiber-like glycoproteins were transiently expressed by most embryonary ependymal cells. These glycoproteins might {{play a role in}} the development of the central nervous system of vertebrates. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
