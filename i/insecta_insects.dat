50|$|All {{the members}} of the family in the United States are descended from Hans Gyllenhaal and come from his great great-great {{grandson}} Anders Leonard (1842-1905) and his wife Amanda (née Nelson, 1859-1948). Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal immigrated to the United States in 1865. The hitherto most memorable member of this younger branch was Leonard Gyllenhaal (1752-1840). In 1807, he was created a Knight of the Royal Order of Vasa for his scientific work as an entomologist, including his monograph of Swedish <b>insects,</b> <b>Insecta</b> Suecia descripta.|$|R
25|$|Soras eat a {{wide range}} of foods. Animals that are {{commonly}} reported as sora food items include snails (Gastropoda), crustaceans (Crustacea), spiders (Araneae), and <b>insects</b> (<b>Insecta),</b> mainly beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), flies (Diptera), and dragonflies (Odonata). Soras often eat the seeds of plants, such as smartweeds, bulrushes, sedges, and barnyard grasses. Seeds of annual wildrice (Zizania aquatica) and rice cutgrass are eaten by soras in the eastern United States. A literature review lists crowngrass (Paspalum spp.) and rice (Oryza sativa) as relatively important food sources for soras in the Southeast. Plants comprising <5% of the sora's diet are also listed and include spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.), duckweeds (Lemnaceae), pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.), panicgrasses (Panicum spp.), cordgrasses (Spartina spp.), and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata).|$|R
50|$|Terrestrial {{ecosystems}} occupy 55,660,000 mi² (144,150,000 km²), or 28.26% of Earth's surface. Although {{they are}} comparatively recent {{in the history}} of life (the first terrestrial organisms appeared in the Alchi period, about 425 million years ago) and occupy a much smaller portion of Earth's surface than marine ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems have been a major site of adaptive radiation of both plants and animals. Major plant taxa in terrestrial ecosystems are members of the division Magnoliophyta (flowering plants), of which there are about 275,000 species, and the division Pinophyta (conifers), of which there are about 500 species. Members of the division Bryophyta (mosses and liverworts), of which there are about 24,000 species, are also important in some terrestrial ecosystems. Major animal taxa in terrestrial ecosystems include the classes <b>Insecta</b> (<b>insects)</b> with about 900,000 species, Aves (birds) with 8,500 species, and Mammalia (mammals) with approximately 4,100 species.|$|E
40|$|Aim. The {{study of}} fossil insects from diatomaceous sediments of Shamb- 1 {{locality}} of Sisian Suite (Early Pleistocene). The collection of fossils {{plants and animals}} of Institute of Botany of NAS RA and authors' findings served as material for study. Methods. The material is processed and prepared for study by conventional methods in paleontology for prints and fossils of insects from diatomaceous sediments. There are 654 samples studied: 2 samples were with mollusks’ imprints and 652 samples with imprints of insects, from which preserved marks on 291 samples allowed to identify them up to order, family, genus and species. Results. The studied material refers to the Mollusca and Arthropoda (<b>Insecta)</b> types. <b>Insects</b> are represented by species of orders Orthoptera (2 fam.), Homoptera (1 fam.), Heteroptera (2 fam.), Coleoptera (15 fam.), Hymenoptera (2 fam.), Diptera (1 fam.). Coleopteras dominate among them and are presented with following species of the family – Carabidae, Dytiscidae, Hydrophilidae, Histeridae, Staphylinidae, Silphidae, Elateridae, Buprestidae, Lampyridae, Scarabaeidae, Chrysomelidae, Tenebrionidae, Coccinellidae, Cerambycidae, Curculionidae. Main conclusions. An analysis of the taxonomic composition of paleofauna was done, which corresponds to the recent fauna and with considering modern ecological characteristics of systematical groups and species. In the investigated location of Shamb- 1 a version is suggested about the palaeolandscapes and palaeoclimate in the Early Pleistocene. </p...|$|R
40|$|Insect fauna of alfalfa was {{surveyed}} {{during two}} successive years (from October, 1990 until Sep-tember, 1992) at Derab Experimental Research Station, College of Agriculture, King Saud University, Riyadh. Samples of insects were collected weekly using a standard 15 " sweeping net. The identification of insects revealed {{the prevalence of}} 103 insect species belonging to 94 genera, 49 families and 10 orders of class <b>insecta.</b> Of these <b>insects,</b> 18 species were recorded {{for the first time}} in Saudi Arabia. The insect fauna of alfalfa was divided, according to their importance to alfalfa grower, to the following categories of insects expressed in percentages; 48 % phytophagous insects, 25. 6 % entomophagous insects, 21. 6 % pol-linating insects and 4. 8 % for other insects (saprophagous, scavengers [...] - etc.). Studying entomofauna of alfalfa is important for developing integrated pest management programs for alfalfa and neighborin...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the trophic {{spectrum}} of three species of lacertid lizards (Lacerta agilis, Lacerta trilineata and Podarcis muralis) was carried out, based on 20 specimens collected in the period 1967 - 1973 in various localities in Bulgaria. The analyzed data showed that the <b>insects</b> (<b>Insecta)</b> are the most numerous and the most frequently met among the alimentary components of {{the total amount of}} food of the studied stomachs (except for Lacerta agilis, where spiders are slightly predominating). The non-insect components consisted spiders and isopods. The largest niche breadth was recorded in Lacerta trilineata (8. 25), followed by Podarcis muralis (5. 20) and Lacerta agilis (3. 44). The niche overlap between the three species (pair-wise comparison) showed medium values and in our opinion there should not be any serious competition for food resources at the places withsympatric distribution...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{will be based on}} the diet {{composition}} monitoring of the introduced rainbow trout and wild brown trout and grayling in defined time intervals, and assessing the degree of the food competition among the monitored species. The experiment was held {{in the second half of}} September 2010 in the river Blanice in the protected fish areas close to the village Těšovice, where several dozens of rainbow trout were stocked. In a predefined several - day interval of were caught 30 pieces of the rainbow trout (SL = 266 ? 14 mm, m = 347 ? 54 g), 33 brown trout (SL = 244 ? 19 mm, m = 219 ? 51 g), 14 graylings (SL = 256 ? 27 mm, m = 240 ? 91 g) and 12 resident rainbow trout (SL = 255 ? 13 mm, m = 280 ? 47 g) originated from the last plant. Within these groups a fish stomach content and consequently food selectivity was examined by using of the Ivlev's selectivity index (1961), a food competition was examined by using of the Schoener's index food overlap (1970) and the importance of various food components was examined by using of the index of preponderance according to Natarajan (1961). Rainbow trout began to ingest food immediately after the stocking into the stream and its occurrence was seen in all fish crop caught during the period. The <b>insect</b> (<b>Insecta)</b> was given as a preferential food of the rainbow trout and according to the index of preponderance (IP), it formed 54 %, Trichoptera (IP) 24 % and Ephemeroptera (IP) 19 % orders belonged to the most preferable kinds of the food. According to the index of preponderance, gastropod (Gastropoda) formed (IP) 25 % of a secondary food. The rainbow trout was accepting the same dietary components as well as the original sorts of salmonoid fish within the river. According to the index of a food overlap (S), the food competition between rainbow trout and brown trout was equal to the value of (S = 0. 566) during the whole monitored period and the grayling was equal to (S = 0. 520). Even though both of these values are slightly below the significant food overlap (S = 0. 6), we can still say that the food competition is relatively high among these kinds...|$|R
