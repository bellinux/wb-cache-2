40|$|Valuation is {{the process}} of <b>estimating</b> <b>price.</b> The methods used to {{determine}} value attempt to model the thought processes of the market and thus <b>estimate</b> <b>price</b> by reference to observed historic data. This information is utilised in the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model to determine the single point valuation figure. However, the valuation will be affected by uncertainties: uncertainty in the comparable data available; uncertainty in the current and future market conditions and uncertainty in the specific inputs for the subject property. These input uncertainties will translate into an uncertainty with the output figure, the <b>estimate</b> of <b>price.</b> This paper discusses ways in which uncertainty can be incorporated into the DCF model...|$|R
25|$|The {{concept for}} the {{aircraft}} {{began in the}} 1990s with a forecast programme cost of US$10 billion (early published figures were US$4–5.5B) and called for the first aircraft to be built before 2000. With an <b>estimated</b> <b>price</b> per unit of about US$160–200 million (an earlier published estimate was US$150 million) the market was forecast {{for a total of}} 300 aircraft, with production planned for the Kazan Aircraft Production Association facility. Initially designed for the carriage of passengers, later a KR-860T (T stands for Tanker) version was proposed for use as an aerial Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker for far-north regions. Taking advantage of the presence of LNG on the aircraft, the design proposed using LNG to fuel the turbines, rather than conventional Jet fuel, like on the Tupolev Tu-206.|$|E
25|$|Two 1941 gelatin silver print {{portraits of}} Bate Tichenor by avant-garde artist Man Ray were {{auctioned}} by Christie's London in 1996. Another 1941 gelatin silver print photograph of Bate Tichenor by Man Ray was auctioned by Sotheby's New York in 1997. A silver gelatin print of fashion photographer Irving Penn's 1949 photograph of Bate Tichenor and model Jean Patchett, titled The Tarot Reader, {{resides in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Two paintings by Bate Tichenor were auctioned by Christie’s in July, 2007 at New York's Rockefeller Plaza, and both received almost 10 times the original estimates in the auction of Mexican actress María Félix's estate. Bate Tichenor's oil on canvas titled Domadora de quimeras, featuring the face of María Félix with details by painter Antoine Tzapoff, went for $20,400 USD, which was several times higher than its original low estimate of $2000 USD.

25|$|The total <b>estimated</b> <b>price</b> tag, {{more than}} $22 million, {{dampened}} {{the enthusiasm of}} many supporters, who were expecting more like $4 million to $5 million. At a convention in December 1826, they attempted to discredit the engineers' report, and offered lower estimates: Georgetown to Cumberland, $5,273,283; Georgetown to Pittsburgh, $13,768,152. Geddes and Roberts were hired to make another report, which they gave in 1828: $4,479,346.93 for Georgetown to Cumberland. With those numbers to encourage them, the stockholders formally organized the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in June 1828. In the end, the final construction cost to Cumberland in 1850 was $11,071,075.21. Compared to the original cost given by the engineers in 1826 of about $8 million, removing things not in the estimate such as land purchases, engineering expenses, incidental damages, salaries, and fencing provision, the cost overrun was about 19%, which can be justified by the inflation rate of the period. The cost overrun of the other proposal (Geddes and Roberts) was about 51% thus showing that the original engineer's estimate was good.|$|E
500|$|Wildebeest provide several {{useful animal}} products. The hide makes good quality leather and the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard. Wildebeest are killed for food, {{especially}} to make biltong in Southern Africa. This dried game meat is a delicacy {{and an important}} food item in Africa. The meat of females is more tender than that of males, and is the most tender during the autumn season. Wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunters because their numbers make them easy to find. Cooks preparing the wildebeest carcass usually cut it into 11 pieces. The <b>estimated</b> <b>price</b> for wildebeest meat was about US$0.47 per kilogram around 2008. The silky, flowing tail of the black wildebeest is used to make fly-whisks or [...] "chowries".|$|E

[...] Global renamed GMG Radio [...] "Real and Smooth Radio Ltd." [...] Several rival radio groups expressed their concerns over the takeover and the effect it could have on commercial radio in the UK.

40|$|The conquests of Alexander III ("The Great") {{transformed}} the economic {{as well as}} political landscape of ancient Greece and Persia. It produced a prolific coinage, part of which survives today. This paper uses a hedonic price modeling approach to analyze auction prices of the major coin type of Alexander the Great. The findings make it possible to identify the effects of specific coin characteristics on realized auction prices, sellers' reservation <b>prices</b> (auction <b>price</b> <b>estimates),</b> discrepancies between realized and <b>estimated</b> <b>prices,</b> and the variability of auction prices around predicted prices, or auction price surprise. The findings reveal that similar considerations shape <b>estimated</b> and realized <b>prices,</b> but bidders consistently value positive coin characteristics more highly than do sellers. Realized auction prices, the difference between realized and <b>estimated</b> <b>prices,</b> and auction price surprise are increasing over time, particularly for the highest grade coins...|$|R

500|$|There were {{plans to}} extend the freeway further in both directions, {{including}} northward to I-80 in Hope Township and southward to I-195. Each of these two extensions were brought forth in the 1960s, and were later shelved {{due to lack of}} support. In the early1970s, a [...] long extension of Route31 was proposed from Oxford, connecting the highway with the proposed Route23 freeway to I-84 near Port Jervis, New York. This northern freeway extension of Route31 was to be known as RouteF-31 and the Foothills Freeway, and was to run through the Kittatinny Mountains, passing through Stokes State Forest and High Point State Park. The proposal gave an <b>estimated</b> <b>price</b> tag of about $105 million (1970s USD). The northern freeway faced high opposition from residents living in Warren and Sussex counties, who feared environmental damage. A group called Opponents of the Foothills Freeway formed to prevent the road from being built. Along with the growing opposition, environmental and financial issues arose, causing the New Jersey Department of Transportation to cancel the Route31 from being built mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Mills' {{design and}} its <b>estimated</b> <b>price</b> tag {{of more than}} $1 million (in 1848, [...] ) caused the society to hesitate. On April 11, 1848 the society decided, {{due to a lack}} of funds, to build only the obelisk. Mills' 1848 obelisk was to be 500 feet tall, [...] square at the base and [...] square at the top. It had two massive doorways, each [...] high and [...] wide, on the east and west sides of its base. Surrounding each doorway were raised jambs, a heavy pediment, and entablature within which was carved an Egyptian-style winged sun and asps. This {{original}} design conformed to a massive temple which was to have surrounded the base of the obelisk, but because it was never built, the architect of the second phase of construction Thomas Lincoln Casey smoothed down the projecting jambs, pediment and entablature in 1885, walled up the west entrance with marble forming an alcove, and reduced the east entrance to [...] high. The western alcove has contained a [...] since 1992–93. Also during 1992–93 a [...] was installed at the east elevator entrance decorated with a winged sun and asps to mimic Mills' 1848 design.|$|E
