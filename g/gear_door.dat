25|$|This {{image from}} the NASA {{archives}} shows several missing tiles on the STS-1 OMS pods. The problem on Columbia was that the damage was sustained from a foam strike to the reinforced carbon-carbon leading edge panel of the wing, not the heat tiles. The first Shuttle mission, STS-1, had a protruding gap filler that diverted hot gas into the right wheel well on re-entry, resulting in a buckling of the right main landing <b>gear</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
25|$|The F-111 used {{a three-point}} landing gear arrangement, with a two-wheel nose gear and two single-wheel {{main landing gear}} units. The landing <b>gear</b> <b>door</b> for the main gear, which was {{positioned}} {{in the center of}} the fuselage, also served as a speed brake in flight. Most F-111 variants included a terrain-following radar system connected to the autopilot. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines. The F-111's variable-geometry wings, escape capsule, terrain following radar, and afterburning turbofans were new technologies for production aircraft.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Disasters in the Air, former KLM pilot and {{one-time}} IFALPA president Jan Bartelski, of Polish origin, {{suggests that the}} crash of the Liberator that carried Gen. Sikorski was caused by a half-empty mail bag jammed between the horizontal stabilizer and the elevator, thus [...] "freezing" [...] the controls and preventing F/Lt Prchal from gaining altitude after takeoff. The mail bag was in the cargo compartment and was blown out of the aircraft through the side hatch (which in normally configured Liberators would have served to protect the machine gun position) by a strong airflow rushing through the nose <b>gear</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

500|$|A {{few weeks}} later on May 21, 1962, Armstrong was {{involved}} in what Edwards' folklore called the [...] "Nellis Affair". He was sent in a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter to inspect Delamar Dry Lake in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. He misjudged his altitude, and also {{did not realize that}} the landing gear had not fully extended. As he touched down, the landing gear began to retract; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing, but the ventral fin and landing <b>gear</b> <b>door</b> struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing hydraulic fluid. Without radio communication, Armstrong flew south to Nellis Air Force Base, past the control tower, and waggled his wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the tail-hook to release, and upon landing, he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain, and dragged the chain along the runway.|$|E

5000|$|Swearingen Aircraft {{was founded}} by Ed Swearingen in 1959. Early work by the company {{included}} the development of prototype aircraft for other manufacturers; such as the Twin Comanche prototype developed for Piper Aircraft during 1962 {{and the development of}} several research helicopters for the Bell Helicopter Company, work which led to the HueyCobra. The company also developed modifications of other designs, an activity Ed Swearingen had been involved in prior to his forming Swearingen Aircraft. These modification programs included the Excalibur 800 conversion of the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza, (because the combined output of its two Lycoming IO-720 engines was 800 horsepower); airframe improvements included modifying the cabin to allow entry via an airstair instead of over the RH wing to a <b>door,</b> and landing <b>gear</b> <b>doors</b> that fully enclosed the wheels when retracted. The airstair was factory-fitted by Beechcraft during manufacture of the ultimate J50 model of the Twin Bonanza. The Queen Air development of the Twin Bonanza also received the Swearingen treatment, the Queen Air Excalibur having less extensive modifications, also involving fitting of [...] IO-720s, replacing the more troublesome and lower-power geared Lycoming engines installed at manufacture, and the enclosed landing <b>gear</b> <b>doors</b> (the Queen Air was designed from the outset with an airstair). The United States Army had several of its U-8 versions of the Queen Air modified to this standard. Excalibur aircraft are easily distinguishable from standard Twin Bonanzas and Queen Airs by the landing <b>gear</b> <b>doors</b> and the more rectangular engine cowlings of the Excaliburs compared to the rounded cowlings of the originals.|$|R
