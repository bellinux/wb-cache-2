5|$|Reports as to {{the size}} of the mosque have varied considerably. Ali Mangera of Mangera Yvars Architects, {{submitted}} a proposal for the design competition, stated that his design would accommodate up to 40,000visitors simultaneously, with the potential for expanding to contain 70,000people. These figures led to much consternation. London Borough of Newham Councillor Alan Craig, of the Christian Peoples Alliance, criticised the development plans on the grounds that they would change the character of the local area, making it predominantly Muslim, and <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> public inquiry into the mosque's development. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Newham planning department would refuse the mosque's application, as a project of that size had the potential to cause damage to community relations in the area.|$|E

25|$|In April 2008, Haiti {{was facing}} a severe food crisis as well as {{governmental}} destabilization to Parliament's failure to ratify the president's choice of a prime minister.

The head of MINUSTAH <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new government to be chosen as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the UN provided emergency food. Haiti was hit by four consecutive hurricanes between August and September 2008. These storms crippled coastal regions, requiring humanitarian aid for 800,000.|$|E

Japan's prime minister <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dramatic reduction in Japan's reliance on nuclear power. Taiwan's president did the same. Mexico has sidelined construction of 10 reactors in favor of developing natural-gas-fired plants. Belgium is considering phasing out its nuclear plants, perhaps as early as 2015.|$|E

25|$|While {{for years}} Dish Network has used {{standard}} MPEG-2 for broadcasting, {{the addition of}} bandwidth-intensive HDTV in a limited-bandwidth world <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change to an H.264/MPEG-4 AVC system. Dish Network announced as of February 1, 2006, that all new HDTV channels would be available in H.264 format only, while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG-2. Dish Network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to H.264 {{in order to provide}} more channels to subscribers. In 2007, Dish Network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080. Reducing horizontal resolution and/or data rate of HD video is known as HD Lite and is practiced by other TV providers as well.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} claims that electroconvulsive therapy and prefrontal lobotomies and similar psychiatric treatments have sometimes been performed not in the patient's best interests, but rather as punishment for misbehaviour or to otherwise make the patient easier to manage. A classic {{example of this is}} the Lake Alice, New Zealand atrocity which occurred in the early 1970s. Children admitted to the Lake Alice Hospital's open child and adolescent unit were routinely punished with unmodified ECT (that is, ECT without anesthesia). Some governments (e.g. Norway and New Zealand) have since begun paying reparations to patients who suffered such treatments. The World Health Organization <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ban on unmodified ECT, and states no form of it should be used on children.|$|E
25|$|India has {{had good}} {{relationships}} with most sub-Saharan African nations {{for most of}} its history. In the Prime Minister's visit to Mauritius in 1997, the two countries secured a deal to a new Credit Agreement of INR 105million (US$3 million) to finance import by Mauritius of capital goods, consultancy services and consumer durable from India. The government of India secured a rice and medicine agreement with the people of Seychelles. India continued to build upon its historically close relations with Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Visits from political ministers from Ethiopia provided opportunities for strengthening bilateral co-operation between the two countries in the fields of education and technical training, water resources management and development of small industries. This has allowed India to gain benefits from nations that are generally forgotten by other Western Nations. The South African President, Thabo Mbeki <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> strategic relationship between India and South Africa to avoid imposition by Western Nations. India continued to build upon its close and friendly relations with Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Minister of Foreign Affairs arranged for the sending of Special Envoys to each of these countries during 1996–97 as a reaffirmation of India's assurance to strengthening co-operation with these countries in a spirit of South-South partnership. These relations have created a position of strength with African nations that other nations may not possess.|$|E
