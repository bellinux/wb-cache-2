5|$|On October 13, 1590, the German {{astronomer}} Michael Maestlin observed an occultation of Mars by Venus. One of his students, Johannes Kepler, {{quickly became}} an {{adherent to the}} Copernican system. After the completion of his education, Kepler became an assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer, Tycho Brahe. With access granted to Tycho's detailed observations of Mars, Kepler was set to work mathematically assembling a replacement to the Prutenic Tables. After repeatedly failing to fit the motion of Mars into a circular orbit as required under Copernicanism, he succeeded in matching Tycho's observations by assuming the orbit was an ellipse and the Sun was located {{at one of the}} foci. His model became the basis for Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which were published in his multi-volume work <b>Epitome</b> Astronomiae Copernicanae (<b>Epitome</b> of Copernican Astronomy) between 1615 and 1621.|$|E

40|$|Image {{enhancement}} in {{our understanding}} includes quality improvements and understanding improvement of a digital image or video. Our study focuses on the latter; this paper proposes a framework for image understanding using <b>epitomes</b> and contextual information in human-motion involved object recognition systems. The proposed has been raised when considering image enhancement with limited computational resources. We demonstrate the proposed with an example of recognizing a target object, i. e., a watch, on a walking man. First, we employ unsupervised learning to train the video in terms of <b>epitomes,</b> and then the classification of the watch is formulated as a search problem of finding the target pixels in the <b>epitomes.</b> Though {{the quality of the}} regenerated object is relatively low, the watch can be recognized with the aid of recent results from human motion analysis. 1...|$|R
