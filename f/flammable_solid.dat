5000|$|A <b>flammable</b> <b>solid</b> is {{one that}} is readily {{combustible}} or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into • flammable solids, • polymerizing substances and • self-reactive substances, i.e., thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing.Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category {{on the basis of the}} outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.|$|E

By the investigation, there are three approaches to prevent the tunnel fire exposed to different combustibles. For <b>flammable</b> <b>solid,</b> an effective method to prevent fires is to decrease the maximum environment temperature and the product concentration. For flammable liquid, adjusting the ambient temperature and enhancing ventilation can prevent or reduce the fire accidents. For flammable gas, the effective method to prevent the fire is to decrease the fuel density and the ambient temperature.

40|$|Bales {{of cotton}} were {{classified}} by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) code regulations as a <b>flammable</b> <b>solid</b> (Class 4. 1), which required hazardous goods papers to accompany waterborne shipments.

Cigarette (NFPA 261 / ASTM E 1352), match (NFPA 705) and open flame (CA TB 129) tests were conducted; the potential for self-heating and spontaneous combustion was evaluated; and the potential of cotton bales sustaining smouldering combustion in their interiors at various compression densities was studied. These studies showed that bales of cotton should {{not be required to}} have the hazardous designation, ‘flammable solid’, and led to the IMO and the US Department of Transportation (DOT) removing the designation for baled cotton [compressed to a density of 360 kg=m 3 ð 22 : 4 lb=ft 3 Þ or greater; meets ISO 8115], with effect from 1 Januar...|$|E

The DOT also reports that approximately 1. 5 billion tons of hazardous materials are shipped each year [26]. The majority of the hazardous material shipped is classified as flammable liquid (e. g. petroleum). Other types of hazardous material include (in decreasing order of annual amount shipped) corrosive materials, gases, <b>flammable</b> <b>solids,</b> toxics and radioactive materials. The DOT also reports statistics on incidents involving hazardous materials shipping and their consequences. For 1999, the DOT reported five fatalities, 217 injured persons, and $ 23 million in property damage associated with hazardous materials transportation on highways [28].

By Australian law, carcinogens must also be properly labelled when stored. Category 1 or 2 carcinogens or mixtures containing above 0.1% of such substances must be labelled either with the risk phrase [...] "R49 May cause cancer by inhalation", if the risk of carcinogenic effects is only present when the substance's dust or vapours are inhaled. Otherwise, the risk phrase [...] "R45 May cause cancer" [...] is used.

Der Versuchsaufbau entspricht dem sogenannten Room-Corner-Test (RCT) nach ISO 9705 mit dem {{international}} das Brandverhalten von Bekleidungsmaterialien und die Gefahr eines Feueruebersprunges in Raeumen im mittleren Massstab beurteilt wird. Unter Variation der Ventilationsoeffnung kann nach diesem Versuchskonzept auch das Maximum des effektiven Heizwertes bei ventilationsgesteuerten Braenden bestimmt werden. Durch Bezug des effektiven Heizwertes auf den genormten unteren Heizwert des betreffenden Stoffes laesst sich dessen Verbrennungseffektivitaet X errechnen. (orig.)

In order to obtain generally valid statements, two <b>flammable</b> <b>solids</b> - wood and polyethylene granulate - and two flammable liquids -hydraulic oil Mobil DTE Medium and glycol - were chosen as fire loads. As an experimental setup, the room corner test (RCT) according to ISO 9705 was chosen, which is used internationally to judge the behaviour of clothing materials in case of fire and the danger of flashover in medium-sized rooms. Varying the ventilation opening, this experimental concept permits also to determine the maximum of the effective calorific value {{in the case of}} ventilation-dependent fires. By correlating the effective calorific value to the standardized lower calorific value of a given material, its combustion effectiveness X can be calculated. (orig.)
