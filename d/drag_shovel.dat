50|$|The machine {{concept was}} a {{standard}} base to each model on which optional front-end equipment could be mounted with appropriate counterbalances, crawler track frames and minimal additional machinery. The most common variants included face shovel, dragline, lifting crane and grabbing crane. Less common variants included <b>drag</b> <b>shovel,</b> skimmer and pile driver. Some cranes were also lorry-mounted. All machines had 360 degree rotation on a conical section roller path.|$|E
40|$|Glass fiber {{manufacturing}} is the high-temperature {{conversion of}} various raw materials (predominantly borosilicates) into a homogeneous melt, {{followed by the}} fabrication of this melt into glass fibers. The 2 basic types of glass fiber products, textile and wool, are manufactured by similar processes. A typical diagram of these processes is shown in Figure 11. 13 - 1. Glass fiber production can be segmented into 3 phases: raw materials handling, glass melting and refining, and wool glass fiber forming and finishing, this last phase being slightly different for textile and wool glass fiber production. Raw Materials Handling-The primary component of glass fiber is sand, but it also includes varying quantities of feldspar, sodium sulfate, anhydrous borax, boric acid, and many other materials. The bulk supplies are received by rail car and truck, and the lesser-volume supplies are received in drums and packages. These raw materials are unloaded {{by a variety of}} methods, including <b>drag</b> <b>shovels,</b> vacuum systems, and vibrator/gravity systems. Conveying to and from storage piles and silos is accomplished by belts, screws, and bucket elevators. From storage, the materials are weighed according to the desired product recipe and then blended well before their introduction into the melting unit. The weighing...|$|R
50|$|Ground {{engaging}} {{tools are}} the expendable replacement parts of costly mining, construction, dredging, crushing, conveying, recycling {{equipment such as}} excavators, scrapers, <b>drag</b> lines, <b>shovels,</b> dippers, graders, dozers, loaders, haulers, dredging cutter heads, backhoes and skid steers. GET protects expensive equipment from {{the wear and tear}} common in high-impact or high-abrasion environments (from hard rock mining to dredging and oil sands extraction). GET includes such wear parts as tooth systems, buckets, blades, end bits, couplers, thumbs, ripper systems, lip systems, dozer packages, liner packages, shrouds, chain, chain sprockets, traction wheels, and shredder hammer components.|$|R
5000|$|The Coen {{brothers}} {{took the}} trailer they made [...] - [...] which showed [...] "a man <b>dragging</b> a <b>shovel</b> alongside a car {{stopped in the}} middle of the road, back towards another man he was going to kill" [...] and [...] "a shot of backlit gun holes in a wall" [...] - [...] and a projector and went around to people's homes and work places to show it. Daniel Bacaner was one of the first people to invest money in the project. He also became its executive producer and introduced the Coens to other potential backers. The entire process of raising the necessary $1.5 million took a year.|$|R
50|$|Wilson Sam: Navajo man, 57 years old, who {{was hit in}} {{the head}} by a <b>shovel,</b> <b>dragged</b> to the edge of Chilchinbito Canyon in Arizona, and pushed over the edge. His body was found by his nephew. Death was {{estimated}} about the same time Endocheeney was murdered. He was a herder of sheep, and sometime worker for the road department.|$|R
5000|$|By {{dispensing}} {{very small}} amounts of lubricant every few hours, the correct amount of lubricant remained in the bearing. This made industrial bearings last longer. Automated lubrication reduced maintenance costs for many types of manufacturing operations and became very important in the mining sector. The first application, at a coal mine in Indiana, was on a Marian shovel. Eventually, mcturers of large mining equipment made these systems standard equipment on every large haul truck, <b>shovel,</b> <b>drag</b> line and mill they sold. (Godier) ...|$|R
