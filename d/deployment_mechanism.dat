40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{intended}} to be a guide for the design of "microdynamically quiet" <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for optical-precision structures, such as deployable telescope mirrors and optical benches. Many of the guidelines included herein come directly from the field of optomechanical engineering, and are neither newly developed guidelines nor are they uniquely applicable to high-precision <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> However, the application of these guidelines to the design of <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is a rather new practice, so efforts are made herein to illustrate the process through the discussion of specific examples. The present paper summarizes a more extensive set of design guidelines for optical-precision mechanisms that are under development. Introduction Despite growing interest in deployable optical instruments within both NASA and the Department of Defense 1, no such instruments have been developed and flown to date within the unclassified community 2, 3.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to facilitate the development of deployable, optical instruments by providing a rational approach for the design, testing, and qualification of high-precision (i. e., low-hysteresis) <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for these instruments. Many of the guidelines included herein come directly {{from the field of}} optomechanical engineering, and are, therefore, neither newly developed guidelines, nor are they uniquely applicable to the design of high-precision <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This paper is to be regarded as a guide to design and not a set of NASA requirements, except as may be defined in formal project specifications. Furthermore, due to the rapid pace of advancement in the field of precision deployment, this paper should be regarded as a preliminary set of guidelines. However, it is expected that this paper, with revisions as experience may indicate to be desirable, might eventually form the basis for a set of uniform design requirements for high-precision <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on future NASA space-based science instruments...|$|R

While in daily life people acquire applications via application stores, the access to those stores can be severely hampered in disasters. Instead of wishful thinking, i. e. hoping that people or manufactures would pre-install an (emergency) app before a disaster, we have started to investigate into Internet-less <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We discuss five potential approaches of deploying apps in an ad-hoc fashion. Each approach is assessed against six criteria, while taking a stance that the smartphone is the minimally required deployment platform.

50|$|Begun in late 2002, the FASTT project entailed {{the design}} and {{fabrication}} of three flight vehicles and a ground test engine rig to undergo wind tunnel testing.

They were designed as test rounds to validate vehicle subsystems, such as booster stack combination performance, fin sets, payload <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanism,</b> telemetry and trackability, and inlet shroud, before flight testing the more complicated scramjet flowpath, which was to undergo proof-of-concept testing in a wind tunnel prior to flight testing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case for}} the use of residual air inflated (RAI) structures on CubeSat platforms, focusing on the development of a high altitude, de-orbiting device that utilises this deployment method. Residual air inflation relies on small pockets of air, trapped within a sealed membrane, expanding when the structure is exposed to vacuum. This expansion of trapped air then inflates the membrane. The application of this deployment method for a technology demonstrator, to be flown on a European sounding rocket in March 2014, shall be discussed. The demonstrator is a proposed passive, high altitude, end-of-life, deorbiting system that utilises solar radiation pressure. The development of this device from analysis and design through to construction shall be covered with the particular challenges present on a CubeSat platform discussed. The paper shall conclude by proposing possible applications of CubeSat based RAI structures and <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> focusing on the potential for <b>deployment</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and debris capture structures...|$|R
