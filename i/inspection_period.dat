40|$|As {{worldwide}} {{wind energy}} generation capacity grows, {{there is an}} increasing demand to ensure structural integrity of the turbine blades to maintain efficient and safe energy generation. Currently, traditional non-destructive testing methods and visual inspections are employed which require the turbine to be out-of-operation during the <b>inspection</b> <b>periods,</b> resulting in costly and lengthy downtime. This study experimentally investigates the potential for using Lamb waves to monitor the structural integrity of a composite wind turbine blade that has been subject to an impact representative of damage which occurs in service. 3 D scanning laser vibrometry {{was used to measure}} Lamb waves excited at three different frequencies both prior to, and after, impact to identify settings for an optimal system.

40|$|Dresher (1962) {{described}} a sequential inspection game where an inspector has to distribute a given number of inspections over {{a larger number}} of <b>inspection</b> <b>periods</b> in order to detect an illegal act that an inspectee, who can count the inspector’s visits, performs in at most one of these periods. This paper treats two extensions of this game. In the first, more than one illegal act is allowed. Then, under certain reasonable assumptions for the zero-sum payoffs, the optimal strategy of the inspector does not depend on the number of intended illegal acts. This allows a recursive description, which is justified formally using extensive games. The resulting recursive equation in three variables for the value of the game, which generalizes several other known equations of this kind, is solved explicitly. In a second variation of the Dresher game, there is again only one illegal act, which is however always detected at the next inspection, with the payoff to the violator linearly increasing with the time passed in between. The solution of this game is simple and intuitive, but a conceptually sound description employs an extensive game with recursion in only one branch, and its corresponding norma...|$|R
40|$|The National Space Transportation System (NSTS) {{is one of}} the Nation's most {{valuable}} resources, providing manned transportation to and from space in support of payloads and scientific research. The NSTS program is currently faced with the problem of hardware obsolescence, which could result in unacceptable schedule and cost impacts to the flight program. Obsolescence problems occur because certain components are no longer being manufactured or repair turnaround time is excessive. In order to achieve a long-term, reliable transportation system that can support manned access to space through 2010 and beyond, NASA must develop a strategic plan for a phased implementation of enhancements which will satisfy this long-term goal. The NSTS program has initiated the Assured Shuttle Availability (ASA) project with the following objectives: eliminate hardware obsolescence in critical areas, increase reliability and safety of the vehicle, decrease operational costs and turnaround time, and improve operational capability. The strategy for ASA will be to first meet the mandatory needs - keep the Shuttle flying. Non-mandatory changes that will improve operational capability and enhance performance will then be considered if funding is adequate.

40|$|Setting up {{effective}} survey {{strategies for}} biodiversity monitoring in agro-ecosystems {{is a major}} task in order to detect adverse effects on biodiversity before negative changes will manifest. Here, we studied the relative costs required for the monitoring of butterflies and selected diurnal moths (Papilionoidea et Hesperioidea; Zygaenoidea: Zygaenidae) in farmland. Analysing data from a well-established Lepidoptera monitoring system in Switzerland, we assessed the influence of <b>inspection</b> <b>periods,</b> <b>inspection</b> frequency and transect length on counts of diurnal Lepidoptera. Furthermore, we estimated the number of transects in relation to sampling effort necessary to detect changes of a given effect size for recorded species number (and abundance). Reducing the counting frequency from seven to four inspections per season still yielded 80 – 90 % of the species, as long as peak abundances in summer months were included. The variation in observed species number was mostly independent of inspection frequency, but strongly increased when transect length was reduced to less than 1 km. Sedentary Lepidoptera species are especially valuable indicators as their occurrences are directly linked to local effects on biodiversity, {{and the proportion of}} recorded sedentary species was not substantially affected by reduced inspection frequency. Transects of 1 – 1. 5 km length were generally the most cost-efficient to detect an effect on total species number of diurnal Lepidoptera in arable landscapes, given that travelling distances between transects were short. Studying effects on rare species or selected species groups would involve higher sampling intensity and costs. Surveying schemes with reduced inspection frequency and transect lengths can detect changes in species richness and total abundance of diurnal Lepidoptera cost-effectively. Facing expected changes in agricultural policy and management, the results and recommendations presented here will help to implement and improve cost-efficient Lepidoptera schemes to monitor changes in arable landscapes...|$|R
40|$|The {{abstract}} {{is being}} passed through STIMS for submision to the conference. International safeguards organizations charged with promoting the peaceful {{use of nuclear}} energy employ unattended and remote monitoring systems supplemented with onsite inspections to ensure nuclear materials are not diverted for weaponization purposes. These systems are left unattended for periods of several months between <b>inspections.</b> During these <b>periods</b> physical security means are the main deterrent used to detect intentional monitoring system tampering. The information gathering components are locked in secure and sealed rooms.
