50|$|During a {{widespread}} French effort to <b>improve</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> designs, Jean Charles de Borda discovered the efficiency was {{a function of}} the relative speed of the water entering and exiting the wheel. As the incoming speed is {{a function of the}} water source, the key to extracting more power from a <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> was reducing the velocity of the exhaust water as much as possible. He also noticed that water entering the system was often slowed before it reached the wheel, through a variety of mechanisms. He suggested that great improvements could be made by improving these aspects of wheel design.|$|R

This automatic fish feeder is designed to dispense food into the aquarium at a particular time each day. In this project, concepts are generated through the research on the existing patents to <b>improve</b> its limitations. <b>Water</b> power is used as the main mechanism to design this fish feeder. To accomplish the factors of lost cost and longer life span, <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> is used to transmit the input power from water.

5000|$|Three Puffins were built, {{the first}} made its maiden {{flight from the}} Marine and Armament Experimental Establishment at the Isle of Grain {{in the hands of}} Norman Macmillan on 19 November 1920. [...] Flight tests {{revealed}} one problem that was never satisfactorily solved: the Puffin was tail heavy and increasing tail incidence seems not to have helped. [...] Other problems came from the float. The first prototype had a float that was short at the front, which in rough water produced so much spray that it destroyed the propeller and damaged the radiator. It was therefore lengthened, with an upward curving section, and reinforced with an extra pair of struts to the engine mounting. This reduced the problem but did not cure it, so another float, with a re-profiled cross-section was introduced which behaved much better. [...] The third prototype used a float incorporating these features but with a flat top, which further <b>improved</b> <b>water</b> handling. The <b>wheeled</b> undercarriage behaved well, and allowed true amphibious use, in contrast to the troublesome Pintail arrangement.|$|R
40|$|We use {{physical}} {{principles to}} derive a <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> model {{under the assumption}} of an asymmetric <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> for which the water inflow rate is in general unsteady (modeled by an arbitrary function of time). Our model allows one to recover the asymmetric <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> with steady flow rate, {{as well as the}} symmetric <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> as special cases. Under physically reasonable assumptions we then reduce the underlying model into a non-autonomous nonlinear system. In order to determine parameter regimes giving chaotic dynamics in this non-autonomous nonlinear system, we consider an application of competitive modes analysis. In order to apply this method to a non-autonomous system, we are required to generalize the competitive modes analysis so that it is applicable to non-autonomous systems. The non-autonomous nonlinear <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> model is shown to satisfy competitive modes conditions for chaos in certain parameter regimes, and we employ the obtained parameter regimes to construct the chaotic attractors. As anticipated, the asymmetric unsteady <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> exhibits more disorder than does the asymmetric steady <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> which in turn is less regular than the symmetric steady state <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> Our results suggest that chaos should be fairly ubiquitous in the asymmetric <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> model with unsteady inflow of water...|$|R

40|$|A <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is an old}} machine, used ages ago {{to provide}} {{mechanical}} energy from hydraulic energy. First, ancient societies used this energy directly to grind {{in order to get}} flour and other products. Later, when generators existed, they were employed to provide electrical energy. Today, there are still some isolated communities in rural areas whose main source of energy comes from <b>water</b> <b>wheels.</b> There have been many studies about <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> and the designs that provide a maximum available installed power. This thesis will do a research on an already existing <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> located at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Construction of the University of Girona. The water wheel-type is a horizontal axle with a very simple design of the blades. Although these kind of <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> are known of not being the best designs, they can be very useful in developing countries because of their simplicity. The purpose of the research is to determine the efficiency of this <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> with simulation techniques and to obtain the geometrical conditions that may provide high enough efficiency values for being a feasible design as an element for producing electricity in isolated communities of developing countries with high resources of water. For doing so, we will simulate the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> employing the ANSYS 15. 0 software package and choosing the commercial code CFX, which is a general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD model. After setting up the model, we will do a parametric study to optimize the efficiency of the <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> Firstly, a geometrical model of the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> will be designed to be as similar as possible to the actual <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> being a copy of the current <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> of the laboratory. This includes every important piece of the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> and also the holes in the plates designed to lower the weight. We have to keep in mind, however, that a good geometrical design has to be accurate enough to reproduce the geometry of the real <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> but simple enough to avoid excessive un important details so we may have the results using reason able computational resources. Secondly, a study on the suitable mesh is required. Because of the limit of 512. 000 elements in the educational version of ANSYS 15. 0, we have to decide which part is more important in the contribution to the hydraulic power in order to apply a finer mesh there. The blades of the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> will receive the water jet impact and will provide the reaction forces that make the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> rotate. It is reasonable that a smaller mesh size at the blade will allow to obtain better results. Also the accuracy of reproducing the path of the water jet is important because the reaction forces come from the impact of the water. Once the discretization of the volume (i. e., the mesh) has been defined, the setup has been created. A parametric study that takes into account the rotation speed of the waterwheel will be carried out in order to determine at which point the power reach the maximum value. The formula of power is equal to the torque multiplied by the angular speed. If we fix the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> to a speed of zero (at rest), there will be a maximum of torque but a minimum of power. On the other hand, the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> turning at a constant speed equal to the speed of the incoming waterjet will not provide torque although it will give to the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> a maximum value of the rotational speed but, again, a minimum of power. These two points will be the starting and ending points of the power curve. After determining the maximum power {{as a function of the}} rotational speed, a second parameter will be modified. This parameter will be the position of the inlet with respect to the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> location, where a perpendicular impact to the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> is required. Afterwards, we can compare the results with the experimental data to see how accurate the simulations are and how much the efficiency is improve...|$|R

An open-deck canal northeast of the foundry provided water supply from a creek. The canal reaches the iron-made <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> in the lower ground level after entering the facility under the eastern fortification wall in a brick vault-like tunnel, and running southwards under the courtyard.
