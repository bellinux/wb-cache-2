60|$|The salt of {{the ocean}} varies {{considerably}} in different parts. Near the equator, the great heat carries up {{a larger proportion of}} water <b>by</b> <b>evaporation</b> than in the more temperate regions; and thus, as salt is not removed <b>by</b> <b>evaporation,</b> the ocean in the torrid zone is salter than in the temperate or frigid zones.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the influence of the}} effect of water loss <b>by</b> <b>evaporation</b> in the water management solution storage function of reservoir system. To determine the size of the effect of water loss <b>by</b> <b>evaporation</b> is used simulation model. The simulation model is created with SOMVS. Determining the size of water losses from reservoirs is made simplified method. Loss of water <b>by</b> <b>evaporation</b> is solved for selected level hydrologic reliability of evaporation. To find the optimal size of the storage volume of the proposed reservoir are used all optimization methods included in the SOMVS, that is the grid method, Monte Carlo method, the modified gradient method and differential evolution...|$|R

40|$|In {{the green}} house, {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to clarify the effect of <b>desalinization</b> <b>by</b> mixing the charcoal chaff and applying the drip irrigation in the newly reclaimed land soil. Permeability was improved significantly by the blend of charcoal chaff. It is possible to grow the crops because drip irrigation can supply the water to the root zone under the condition of draining salinity. It is harmful for the crops to stop the irrigation because the capillary rise of salinity cannot be prevented. In the root zone at the reclaimed land, mixing the charcoal chaff is proved to be effective to make mature field earlier to grow crops. lt would be recommendable to use the charcoal chaff as the chaff is easy to get in the harvest time. 新規干拓地土壌に焼き籾殻を混入し，土壌物理性の変化を調べると共に点滴潅漑による除塩効果を調査した．その結果，①破砕粘土に焼き籾殻を混入することで透水性の改善が見られた，②点滴灌概により，根群域周辺のみ集中的に少量の水で除塩を行いながら，作物を生育させることが可能である，③灌概が停止すれば塩の上昇を抑えることが困難になり作物にとって危険な状態になることがわかった．根群域のみに注目して，入手容易な焼き籾殻を土壌改良剤として作土層に混入し，点滴灌概を行い，作物を育てながら除塩を行うことは，海成粘土の早期畑地化実現のために有効である...|$|R
