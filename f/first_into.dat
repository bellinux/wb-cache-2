5|$|A {{few hundred}} yards from the airfield, his plane crashed nose <b>first</b> <b>into</b> the ground. He was quickly freed from the {{aircraft}} by his men, but died in an ambulance minutes later; his orders to return home were found in his jacket pocket. Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The {{administrative}} {{division of}} the East Riding of Yorkshire originated in antiquity. Unlike most counties in Great Britain, which were divided anciently into hundreds, Yorkshire was divided <b>first</b> <b>into</b> three ridings and then into numerous wapentakes within each riding.|$|E
5|$|Alexander then chased Darius, <b>first</b> <b>into</b> Media, {{and then}} Parthia. The Persian king no longer {{controlled}} his own destiny, {{and was taken}} prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.|$|E

5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves <b>first</b> <b>into</b> the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes <b>first</b> <b>into</b> the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
5|$|Hunter gatherers {{settled the}} {{territory}} in the stone and iron ages, followed later by Bantu peoples. The population coalesced <b>first</b> <b>into</b> clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-18th century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during the First World War. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990. Social tensions erupted in the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1.3 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Mitch's {{meteorological}} history {{began with}} its origins over Africa as a tropical wave and lasted until its dissipation as an extratropical cyclone {{north of the}} United Kingdom. Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October22, 1998, over the southwestern Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October10. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from a nearby upper-level low, Mitch quickly intensified in response to improving conditions which included warm waters and good outflow. It became a hurricane on October24 and developed an eye. After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly intensified, <b>first</b> <b>into</b> a major hurricane on October25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman {{system of}} direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings {{were used to}} vote on legislative, electoral, and {{judicial}} matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, {{even if it did}} not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled <b>first</b> <b>into</b> Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, he {{was present}} at the liberation of Paris although, {{contrary}} to the Hemingway legend, he was not the <b>first</b> <b>into</b> the city, nor did he liberate the Ritz. In Paris, he visited Sylvia Beach and Pablo Picasso with Mary Welsh, who joined him there; in a spirit of happiness, he forgave Gertrude Stein. Later that year, he {{was present at}} heavy fighting in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. On December 17, 1944, a feverish and ill Hemingway had himself driven to Luxembourg to cover what was later called The Battle of the Bulge. As soon as he arrived, however, Lanham handed him to the doctors, who hospitalized him with pneumonia; by the time that he recovered a week later, most of the fighting in this battle was over.|$|E

5|$|Over twenty skulls {{have been}} found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, {{elaborate}} bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, <b>first</b> <b>into</b> separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two-thirds {{what it would have}} been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin {{also had}} {{influential}} relatives. Potemkin's sister Maria, for example, married Russian senator Nikolay Samoylov: their son Alexander was decorated for his service under Potemkin in the army; their daughter Ekaterina married <b>first</b> <b>into</b> the Raevesky family, {{and then the}} wealthy landowner Lev Davydov. She had children with both husbands, including highly decorated General Nikolay Raevsky, Potemkin's great-nephew. His wider family included several distant cousins, among them Count Pavel Potemkin, another decorated military figure, whose brother Mikhail married Potemkin's niece Tatiana Engelhardt. A distant nephew, Felix Yusupov, helped murder Rasputin in 1916.|$|E
5|$|South of the Eagle Nebula on {{the border}} with Sagittarius is the eclipsing binary W Serpentis, whose primary is a white giant that is {{interacting}} with the secondary. The system has been found to contain an accretion disk, {{and was one of the}} first discovered Serpentids, which are eclipsing binaries containing exceptionally strong far-ultraviolet spectral lines. It is suspected that such Serpentids are in an earlier evolutionary phase, and will evolve <b>first</b> <b>into</b> double periodic variables and then classical Algol variables. Also near the Eagle Nebula is the eclipsing Wolf–Rayet binary CV Serpentis, consisting of a Wolf–Rayet star and a hot O-type subgiant. The system is surrounded by a ring-shaped nebula, likely formed during the Wolf–Rayet phase of the primary. The eclipses of the system vary erratically, and although there are two theories as to why, neither of them is completely consistent with current understanding of stars.|$|E

5|$|The California Gold Rush in the 1850s saw {{gradually}} increasing mining in Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley. Many Native Americans in {{the area}} revolted, leading to conflicts between miners and the Ahwahnechee. In 1851 the Mariposa Battalion was formed to drive the remaining Ahwahnechee out of the valley into reservations. The Battalion fought an Ahwahnechee group led by Chief Tenaya over the South Fork of the Merced River. Eventually, they succeeded in driving most of the Indians out of the Yosemite Valley, <b>first</b> <b>into</b> a reservation near Fresno. Following the gold rush, the Ahwahnechee were allowed back into Yosemite Valley, but further incidents prompted a second battalion to drive them out, this time to the Mono Lake area. Many place names in the valley have their origin from the Mariposa Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister was {{responsible}} for nominating {{the other members of}} the government, chairing meetings of the Rhodesian Cabinet, and deciding when to call a new general election for the House of Assembly. He retained this role following the reconstitution of Rhodesia under black majority rule, <b>first</b> <b>into</b> Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, then into Zimbabwe the following year. The Zimbabwean government was headed by a Prime Minister from 1980 to 1987, when that post was superseded by an executive presidency. The former Prime Minister, Robert Mugabe, became President; as of 2015 he retains this post.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} {{initially}} frustrated by light winds, but by 14:25 Blonde and Thetis were {{within range of}} the gun batteries and fifteen minutes later {{they were able to}} open fire on the flûtes, although still at quite a distance. Becalmed in the bay, Blonde was forced to engage one of the forts instead, fire from the shore causing some damage but not enough to endanger the ship. Thetis was luckier, and Captain Miller was able to close with one of the French ships, although their identities during the engagement are uncertain in historical accounts and it is not clear which one was <b>first</b> <b>into</b> the action. By 15:35, Thetis had dismasted her opponent, which surrendered. Moving against the second ship, Thetis was then also becalmed and was forced to engage the forts instead. As Sceptre led the remainder of the squadron into the bay, fire was seen spreading through the surrendered ship and, in the face of overwhelming opposition, the second flûte also surrendered at 16:20.|$|E
