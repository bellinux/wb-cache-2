Roman High Avoidance (RHA) and Roman Low Avoidance (RLA) rats {{were used to}} enhance generalization of the results. Orbital bleeding when the rats were under <b>diethylether</b> anaesthesia was compared with <b>diethylether</b> anaesthesia alone. To take into account any effects of handling, the rats were also subjected to sham anaesthesia.

In neither RHA nor RLA rats did anaesthesia plus orbital puncture, versus anaesthesia alone, influence body temperature, heart rate rhythm, locomotor and eating activity. The lack of effect of orbital puncture occurred both in the short term (within 2 h) and long term (within 48 hours) and thus this study indicates that orbital puncture had, at least with respect to variables measured in the present study, no effect superimposed on that of <b>diethylether</b> anaesthesia. ...|$|E

The Monodora tenuifolia seed was extracted with petroleum ether 40 - 60 0 C to produce the crude extract.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} an inoculation model of Walker 256 carcinoma on cervix uteri and vagina of rats. METHODS: Fifteen female rats were used, and assigned to three groups each one with five rats: group A - rats with 4 x 10 (6) cells of Walker 256 carcinoma without acid acetic inoculation; group B - rats with 2 x 10 (6) cells of Walker 256 carcinoma with acid acetic inoculation and group C: rats with 4 x 10 (6) cells of Walker 256 carcinoma with acid acetic inoculation. The day before tumor cells inoculation the rats from groups B and C were anaesthetized with <b>diethylether</b> and 0, 3 ml of acetic acid was inoculated into their vaginas. Tumor cell inoculation into the vagina and cervix was done under general anesthesia with <b>diethylether.</b> Then a endocervical brush {{was used to}} scrape the vaginal wall and after that 0, 3 ml of the liquid containing tumor cells was inoculated on the vagina and cervix. For the tumor analysis, animals were euthanized at day 12 following tumor cell implantation by an excessive inhalation of <b>diethylether.</b> Tumor was resected entirely and weighed and the tumors were then sectioned and counter stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic evaluation. It was also calculated the percentage of tumor equivalent to the body weight by the formula: P= tumor weight / body weight x 100. Data were analyzed by {{one-way analysis of variance}} - ANOVA.

40|$|The recent {{identification}} and characterization of two genes, encoding histamine-gated chloride channel subunits from Drosophila melanogaster, has confirmed that histamine {{is a major}} neurotransmitter in the fruitfly. One of the cloned genes, hclA (synonyms: HisCl-alpha 1; HisCl 2), corresponds to ort (ora transientless), mutations in which affect synaptic transmission in the Drosophila visual system. We identified a mutational change (a null mutation) in the genomic and RNA copies of hclA derived from mutants carrying the ort(1) allele. This correlates with new phenotypes observed in the mutant strain., We found hypersensitivity to the avermectin neurotoxins in both the ort(1) adult flies and third instar larvae compared to Oregon R wild-type animals. On the other hand, the mutation makes {{both male and female}} adult flies more resistant to treatment with diethyl ether, and the animals show substantially prolonged recovery from paralysis after <b>diethylether</b> anaesthesia, as well as from paralysis after mechanical shock, as revealed by the bang sensitivity test.
