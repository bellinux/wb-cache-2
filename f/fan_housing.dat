As shown in the animated figure, the hub turns on a driveshaft mounted in bearings in the <b>fan</b> <b>housing.</b> The gas enters {{from the side of the}} fan wheel, turns 90 degrees and accelerates due to centrifugal force as it flows over the fan blades and exits the <b>fan</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E

50|$|A mining {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} November 6, 1922 at Reilly No. 1 Mine. 79 miners {{were killed when}} an explosion occurred at 7:20 a.m. as 112 men had begun work. The explosion blew out some stoppings and overcasts and also the side and end walls of the <b>fan</b> <b>housing.</b> Help was called from other mines and from the Bureau of Mines at Pittsburgh. The <b>fan</b> <b>housing</b> was patched and the fan started, making the concrete-lined, 112 foot shaft an intake. Recovery workers without apparatus encountered a live man making his way out to fresh air and brought him and four others out. All were badly affected by mine gases, as were 18 of the rescuers. Apparatus crews were then admitted, and 22 other survivors were rescued. Five other men made their way out unassisted. Seventy-six bodies were found, {{and three of the}} rescued men died. The reasons for the explosion were explained. The mine had been rated gaseous in 1918, but at the insistence of the new operators it was rated as non-gaseous although a fireboss was employed and men burned by gas on at least four occasions. The low-volatile dust of the coal helped to spread the explosion. Gas that had accumulated in one or more rooms through open doors and deficient ventilation was ignited by the miners' open lights. Fireboss examinations were neglected and incomplete. A monument constructed to the memory of those lost in this disaster stands in a park {{near the center of the}} town.|$|E
50|$|The {{centrifugal}} design {{uses the}} centrifugal force {{generated by a}} rotating disk, with blades mounted {{at right angles to}} the disk, to impart movement to the air or gas and increase its pressure. The assembly of the hub, disk and blades is known as the fan wheel, and often includes other components with aerodynamic or structural functions. The centrifugal fan wheel is typically contained within a scroll-shaped <b>fan</b> <b>housing,</b> resembling the shell of the nautilus sea creature with a central hole. The air or gas inside the spinning fan is thrown off the outside of the wheel, to an outlet at the housing's largest diameter. This simultaneously draws more air or gas into the wheel through the central hole http://www.howden.com/en/Products/default.htm. Inlet and outlet ducting are often attached to the fan's housing, to supply and/or exhaust the air or gas to the industry's requirements.|$|E
50|$|Testing had {{revealed}} several interesting tendencies of hovercraft, {{such as that}} there was an inevitable delay between the heading of the craft changing and the direction that it was travelling in would change to match. In addition, travelling overland posed more difficulty than traversing water {{due to the lack of}} motion attenuation generated by wave drag. Considerable skill on the part of the pilot was typically required to counter the effects of phenomenon such as cross winds and ground slopes. In 1961, the SR.N1 was outfitted with a flexible skirt which greatly improved the effective depth of the air cushion. During the following year, an aft-facing Bristol-Siddeley Viper III jet engine, mounted on the rear of the decking behind the lift <b>fan</b> <b>housing,</b> supplemented the ducted-air propulsion produced by the piston engine, increasing the craft's maximum speed from 35 to 50 knots; the Viper installation followed an earlier installation of a Blackburn/Turbomeca Marboré of approximately half the Viper's thrust. The SR.N1 was involved in tests for a total of four years prior to its retirement, having demonstrated the practicality of the concept.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} founded on 1 November 1919 as Pelger in Rotterdam in the Netherlands by Mr. Willem D. Pelger, with a funding capital of 40 Dutch guilders The company {{started at the}} Zwanesteeg 4 in Rotterdam as a direct current electric motor repair shop. In 1920 the first employee was offered a job. Direct current motors were in use in Rotterdam, {{as a result of}} the direct current power supply instead of alternating current supply in these early days of electric grid. In March 1926 the company moved to the Paardenstraat 5 and in May 1929 they moved on to the Van Speykstraat 86-102 in Rotterdam. In 1936 a centrifugal fan, brake motors and small induction motors program from another manufacturer named HSM (short for: Heinke-Schuitema-Musselkanaal) in Musselkanaal was bought and brought to Rotterdam. Mr. K.W. Heinke, one of the former owners and mechanical engineer of HSM also moved to work at the factory in Rotterdam. In the same year 40 off. patents were applied for, with reference to three inventions: the centrifugal switch, the centrifugal <b>fan</b> <b>housing</b> and the principle of a squirrel-cage rotor. The Pelger repair shop gradually evolved into a factory designing and manufacturing special electric motors and centrifugal fans. After some time the two original company names Pelger and HSM were changed into a variant of the existing names: Holland Special Machines Pelger or HSM-Pelger.|$|E

40|$|Protecting {{an outdoor}} radon fan from water and ice damage {{is key to}} the {{extended}} life of the outdoor radon mitigation system.

The ice screen located inside the Diverta Drain can eliminate the need of a critter screen at the top end of the exhaust pipe.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{step in the}} process of reusing existing WSDL-specified services for building web-based applications is the discovery of potentially relevant services. However, the category-based service discovery, such as UDDI, is clearly insufficient. Semantic Web Services, augmenting Web service descriptions using Semantic Web technology, were introduced to facilitate the publication, discovery, and execution of Web services at the semantic level. Semantic matchmaker enhances the capability of UDDI service registries in the Semantic Web Services architecture and it is able to recognize various degrees of matching for Web services. Based on the Semantic Web Service framework, semantic matchmaker, specification matching and probabilistic matching, this paper proposes a fuzzy matchmaking approach for Semantic Web Services to support a more automated and veracious service discovery process in collaborative manufacturing environments. In the proposed approach, the membership function is set up on the semantic information annotated on WSDL specification of a web service, and the similarity of service objects is evaluated by the similarity degree of service attributes.

40|$|In this study, a {{centrifugal}} fan design with two flow outlets is investigated. This design aims to provide high {{mass flow rate}} but low noise performance. Two dimensional unsteady flow simulation with CFD code (FLUENT 6. 3) is carried out to analyze the fan flow dynamics and its acoustics. The calculations were done using the unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) approach in which effects of turbulence were accounted for using κ‐ε model. This work aims to provide an insight how the dominant noise source mechanisms vary with a key fan geometrical paramters, namely, the ratio between cutoff distance and the radius of curvature of the <b>fan</b> <b>housing.</b> Four new fan designs were calculated. Simulation {{results show that the}} unsteady flow‐induced forces on the fan blades are found to be the main noise sources. The blade force coefficients are then used to build the dipole source terms in Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FW‐H) Equation for estimating their noise effects.

The addition of a percentage of closing the inlet causes the air volumetric rate the airflow energy BHP and total efficiency except for the fan total and static pressure. The experimental test results there are static pressure data and the resulting total pressure is different or distorted 10 - 17 of deviation from calculation data based on the fan laws. This is possible because of changes in the shape of the blade with serrated on the inside of the impeller. Based on the performance curve shows that the selection of impeller speeds of 800 RPM produces a relatively high air volumetric rate is proportional to the total pressure of the fan and the flow energy so that it is more efficient than other impeller speeds...|$|E
