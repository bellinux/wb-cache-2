Claire Clairmont and Laurette had spent Laurette's {{birthday}} together in Pisa and the following day on the coast with Mary Shelley; this excursion may have inspired the story, {{which may have been}} a birthday present. Shelley suggested that her father, philosopher William Godwin, publish Maurice as part of his Juvenile Library, but he refused.

500|$|Appalled at the {{situation}} affecting his homeland and relatives, Bengali musician Ravi Shankar first brought the issue {{to the attention of}} his friend George Harrison in the early months of 1971, over dinner at Friar Park, according to Klaus Voormann's recollection. By April, Shankar and Harrison were in Los Angeles working on the soundtrack to the film Raga (1971), during which Harrison wrote the song [...] "Miss O'Dell", commenting on corruption among the Indian authorities as aid shipments of rice from the West kept [...] "going astray on [...] way to Bombay". After returning to England to produce Badfinger's Straight Up album (1971) and take part in sessions for John Lennon's Imagine (1971) – all the while, being kept abreast of developments by Shankar, via newspaper and magazine cuttings – Harrison was back in LA to finish the Raga album in late June. By then, the Sunday Times in London had <b>just</b> <b>published</b> an influential article by Pakistani journalist Anthony Mascarenhas, which exposed the full horror of the Bangladesh atrocities, and a distraught Shankar approached Harrison for help in trying to alleviate the suffering. Harrison later talked of spending [...] "three months" [...] on the phone organising the Concert for Bangladesh, implying that efforts were under way from late April onwards; it is widely acknowledged that the project began in earnest during the last week of June 1971, however, five or six weeks before the event took place on 1 August.|$|E
