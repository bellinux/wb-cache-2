40|$|The {{sampling}} artifacts (both {{positive and}} negative) {{and the influence}} of thermal-optical methods (both charring correction method and the peak inert mode temperature) on the split of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were evaluated in Beijing. The positive sampling artifact constituted 10 % and 23 % of OC concentration determined by the bare quartz filter during winter and summer, respectively. For summer samples, the adsorbed gaseous organics were found to continuously evolve off the filter during the whole inert mode when analyzed by the IMPROVE-A temperature protocol. This {{may be due to the}} oxidation of the adsorbed organics during sampling (reaction artifact) which would increase their thermal stability. The backup quartz approach was evaluated by a denuder-based method for assessing the positive artifact. The quartz-quartz (QBQ) in series method was demonstrated to be reliable, since all of the OC collected by QBQ was from originally gaseous organics. Negative artifact that could be adsorbed by quartz filter was negligible. When the activated carbon impregnated glass fiber (CIG) filter was used as the denuded backup filter, the denuder efficiency for removing gaseous organics that could be adsorbed by the CIG filter was only about 30 %. EC values were found to differ by a factor of about two depending on the charring correction method. Influence of the peak inert mode temperature was evaluated based on the summer samples. The EC value was found to continuously decrease with the peak inert mode temperature.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the possibility of identifying and quantifying atmospheric carbonate carbon (CC) by thermal-optical analysis. Three different temperature protocols, two modified NIOSH-like protocols (RT-QUARTZ- 840 and RT-QUARTZ- 700), and the EUSAAR 2 protocol were tested on filter samples containing known amounts of CC with the semi-continuous Sunset analyzer. Carbonate was quantified by the manual integration of the sharp peak appeared at the maximum temperature step of the inert mode. High recoveries of CC were achieved by all the thermal protocols. Using the EUSAAR 2 thermal protocol, more than 95 % of CC evolved as OC during the maximum temperature step in inert atmosphere for CC amounts up to 56 μg. Using the RT-QUARTZ- 840 protocol specifically developed for on-line analyses, CC completely evolves as OC during the maximum temperature step in the inert node, regardless of the CC concentration. However, the quantification of CC by the RT-QUARTZ- 840 protocol suitable for the semi-continuous analyzer implies {{a high level of}} uncertainty (manual integration, residual contribution of organic carbon). Therefore, it is advisable to determine CC with an independent method (e. g. by acidic decomposition of CO 2 − 3 and subsequent detection of CO 2) when other sample aliquots are available. The comparison of the peak integration method with the direct determination of the CC sample content by acidic CO 2 release showed that the peak integration method provides always higher CC concentrations of about 33 %. Nevertheless, the determination of CC with the RT-QUARTZ- 840 protocol may be considered in cases where on line monitoring instruments are used and for areas Correspondence to: A. Karanasiou (angeliki. karanasiou@idaea. csic. es) where CC concentrations are expected to be significant e. g. Southern European countries.

40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{molecular}} mechanisms involved in the import of proteins into the nucleus. This lack of knowledge extends to <b>he</b> <b>mode</b> of nuclear entry of steroid-receptor complexes and modulation of steroid hormone action during its passage across the nuclear envelope. The main goal of this thesis was to identify the molecular machinery that interacts with the nuclear localization signals located in steroid hormone receptors. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone receptor nuclear localization signals were radioiodinated and incubated with cytosol, high salt- and detergent-extracted rat liver nuclei or nuclear envelopes in the presence of a crosslinking agent. Two specifically labeled polypeptides of 60 and 76 kDa were identified with both synthetic peptides in all fractions by autoradiography after SDS-Page. The two general conclusions drawn from my data are: first, that these two specifically labeled polypeptides may act as shuttling vectors in nuclear transport; and second, the binding sites may be part of a general mechanism for nuclear entry of most nuclear proteins. Nuclear import of proteins is comprised of two steps, the first step being the binding of the protein to he outer nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complex, and the second step being the translocation of the protein through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus. I established an in vitro system, which consist of isolated rat liver nuclei, capable of the first step but not the second step, to study glucocorticoid receptor nuclear binding. I have also demonstrated that digitonin-permeabilized cells can be used to study both steps (binding and import) of the glucocorticoid receptor translocation into nuclei in an ATP-dependent manner similar to other nuclear proteins. These in vitro models will allow us to further define the mechanisms involved in the nuclear import of the glucocorticoid receptor, particularly the hormone-induced nuclear translocation of the receptor, and to establish the role of the 60 - and 76 -kDa polypeptides in nuclear import. The ligand-induced nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor is dependent on the intracellular hormone concentration which is influenced by membrane binding sites for the glucocorticoid ligand. With the affinity label, dexamethasone 21 -mesylate, I have identified a 45 -kDa microsomal membrane site that displays the characteristics of a low affinity glucocorticoid binder. This protein may limit the amount of free hormone for the receptor and therefore blunt the action of the steroid hormone in the nucleus...|$|E
