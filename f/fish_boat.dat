25|$|Artisan <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> {{are usually}} small {{traditional}} <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> appropriately {{designed for use}} on their local inland waters or coasts. Many localities {{around the world have}} developed their own traditional types of <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> adapted to use local materials suitable for boat building and to the specific requirements of the fisheries and sea conditions in their area. Artisan boats are often open (undecked). Many have sails, but they do not usually use much, or any mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines. For example, Indonesia has reported about 700,000 <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> 25 percent of which are dugout canoes, and half of which are without motors. The Philippines have reported a similar number of small <b>fishing</b> <b>boats.</b> Many of the boats in this area are double-outrigger craft, consisting of a narrow main hull with two attached outriggers, commonly known as jukung in Indonesia and banca in the Philippines.|$|R

40|$|Mobile phones {{have had}} a {{tremendous}} diffusion rate in Africa in recent years. This has brought access to telecommunication to new user groups, among them Tanzanian fishermen. But how does mobile phone use affect the way fishermen live their lives, how they pursue economic activities and how they protect themselves from vulnerability to risk? During a field study in Tanzania, interviews with <b>fish</b> <b>boat</b> captains were conducted in order to investigate what impact mobile phone use has on the livelihood indicators empowerment, opportunity and vulnerability to risk. Our research shows that increased access to information, enabled by mobile phones brings positive effects to all indicators. Mobile phone use empowers, both through increased bargaining power and increased control over external events. Mobile phones give increased knowledge about market opportunities and a possibility to work more efficiently. Furthermore, mobile phones give fishermen a possibility to take measures to decrease the risks they are exposed to, such as emergencies out at sea. The negative effects are found negligible. These effects are most likely not isolated to Tanzanian fishermen. Communication through mobile phones can bring similar advantages to other groups that have earlier been excluded from the communication system...|$|E

Her mother was born in the city while her dad was from a village, both of them from South Vietnam. Stephanie explained how her parents escaped from Vietnam. Her mother boarded a ship to Thailand and was in a camp there while her dad escaped in a <b>fish</b> <b>boat</b> {{in the middle of the}} night. He spent 2 weeks in the boat and struggled for food and water and saw people died. He ended up his journey in a refugee camp in Thailand as well. Both of her parents were sponsored by families who helped them come to America. They settled their new life in the United States and years later Stephanie was born. Stephanie is a great example because as a second-generation child she recognizes the sacrifice that her parents did to escape the war that could have cost their lives if they stayed in Vietnam. She feels proud of them and as an American-Vietnamese she wants to share her parents' experiences with future generations as well as her personal perspective towards the war and how it was taught to her in American schools.

40|$|Before {{you start}} the search, {{take some time to}} think about your lifestyle, interests, and what {{activities}} you enjoy. Are your interests specific to waterfront property? Or would a property near, but not on, the water be a good choice? Scenic lakes and rivers have lured families to their shores for generations to <b>fish,</b> <b>boat</b> and swim. Once at the lake, people discover more – like the fun of seeing a family of otters playing among the lily pads, and the majestic sight of a bald eagle soaring above sparkling blue waters. If you are thinking about buying waterfront property in Wisconsin, this guide is meant for you. A little time invested in learning about waterfront living will pay back sizable dividends in matching your expectations to the realities. This guide provides: Ideas to consider before you start your property search • Considerations to help you decide on the right lake or river Factors to help you choose just the right property The questions below may help get you thinking: Why do you want to own waterfront property? How far are you willing to drive? How do you envision spending time there? How many times a year {{will you be able to}} visit when you consider your other time commitments?

Will you landscape or enjoy the native vegetation? Are you willing to help take care of the lake or river and accept the regulations and restrictions that may be in place to protect it? Are you willing to share your waterfront with others? CONSIDER: Non-waterfront property is generally less expensive and has lower taxes.
