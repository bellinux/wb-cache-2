40|$|Management of the {{concentrate}} streams {{generated from}} reverse osmosis (RO) based wastewater reclamation processes {{is critical for}} the water industry in the sustained use of the practice. The potential of a biological activated carbon (BAC) process combined with pre-oxidation using a UVC/H 2 O 2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) for treating a highly saline municipal wastewater RO concentrate (ROC) was evaluated at lab scale during approximately 3 months of operation. The combined treatment reduced the UVA 254 and colour of the ROC to below those for the influent of the RO process (i. e., biologically treated secondary effluent), and the reductions in dissolved organic carbon (<b>DOC)</b> <b>and</b> <b>COD</b> were approximately 60 and 50 %, respectively. UVC/H 2 O 2 was demonstrated {{to be an effective}} means of converting the recalcitrant organic compounds in the ROC into biodegradable substances which were readily removed by the BAC process.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} Fenton reactions induced by solar radiation {{in the treatment of}} effluent from a factory of paints for buildings, after prior removal of the suspended solids. The increase of H 2 O 2 concentration from 100 to 2500 [*]mg[*]L− 1 for a [Fe 2 +] = 105 [*]mg[*]L− 1 contributed to the reduction of DOC, COD, and toxicity. Our best results were achieved using 1600 [*]mg[*]L− 1 H 2 O 2, with 90 % of <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> <b>COD</b> removal and a complete removal of the toxicity with respect to Artemia salina. Additionally, through increasing Fe 2 + concentration from 15 to 45 [*]mg[*]L− 1, the DOC removal rate increased 11 times, remaining almost constant in the range above 45 until 105 [*]mg[*]L− 1. Under our best experimental conditions, 80 % of DOC removal was achieved after an accumulated dose of 130 [*]kJ[*]m− 2 of UVA radiation (82 ± 17 [*]min of solar irradiation under an average UVA irradiance of 34. 1 ± 7. 3 [*]W[*]m− 2), while 40 % of DOC removal was reached after 150 [*]min under only thermal Fenton reactions.

40|$|The UVC/H 2 O 2 {{process was}} studied at {{laboratory}} scale {{for the treatment}} of one moderate (conductivity ∼ 8 mS/cm) and two high salinity (∼ 23 mS/cm) municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) samples with varying organic and inorganic characteristics. The process efﬁciency was characterized in terms of reduction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), colour and absorbance at 254 nm (A 254), and the improvement of biodegradability. The reduction of colour and A 254 was signiﬁcantly greater than for <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> <b>COD</b> for all samples due to the greater breakdown of humic compounds, as conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra. Fairly small differences in the reduction of DOC (26 &ndash; 38 %) and COD (25 &ndash; 37 %) were observed for all samples, suggesting that the salinity of the ROC did not have a signiﬁcant impact on the UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment under the test conditions. The biodegradability of the treated ROC samples improved markedly (approximately 2 -fold) after 60 min UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment. This study indicates the potential of UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment followed by biological processes for treating high-salinity concentrate, and the robustness of the process where the characteristics of the secondary efﬂuent (inﬂuent to RO) and thus resultant ROC vary signiﬁcantly...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor the changes in biodegradability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in landfill leachates. Experiments to investigate aerobic biodegradation of leachate DOM were carried out using untreated and treated leachate samples collected from two UK municipal solid waste landfills, L 1 and L 2. Leachate samples collected {{at different stages of}} the aerobic treatment processes were characterized by conventional methods (chemical oxygen demand (<b>COD)</b> <b>and</b> dissolved organic carbon content (<b>DOC))</b> <b>and</b> also by UV spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. The laboratory-scale aerobic treatment system achieved reductions in <b>COD</b> <b>and</b> <b>DOC</b> in all of the leachates. Results obtained from UV spectrophotometry indicated that the aromatic character of the leachate decreased during aerobic biodegradation. Additionally, the fluorescence intensity of the leachates decreased to various extents, suggesting degradation of humic, fulvic or protein-like structures during biodegradation. Initial results showed strong relations between fluorescent <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> fluorescent <b>COD</b> <b>and</b> suggest that the strength of these correlations could be a useful tool in distinguishing sources <b>and</b> biodegradability of <b>DOC</b> cheaply <b>and</b> quickly, although further research using different types of leachates is required...|$|R

Simple, cost effective, reliable and widely applicable methods for the measurement of organic waste and its biodegradability are needed for this activity.

The review considered both biological and non-biological methods including simple methods that may provide a surrogate measurement of waste biodegradability instead of the time-consuming biological methods. The biological methods selected for further evaluation were the aerobic specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) and dynamic respiration index (DRI) tests, and the anaerobic biochemical methane potential (BMP) test.

40|$|The {{organic matter}} {{present in the}} {{concentrate}} streams generated from reverse osmosis (RO) based municipal wastewater reclamation processes poses environmental and health risks on its disposal to the receiving environment (e. g., estuaries, bays). The potential of a biological activated carbon (BAC) process combined with pre-oxidation using a UVC/H 2 O 2 advanced oxidation process for treating a high salinity (TDS ∼ 10 000 mg L- 1) municipal wastewater RO concentrate (ROC) was evaluated at lab scale during 90 d of operation. The combined treatment reduced the UVA 254 and colour of the ROC to below those for the influent of the RO process (i. e., biologically treated secondary effluent), and the reductions in <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> <b>COD</b> were approximately 60 % and 50 %, respectively. UVC/H 2 O 2 was demonstrated {{to be an effective}} means of converting the recalcitrant organic compounds in the ROC into biodegradable substances which were readily removed by the BAC process, leading to a synergistic effect of the combined treatment in degrading the organic matter. The tests using various BAC feed concentrations suggested that the biological treatment was robust and consistent for treating the high salinity ROC.

40|$|M. Sc. (Chemistry) In {{this study}} the {{stability}} {{as well as}} the fate and behavior of ZnO engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in municipal wastewater systems were investigated. The first part of the study examined the influence of pH and ionic strength on the stability of ZnO ENPs in domestic wastewater to elucidate the dynamic changes on the ENPs physicochemical characteristics (e. g. aggregation or dissolution). The ZnO ENPs obtained commercially were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), BET surface area determination, and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Results derived from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for zinc analysis indicated a decrease on the released zinc concentration from wastewater as the pH and ionic strength increased. Conversely, an increase on zinc concentration from the sludge was observed. The findings suggest the removal of ZnO ENPs from the influent wastewater as the sludge settled out, and the removal efficiency was directly proportional to ionic strength and pH. In addition, the ZnO ENPs suspension in the wastewater was used to monitor the particle size distribution using the dynamic light scattering analysis (DLS). The formation of agglomerates was observed which the TEM and EDS analysis confirmed to be ZnO aggregates. The distribution of zinc in the sludge was investigated using XRD analysis and the findings indicated partial sedimentation of ZnO ENPs as the sludge settled out. The second part of the study assessed the fate and behavior of ZnO ENPs in wastewater treatment systems. This study was carried out in a simulated activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (AS WWTP), constructed in accordance to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 303 A) guidelines. Results from the ICP-OES analysis for zinc indicated 50 – 200 μgL- 1 and about 3 000 mgkg- 1 were released into the effluent and sludge, respectively, after spiking the influent wastewater with 5 mgL- 1 ZnO ENPs. Moreover, we noted that increasing the ZnO ENPs concentration up to 20 mgL- 1 resulted in a linear increase in the zinc releases into effluent wastewater. However, the increase was insignificant in comparison to the zinc found in the control unit. Therefore, the findings indicated that ZnO ENPs had stronger affinity for the suspended bio-solids during wastewater treatment, and postulated that the ENPs removal from the influent wastewater was due to bio-sorption, and bio-solid settling mechanisms. These were confirmed by results from XRD and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) analysis of the sludge as they showed the presence of ZnO in the sludge. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were concurrently monitored during the ENPs exposure studies to indirectly assess the ZnO ENPs impact to the bacterial degradation of the organic matter. An average of 43 and 91 % for <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> <b>COD</b> removal efficiencies, respectively, were observed throughout the study. Overall, from results obtained indicated the suitability of the OECD 303 A method to assess the fate and behavior of ZnO ENPs in WWTPs. Secondly, in light of low concentrations of ZnO ENPs found in the treated effluent due to their removal with the waste activated sludge (WAS), suggest low likelihood of ZnO ENPs release and dispersion into the aquatic systems from WWTPs as point sources. Finally, the elevated concentrations of ZnO ENPs in the sludge therefore necessitates additional treatment steps to ensure mitigation of possible dispersion of ENPs from various disposal mechanisms such as landfilling, incineration, and agricultural applications...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{monitoring}} the changes of fluorescent components in wastewater samples from 22 Korean biological {{wastewater treatment plants}} and exploring their prediction capabilities for total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (<b>COD),</b> <b>and</b> the biodegradability of the wastewater using an optical sensing technique based on fluorescence excitation emission matrices and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Three fluorescent components were identified from the samples by using EEM-PARAFAC, including protein-like (C 1), fulvic-like (C 2) and humic-like (C 3) components. C 1 showed the highest removal efficiencies for all the treatment types investigated here (69 % ± 26 %– 81 % ± 8 %), followed by C 2 (37 % ± 27 %– 65 % ± 35 %), while humic-like component (i. e., C 3) tended to be accumulated during the biological treatment processes. The percentage of C 1 in total fluorescence (%C 1) decreased from 54 % ± 8 % in the influents to 28 % ± 8 % in the effluents, while those of C 2 and C 3 (%C 2 and %C 3) increased from 43 % ± 6 % to 62 % ± 9 % and from 3 % ± 7 % to 10 % ± 8 %, respectively. The concentrations of TOC, <b>DOC,</b> BOD, <b>and</b> <b>COD</b> were the most correlated with the fluorescence intensity (Fmax) of C 1 (r = 0. 790 – 0. 817), {{as compared with the}} other two fluorescent components. The prediction capability of C 1 for TOC, BOD, <b>and</b> <b>COD</b> were improved by using multiple regression based on Fmax of C 1 and suspended solids (SS) (r = 0. 856 – 0. 865), both of which can be easily monitored in situ. The biodegradability of organic matter in BOD/COD were significantly correlated with each PARAFAC component and their combinations (r = − 0. 598 – 0. 613, p < 0. 001), with the highest correlation coefficient shown for %C 1.

40|$|Sequential ozone and UV-based {{processes}} (VUV irradiation and UV/H 2 O 2) for {{the treatment}} of secondary effluent were investigated. The effectiveness of these sequential treatments was compared with the individual treatments in terms of reduction in <b>DOC,</b> <b>COD,</b> UV 254 <b>and</b> colour and impact on BDOC. The greatest decrease in <b>DOC,</b> <b>COD</b> <b>and</b> UV 254 was achieved for samples treated with ozone before UV/H 2 O 2 (UVH), where a synergistic benefit was observed. By monitoring the formation of hydroxyl radicals (HO) during UVH and ozonation it was demonstrated that UVH treatments generated more hydroxyl radicals than ozonation, which explained the greater extent of mineralisation attained during UVH treatment. Sequential O 3 -UVH treatment (for 5 and 10 min, respectively) enhanced the formation of biodegradable compounds such that when followed by biological treatment up to 73 % of the DOC could be removed from the secondary effluent. Furthermore, application of the O 3 -UVH treatment achieved 2. 5 times greater mineralisation than ozone alone.

In the presence of high bottom ice algal biomass in mid-spring, <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> CO exhibited high concentrations in the bottom (DOC: 563 +/- 434 mu mol L(- 1); CO: 82. 9 +/- 84 nmol L(- 1)) relative to the surface (DOC: 56 +/- 26 mu mol L(- 1); CO: 16. 8 +/- 7 nmol L(- 1)). Landfast ice contained higher levels of <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> CO than drifting ice. Cruise-mean <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> CO inventories in sea ice were 87 +/- 51 mu mol m(- 2) and 13. 9 +/- 10 mu mol m(- 2), respectively. Net productions of <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> CO linked to the ice algal bloom were assessed to be 75 mu mol m(- 2) and 13. 2 mu mol m(- 2).

40|$|Temporal {{variation}} in {{dissolved organic carbon}} (<b>DOC)</b> <b>and</b> water color (light absorption at 440 nm) was measured in 20 lakes in northern Michigan that varied in <b>DOC,</b> pH, morphometry, <b>and</b> relative productivity as indicated by chlorophyll and total phosphorus (TP). Monthly observations during May–August over 6 yr revealed that <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> color varied by 6 - and 28 -fold among lakes and varied substantially through time within lakes. The pattern of temporal variation differed among years but was synchronous among lakes. Of the 190 possible correlations among lake time series, most were positive for <b>DOC</b> (158) <b>and</b> color (160), and 50 % of the positive correlations were significant (P � 0. 05). Other variables, such as total phosphorus, chlorophyll, and pH, were less synchronous and had fewer significant positive correlations (13 – 25 %). Temporal dynamics in <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> color were related to ice-out date as well as spring and summer precipitation. Years of late ice-out and high spring rain were associated with high <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> color in spring. A summer drought in one year lead to declines in color (up to 40 %) <b>and</b> <b>DOC</b> (up to 38 %) in {{nearly all of the}} lakes. The common temporal dynamics of <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> color were most likely the result of climatic conditions that affected loading of allochthonous carbon as well as losses due to photodegradation. The variations in DOC were sufficient to cause large changes in light penetration, standing stocks of carbon, and ecosystem metabolism...|$|R

Our approach integrates biogeochemical measurements, optical properties and remote sensing to examine the distributions and inventories of organic carbon in the U. S. Middle Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Maine. Algorithms developed to retrieve colored DOM (CDOM), Dissolved (<b>DOC)</b> <b>and</b> Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) from NASA's MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS satellite sensors are applied to quantify the distributions <b>and</b> inventories of <b>DOC</b> <b>and</b> POC.
