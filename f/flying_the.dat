5|$|Born in Andrews, South Carolina, Overton took {{an early}} {{interest}} in flying, and attended The Citadel {{for a year}} before enlisting in the United States Navy briefly during World War II. Afterward, Overton graduated from West Point and began a career <b>flying</b> <b>the</b> F-84 Thunderjet. In 1952, Overton volunteered to fly in the Korean War and flew 102 missions in an F-84 before transferring to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and <b>flying</b> <b>the</b> F-86 Sabre. During a four-day time period in early 1953, Overton claimed five MiG-15 victories in MiG alley, certifying him as a flying ace. However, he was subsequently returned to the United States in shame after commanders charged him with insubordination for crossing the Yalu River into Manchuria for his victories.|$|E
5|$|Following this duty, {{the ship}} sailed for Hawaii, {{where she was}} used as a prop in the movie Mister Roberts. The ship {{returned}} to San Diego in November. Remaining in the area for four months, Philippine Sea conducted several training operations off the California coast. She then began her fifth cruise of the Far East on 1 April 1955 en route to Yokosuka. She operated in waters of Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan for most of 1955, with Air Task Group 2 consisting of VF-123, VF-143 and VA-55, VF-123 <b>flying</b> <b>the</b> F9F-2 Panther jet fighter-bomber, VF-143 <b>flying</b> <b>the</b> Grumman F9F-6 Cougar jet fighter, and VA-55 <b>flying</b> <b>the</b> AD-6 Skyraider propellor attack bomber. During this time, she made trips to Hong Kong, Keelung and Formosa. On 23 November, she was redesignated as a CVS, or an anti-submarine warfare carrier. Her aircraft complement was replaced with several dozen S2F Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and HSS-1 Seabat helicopters. She returned to San Diego on 23 November 1955. Throughout 1956 she saw little activity as crew went on leave and she was docked for upkeep, and only conducted several routine training operations off the coast of southern California. In late 1956 she moved to Hawaii for more training operations.|$|E

5|$|At {{his death}} he had {{achieved}} 57 aerial victories, placing him seventh {{on the list}} of the war's most successful aces. Just under two-thirds of his victims can be identified by name.

The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five fell while <b>flying</b> <b>the</b> S.E.5a.|$|E

5|$|Captain Walter Lux, 53, {{had been}} <b>flying</b> <b>the</b> DC-10 since its {{introduction}} eight years earlier.

First Officer James Dillard, 49, and Flight Engineer Alfred Udovich, 56, were also highly experienced: 9,275 hours and 15,000 hours respectively, and between them they had 1,830 hours flying experience in the DC-10.|$|E

During <b>the</b> <b>flying</b> fish season, <b>the</b> people are not allowed to catch other than <b>the</b> <b>flying</b> fish and <b>the</b> common dolphinfish; they also have specific regulations for fishing gear and the number of people allowed to fish.
