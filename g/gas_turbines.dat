The analysis performance code has been performed used the MATLAB software. The simulating code for <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configuration results show that the simple <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configuration is more suitable with regards to power output, but the regenerative <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configuration has higher efficiency with effect ambient temperature. The simple <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configuration has higher power output with effect the compression ratio, while the regenerative <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> configuration has higher efficiency with effect lower compression ratio, therefore the variation of total power output is insignificance at lower compression ratio.

5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 1954, a {{conversion}} {{proposal for the}} South Dakota-class ships was ordered by the Chairman of the Ship Characteristics Board. The request was made for the ships' speed to be increased to at least 31 knots. To do so, the design staff decided to remove the after turret and use the weight and space gained to install either a set of improved steam turbines or a set of <b>gas</b> <b>turbines.</b> Either system would have to produce at least 256,000shaft horsepower (190 MW)—the minimum requirement to achieve 31knots on the South Dakota hull. Unfortunately, this would have necessitated alterations to the hull form, particularly {{in the rear of}} the ship. Larger propellers were also required, and all four shafts would have had to have been completely rebuilt to accommodate the changes. Estimates for the project ran as high as $40,000,000 per ship, and this did not include the cost of reactivating the ship and upgrades to its electrical and combat systems. As a result, the conversion program was halted.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for <b>gas</b> <b>turbines</b> and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Gas {{turbine blade}} are {{designed}} to operate at high temperature which just below material melting temperature. It always undergoes high temperature and pressures which creates stresses in the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> blade material. Due to this <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> mostly fails before its specified time period. It also tends to damage stators in turbine engine. The working environment of <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> blade is very hot, aggressive and harsh for blade material. But blade metallurgy and coating always saves the blade material for long period of time. It is observed that <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> blade fails due to hot flowing fluid over its profile. Means flowing fluid makes impact on blade working life period and ultimately of course on rotation of blades. The actual flow of hot fluid in <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> blade decides the impact in blade. By simulating actual flow of hot fluid on blade can give more information about that environment and we can understand the working phenomenon. If we capable to understand the flow of hot fluid in <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> then we can understand root causes of <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> blade failure.
