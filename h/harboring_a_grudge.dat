40|$|Interpersonal offenses {{frequently}} mar relationships. Theo-rists {{have argued}} that the responses victims adopt toward their offend-ers have ramifications not only for their cognition, but also for their emotion, physiology, and health. This study examined the immediate emotional and physiological effects that occurred when participants (35 females, 36 males) rehearsed hurtful memories and nursed grudges (i. e., were unforgiving) compared with when they cultivated empathic perspective taking and imagined granting forgiveness (i. e., were forgiving) toward real-life offenders. Unforgiving thoughts prompted more aversive emotion, and significantly higher corrugator (brow) electromyogram (EMG), skin conductance, heart rate, and blood pressure changes from baseline. The EMG, skin conductance, and heart rate effects persisted after imagery into the recovery peri-ods. Forgiving thoughts prompted greater perceived control and com-paratively lower physiological stress responses. The results dovetail with the psychophysiology literature and suggest possible mechanisms through which chronic unforgiving responses may erode health whereas forgiving responses may enhance it. Social relationships are often marred by interpersonal offenses. An expanding group of theorists, therapists, and health professionals has proposed that the ways people respond to interpersonal offenses can significantly affect their health (McCullough, Sandage, & Worthing-ton, 1997; McCullough & Worthington, 1994; Thoresen, Harris, & Luskin, 1999). Unforgiving responses (rehearsing the hurt, <b>harboring</b> <b>a</b> <b>grudge)</b> are considered health eroding, whereas forgiving responses (empathizing with the human condition of the offender, granting for-giveness) are thought to be health enhancing (e. g., Thoresen et al. ...|$|E
