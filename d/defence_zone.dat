Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the <b>defence</b> <b>zone</b> between the two trench systems. This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
25|$|Concerns about The Barrier's {{instability}} due to volcanic, tectonic {{or heavy}} rainfall activity prompted {{the provincial government}} to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1980. This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of Garibaldi nearby and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should The Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish rivers would be considerable, including major damage {{to the town of}} Squamish and possibly an impact-wave on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island.

25|$|The {{fighting}} in early October {{had been very}} costly for the 4th Army and units were used piecemeal to fill gaps. After the defeat of 4 October, Thaer had a heated dispute with Loßberg, who had ordered exhausted divisions to counter-attack and Loßberg {{said that he could}} not relieve such divisions. On 7 October, the 4th Army reversed the new policy, more emphasis was placed on reducing British barrage fire with counter-battery bombardments. Front line garrisons were dispersed in an advanced <b>defence</b> <b>zone</b> of sentry posts and machine-gun nests. As soon as the British attacked, the outpost troops were to rush back to the main defensive line, which would be protected by a standing barrage, delaying the attackers until the Eingreif divisions could advance through the British barrages and conduct Gegenstoss counter-attacks as soon as possible. If the British had managed to dig in, the Gegenstoss was to be cancelled and a Gegenangriff substituted later.|$|E

In ComCoast, five countries from the North Sea Region are involved: Belgium, Denmark, The Netherlands, Germany, and the UK. In total, ten partners constitute the project consortium. Climate change cause already increasing physical load on coastal defence along the North Sea. Over the next decades, problems will arise through the need of adapting the existing coastal defence structures to modified conditions of coastal development, e. g. nature conservation areas, limited budgets, or changing social pretensions. New approaches emphasizing a gradual transition from sea to land are being explored in order to incorporate land use management {{with regard to the}} increasing pressure from population growth. These transitional areas will offer new opportunities both to the environment and to the people. In the ComCoast project, the need to develop new sustainable flood management strategies will be recognised in order to influence planners to anticipate future developments. Work Package 1 is one of the six Work Packages of the ComCoast project. Work Package 1 aims to identify feasible ComCoast areas along the southern North Sea. Work Package 2 explores new socio-economic evaluation methods for the ComCoast concept. The design and development of alternative embankments and strategies for coastal <b>defence</b> <b>zones</b> are worked out in Work Package 3. Work Package 4 deals with new and innovative participation strategies to involve stakeholders in the development process of ComCoast concepts.

On 9 October Ludendorff issued a memorandum to all Western Front divisions, complaining that Eingreifdivisionen were being misused.
