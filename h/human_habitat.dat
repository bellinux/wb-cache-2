5|$|Unlike many waterfowl, mallards {{have benefited}} from human {{alterations}} to the worldso much {{so that they are}} now considered an invasive species in some regions. They are a common sight in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other man-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in <b>human</b> <b>habitat</b> due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes from the loss of genetic diversity among a region's traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl. These non-migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Geography Congress, held in Ankara City between 6–21 June 1941, divided Turkey into seven regions {{after long}} discussions and work. These {{geographical}} regions were separated {{according to their}} climate, location, flora and fauna, <b>human</b> <b>habitat,</b> agricultural diversities, transportation, topography, etc. At the end, 4 coastal regions and 3 inner regions were named according to their proximity to the four seas surrounding Turkey, and their positions in Anatolia.|$|E
25|$|A {{maternal}} mitochondrial, paternal Y chromosome, and microsatellite {{assessment of}} two wolf populations in North America and combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou, and another territorial ecotype population that remained in a boreal coniferous forest. Though these two populations spend {{a period of}} the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey–habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence. A study has identified the remains of a population of extinct Pleistocene Beringian wolves with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these were specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived. Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the <b>human</b> <b>habitat.</b>|$|E

25|$|Biosphere 2 was {{originally}} meant {{to demonstrate the}} viability of closed ecological systems to support and maintain human life in outer space, defining mission one as eight humans for two years. Additionally, it served to explore the web of interactions within life systems in a structure with five areas based on biomes, and an agricultural area and human living and working space to study the interactions between humans, farming, and technology {{with the rest of}} nature. It also explored the use of closed biospheres in space colonization, and allowed the study and manipulation of a biosphere without harming Earth's. Its five biome areas were a 1,900 square meter rainforest, an 850 square meter ocean with a coral reef, a 450 square meter mangrove wetlands, a 1,300 square meter savannah grassland, a 1,400 square meter fog desert, a 2,500 square meter agricultural system, a <b>human</b> <b>habitat,</b> and a below-ground infrastructure. Heating and cooling water circulated through independent piping systems and passive solar input through the glass space frame panels covering most of the facility, and electrical power was supplied into Biosphere2 from an onsite natural gas energy center.|$|E

40|$|Ever since {{homo sapiens}} {{appeared}} on earth some 2. 5 million years ago, {{their need to}} build <b>human</b> <b>habitats</b> have impacted upon the environment. Early homo sapiens were largely constrained by Environmental Determinism which did little harm to the environment. However, Possibilism and Human Determinism of the modern era left inerasable scars on earth. Increasingly, as humans advanced in science and technology, and preferred to live in urban habitats, they have inadvertently impacted upon the environment very significantly, often {{to the point of}} irreversible damage. Modern humans and the construction of their habitats have significantly impacted upon and changed the environment as follows: changed the atmospheric characteristics resulting in climate change (initially at the local level but now globally); changed the hydrological characteristics resulting in floods, droughts, water crises and other hydrological disasters; changed the lithospheric characteristics resulting in soil erosion, landslides and other mass movements; changed the biosphere resulting in loss of natural habitats (of indigenous people, flora and fauna); and changed the cryosphere resulting in global melting and retreating of ice shelves and ice sheets leading to sea level rise {{and a host of other}} environmental disasters. However, a combination of realisation of environmental degradation, the environmental movement, and the rise of sustainable development have led to environmentally-friendly <b>human</b> <b>habitats.</b> To achieve sustainable development in <b>human</b> <b>habitats,</b> <b>humans</b> need to control urban growth, control population growth, illegal immigrants and proliferation of slums, ensure adequate (quantity) and appropriate (quality) housing, institute legislation for disaster-resistant habitat structures, develop technology for early warning system of major risks to habitats, and mobilise politicians to commit to environmental management of <b>human</b> <b>habitats</b> vis-à-vis economic development.

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} by which species colonize and adapt to <b>human</b> <b>habitats</b> is particularly important {{in the case of}} disease-vectoring arthropods. The mosquito species Aedes aegypti, a major vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses, probably originated as a wild, zoophilic species in sub-Saharan Africa, where some populations still breed in tree holes in forested habitats. Many populations of the species, however, have evolved to thrive in <b>human</b> <b>habitats</b> and to bite humans. This includes some populations within Africa as well as almost all those outside Africa. It is not clear whether all domestic populations are genetically related and represent a single ‘domestication’ event, or whether association with <b>human</b> <b>habitats</b> has developed multiple times independently within the species. To test the hypotheses above, we screened 24 worldwide population samples of Ae. aegypti at 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. We identified two distinct genetic clusters: one included all domestic populations outside of Africa and the other included both domestic and forest populations within Africa. This suggests that human association in Africa occurred independently from that in domestic populations across the rest of the world. Additionally, measures of genetic diversity support Ae. aegypti in Africa as the ancestral form of the species. Individuals from domestic populations outside Africa can reliably be assigned back to their population of origin, which will help determine the origins of new introductions of Ae. aegypti...|$|R
