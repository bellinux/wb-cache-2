50|$|Starting {{out with}} the {{production}} and distribution of die-casting products, Zama developed into the world’s largest manufacturer of diaphragm carburetors and sells further products nowadays. Zama's first carburetor was produced in 1975, {{and the production of}} oil pumps was initiated in 2003. Further milestones for Zama were the production of their first <b>electronic</b> <b>carburetor</b> in 2009 and the production of their first solenoid valve in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|An even sportier version {{appeared}} in November 1983, when the CT and CT-G Turbo versions were offered. The F5A Turbo was Suzuki's first forced induction car engine and produced [...] and a useful 54 Nm. It received an <b>electronic</b> <b>carburetor</b> {{and a lower}} compression rate of 8,6:1. Only a five-speed manual transmission was available, and front disc brakes were standard. The CT weighed in at 560 kg, prices were ¥748,000 and ¥898,000 respectively. A two-tone red-and-black interior and dummy hood scoop added to the Turbo's sporty looks, while the CT-G also received a rev counter. Top speed has been quoted at 135 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The 2150 {{improved}} on the 2100s design {{through the}} introduction of a variable air bleed system, which keeps the air to fuel mixture better balanced throughout the carburetor's full range of operation. The 2150 models from 1983 to 1986 were <b>electronic</b> feedback <b>carburetors</b> equipped with Ford's EEC-IV.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{use of the}} {{powertrain}} {{control module}} {{dates back to the}} late 1970s - official phasing in of the PCM occurred during the early 1980s when used in conjunction with <b>electronic</b> controlled <b>carburetors</b> and lockup torque converters (at the time conventional 3-speed automatics received lockup converters at the same time overdrives were introduced).|$|R
50|$|Several {{changes were}} made to the 600 in 1985. The 600 sedan was moved to a longer {{wheelbase}} and the former base and ES trims were dropped, replaced by a new SE trim. This was {{due in part to the}} new Lancer, which would have competed directly with the 600 (the 5-speed manual transmission was no longer offered as well, in an attempt to keep competition between the Lancer and 600 to a minimum). The coupe and convertible remained relatively unchanged except for minor trim and interior changes. The only significant advancement was the replacement of the 2.2 L engine's two-barrel Holley <b>electronic</b> feedback <b>carburetor</b> by an <b>electronic</b> throttle-body fuel injection system.|$|R
5000|$|The Custom Cruiser was restyled in 1980 with a {{lower front}} fascia. The doors and window {{mechanisms}} were also redesigned to be lighter. The woodgrained side panels on models so equipped no longer followed the curves of the wheel wells like the 1977-1979 versions, but were positioned higher on the body sides to give a straighter, sleeker look similar to the first generation. 1980 saw the last restyling of the second generation Custom Cruisers.Minor mechanical changes were made between 1980 and 1990. The new E4ME <b>electronic</b> <b>carburetor</b> which used GM's CCC (Computer Command Control) system was introduced in 1980 for models sold in California. In 1981, all Custom Cruisers used the E4ME with the CCC system, although Canadian emission cars continued to use the mechanical M4ME carburetor until 1986. Also new in 1981 was GM's new Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R automatic transmission with overdrive. This transmission was equipped with a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Custom Cruiser could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range. 1985 saw major changes to the 5.0 L (307 CID) V8 engine's cylinder head design. Introduced were new [...] "swirl port" [...] heads, which improved driveability and low-end torque. These new heads also featured very small intake ports, which reduced the higher RPM power and performance significantly. Along with the new heads, roller lifters replaced flat lifters. The 1989 Custom Cruiser was the last edition to have front shoulder belts mounted in the B-pillars; 1990 introduced door-mounted [...] "passive" [...] shoulder belts.|$|E
50|$|With skyrocketing oil and {{gas prices}} (the price {{of oil in the}} US had more than quadrupled) due to the OPEC oil embargo in late 1973, the much smaller, far more {{efficient}} Japanese and European cars (which utilized four-cylinder engines, unibody construction, and, most, front-wheel drive) dramatically increased in popularity. American automakers' attempts at compensating were relatively poorly received, as the offered vehicles (including its homegrown compacts e.g. Chevrolet Nova, Ford Maverick and subcompacts (Pinto, Vega)) were still much heavier and less efficient. This included detuning the powertrain to meet emission standards (from the use of EGR valves, smog air pumps, and the early catalytic converter designs with a restrictive catalyst brick (unlike the modern day variant using a monolithic brick). Detuned engines later gained <b>electronic</b> <b>carburetors</b> (used with an early variant of a powertrain control module which pre-dated OBDII) until the advent of electronic fuel injection by the mid-1980s (first with the musclecar survivors and later extended to full and mid-size automobiles). Additionally, import automakers introduced North America only models that were somewhat larger (though not as large as most American brand models) to appeal to existing preferences - the larger sized imports (usually Asian marques especially the Japanese makes where the larger sized car was subjected to higher vehicle taxation in its own home market - usually a car model which is designed for the North American (USA/Canada) market e.g. a USDM Honda Accord or Nissan Altima) were considered acceptable by North American consumers when mass-market Asian automakers established their transplant assembly plants in the United States, Canada, and Mexico once the 1981 Voluntary Export Restraints was passed by the U.S. Congress.|$|R
5000|$|VIN [...] "9" [...] Broughams were {{actually}} produced in 1987-1990 (and in 1986 as well), and, although rare, {{can be found}} as [...] "commercial chassis" [...] vehicles, and generally have a higher output Oldsmobile 307 LG8 Engine and different transmissions (typically the TH400 three speed), depending on the use. Generally speaking, minor differences between 1987 and 1988 (VIN 9 and Y) can be found, such as carburetor assembly. While these cars all used Rochester Quadrajet <b>Electronic</b> four-barrel <b>carburetors,</b> differences include an electronic (Detroit) versus vacuum (Arlington) Idle Load Compensator, {{as well as an}} electronic (Detroit) versus climactic (Arlington) choke system. The vin [...] "9" [...] engine is the high output version of the base LV2 307 vin code Y and shares most parts with it. The HO engine is the same engine that was used in the rear wheel drive Oldsmobile 442. While the engine was not powerful, it proved to be a reliable engine with proven (albeit dated) technology.|$|R
50|$|Changing weather {{conditions}} may also affect a car's handling. In a long race, {{it is sometimes}} advantageous to prepare a car to handle well {{at the end of}} an event while surrendering the advantage of speed at the start. Without <b>electronic</b> controls, the <b>carburetor</b> must be tuned manually according to the expected air temperature and barometric pressure. Rain forces a race to be halted immediately because there is no current provision for rain tires. While rain tires were developed for the series in the late 1990s, NASCAR abandoned them because there were not enough road courses on the schedule to justify the cost of making more tires to replace them as they aged. Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series cars have used these tires in practice sessions, but only the Xfinity Series has used them under actual race conditions. There was, however, one case of a NASCAR Cup Series race being held in the rain. In 1956 a race at Road America was held in rain; Tim Flock won the race.|$|R
5000|$|Changes for 1982 {{included}} a revised hood ornament (changed from a Plymouth logo to a Chrysler Pentastar), roll-down rear door windows vs. the former stationary glass with rear quarter pop-outs, a counterbalanced hood, a Pentastar trunk medallion, and black painted valve cover on the 2.2L engine (vs. the former blue). Changes for 1983 {{were limited to}} a blacked out grille. In 1984, the hood ornament was removed and the Chrysler Pentastar moved to the grille; the Mercedes Benz-styled grille used on the Reliant was modified. Also, the tail lights received chrome trim, and the interior received a padded dash and new black instrument cluster with round gauges. For 1985, the Reliant and Aries received a substantial restyle, with new, rounder front and rear fascias. This included new head & tail lights and a new grille {{that was the same}} height as the headlights (rather than going {{all the way up to}} the hood as with previous model years). The base engine was a transverse mounted Chrysler designed 2.2 L (135 cid) inline-four engine with an <b>electronic</b> two-barrel <b>carburetor</b> (later replaced by a fuel injection system in 1986), rated at [...] Transaxles were a 4-speed floor shift manual or a 3-speed automatic with either a floor or column shift. A Mitsubishi motor was optional (automatic transmission was required with that engine), and cars so equipped for 1981 were badged as 2.6 HEMI. Reliants and Aries equipped with this engine accelerated 0-60 mph in the 13-second range. The Mitsubishi 2.6 L G54B engine was a popular option, but driveability and reliability problems led to the Mitsubishi engine being replaced by a fuel-injected Chrysler 2.5 L I4 for 1986 (just like the 2.6, automatic transmission was mandatory for the 2.5). For 1987, the coupe's fixed rear windows got a small pivoting vent at the trailing edge of the rear doors. Also for 1987, the base model was renamed America in the U.S (this was later done to the base models of the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance). After 1987, only minimal changes were made through the end of the production run.|$|R
2500|$|The 1975 American ECD came {{standard}} with a 170 gross hp [...] inline six engine with a single-barrel Carter <b>carburetor,</b> <b>electronic</b> ignition, 266 degree camshaft, and 7.6:1 {{compression ratio}} with regular cooling system. Included were manual front disk brakes with rear drums, power steering, {{heavy duty suspension}} with front sway bar, Chrysler TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, and 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The exterior of the model incorporated a full vinyl roof with bright moldings, regular bright molding package (wheel lip, rocker panels, drip rails, and between taillights molding), luxury wheel covers, [...] "American" [...] and [...] "Automático" [...] emblems on the rear panel, [...] "258" [...] emblems on rear quarter panels, and golden [...] "ECD" [...] emblems over {{the base of the}} C-pillars. Standard equipment also consisted of front and rear bench seats, front two-point seatbelts, front and rear armrests, luxury upholstery, custom steering wheel, column-mounted shifter, color-keyed padded dashboard, gasoline and water temperature gauges, warning lights (brakes, oil and electrical system), 200km/h speedometer, vacuum gauge, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, heater with front defroster, AM monoaural radio with a single speaker and antenna, locking glove box, parcel sheft, courtesy lights, padded sun visors, day/night rearview mirror, heat and sound insulating cardboard-type headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, rear ashtray mounted on the front seat back and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included among others a passenger's side mirror, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, power brakes, bumper guards, tinted windshield, and light group.|$|R
