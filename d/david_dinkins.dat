5|$|Sotomayor was {{appointed}} by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 {{as one of the}} founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years. There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure. Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, <b>David</b> <b>Dinkins,</b> and Rudy Giuliani.|$|E

25|$|In January 2006, Spitzer {{selected}} New York State Senate {{minority leader}} David Paterson as his choice for lieutenant governor and running mate.

25|$|Homelessness {{became a}} serious problem during the 1980s, {{specifically}} {{in the last two}} of Edward Koch's three terms as mayor (1978–1990). The city outlawed discrimination against gay and lesbian people in such matters as employment and housing in 1986. In 1989, Koch was defeated by <b>David</b> <b>Dinkins</b> in the Democratic Party primary in his bid for a fourth term, and then Dinkins narrowly defeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani in the general election to become the city's first-ever black mayor. Crime began a 15-year decline in 1990 during Dinkins's administration, but a combination of continued racial strife (such as that in the Crown Heights Riot in 1991), and an extremely weak economy (in January 1993 the city's unemployment rate reached 13.4 percent, the highest level of joblessness seen there since the Great Depression) caused Dinkins' popularity to seriously decline (including a threat by residents of Staten Island to secede from the city, where in a 1993 referendum, 65% voted to secede, but implementation was blocked in the State Assembly).|$|E
25|$|During Giuliani's administration, {{crime rates}} dropped in New York City. The {{extent to which}} Giuliani deserves the credit is disputed. Crime rates in New York City had started to drop in 1991 under {{previous}} mayor <b>David</b> <b>Dinkins,</b> three years before Giuliani took office. The rates of most crimes, including all categories of violent crime, made consecutive declines during the last 36 months of Dinkins's four-year term, ending a 30-year upward spiral. A small nationwide drop in crime preceded Giuliani's election, and some critics say {{that he may have}} been the beneficiary of a trend already in progress. Additional contributing factors to the overall decline in New York City crime during the 1990s were the addition of 7,000 officers to the NYPD, lobbied for and hired by the Dinkins administration, and an overall improvement in the national economy. Changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions, which were similar across the country during this time. Because the crime index is based on that of the FBI, which is self-reported by police departments, some have alleged that crimes were shifted into categories that the FBI doesn't collect.|$|E
50|$|Rivera's parents {{moved from}} Puerto Rico to New York City, {{where he was}} born, in the early 1930s. There Rivera {{received}} his primary and secondary education.

50|$|The Mollen Commission is {{formally}} {{known as}} The City of New York Commission to Investigate Allegations of Police Corruption and the Anti-Corruption Procedures of the Police Department.

Mollen's mandate was to examine and investigate “the {{nature and extent of}} corruption in the Department; evaluate the departments procedures for preventing and detecting that corruption; and recommend changes and improvements to those procedures”.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Velella asked Tosi {{to manage}} the {{campaign}} of cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, who sought the Republican primary for mayor against Rudy Giuliani. Lauder's candidacy was engineered by U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who was determined to damage Giuliani's candidacy. D'Amato recruited Velella and newly elected Republican State Senator Serphin Maltese of Queens in his campaign against Giuliani. Lauder spent about $13 million in negative television ads against Giuliani. Although Lauder lost the primary, getting about 34 percent of the vote, he damaged Giuliani's image enough {{in the general election}} in which he lost to Democrat <b>David</b> N. <b>Dinkins.</b>|$|R
