40|$|We study {{mutual fund}} mergers between 1999 and 2001 to {{understand}} the role and effectiveness of fund boards.

This effect is most pronounced when all of the fund's directors are independent, not the 75 % level of independence required by the SEC. Higher-paid target fund boards are less likely to approve across-family mergers that cause substantial reductions in their compensation...|$|R
