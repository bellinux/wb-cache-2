In other words, careers with a majority of female employees tend to pay less than careers that employ a majority of males. This is different from <b>direct</b> <b>wage</b> discrimination within occupations, as males in the female dominated professions will also make lower than average wages and the women in the male dominated occupations usually make higher than average wages.

In 1960, the dissimilarity index for the United States was measured at 62. It has dropped since then, but at 47 in 2000, is still one of the highest of any developed nation.|$|E

50|$|Child support {{programs}} work with district or state attorneys, {{law enforcement agencies}} and officials of family or domestic relations courts to deliver services at the local level. OCSE is the U.S. central authority for international child support and provides assistance to families, states, and countries seeking support when family members live in different countries. OCSE works with many public and private partners to increase child support collections and help parents meet the financial needs of their children. Employers are vital to the child support program. The majority of child support (70%) is collected through <b>direct</b> <b>wage</b> withholding. Employers are responsible to report newly hired and terminated employees, withhold child support payments as ordered, enroll children in health care coverage, and remit child support to the State Disbursement Units. A critical function of OCSE is authorized data matching. Employers are required to report newly hired employees to their designated state agency. OCSE gathers and maintains these records to match against state child support records to locate parents who owe child support, locate income sources and prevent erroneous payments and fraudulent access to government benefit programs. At the state level, ORS has contracts to receive local information from the Department of Workforce Services, Utah Criminal Justice Information Systems, and many other city, county, state, and federal resources. Although ORS is able to utilize the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (UAPA) process to establish most paternity and child support orders administratively, they also work closely with staff assigned to them from the state Office of the Attorney General (AG). The Attorneys from the AG office represent ORS in court and whenever legal representation is required.|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} effects of workers' {{compensation}} on fatality rates and wages using the 1982 Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the new occupational fatality data issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The fatality rate depends upon the workers' compensation benefit variables {{in a manner that}} suggest that the safety incentive effects of higher insurance premiums offset any moral hazard effect. The estimates imply that in the absence of workers' compensation, fatality rates would increase by over 20 %. Premium levels substantially overstate the cost of workers' compensation, due primarily to a <b>direct</b> <b>wage</b> offset from higher benefits. An indirect wage offset resulting from the decrease in risk caused by workers' compensation augments the <b>direct</b> <b>wage</b> effects. The indirect offset is relatively small, equalling about 10 % of the total. ...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{decline of}} German {{emigration}} before World War I constitutes a puzzle that traditional explanations (decrease {{in the international}} wage gap, growing industrialization, fall in the fertility or international competition with other migrants) can only partly solve. It therefore seems necessary to go more deeply into the question, in particular by looking into the social legislation implemented by Bismarck during the 1880 s. Actually, the German insurance system {{was one of the}} most developed in the pre- 1914 world and it probably contributed to deterring labor outflows. The main explanation is that candidates for migration consider not only the gap between <b>direct</b> <b>wages</b> in sending and receiving countries, but also the differential in “indirect wages”, that is, social benefits. As a matter of fact, the existence of such benefits constitutes a form of social remuneration that partly offsets low levels of wage rates in sending countries.

In addition, film expenditures generated $ 28. 4 million in additional state-wide expenditures through the multiplier effect.

Based on audit work performed by the SCO, we determined the County's ICRPs are presented in accordance with Title 2 CFR, Part 225. The approved indirect cost rates are 42. 43 percent and 59. 86 percent of total <b>direct</b> salaries and <b>wages</b> plus fringe benefits for FY 2011 / 2012 and FY 2012 / 2013, respectively.

Since the audited indirect cost rates are lower than the previously accepted rates, the County is required to reconcile all prior reimbursement claims using the lower audited rates. Any resulting overpayment should be repaid to Caltrans within 30 days or by the next billing cycle, whichever occurs first. The SCO auditors excluded unallocable fleet service and legal counsel charges totaling $ 653, 383 and $ 712, 956 for FY 2011 / 2012 and FY 2012 / 2013, respectively. In addition, the audit determined that the indirect costs were overstated because the county included unallowable contingency settlement charges of $ 44, 358 in FY 2011 / 2012 and $ 45, 797 in FY 2012 / 2013.

40|$|Because of {{endogeneity}} problems {{very few}} studies have been able to identify the incidence of corporate taxes on wages. We circumvent these problems by using an 11 -year panel of data on 11, 441 German municipalities' tax rates, 8 percent of which change each year, linked to administrative matched employer-employee data. Consistent with our theoretical model, we find a negative effect of corporate taxation on wages: a 1 euro increase in tax liabilities yields a 77 cent decrease in the wage bill. The <b>direct</b> <b>wage</b> effect, arising in a collective bargaining context, dominates, while the conventional indirect wage effect through reduced investment is empirically small due to regional labor mobility.

Therefore, there are tremendous pressures to privatize the public services and the systems of Social Welfare, which are now regarded as sectors of potential profit. The great international financial institutions are urging the developed countries and are forcing the under-developed ones to reform their Health and Pension systems in order to achieve a partial or total liberalization/privatization. These reforms are said to be undertaken to preserve the financial balance of the Health insurance funds and the state sponsored redistribution pension scheme which are supposedly threatened by demographic evolution, whereas private systems would be safe from this threat.
