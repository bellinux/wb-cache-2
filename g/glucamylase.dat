40|$|Glycogen {{has been}} {{extracted}} from human fetal livers {{ranging in age}} from 13 to 26 weeks. The average chain lengths have been determined by a-amylolysis and periodate oxidation and the average exterior chain lengths by B-amylolysis. The structures of liver glycogens from baboon, mouse, rabbit and several mature humans have also been determined. The absorption spectra of someglycogen-iodine complexes have been recorded and also glycogen values have been determined by the reaction with concanavalin A. The development of glycogen in the human fetal liver is discussed in relation to other mammalian species. The activities of the enzymes glucose- 6 -phosphatase (D-glucose- 6 -phosphate phosphohydrolase), phosphoglucomutase (D-glucose- 1, 6 -diphosphate: D-glucose-l-phosphate phosphotransferase), and phosphoglucoisomerase (D-glucose- 6 -phosphate ketol isomerase) in the human fetus have been studied. The liver glycogens from four cases of suspected glycogen storage disease have been isolated and the structures determined as previously described. An electrophoretic and chromatographic study has been made of sugars in the urine of another case, where the patient lacked several intestinal enzymes. The action of <b>glucamylase</b> and a commercial amyloglucosidase preparation ("Diazyme") on glycogen has been examined. The <b>glucamylase</b> and B -amylase limit dextrins of glycogen have been isolated and their average chain lengths determined. <p...|$|E
40|$|Neurospora crassa mutants {{resistant}} to 2 -deoxyglucose have been isolated, and their mutations have been mapped to four genetic loci. The mutants have the following characteristics: (i) they are {{resistant to}} sorbose {{as well as to}} 2 -deoxyglucose; (ii) they are partially or completely constitutive for glucose transport system II, <b>glucamylase,</b> and invertase, which are usually repressed during growth on glucose; and (iii) they synthesize an invertase with abnormal thermostability and immunological properties, suggesting altered posttranslational modification. All of these characteristics could arise from defects in the regulation of carbon metabolism. In addition, mutants with mutations at three of the loci lack glucose transport system I, which is normally synthesized constitutively by wild-type N. crassa. Although the basis for this change is not yet clear, the mutants provide a way of studying the high-affinity system II uncomplicated by the presence of the low-affinity system I...|$|E
40|$|During meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {{polysaccharide}} glycogen {{is first}} synthesized and then degraded {{during the period}} of spore maturation. We have detected, in sporulating yeast strains, an enzyme activity which is responsible for the glycogen catabolism. The activity was absent in vegetative cells, appeared coincidently with the beginning of glycogenolysis and the appearance of mature ascospores, and increased progressively until spourlation was complete. The specific activity of glycogenolytic enzymes in the intact ascus was about threefold higher than in isolated spores. The glycogenolysis was not due to combinations of phosphorylase plus phosphatase or amylase plus maltase. Nonsporulating cells exhibited litle or no glycogen catabolism and contained only traces of glycogenolytic enzyme, suggesting that the activity is sporulation specific. The partially purified enzyme preparation degraded amylose and glycogen, releasing glucose as the only low-molecular-weight product. Maltotriose was rapidly hydrolyzed; maltose was less susceptible. Alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, isomaltose, and linear alpha- 1, 6 -linked dextran were not attacked. However, the enzyme hydrolyzed alpha- 1, 6 -glucosyl-Schardinger dextrin and increased the beta-amylolysis of beta-amylase-limit dextrin. Thus, the preparation contains alpha- 1, 4 - and alpha- 1, 6 -glucosidase activities. Sephadex G- 150 chromatography partially resolved the enzyme into two activities, one of which may be a <b>glucamylase</b> and the other a debranching enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Several human glycogens {{have been}} {{analysed}} by enzymic methods and {{shown to have}} normal structures. The highly branched structure of rabbit liver glycogen has been verified by stepwise degradation using pullulanase and B-amylase. The actions of pullulanase on the B-amylase and <b>glucamylase</b> limit dextrins of glycogen were also investigated. Iodine complexes formed with rabbit liver glycogen are affected by low molecular weight aliphatic alcohols and by urea. The reaction of the former reagents is important {{in relation to the}} purification of glycogens by alcohol precipitation. Some attempt has been made to explain the reaction of urea on the basis of competitive hydrogen bonding. "Extractable" glycogen was isolated from rat liver by extraction with dilute trichloracetic acid solution. The remaining "residual" glycogen was partially released by proteolytic digestion with Pronase, and isolated by gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G- 75. The structures of these two glycogens were found to be similar. The ratio of "extractable" to "residual" glycogen was determined in fetal and adult rat and human liver tissues. The "residual" glycogen content of the developing liver appears to befairly constant but the "extractable" glycogen in the rat, at least, rises to a maximum at term and then falls. These results are discussed on the basis that "residual" glycogen is an artifact and that the level in the liver is governed by the molecular weight of the glycogen and the protein content. The development of the activities of glycogen synthetase (UDPG: 1, 4 -glucan a- 4 -glucosyltransferase), phosphorylase (a- 1, 4 -glucan: orthophosphate glucosyl-transferase), phosphoglucomutase (D-glucose- 1, 6 -diphosphate: D-glucose- 1 -phosphate phosphotransferase) and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (D-glucose- 6 -phosphate phosphohydrolase) were examined in fetal and adult human livers, and the activities of these enzymes together with those of a-amylase (a- 1, 4 -glucan 4 -glucanohydrolase) and "acid maltase" (a-D-glucoside glucohydrolase) were also measured in fetal and neonatal rat livers. The results were analysed with reference to glycogen storage on the liver. Glycogen and enzyme analyses have been carried out on the tissues of four suspected cases of glycogen storage disease. <p...|$|E
