5|$|This {{alliance}} probably forced Bolesław the Pious {{to reconsider}} his threatment of his nephew and finally granted him the Duchy of Poznań in 1273. Przemysł II, in exchange, not only interrupted {{for a time}} his cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, but decided to support his uncle in the expedition against Władysław of Opole (ally of King Ottokar II and Henryk IV Probus), {{in retaliation for the}} attempts of the Opole ruler to overthrow the government of Bolesław V the Chaste in Lesser Poland {{during the first half of}} 1273.

The study deals with simulations work and creation of models range from mesh and boundary effect, effect of complex geometry and layer soil, effect of geo-grid, effect of water table and effect of surcharge loads. Generally, the purpose of this research is to learn and assess this FLAC/Slope software regarding to its user-friendliness and reliability. The results regarding to these issues will be obtained via analyzing 5 models by using the range of models mention above. This would in turn use to compare with on-the-shelf reference such as from literature review, and several texts. If the value for the factor of safety is close to the value for the factor of safety in these references, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>conclude</b> that its given result is reliable.

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|There {{were rumors}} that Joseph McClure, the Chief Justice who had sworn him into office, {{intended}} to have Baxter either arrested or killed, ostensibly because Baxter had replaced W. W. Wilshire, a Minstrel, with Robert C. Newton, an ex-Confederate, {{as head of}} the state militia. U.S. Attorney General Williams contacted Baxter and suggested that he ask for federal troops for protection again. A letter from President Grant followed, offering protection. The Grant administration usually followed Powell Clayton's lead where Arkansas matters were concerned, so <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that the former governor was still supporting Baxter. The Republican Party of Arkansas, still controlled by the Minstrel faction, issued a statement denouncing Brooks' attempt to contest the election, which was published in the Little Rock Republican on October 8, 1873 and signed by all the major members of the party, including Clayton. However, the Minstrels would soon turn on Baxter for not following the party line.|$|E

25|$|The {{mutations}} {{found in}} EEC are missense mutations, meaning {{that there is}} a single amino acid change in the protein, as opposed to premature termination of protein synthesis, known as a nonsense mutation. The frameshift mutation introduces a premature stop codon that affected the α isotope, but does not affect the β and γ isotopes of p63. From this, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that mutant p63α isotopes seem {{to play a major role}} in the pathogenesis of EEC syndrome. Interestingly, it seems that p63α is the predominant p63 isotope in epithelial basal cell layers, which are the cell type often associated with the anomalies found in patients with EEC syndrome.|$|E
25|$|TMRCA {{calculations}} {{are considered}} critical evidence {{when attempting to}} determine migration dates of various populations as they spread around the world. For example, if a mutation is deemed to have occurred 30,000 years ago, then this mutation should be found amongst all populations that diverged after this date. If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread and formation of regionally isolated populations then this must {{be reflected in the}} isolation of subsequent genetic mutations in this region. If genetic divergence and regional divergence coincide <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that the observed divergence is due to migration as evidenced by the archaeological record. However, if the date of genetic divergence occurs at a different time than the archaeological record, then scientists will have to look at alternate archaeological evidence to explain the genetic divergence. The issue is best illustrated in the debate surrounding the demic diffusion versus cultural diffusion during the European Neolithic.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the most}} {{controversial}} area of reform was that of religion. The policy of state secularism ("active neutrality") met with opposition {{at the time and}} it continues to generate a considerable degree of social and political tension. However, any political movement that attempts to harness religious sentiment at the expense of Turkish secularism is likely to face the opposition of the armed forces, which has always regarded itself as the principal and most faithful guardian of secularism. Some assert that a historical example is the case of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, who was overthrown by the military in 1960. He and two of his Ministers were hanged by the Military Tribunal. However, their charges were not for being anti-secular. Although Menderes did relax some restrictions on religion he also banned the millet party which was avowedly Islamist. Further, the charges at the Military Tribunal did not involve antisecular activities and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that Menderes was overall in favour of the secular system.|$|E

25|$|Information {{about the}} course and {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Kosovo is {{incomplete}} in the historical sources. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that, tactically, the battle was a draw. However, the mutual heavy losses were devastating only for the Serbs, who had brought to Kosovo almost all of their fighting strength. Although Serbia under Prince Lazar was an economically prosperous and militarily well organized state, it could not compare to the Ottoman Empire with respect to the size of territory, population, and economic power. Lazar was succeeded by his eldest son Stefan Lazarević. As he was still a minor, Moravian Serbia was administered by Stefan's mother, Milica. She was attacked from north, five months after the battle, by troops of the Hungarian King Sigismund. When Turkish forces, moving toward Hungary, reached the borders of Moravian Serbia in the summer of 1390, Milica accepted Ottoman suzerainty. She sent her youngest daughter, Olivera, to join the harem of Sultan BayezidI. Vuk Branković became an Ottoman vassal in 1392. Now all the Serbian lands were under Ottoman suzerainty, except Zahumlje under King Tvrtko.|$|E

500|$|Since the {{aircraft}} {{did not respond}} to a ping at 09:15, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>concluded</b> that at some point between 08:19 and 09:15, {{the aircraft}} lost the ability to communicate with the ground station. The log-on message sent from the aircraft at 08:19:29 was [...] "log-on request". There are only a few reasons the SDU would transmit a log-on request, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to the aircraft's [...] Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that it was sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours, so fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, which would eliminate power to the SDU, the aircraft's ram air turbine (RAT) would deploy, providing power to some instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake—also a log-on request—communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake, but none were received, supporting the fuel-exhaustion scenario.|$|E
