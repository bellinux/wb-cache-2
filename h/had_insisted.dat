5|$|By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River {{against the advice of}} his officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{the title}} {{was used for the}} tenth film in the Eon Productions series. It was the third to star Roger Moore as British Secret Service agent Commander James Bond. Although Fleming <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> that no film should contain {{anything}} of the plot of the novel, the steel-toothed character of Horror was included, although under the name Jaws.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 2006, CNN {{reported}} that Barney, a Doberman Pinscher {{employed as a}} security dog at Wookey Hole, had destroyed parts of a valuable collection of teddy bears, including one which had belonged to Elvis Presley, which {{was estimated to be}} worth £40,000 (US$75,000). The insurance company insuring the exhibition of stuffed animals <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> on having guard dog protection.|$|E

5|$|Rutherford {{took over}} a {{struggling}} institution and rebuilt it {{into one of the}} most prestigious schools for young women in Georgia. She immediately went to work improving its academic standards, beautifying the physical plant, and increasing enrollment. In agreeing to head the school, Rutherford <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> that the all-male board of directors cede to her its control of the budget and power to hire and fire staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} not commercially acclaimed, which {{came as a}} {{surprise}} to Sire since they <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> the band record with Gouldman in an effort to increase fan-base; it peaked at number fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and only charted outside of the US in Sweden. The album was not critically acclaimed either, as it received several mixed articles by reviewers, who insisted the album to be less playable than their first four albums.|$|E
5|$|The next court {{session was}} on July 1. At this session, Satoshi Kawamitsu, an {{attorney}} for the employment agency that V. N. worked for, testified that he had tried to arrange a jidan settlement between Brown and V. N. in December 2002, but V. N. <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> on pressing charges. He stated that he informed her that once the charges were filed, she {{would not be able to}} withdraw them until the trial began.|$|E
50|$|Both sides blame {{each other}} for the {{stalling}} of the referendum. The Polisario <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> on only allowing those found on the 1974 Spanish Census lists (see below) to vote, while Morocco <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that the census was flawed by evasion and sought the inclusion of members of Sahrawi tribes which escaped from Spanish invasion to the north of Morocco by the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The group members, however, <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> {{that the}} song is in large parts {{nonsensical}} rather than satanical.|$|R

5|$|The next {{trial hearing}} {{took place on}} June 4. At the hearing, Takaesu stated that Brown had {{arranged}} with the Camp Courtney officers' club manager {{to have sex with}} V. N., but that V. N. resisted Brown's advances after driving him to the secluded road off base. The Naha prosecutor said during the hearing that V. N. <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> on pressing charges.|$|E
5|$|Following Bowie's death, fans {{gathered}} at impromptu street shrines. At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, south London, which shows {{him in his}} Aladdin Sane character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> {{that he did not}} want a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg reluctantly {{agreed to}} appoint Hitler as {{chancellor}} after two further parliamentary elections—in July and November 1932—had not {{resulted in the}} formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia. Hitler <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.|$|E
50|$|Religious orders {{such as the}} Benedictines <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> on this {{as one of the}} {{essential}} rules of their institutes.|$|R

5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> that the technology aboard the Enterprise be grounded in established science and scientific theories. The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus... was {{the most}} eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the {{atmosphere}} in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking.... Toward {{the end of his}} life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Naturæ he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> upon in his earlier works.... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 2003 {{he signed}} a one-year, $1.73 million {{contract}} with the Indians {{in order for the}} Indians to avoid salary arbitration with him. During spring training, he was banned from the Indians' training camp after not running out a popup a game earlier. On April 3, 2004, he was traded to the Dodgers for Franklin Gutiérrez and a player to be named later (Andrew Brown); the Akron Beacon Journal later reported that manager Eric Wedge <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> that Bradley be traded.|$|E
60|$|And then, {{when it was}} too late, {{he began}} to blame himself for not <b>having</b> <b>insisted</b> on staying behind as George proposed.|$|R

5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
5|$|Aristodemus: The lone Spartan {{survivor}} of the slaughter of the 300 at the Battle of Thermopylae had, with a fellow Spartiate, been dismissed from the army by Leonidas I because of an eye infection. However, his colleague <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> on being led into battle, partially blind, by a helot. Preferring to return to Sparta, Aristodemus was branded a coward and suffered a year of reproach before Plataea. Anxious to redeem his name, he charged the Persian lines by himself, killing in a savage fury before being cut down. Although the Spartans agreed that he had redeemed himself, they awarded him no special honour, because he failed {{to fight in the}} disciplined manner expected of a Spartan.|$|E

5|$|In June 1988 the {{producer}} Tim Taylor invited Aston {{to work on}} a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called Time Signs, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries in the Landscape but his publisher, Batsford, <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> on the shorter title.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> {{on writing}} the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, {{who had no}} familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E
5|$|Sarah and Queen Anne {{never made}} up their differences, {{although}} one eyewitness claimed to have heard Anne asking whether the Marlboroughs had reached the shore, leading to rumours that she had called them home herself. Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714 at Kensington Palace; the Protestant Whig Privy Councillors <b>had</b> <b>insisted</b> on their right to be present, preventing Henry St. John, the first Viscount Bolingbroke from declaring for the Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart. The Marlboroughs returned home {{on the afternoon of}} Anne's death. The Act of Settlement of 1701 ensured a Protestant succession by passing over more than fifty stronger Roman Catholic claimants and proclaiming Georg Ludwig, Elector of Hanover (the great grandson of James I through Georg's mother Sophia of Hanover), King George I of Great Britain.|$|E
