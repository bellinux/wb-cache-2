5|$|Jewell's {{first order}} as Secretary, issued in October 2013, {{established}} {{a process for}} the Department of the Interior to offset large development projects with conservation efforts. The effort was an extension of existing programs that use fees for offshore drilling permits to expand or build parks. At the same time, Jewell publicly pledged to work with President Obama to preserve mountains and rivers, with or without Congressional action. Existing laws, such as the 1906 Antiquities Act, <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> broad authority to preserve land, a power Jewell indicated she and the President were prepared to use {{as part of a}} balanced approach between development and conservation.|$|E

The X-Men <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Wolverine remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before 8:20 pm {{local time}} (18:20UTC), the presidential jet circled once around Kigali International Airport before {{coming in for}} final {{approach}} in clear skies.

25|$|On January 13 the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP), by a {{count of}} 154-to-2, voted to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> the power to declare martial law to restore order. Yet on the same day, 9 people were {{reported}} killed in fighting in Biyo-Adde in central Somalia. Prime Minister Gedi first stated that martial law would be declared on December 29, 2006; parliament's vote vested the government with the proper legal authority.|$|E

25|$|The steel industry's brief focused {{instead on}} the lack of {{statutory}} authority for this seizure, emphasizing Congress' decision when enacting the Taft–Hartley Act to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> the power to seek an injunction against strikes that might affect the national economy instead. It denied that the President had any power to seize private property without express legislative authorization, noting that Truman himself had asked for such legislative authority when the United Mine Workers of America went out on strike in 1950.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} calls by some, such as former German {{interior}} minister and current {{minister of finance}} Wolfgang Schäuble, for direct elections to take place to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> a mandate, this would strengthen the post within the European Council allowing for stronger leadership in addition to addressing the question of democratic legitimacy in the EU. However, this might cause conflict with Parliament's democratic mandate or a potential mandate for the Commission (see section below). To give a mandate to the European Council's president would signify a development of the Union's governance towards a presidential system, rather than a parliamentary system.|$|E
25|$|On {{that same}} day, Joshua Bolten, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave {{a press conference}} on the president’s line-item veto proposal. Bolten {{explained}} that the proposed Act would <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> the ability to single out “wasteful” spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.|$|E

25|$|The {{governments of}} Iceland {{have always been}} {{coalition}} governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed {{by the office of}} the president is disputed by legal scholars, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently. In 1980, Icelanders elected Vigdís Finnbogadóttir as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state. She retired from office in 1996. In 2009, Iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir became prime minister.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, three younger {{members of}} the CPP were brought up on charges of {{taking part in a}} plot to blow up Nkrumah's car in a motorcade. The sole {{evidence}} against the alleged plotters was that they rode in cars well behind Nkrumah's car. When the defendants were acquitted, Nkrumah sacked the chief judge of the state security court, then got the CPP-dominated parliament to pass a law allowing a new trial. At this second trial, all three men were convicted and sentenced to death, though these sentences were subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. Shortly afterward, the constitution was amended to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> the power to summarily remove judges at all levels.|$|E
25|$|With Wolman's support, NLB Chairman Wagner {{intervened in}} the strike on March 6. AFL President William Green sought a {{compromise}} under which auto workers {{would be able}} to air their grievances and company unions would be banned but no additional organizing rights would be sought. Wolman, who had long supported company unions, pressed for the retention of these entities as a means of giving workers a voice during the Great Depression without empowering unions (which he felt would overreach themselves and inhibit economic recovery). The strike deadline passed without any action as talks continued. For a time the talks seemed to be making progress, but when the automakers refused to deal with the NLB President Roosevelt intervened personally in the negotiations. The strike was postponed to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> time to broker a deal. Relying heavily on Wolman's advice, Roosevelt negotiated a deal on March 23, but the deal collapsed and negotiations resumed. At Wolman's suggestion, Roosevelt agreed on March 25 to establish an Automobile Labor Board which endorsed Johnson's reinterpretation of the auto industry code of February 1934 and would hear grievances and cases of discrimination against workers.|$|E

500|$|Hanna {{was called}} upon to do only small amounts of {{fundraising}} this time: [...] no great educational campaign was required, and the corporations were willing to <b>give.</b> <b>The</b> <b>President</b> gave only one speech, the formal acceptance of his nomination in Canton in July. [...] Roosevelt, on the other hand, traveled widely across the nation giving speeches. [...] The New Yorker traveled [...] in the campaign, reaching 24 of the 45states. [...] Hanna was now a public figure, and wanted to campaign for the Republicans in the western states. [...] McKinley, however, was reluctant, as Hanna had varied from the administration's position on trusts in a recent speech. [...] McKinley sent Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith to Chicago, where Hanna then was, {{to talk him out}} of the trip. [...] Hanna rapidly discerned that Smith had been sent by the President, and told him, [...] "Return to Washington and tell the President that God hates a coward." [...] McKinley and Hanna met in Canton several days later and settled their differences over lunch. [...] Hanna made his speaking tour in the West. [...] According to Hanna biographer Thomas Beer, Hanna's tour was a great success, though many viewers were surprised he did not wear suits decorated with the [...] "dollar mark".|$|E
2500|$|Scholars have differing {{views on}} the president's {{competent}} powers.

[...] "One of the fundamental reasons for the US military's success in reacting to emergencies is its almost limitless supply of contingency funding. US development agencies have no comparable capacity. Congress should <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> a [...] "country-in-transition" [...] fund to finance unforeseen reconstruction or peacekeeping operations... cohesive rapid response unit, a centralized pool of interagency experts on state building—the rule of law, governance, and economic reform—trained {{to work together and}} able to deploy rapidly, unencumbered by bureaucratic inertia, to crisis spots." [...] Language and cultural knowledge gaps alone mean that this cannot be a unilateral US operation.|$|E

He voted for {{replacement}} resolution (H.J Res. 114) in the full Senate to authorize {{the use of military force}} against Iraq, which passed by a vote of 77 to 23, On October 10, 2002, he stated that: [...] He defended his vote on an October 10, 2004, appearance on Meet the Press, saying [...] "I would have voted for the resolution knowing what I know today, because it was the right thing to do to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> the authority to confront Saddam Hussein...I think Saddam Hussein was a very serious threat. I stand by that, and that's why [...] stand behind our vote on the resolution". However, he subsequently changed his mind about the war and apologized for that military authorization vote.
