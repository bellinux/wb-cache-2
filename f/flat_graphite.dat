A plasma reactor equipped with a rotating vacuum chamber and internal glass wings is used to keep the granular materials homogeneously stirred and to modify the surface of both graphite slabs and carbon black granules.

These materials were <b>flat</b> <b>graphite,</b> roughened graphite, Pt-coated titanium, and uncoated titanium. The materials {{were placed in}} four identical MFCs, of which the anode compartments were hydraulically connected in series, {{as well as the}} cathode compartments. The MFCs were operated with four resistors. The anode kinetics at these electrode materialswere studied by means of dc-voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Both techniques were compared and showed that the bio-anode performance decreased in the order roughened graphite > Pt-coated titanium > <b>flat</b> <b>graphite</b> > uncoated titanium. Uncoated titanium was unsuitable as anode material. For the other three materials, specific surface area was not the single variable explaining the differences in current density for the different materials. All polarization curves showed a clear limiting current. This limit could not be attributed to mass transfer of the substrate and reflected the maximum biomass activity. The current density of the non-porous bioanodes, except for the uncoated titanium anode, was comparable to the reported current densities of porous materials when normalized to the projected surface area. The high current densities that were recorded by dc-voltammetry, however, could not be maintained in a stable way for a longer period. This shows that polarization curves of MFCs should be evaluated critically...|$|E

Kluczynski Building, and the single-story Post Office building. The complex’s plot area extends over two blocks; a one-block site, bounded by Jackson, Clark, Adams, and Dearborn streets, contains the Kluczynski Federal Building and U.S. Post Office Loop Station, while a parcel on an adjacent block to the east contains the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. The structural framing of the buildings is formed of high-tensile bolted steel and concrete.

The proof-of-concept fuel cell with a <b>flat</b> catalyst-free <b>graphite</b> electrode can discharge at 3 mW cm⁻² with seawater, and 9 mW cm⁻² with dilute bromine catholytes. The fuel cell can also be recharged with LiBr catholytes efficiently to recover the lithium metal anode. Scanning electron microscopy images reveal that both the organic electrolyte and the bromine electrolyte corrode the solid electrolyte plate quickly, leading to nanoporous pathways that can percolate through the plate, thus limiting the cell performance and lifetime. With improved solid electrolytes or membraneless flow designs, the dual-mode lithium–bromine/oxygen system could enable not only AUV but also land-based electric vehicles, by providing a critical high-power mode to high-energy-density (but otherwise low-power) lithium–air batteries...|$|R

The isosteric heat curve is finite under subcritical conditions, but for supercritical adsorption, it becomes infinite at the pressure where the excess concentration versus pressure is maximum. This can be circumvented using the integral molar enthalpy, which is a better variable to describe the energy change for supercritical adsorption.

We obtain analytical and numerical results for the magnetizations and transition fields for armchair, zig-zag and chiral nanotubes. The zig-zags are exceptional in that one of the plateaus has extensive zero temperature entropy in the classical limit.

40|$|We {{systematically}} {{studied the}} influence of the substrate on the shape, mobility, and stability of deposited gold clusters. The An, clusters were produced in a laser vaporization source and deposited with low kinetic energy (similar to 0. 4 eV/atom) on atomically <b>flat</b> substrates (<b>graphite,</b> mica, and gold and silver films on mica) under UHV conditions. Their size distribution is probed with time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ranges from dimers to several hundreds of atoms. Scanning probe microscopy is used to characterize the deposited clusters and the formation of islands by cluster aggregation. On all substrates, An,, islands can be clearly distinguished and the islands are flattened despite the small impact energy. The shape and size of the island configurations are strongly system dependent. Gold clusters deposited on Au(111) and Ag(111) films grown on mica do not aggregate, but deform due to strong cluster-substrate interactions. The clusters tend to grow epitaxially on these surfaces. On graphite and on mica, deposited clusters do diffuse and aggregate. On the graphite surface, large ramified islands are formed by juxtaposition of small islands and trapping of the clusters at the step edges. On the other hand, the diffusion of the clusters on mica results in a total coalescence of the Au, clusters into compact islands. status: publishe...|$|R

Curling of <b>graphite</b> <b>flat</b> fragments, end-capping of nanotubes, and closure of curved structures are driven by a tremendous increase in Kekule structures as terminal carbon atoms couple their dangling bonds into C-C sigma bonds. The increasing tendency becomes particularly striking for large cages and nanotubes. Resonance among numerous Kekule structures will stabilize the curved structure and dominate formation of closed carbon species. For similar carbon cages with comparable Kekule structure counts in magnitude, the surface curvature of carbon cages, as a measure for the strain energy, also {{plays an important role in}} determining their Most stable forms...|$|R

This work, which is part of an extensive computational study on heterogeneous catalytic systems, is devoted to identify electronic and geometrical changes in which metal clusters and supports are involved upon interaction. Such analysis is helpful in designing new heterogeneous metallic catalysts, namely, new metal-supported carbonaceous catalysts. Calculations reveal a major geometrical distortion occurring in the palladium cluster supported on both graphite and nanotubes, which is caused by strong Pd-C interactions.

Theoretical calculations predicted that CNS were a promising candidate for hydrogen storage as they had a more accessible surface than CNTs [13, 14]. In addition, the CNS possess a tunable interplanar distance by intercalation or doping. It had also been found that CNS were suitable as electrodes for supercapacitors [15] and batteries [16, 17].

Peeling with monolayer resolution is achieved by scanning the NP covered graphite surface in close proximity. In this exfoliation process part of the lifted upper graphene layer is cut from this layer, while the surrounding part relaxes back to the underlying graphite surface. This gives rise to the appearance of spatially varying Moire patterns and to a modified electronic interaction with the underlying graphite, which is probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. NP assisted exfoliation provides a promising route for preparation of (few-layer) graphene under ultra-high vacuum conditions, ideally suited for high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy based experiments.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a simple force-based label-free {{strategy for the}} highly sensitive sensing of adenosine. An adenosine ssDNA aptamer was bound onto an atomic force microscopy (AFM) probe by covalent modification, and the molecular-interface adsorption force between the aptamer and a <b>flat</b> <b>graphite</b> surface was measured by single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS). In the presence of adenosine, the molecular recognition between adenosine and the aptamer resulted {{in the formation of}} a folded, hairpin-like DNA structure and hence caused a variation of the adsorption force at the graphite/water interface. The sensitive force response to molecular recognition provided an adenosine detection limit in the range of 0. 1 to 1 nM. The addition of guanosine, cytidine, and uridine had no significant interference with the sensing of adenosine, indicating a strong selectivity of this sensor architecture. In addition, operational parameters that may affect the sensor, such as loading rate and solution ionic strength, were investigated...|$|E
30|$|We have {{investigated}} the adsorbed CO 2 at 300  K on N-HOPG by XPS, angle-resolved XAS, and IRAS using a model N-HOPG synthesized by a protocol developed in a previous study. The O 1 s binding energy of the adsorbed CO 2 at 300  K, located at 533  eV, showed clear evidence of the Lewis basicity of N-HOPG caused by the nitrogen doped in the graphite system. The polarization dependence of the σ* and π* peaks in the O 1 s XAS spectra, {{as well as the}} absence of expected IRAS signals, clearly indicates that the adsorbed CO 2 lies <b>flat</b> on the <b>graphite</b> surface and that Lewis base sites are induced by the incorporation of nitrogen in HOPG. We discussed possible CO 2 adsorption sites induced by pyridinic N and valley N species. The activity of these species as adsorption sites indicates the potential to fine-tune the Lewis basicity of a graphite substrate by controlling the prevalence of nitrogen species focused on the appropriate interaction strength of CO 2, which can be directly estimated by the O 1 s binding energy of the adsorbed CO 2. The properties of fine-tuned Lewis basicity in carbon-based materials {{can be applied to the}} field of catalysis, including the use of the materials as oxygen reduction reaction or hydrogen evolution reaction sites.|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have gained}} great attention {{due to their}} excellent mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays attached to solid substrates resemble a nano-carpet and have potentials {{in a variety of}} devices. In this study, the focus is to investigate the surface modification approaches of CNT carpets on <b>flat</b> (compressed) <b>graphite.</b> Wettability, or permeation of a liquid such as water into the CNT strands, may play very significant roles in many applications where a CNT-coated device may be used in aqueous environment. Short-term microwave plasma treatments were used in this project to functionalize CNT carpets for wettability. Hydrophilic/ hydrophobic behavior, measured by the contact angle of water, could be well tuned by controlling the exposure time. A simple method to reverse the changes caused by plasma is to anneal in air at a temperature of 110 °C. The CNT carpets could be cycled between hydrophobic and hydrophilic by repeated treatments of plasma and air annealing. The extent and ease of cycling depended on the morphology of the CNT carpets. We investigated the influence of surface nanostructure, morphology and surface chemistry on wettability. Nanostructure and morphology of CNT arrays was studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The chemical composition of the surface was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Pure CNT carpets are superhydrophobic (contact angle 3 ̆e 160 °) {{as long as they are}} well aligned and do not contain covalently bonded oxygen groups. Superhydrophobicity may be lost, or contact angle decreased, if either alignment of CNTs is disturbed or covalent oxygen-containing groups bind to its surface. Young 2 ̆ 7 s, Wenzel 2 ̆ 7 s and Cassie-Baxter regimes are three models of contact angle that are used to explain these observations. The wetting state and contact angle of hydrophobic CNT arrays were compared with the values predicted by Cassie-Baxter equation on pristine CNT carpets. The morphological parameter was obtained by measuring multiscale dimensions of CNT carpets from SEM images. The chemical parameter represented by inherent contact angle was obtained by measuring contact angle on the graphitic materials, and reviewing the literature values reported on graphite and graphene surfaces. As an example of how wettability may influence an engineering property such as water flow, CNT arrays were synthesized on carbon fiber cloth. The flow of water through this porous fabric was tested. It was seen that water flow was enhanced by CNT attachment, which may be attributed to drag reduction on super-hydrophobic surface. However, making the CNT carpets fully hydrophilic through plasma treatment seemed to further increase overall water flow rates, which may raise the possibility of capillary transport through hydrophilic nano-carpet. These effects need to be investigated more carefully in future for better understanding...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} monolayers of alkyl amides adsorbed on a {{graphite}} surface {{have been successfully}} identified and investigated {{using a combination of}} synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Exceptionally stable solid layers have been observed at temperatures well above the bulk melting point, at both high multilayer coverages and, very unusually, at sub-monolayer coverages. The molecular structure of the two-dimensional crystals of these alkyl amides has been obtained from diffraction and interpreted in terms of the subtle intermolecular interactions, particularly the contribution of hydrogen bonding in monolayer assembly. Thermodynamic information provides insight on the mixing behaviour in adsorbed amide layers. A systematic study on the variation in monolayer crystal structures with alkyl chain length (between five and sixteen carbon atoms) of saturated alkyl amides using diffraction identifies that all the amide molecules investigated lie <b>flat</b> on the <b>graphite</b> surface. An odd-even variation is observed in the monolayer crystal structures and this is supported by the melting enthalpies of the amides determined by DSC. The structure of the even members is found to support the qualitative monolayer arrangement proposed by an STM report of one member of the series, but with more quantitative insight here. Significantly, a new monolayer symmetry group for odd members of the homologous series has been identified. Characteristics of the hydrogen bond geometry between the molecules in the solid monolayers are reported exploiting the high level of detail available from the diffraction techniques. Secondly, the formation of solid monolayers of unsaturated alkyl amides has been reported and their crystal structures determined. This {{is believed to be the}} first report of these monolayer structures. The position and nature of the double bond have an important effect in the stability of the monolayer. Unusually, certain unsaturated amides that have a double bond conjugated with the amide group are found to form considerably more stable layers than their saturated homologues. The abnormally high melting points and enhanced stability of amide monolayers have been attributed to the existence of a network of hydrogen bonds in the layer. Phase diagrams obtained by DSC for binary mixtures of alkyl amides on graphite have been quantitatively analysed using a combination of thermodynamic models (ideal, eutectic and the regular solution models). The determined mixing behaviour is supported by conclusions based on the monolayer crystal structures of the individual components calculated using diffraction. Saturated amide mixtures that have the same plane group symmetry are found to mix non-ideally in the solid layer and phase separate if the symmetry is different, whereas the mixing behaviour of saturated/unsaturated amides considered here was found to depend on the nature of the double bond (cis/trans). Results from an initial investigation into the adsorption of alkyl amides at the polymer/air interface are also presented. This complements the study above and provides an alternative situation where amide monolayers have a central role. A reduction in the coefficient of friction is seen with increasing bulk concentration of the amide and with increasing time indicating migration of the amide to the surface. A powerful combination of surface reflection techniques including neutron and X-ray reflection and ellipsometry have been used to gain uniquely quantitative insight into this system. Initial estimates of the concentration of amides at the polystyrene surface are presented for the first time.

This method is applied, {{for the first}} time, to molecules having Lennard-Jones sites and fixed partial charges. For the bulk phase equilibria, {{we have found that}} all the thermodynamic properties agree well with experimental data and pre-existing simulations over a wide range of temperatures. A major advantage of the kMC method is its excellent performance under conditions where the Gibbs ensemble simulation fails to achieve convergence, especially in dense phases. Moreover, the calculation of the chemical potential is incorporated in the scheme, which avoids the need for tedious additional procedures, such as the Widom method, required in conventional methods, which add significant computational overheads. For adsorption on a graphite surface, the kMC results are superior to those from a conventional GCMC simulation under conditions where dense phases exist; this is attributed to efficient sampling of the kMC scheme.

Their depositions have been studied on flat substrates and present major protection against oxidation at high temperature (several minutes at 2000 °C under air). Infiltration of these carbides layers has been observed inside the open porosities of the carbon substrate which enhance the adhesion of the protection. The low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) process developed here allows multilayer HfC/SiC depositions.

Here, a lithium-bromine rechargeable fuel cell using highly concentrated bromine catholytes is demonstrated with comparable specific energy, improved power density, and higher efficiency. The cell is similar in structure to a hybrid-electrolyte Li-air battery, where a lithium metal anode in nonaqueous electrolyte is separated from aqueous bromine catholytes by a lithium-ion conducting ceramic plate. The cell with a <b>flat</b> <b>graphite</b> electrode can discharge at a peak power density around 9 mW cm- 2 and in principle could provide a specific energy of 791. 8 Wh kg- 1, superior to most existing cathode materials and catholytes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} argon adsorption into carbon nanotubes at temperatures below the triple point, using a grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation to {{study the effects of}} confinement and surface strength on the 2 D transition. In large pores, it was found that 2 D transitions can occur in more than one layer, but are absent in higher layers for small pores. The 2 D critical temperature of the first layer for a small pore (R = 1. 2 nm) was found to be ca. 66 K (MWCNT) and 65 K (SWCNT), compared to 55 – 59 K observed experimentally for a <b>flat</b> <b>graphite</b> surface. This is because of the overlapping effects due to the surface curvature or the confinement in a carbon nanotube. Assuming a weaker carbon surface by reducing the graphene surface strength by 40 % for SWCNT, the 2 D critical temperature was only modestly reduced to 63 K. This suggests that the experimental data at 59 K might be attributed to other factors, other than confinement effects. An imperfect surface is suggested and, employing 5 % defects on this surface, the 2 D critical temperature has been determined as 58 K which is in better agreement with the experimental value of 59 K...|$|E

Here atomic force microscopy is used to shear five different mixtures of hexadecane and squalane confined between the tip apex and atomically <b>flat</b> <b>graphite.</b> The shearing amplitudes are typically < 2 nm, hence reflecting highly localised information at the interface. The evolution of each mixture’s viscoelastic properties is studied as a function of temperature, between 20 °C and 100 °C. The results, complemented by sub-nanometre resolution images of the interface, show that spatial organisation of the liquid molecules at the surface of graphite largely dominates the measurements. Squalane presents a higher affinity for the surface and forms a robust self-assembled layer in all mixtures. This results in a step-like change of the viscous and elastic response of the confined liquid as the confining pressure increases. In contrast, measurements in pure hexadecane show a continuous and linear increase in the apparent viscosity with pressure at all temperatures. This is interpreted as a more fragile interfacial layer and images show that it can be completely removed at high temperatures. Depending on the mixture composition, measurements can be strongly location-dependent which suggests molecular clustering and nanoscale phase separation at the interface...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a 1 cm{sup 2 } thermophotovoltaic (TPV) module was recently measured in a photonic cavity test system. A conversion efficiency of 11. 7 % was measured at a radiator temperature of 1076 C and a module temperature of 29. 9 C. This experiment achieved the highest direct measurement of efficiency for an integrated TPV system. Efficiency was calculated from {{the ratio of the}} peak (load matched) electrical power output and the heat absorption rate. Measurements of these two parameters were made simultaneously to assure the validity of the measured efficiency value. This test was conducted in a photonic cavity which mimicked a typical flat-plate TPV system. The radiator was a large, <b>flat</b> <b>graphite</b> surface. The module was affixed {{to the top of a}} copper pedestal for heat absorption measurements. The heat absorption rate was proportional to the axial temperature gradient in the pedestal under steady-state conditions. The test was run in a vacuum to eliminate conductive and convective heat transfer mechanisms. The photonic cavity provides the optimal test environment for TPV efficiency measurements because it incorporates all important physical phenomena found in an integrated TPV system: high radiator emissivity and blackbody spectral shape, photon recycling, Lambertian distribution of incident radiation and complex geometric effects. Furthermore, the large aspect ratio between radiating surface area and radiator/module spacing produces a view factor approaching unity with minimal photon leakage...|$|E
40|$|The {{abilities}} of carbon cloth, graphite plate {{and stainless steel}} to form microbial anodes were compared under identical conditions. Each electrode was polarised at − 0. 2 V vs. SCE in soil leachate and fed by successive additions of 20 mM acetate. Under these conditions, the maximum current densities provided were on average 33. 7 A m− 2 for carbon cloth, 20. 6 A m− 2 for stainless steel, and 9. 5 A m− 2 for <b>flat</b> <b>graphite.</b> The high current density obtained with carbon cloth was obviously influenced by the three dimensional electrode structure. Nevertheless, a fair comparison between flat electrodes demonstrated the great interest of stainless steel. The comparison was even more in favour of stainless steel at higher potential values. At + 0. 1 V vs. SCE stainless steel provided up to 35 A m− 2, while graphite did not exceed 11 A m− 2. This was the first demonstration that stainless steel offers a very promising ability to form microbial anodes. The surface topography of the stainless steel did not significantly affect the current provided. Analysis of the voltammetry curves allowed two groups of electrode materials to be distinguished by their kinetics. The division into two well-defined kinetics groups proved to be appropriate {{for a wide range}} of microbial anodes described in the literature...|$|E
40|$|We deduce a new {{value for}} the {{potential}} well depth for the C-H- 2 interaction {{on the basis of}} experimental validations of isotherms of H- 2 and D- 2 predicted using independently characterized microstructural parameters. We use two carbons, one an activated carbon fiber whose structure has been recently characterized by us (Nguyen, T. X.; cohaut, N.; Bae, J. -S.; Elhatia, S. K. Langmuir 2008, 24, 7912) using hybrid reverse Monte Carlo simulation (HRMC) and the other the commercial Takeda 3 A carbon molecular sieve whose pore size distribution is determined here from the 273 K CO 2 adsorption isotherm. The conventional grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation technique incorporating a semiclassical Feynman and Hibbs (FH) potential approximation (FHGCMC) as well as path integral Monte Carlo calculations is employed to determine theoretical adsorption isotherms. It is found that curvature enhances the well depth for the LJ C-H- 2 interaction by a factor of 1. 134 over that for a <b>flat</b> <b>graphite</b> surface, consistent with our recent study (Nguyen, T. X.; cohaut, N.; Bae, J. -S.; Bhatia, S. K. Langmuir 2008, 24, 7912). A value of the C-C well depth of 37. 26 K, used for estimating the C-H- 2 well depth in conjunction with the Berthelot rules, with the Steele C-C well depth used for interaction with heavier gases (Ar, CO 2 and CH 4), leads to excellent agreement with experimental isotherms in all cases...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) {{procedure}} for atomistic modeling of the microstructure of activated carbons whereby the guessed configuration for the HRMC construction simulation is generated using the characterization results (pore size and pore wall thickness distributions) {{obtained by the}} interpretation of argon adsorption at 87 K using our improved version of the slit-pore model, termed the finite wall thickness (FWT) model (Nguyen, T. X.; Bhatia, S. K. Langmuir 2004, 20, 3532). This procedure overcomes limitations arising {{from the use of}} shortrange potentials in the conventional HRMC method, which make the latter unsuitable for carbons such as activated carbon fibers that are anisotropic with medium-range ordering induced by their complex pore structure. The newly proposed approach is applied specifically for the atomistic construction of an activated carbon fiber ACF 15, provided by Kynol Corporation (Nguyen, T. X.; Bhatia, S. K. Carbon 2005, 43, 775). It is found that the PSD of the ACF 15 ’s constructed microstructure is in good agreement with that determined using argon adsorption at 87 K. Furthermore, we have also found that the use of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) carbon-fluid interaction well depth obtained from scaling the <b>flat</b> <b>graphite</b> surface-fluid interaction well depth taken from Steele (Steele, W. A. Surf. Sci. 1973, 36, 317) provides an excellent prediction of experimental adsorption data including the differential heat of adsorption of simple gases (Ar,N 2, CH 4, CO 2) over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. This finding is in agreement with the enhancement of the LJ carbon-fluid well depth due to the curvature of the carbon surface, found by the use of ab initio calculations (Klauda, J. B.; Jiang, J.; Sandler, S. I. J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 9842) ...|$|E
