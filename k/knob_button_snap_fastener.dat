5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with <b>buttons</b> rather than <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners</b> or velcro to reduce noise.|$|R
50|$|The zipper was {{initially}} popularized as a fastener for men's trousers. Though at first opposed on women's clothes {{due to the}} suggestiveness of speedy undressing, it ultimately became popular on women's clothing, particularly dresses, in the late 1930s, for their convenience over hook and eye <b>fasteners,</b> <b>buttons</b> and <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners,</b> hence the now obsolete term zipperback dress. Zippers are typically placed at the back seam of a dress. Some such garments may sport decorative buttons, lacing or mock closures at the front, but actually open at the back.|$|R
5000|$|The sleeper serves {{mainly to}} keep the wearer warm at night, {{even in the absence}} of {{blankets}} and bed covers. The sleeper covers the entire body except for the head (except in certain cases where a hood is present) and (in most cases) hands (except in cases where a sleeper has attached mitts, mostly on infant sizes), where it is snug at the neck and wrists. The use of a zipper closure in place of <b>buttons</b> or <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners</b> also further retains warmth by eliminating drafts. This is especially important for infants, for whom loose blankets may pose a safety hazard (including increasing the risk of SIDS), and possibly for older children, who may still be too young to be relied upon {{to keep the}}ir own sleepwear or bed covers adjusted so as to prevent exposure to the air of bare skin. This is reflected in advertisements by blanket sleeper manufacturers, which often emphasize that their garments [...] "can't be kicked off", or that [...] "no other covers are needed". The permanently attached feet can also be a beneficial feature for children who are prone to get out of bed in the morning before their parents are awake, and are too young to be relied upon to put on slippers or other footwear to keep their feet warm, as well as for adults who find putting on, and/or wearing socks in bed too bothersome, yet still want their feet covered when getting out of bed in the morning. Blanket sleepers without feet allow more room for growth and reduce the possibility of slipping. Also, children with larger or smaller feet find a better fit.|$|R

50|$|Snap-together {{connectors}} {{have been}} used for thousands of years. The first ones were metal. Some of the oldest snap-fits found are <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners,</b> or <b>buttons,</b> shown on the Chinese Terracotta Army featuring soldiers from the late Warring States Period. Metal <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners,</b> spring clips, and other snap-type connectors are still in broad use today.|$|R

40|$|A <b>snap</b> <b>fastener</b> is a {{deformable}} device {{consisting of}} a pair of mating surfaces that "snap" together during assembly. Because of the simple, linear assembly motion, such latching micro fasteners have a wide range of applications in micro assembly tasks, e. g. for devices with multiple or layered components, or micro opto-mechanical plugs. At the micro scale, conventional types of fasteners like screws and hinges are unlikely to work due to present fabrication constraints and large friction forces. Micro <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners</b> also have great potential to be used as sensors with memory...|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners</b> {{were first}} {{patented}} by German inventor Heribert Bauer in 1885 as the [...] "Federknopf-Verschluss", a novelty fastener for men's trousers. Some attribute the invention to Bertel Sanders, of Denmark. These first versions had an S-shaped {{spring in the}} [...] "male" [...] disc instead of a groove. Australian inventor Myra Juliet Farrell is also credited with inventing a 'stitchless press stud' and the 'stitchless hook and eye.' In America, Jack Weil (1901-2008) put snaps on his iconic Western shirts, which spread the fashion for them. The Prym-company produces <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners</b> since 1903.|$|R
