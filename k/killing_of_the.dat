5|$|Critics have {{objected to}} the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea lions, {{pointing}} out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.|$|E
5|$|According to a latter {{episode of}} the Devi Mahatmya that deals with the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demon Raktabija, the warrior-goddess Durga creates the Matrikas from herself and with their help slaughters the demon army. When the demon Shumbha {{challenges}} Durga to single combat, she absorbs the Matrikas into herself. In the Vamana Purana, the Matrikas arise {{from different parts of}} the Divine Mother Chandika; Varahi arises from Chandika's back.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Velvicks, the Lieutenant-Governor Frederick Irwin {{declared}} Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws, offering {{rewards of}} £20 each for {{the capture of}} Midgegooroo and Munday, and a reward of £30 for Yagan's capture, dead or alive. Munday successfully appealed against his proscription. Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley. On 17 May, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River. After a brief, informal trial, he was executed by firing squad. Yagan remained at large for over two months.|$|E

5|$|Further work {{to improve}} {{the image of the}} town {{continues}} with the latest Central Basingstoke Vision project coordinated by the Borough Council. In the mid-1990s, numerous reports described sightings of the Beast of Basingstoke, a big cat believed to be a lion or a puma, possibly two. Local legend suggests the animal was shot and killed, although no official news sources document any capture or <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beast.|$|E
5|$|Morgaon is the {{foremost}} centre of {{worship of the}} Ganapatya sect, which considers Ganesha as the Supreme Being. A Hindu legend relates the temple to <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demon Sindhu by Ganesha. The exact date of building of the temple is unknown, though the Ganapatya saint Morya Gosavi {{is known to be}} associated with it. The temple flourished due to the patronage of the Peshwa rulers and descendants of Morya Gosavi.|$|E
5|$|The Harivamsa {{from the}} epic Mahabharata also narrates the {{incident}} {{in a similar fashion}} complete with Narada's praise identifying Krishna as Vishnu. The Vishnu Purana and the Harivamsa (1st - 2nd century BCE) tell that Keshi is the last agent sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna, after Keshi's killing, Krishna and Balarama go to Mathura, where Kamsa is killed. However, the Bhagavata Purana describes the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demon Vyoma sent by Kamsa, before he leaves for Mathura.|$|E

5|$|The {{first scene}} of the episode, {{depicting}} the celebration of King Joffrey's name day, was filmed on Dubrovnik's Fort Lovrijenac (also called St. Lawrence Fortress). The later debate {{about the nature of}} power between Cersei and Littlefinger also takes place in its porch, and in the final montage with the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bastards the Old City of Dubrovnik and its famed walls can be clearly seen.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} prosecuted {{four people}} {{in connection with the}} 1991 <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoners of war, and convicted and sentenced them to 15 to 20 years in prison. Another person was tried and convicted in connection with the 1993 bombing, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 1998, the Chapel of Nativity of Mary was built in Kusonje at the initiative of the parents of the soldiers who were killed there, and a commemorative plaque containing the names of the 23 killed was placed at the chapel. The events of 1991 and 1993 are commemorated annually in Kusonje, with civilian and military representatives attending. In 2014, a feature film titled Number 55, based on the 1991 events in Kusonje, was released. The title of the film refers to the number of the house where the ZNG troops took shelter on 8–9 September 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{protected}} in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended {{to all of}} North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States {{due to the fact}} that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In his absence, {{the issue}} of female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would {{be a threat to}} the structure and customs of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, with several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American nun, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta soon attended a meeting with church representatives. There, he expressed the view that although he personally opposed FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through education of its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later complained about what he described as Kenyatta's dishonesty during the debate, expelling him from the church. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.|$|E
5|$|Mithridates the Great was {{the ruler}} of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor, from 120 to 63 BC. He is remembered as one of Rome's most {{formidable}} and successful enemies who engaged {{three of the most}} prominent generals of the late Roman Republic: Sulla, Lucullus, and Pompey the Great. In a pattern familiar from the Punic Wars, the Romans came into conflict with him after the two states' spheres of influence began to overlap. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring. After conquering western Anatolia (modern Turkey) in 88 BC, Roman sources claim that Mithridates ordered the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority of the 80,000 Romans living there. In the subsequent First Mithridatic War, the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper after the Battle of Chaeronea and later Battle of Orchomenus but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival Marius; consequently, Mithridates VI was defeated but not destroyed. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} become so {{numerous}} that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea lions. Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted {{to ward off the}} sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective. Critics like the Humane Society object to the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea lions, claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown fur seals. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually {{have a negative effect on}} the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Sources vary to {{some extent}} in respect of the Chetnik {{massacre}} of Muslims {{in the town of}} Goražde. According to Hoare, on 29 November 1941, the Italians handed Goražde over to the Chetniks, who immediately massacred Croatian Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials. This expanded into the systematic <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim civilian population. Their corpses were left hanging in the town or were tossed into the Drina. Several hundred civilians were killed in Goražde at this time. Todorović had reached an agreement with Lieutenant-Colonel Castagnieri, commander of the Italian garrison in Goražde, regarding Italian evacuation and hand over of Goražde to the Chetniks. According to Tomislav Dulić, the town was occupied by Dangić and his Chetniks on 1 December. Upon arrival, Dangić gave a speech to a group of Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims which contained references to Greater Serbia and ended with Dangić proclaiming that Serbs and Bosnian Muslims could no longer live together. Following the speech, Chetnik bands spread through the town and began killing, raping, pillaging and torching homes. A significant number of victims were killed on a bridge over the Drina, after which their bodies were dropped into the river. Chetnik forces in Bosnia, including those of Dangić, then set about pursuing an anti-Muslim campaign to recompense for the persecution experienced by ethnic Serbs in the NDH. On 11 December, Dangić's Chetniks entered Pale and looted and burnt down the local convent. They captured five nuns (two Croats, two Slovenes, and one Austrian) and took them with them through Romanija to Goražde, where on 15 December they committed suicide to avoid being raped.|$|E
5|$|The Kaqchikel {{appear to}} have entered into an {{alliance}} with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz'utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan. Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan {{at the request of}} the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz'utujil. When news of the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz'utujil with their Kaqchikel allies. Pedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's hard march, without encountering any opposition. Seeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore. Opposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz'utujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz'utujil fled. The causeway was too narrow for the horses, therefore the conquistadors dismounted and crossed to the island before the inhabitants could break the bridges. The rest of Alvarado's army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island. The surviving Tz'utujil fled into the lake and swam to safety on another island. The Spanish could not pursue the survivors further because 300 canoes sent by the Kaqchikels had not yet arrived. This battle took place on 18 April.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{launched}} its invasion of Panama on December 20, 1989. Although the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marine was the ostensible {{reason for the}} invasion, the operation had been planned for months before his death. The move was the largest military action by the U.S. since the Vietnam War, and included more than 27,000 soldiers, as well as 300 aircraft. The Bush administration considered lighter assaults using fewer troops, but decided against them. The U.S. forces targeted Noriega's personal private vehicles. Several slums {{in the middle of}} Panama City were destroyed in the U.S. bombing campaign. The day after the invasion, Noriega's deputy Colonel Luis del Cid retreated with some soldiers to the mountains outside David City, after laying mines in the airport. Though this was part of a contingency plan for the invasion, del Cid quickly decided that the Panamanian military was {{not in a position to}} fight a guerrilla war against the U.S., and negotiated a surrender. The number of U.S. soldiers that were killed in the operation was between 23 and 60; 300 soldiers were injured. Casualties among the Panamanian forces were much higher; between 300 and 845. A large number of civilians were killed in the invasion: the precise figure is a matter of debate. The U.S. government reported 250 civilian deaths; other observers estimated 3,000 casualties.|$|E

5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency – Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.It {{would appear that the}} UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organisation transferring weapons to the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.|$|E
