No Brasil, desconhece-se o impacto da infecção na hipoacusia. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a audição de crianças com toxoplasmose congênita identificadas pela triagem {{neonatal}}. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Estudo prospectivo de crianças com toxoplasmose congênita identificadas pela triagem neonatal (IgM anti-T. gondii) em Belo Horizonte, durante 2003 / 2004. Realizada sorologia confirmatória (mãe/filho) e consideradas positivas as crianças apresentando IgM e/ou IgA nos primeiros seis meses ou IgG aos 12 meses de vida. Avaliações auditivas ao diagnóstico e após 12 meses incluíram Audiometria Comportamental, Emissões Otoacústicas, Imitanciometria, Audiometria de Tronco Encefálico. RESULTADOS: Dentre 30. 808 crianças triadas (97 % dos nascidos vivos), 20 apresentavam toxoplasmose congênita, 15 (75 %) com infecção subclínica. Dezenove crianças realizaram avaliação auditiva. Quatro apresentaram déficit neurossensorial (21, 1 %). Uma criança apresentou outros fatores de risco para hipoacusia; nas outras três, a toxoplasmose foi o único fator observado.

This study was planned with an objective to assess hearing loss in children using behavioural observation audiometry and brain stem <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Methods: A total of 105 cases suffering from severe to profound hearing loss were registered. After proper history and clinical examination patients were subjected to behavioural observation audiometry (BOA) and brainstem <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> <b>audiometry</b> test (BERA). Results: Out of 105 cases in 62 cases (59. 05 %) the findings of both BOA and BERA tests were similar but in 43 cases the findings of both tests were not similar. In total 18 cases (17. 14 %) diagnosis of severe hearing loss could be made by BERA test only because of in 10 cases there was inconclusive BOA finding and in 8 cases there was no response in BOA test.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Congenital {{deafness}} in a {{child is}} often missed. Several distraction tests have evolved over time to diagnose congenital deafness. These are of limited value {{in the era of}} <b>Evoked</b> <b>response</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Evoked responses, such as Oto-acoustic emission (OAE) and Brainstem <b>Evoked</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Audiometry</b> (BERA) have {{played a significant role in}} early diagnosis of congenital hearing impairment. The study was conducted to compare the result of neonatal hearing screening in high risk and non high risk neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS A study was conducted over a time period of three months at a tertiary care institute to screen all live neonates for congenital hearing impairment using OAE and BERA. RESULT 1182 neonates were screened for hearing impairment. 336 were in High risk group and rest in Non high risk group. Nine neonates turned out to have abnormal BERA result (absence of wave V). Six of them were high risk babies and rest 3 were non high risk. DISCUSSION 33. 33 % of congenital deaf population detected by UNHS belong to the Non High Risk group. Studies across the world suggest at least 50 % chance of missing out a congenital deaf child if Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening is not practiced.   CONCLUSION In order to ensure that early detection and effective intervention are made on all newborns with hearing impairment, UNHS should be performed.

MÉTODOS: Foram incluídos na pesquisa neonatos de alojamento conjunto, nascidos em um hospital público, e que realizaram triagem auditiva após a alta hospitalar. Utilizou-se para triagem as Emissões Otoacústicas Transientes (EOAT) com critério passa/falha e o reteste com o Potencial Evocado Auditivo de Tronco Encefálico-modo automático (PEATE-A). RESULTADOS: Foram testados 5106 neonatos, 51, 3 % do sexo masculino e 48, 7 % do sexo feminino. Falharam 628 (12, 3 %) neonatos, 368 (58, 6 %) do sexo masculino e 260 (41, 4 %) do gênero feminino, sendo encaminhados para o PEATE-A.

DESIGN [...] Clinicians who notified children to the national congenital rubella surveillance programme were asked retrospectively to complete a questionnaire examining {{the methods used}} to identify hearing impairment and the age at testing in two consecutive five year cohorts. The presence or absence of hearing loss was confirmed by obtaining the results of audiometric evaluations and, whenever possible, a recent pure tone audiogram. SETTING [...] The United Kingdom. PATIENTS [...] Children notified to the national congenital rubella surveillance programme and born in 1978 - 87 in whom IgM specific for rubella was detected shortly after birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The age at which hearing loss was identified and the degree of loss in decibels at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz measured by pure tone audiometry. RESULTS [...] 61 (52 %) Of 117 children born in 1978 - 82 had a hearing impairment of 40 dB or greater in both ears. The mean loss was 93 dB. In the following five years 75 (47 %) of 159 children had impaired hearing, their mean loss being 96 dB. The age at which the hearing loss was confirmed decreased from 11. 6 to 9. 8 months as a result of earlier auditory evoked response testing. Nevertheless, only eight (13 %) of the children with hearing impairment born in 1978 - 82 and 16 (21 %) of those born in 1983 - 7 had these tests performed {{in the first six months}} of life.

40|$|SummaryOne of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of the Brainstem <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> <b>audiometry</b> (ABR) is in the evaluation of hearing loss in children. Today the ABR is also indicated in the screening of cochleo-vestibular syndromes to detect retrocochlear lesions, to monitor patients in a coma (brain death), in monitoring the brainstem during skull base surgery, etc. Among the many BERA qualities, is its capacity to evaluate the neurophysiologic integrity of the auditory brainstem pathway. In doing so, sometimes while evaluating hearing function in children we are faced with ABR waves that suggest the presence of retrocochlear lesions (trace asymmetry, increased interpeak intervals), many times confirmed through image studies. These cases are seen as occasional findings of neurologic disorders during children hearing loss evaluation. In this study we report 2 cases of neurologic disorders diagnosed {{with the use of the}} ABR to evaluate hearing loss in children...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} assumption {{in human}} cognitive electrophysiology using EEG and MEG {{is that the}} presentation of a particular event such as visual or auditory stimuli evokes a "turning on" of additional brain activity that adds to the ongoing background activity. Averaging multiple event-locked trials is thought to result in the cancellation of the seemingly random phased ongoing activity while leaving the <b>evoked</b> <b>response.</b> However, recent work strongly challenges this conventional view and demonstrates that the ongoing activity is not averaged out due to specific non-sinusoidal properties. As a consquence, systematic modulations in ongoing activity can produce slow cortical <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> reflecting cognitive processing. In this review we introduce the concept of "rhythmic pulsing" to account for this specific non-sinusoidal property. We will explain how rhythmic pulsing can create slow <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> from a physiological perspective. We will also discuss how the notion of rhythmic pulsing provides a unifying framework linking ongoing oscillations, <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> and the brain's capacity to process incoming information...|$|R

LIMO EEG is a Matlab toolbox (EEGLAB compatible) to analyse <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> over all space and time dimensions, while accounting for single trial variability using a simple hierarchical linear modelling of the data. In addition, LIMO EEG provides robust parametric tests, therefore providing a new and complementary tool in the analysis of neural <b>evoked</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R
