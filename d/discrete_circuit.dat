40|$|A {{landmark}} of corticostriatal connectivity in nonhuman primates is that cortical {{connections are}} organized into {{a set of}} <b>discrete</b> <b>circuits.</b> Each circuit is assumed to perform distinct behavioral functions. In animals, most connectivity studies are performed using invasive tracing methods, which are nonapplicable in humans. To test the proposal that corticos-triatal connections are organized as multiple circuits in humans, we used diffusion tensor imaging axonal tracking, a new magnetic resonance technique that allows demonstration of fiber tracts in a noninvasive manner. Diffusion tensor im-aging–based fiber tracking showed that the posterior (sensorimotor), anterior (associative), and ventral (limbic) compart-ments of the human striatum have specific connections with the cortex, and particularly the frontal lobes. These results provide the first direct demonstration of distinct corticostriatal connections in humans. Ann Neurol 2004; 55 : 522 – 529 Over the past 15 years, anatomical studies in animals have shown that all cortical areas project to the stria-tum in <b>discrete</b> <b>circuits.</b> 1 These circuits are subdivided into subchannels conveying either sensorimotor, asso-ciation, or limbic information. 1 Most fiber tract studies in animals rely on invasive techniques, which are no...|$|R
50|$|Strictly, {{read-only}} memory refers to memory that is hard-wired, such as diode matrix and the later mask ROM (MROM), which cannot be changed after manufacture. Although <b>discrete</b> <b>circuits</b> {{can be altered}} in principle, integrated circuits (ICs) cannot, and are useless if the data is bad or requires an update. That such memory can never be changed is a disadvantage in many applications, as bugs and security issues cannot be fixed, and new features cannot be added.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{invention}} of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These <b>discrete</b> <b>circuits</b> consumed much space and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications.

50|$|ICs {{have two}} main {{advantages}} over discrete circuits: cost and performance. Cost is low because the chips, {{with all their}} components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than <b>discrete</b> <b>circuits.</b> Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and close proximity. The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost to design them and fabricate the required photomasks. This high initial cost means ICs are only practical when high production volumes are anticipated.|$|R

50|$|The OB-Xa was {{released}} in December 1980, {{a year after the}} OB-X {{was released}}. Instead of <b>discrete</b> <b>circuits</b> for oscillators and filters, the OB-Xa (and the Oberheim synths to follow) switched to Curtis integrated circuits. This made the inside of the synth less cluttered, reducing the labor required to replace bad parts, and reducing the cost of manufacture. It was getting more difficult to service the OB-Xa due to the scarcity of Curtis chips; however, Curtis started re-manufacturing these chips in June 2016 (http://www.curtiselectromusic.com/) which has breathed new life into the longevity of the OB-Xa and many other synthesizers that use these chips.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{is not very}} common in low-frequency <b>discrete</b> <b>circuits,</b> where it is usually employed for amplifiers that require an unusually low input impedance, for example {{to act as a}} preamplifier for moving-coil microphones.However, it is popular in integrated circuits and in high-frequency amplifiers, for example for VHF and UHF, because its input capacitance does not suffer from the Miller effect, which degrades the bandwidth of the common-emitter configuration, and because of the relatively high isolation between the input and output. This high isolation means that there is little feedback from the output back to the input, leading to high stability.|$|R
