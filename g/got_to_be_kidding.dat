500|$|According to Traci Paige Johnson, {{one of the}} {{producers}} and creators of Blue's Clues, Patton's character {{was more like a}} preschooler and more innocent than Steve. Angela Santomero, another producer and creator, stated that Patton's characterization as Joe brought him closer to the preschool viewer as Joe <b>was</b> more willing <b>to</b> [...] "jump into a problem rather than figure it out first like Steve". Patton liked working on Blue's Clues because, as he stated, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go <b>be</b> a <b>kid</b> for twelve hours a day". [...] He called the show's crew [...] "a real fun little family" [...] and a [...] "well-oiled machine" [...] by the time he joined the show. Patton remained on the show until the show's cancellation, and also appeared in its spin-off, Blue's Room, which premiered in 2004. Several years later, Patton said he had not yet grasped the enormity of replacing Burns, even after he became a parent and witnessed the show's effect on his own children.
