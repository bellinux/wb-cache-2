40|$|Background Innovative imaging techniques, using {{up-to-date}} ultrasonic equipment, necessitate specific biometry. The aim of {{our study}} was to test the possibility of detailed human embryonic biometry using a virtual reality (VR) technique. Methods In a longitudinal study, three-dimensional (3 D) measurements were performed from 6 to 14 weeks gestational age in 32 pregnancies (n = 16 spontaneous conception, n = 16 IVF/ICSI). A total of 125 3 D volumes were analysed in the I-Space VR system, which allows binocular depth perception, providing a realistic 3 D illusion. Crown-rump length (CRL), biparietal diameter (BPD), occipito-frontal diameter (OFD), head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) were measured as well as arm length, shoulder <b>width,</b> <b>elbow</b> <b>width,</b> hip width and knee width. Result SCRL, BPD, OFD and HC could be measured in more than 96 of patients, and AC in 78. Shoulder <b>width,</b> <b>elbow</b> <b>width,</b> hip width and knee width could be measured in more than 95 of cases, and arm length in 82 of cases. Growth curves were constructed for all variables. Ear and foot measurements were only possible beyond 9 weeks gestation. Conclusions This study provides a detailed, longitudinal description of normal human embryonic growth, facilitated by a VR system. Growth curves were created for embryonic biometry of the CRL, BPD, HC and AC early in pregnancy and also of several 'new' biometric measurements. Applying virtual embryoscopy {{will enable us to}} diagnose growth and/or developmental delay earlier and more accurately. This is especially important for pregnancies at risk of severe complications, such as recurrent late miscarriage and early growth restriction...|$|R

A cross-sectional sample of 267 deaf-mute boys from 5 to 18 years was collected from various educational institutes of Punjab specially meant to teach hearing impaired children who were otherwise normal. Various anthropometric measurements were taken on each subject with the help of techniques given by Lohman et al. (1988) which included weight and height, humerus and femur bicondylar diameter, upper arm and calf circumferences, skinfolds at triceps and subscapular. In a nutshell, it has been found that the deaf-mute boys of the present study lag behind the normal in early years of life in height, have significantly smaller <b>elbow</b> <b>widths</b> and are more fatty at triceps skinfold. The ecological factors and mental attitude of the populace have not changed from those of the past in case of deafmutes while there is a tremendous improvement in the otherwise living standards of the general population.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{identify}} the differentiation of body composition among players of Polish national baseball team in comparison to persons of the same population not professionally engaged in sport. The study involved Polish baseball representatives (n= 20). Competitors’ age was 18 - 28 years, body mass from 67. 7 kg to 114 kg (85 ± 10. 3 kg), and body height 173 - 196 cm (185. 1 ± 4. 8). The training experience was 7 - 14 years and it was highly differentiated. The stoutness factor is the dominant factor among "infielders" and "pitchers", and among "outfielders" - the length one. The proportions of the features within the factors show that players are characterized by a strongly muscled forearm and a shank and by a clear predominance of the <b>elbow</b> <b>width</b> with a disproportionately - to the overall size of the factor - small knee and shoulder width.

40|$|Background: Anthropometry {{plays an}} {{important}} role in industrial design, clothing design, ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in lifestyles, nutrition, and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e. g. the obesity epidemic), and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections. Aim and Objectives: This study analyzed the variation in anthropometric dimensions and body composition parameters of working women employees of different geographical zones. Material and Methods: The study was undertaken on nine hundred forty (940) women employees of Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) working in seventeen different laboratories and belonged to different states of India. The age range of studied women was between 20 - 60 years. Fourteen body dimensions namely stature, popliteal height, knee height, buttock to popliteal length, hip breadth, waist breadth, shoulder breadth, forearm length, arm length, eye height (sitting), sitting shoulder height, hand length, hand breadth and <b>elbow</b> <b>width</b> were measured in cm using Martin anthropometers and Martin's sliding caliper. Body composition parameters like weight, percentage body fat, fat mass and fat free mass were recorded. Results: All anthropometric parameters were found significantly different (p< 0. 001). Body composition variables of women were also found significantly different in all three zones but fat free mass was not significantly different. Conclusion:It can be concluded that diet, environmental conditions and living style of different regions can influence the anthropometry and body composition of the individuals, however the influence of ethnic, genetic and hereditary factor are not controlled in this study...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} food and {{nutrient}} intake, activity levels and body composition of migrant Chinese children living in Auckland, and compare the results with data from European children {{of the same age}} in New Zealand. Subjects: Fifty children aged between 7 to 10 years of age, who were born in Mainland China and have immigrated to New Zealand (twenty-seven boys and twenty-three girls). Method: Three 24 -hour recalls were used to evaluate dietary intake. Questionnaires were pretested before survey, and were used to determine food consumption patterns, demographic details, medical status, lifestyle and activity patterns. Anthropometric measurements included were height, weight, upper arm circumference, triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold and elbow breadth. BMI was calculated. Results: • The average body height and weight of the migrant Chinese children was 131. 8 cm and 29. 2 kg respectively, higher and heavier than their peers in Mainland China. Each anthropometric measurement was higher in 9 - 10 year old children than 7 - 8 year old children, but only the differences between weight (p < 0. 001), arm circumference (p < 0. 005), and <b>elbow</b> <b>width</b> (p < 0. 001) were significant. Except the triceps skinfold, most anthropometric measurements for the migrant Chinese children were lower than the European children in the Validation Report for the Children's Nutrition Survey in New Zealand, indicating Chinese children had higher arm fat and lower muscle than their counterparts in new Zealand. • The overall average energy intake of migrant Chinese children was 7712 kJ, close to the recommendations. The average protein intake of children was well above the UK RNI and USA RDA values (69. 3 g compared with RNI of 28. 3 g and RDA of 28. 0 g), and higher than that of their New Zealand and Mainland Chinese counterparts. Mean percentage of food energy derived from carbohydrate was 52. 5 %. Mean percentages of food energy derived from fat and saturated fat were 29. 6 and 12. 8, respectively. The fat intake of children was higher than that found in Mainland Chinese children where the mean percentage of total energy from fat in this age group varies from 23. 4 - 28. 5. However, it was lower than that found in New Zealand European children where the average percentages of food energy derived from fat and saturated fat were 34. 9 and 16. 3 for boys, and 31. 4 and 13. 8 for girls, respectively. • Mean intakes of most micronutrients were in excess of UK RNI. Lower intakes of vitamin A Eq were found (95. 5 % of RNI and 68. 5 % of RDA), reflecting lower consumption of fruits and vegetables than European New Zealand children. • The food frequency questionnaire designed to assess nutrient intake in New Zealand European, Maori and Pacific children in the Children's Nutrition Survey was not applicable to migrant Chinese children. • For the children in this study, breakfast and lunch at school, especially lunch at school, were "Westernized". Dinner of the children mainly maintained Chinese traditional foods. • While parents of the children realized the importance of modern nutrition, most of them applied the ancient Chinese philosophies regarding food and health to their children. Seventy percent of the parents could feel their children in "hot" or "cold" conditions, and used dietary restriction or encouraged their children to eat certain foods when their children were in hot" or "cold" conditions. All the Cantonese families used herbs in their children's dishes. • In these Chinese families, the mothers played a very important role in determining food choice of their children. • The migrant Chinese children achieved the recommended activity levels. However, their activity levels were lower than their counterparts in New Zealand. Conclusions: • The trend towards increasing fat and protein intake should be avoided in migrant Chinese children, and the importance of maintaining the traditional Chinese cereal-based diet should be emphasized. • Foods rich in vitamin A should be recommended for the migrant Chinese children. • It is crucial that migrant Chinese children during their diet transition adopt healthy western food habits. • Cultural preferences and mothers' influence should be considered when making nutrition recommendations for migrant Chinese children...|$|R

A questionnaire survey on consumers investigated satisfaction with jackets according to clothing materials and repair trend after wearing. Subsequently, a preference for cir-cular knitted jackets was shown higher than woven jackets. Females in their 20 s preferred woven jackets than those in their 30 s; however, the latter preferred circular knitted jackets than the former. For woven jackets, they showed the high-est satisfaction with size; however, for circular knitted jackets, they showed the highest satisfaction with fitting. In the question on their satisfaction by jacket part, satisfaction with circular knitted jackets was higher in all items except for bust measurement, bottom edge measurement, <b>elbow</b> circumference, shoulder <b>width,</b> and clothes length. Circular knitted jackets had lower repair rates than woven jackets and woven jackets had significant differences by age in satisfaction with back width. The research results indicate that females in their 20 s and 30 s who value fit preference and practicality will increasingly wear knit clothes. Therefore, we can address the fitting satisfaction requirement of females in their 20 s and 30 s by taking the clothing material properties of circular knitted clothes into consideration. In addition, further research is required on jacket patterns in consideration of clothing materials.
