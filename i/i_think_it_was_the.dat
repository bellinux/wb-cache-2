500|$|Only two exemplifications of Magna Carta {{are held}} outside England, both from 1297. One {{of these was}} {{purchased}} in 1952 by the Australian Government for £12,500 from King's School, Bruton, England. This copy is now {{on display in the}} Members' Hall of Parliament House, Canberra. The second was originally held by the Brudenell family, earls of Cardigan, before they sold it in 1984 to the Perot Foundation in the United States, which in 2007 sold it to U.S. businessman David Rubenstein for US$21.3million. Rubenstein commented [...] "I have always believed that this was an important document to our country, even though it wasn't drafted in our country. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> basis for the Declaration of Independence and the basis for the Constitution". This exemplification is now on permanent loan to the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Only two other 1297 exemplifications survive, one of which is held in the UK's National Archives.|$|E
500|$|As the 30th anniversary approached, Gerrold {{had heard}} {{rumors of a}} tribble-sequel in the works but had only heard denials from {{executive}} producer Rick Berman. Following an interview request from The New York Times, he telephoned Berman once more to ask what was happening as {{he did not want}} to say he did not know about the sequel episode and embarrass anyone if it actually was going to happen. Gerrold suggested that an acknowledgement of the creator of the tribbles might be in order and asked if he could be an extra. He was cast as a security redshirt. While Gerrold was on set, he also advised director Jonathan West on the integration of new scenes into [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles". Gerrold later said that [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations" [...] "turned out beautiful. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best episode of Deep Space Nine ever and possibly the best episode of Star Trek after the Original Series." [...] Charlie Brill returned as Arne Darvin to film new scenes set in the DS9 timeframe.|$|E

500|$|Homesick was {{produced}} by Gilbert, and was mixed by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage, with mixing taking place in December 2008, at Zing Studios. Mastering took place at West West Side Studios, by Alan Douches. The album features three guesting vocalists: Mike Hranica of The Devil Wears Prada on [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?", Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain on [...] "Welcome to the Family", and Sierra Kusterbeck of VersaEmerge on [...] "If It Means a Lot to You". The latter featured harmonica played by Dave Guynn. One of the tracks written for Homesick was held over for What Separates Me from You (2010). An instrumental entitled [...] "Money Maker" [...] was also recorded during the sessions, but McKinnon had difficulties with it. He later explained: [...] "when {{it came down to}} writing vocal parts [...] I just couldn't get that song done. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best music for the whole record. The music was just so catchy on its own [...] so we said we will just set this aside for next time around." ...|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E

On October 3, 2012, {{it was announced that}} Swank had dropped out of the film and that Gael Garcia Bernal was in talks to play an HIV patient who meets Woodroof in the hospital and helps him in the club. On November 6, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Jared Leto would be returning to acting to play the role which Bernal was previously in talks to play. In January 2014, Jared Leto has admitted that he was sent a script 15 years ago but never read it. When Leto was asked about his role, he said: [...] "This was a really special movie. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> role of a lifetime. It's {{one of the best things}} I've ever done." [...] He also said that he tried to stay focused on the role because he knew it was an incredible opportunity. On November 14, Dallas Roberts and Steve Zahn joined the film; Roberts would play David Wayne, Ron's defense attorney, while Zahn would play a Dallas police officer who is sympathetic to Ron. On November 26, Griffin Dunne, Denis O'Hare, and Bradford Cox joined the cast when the shooting was underway in New Orleans.|$|E

The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30p.m., {{where it was}} taken over by Vulović and her colleagues. [...] "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," [...] Vulović said. [...] "I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> man who put the bomb in the baggage. I think he had checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight." [...] Flight 367 {{departed from}} Copenhagen Airport at 3:15p.m. At 4:01p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović {{was the only one of}} the 28 passengers and crew to survive the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her [...] stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact.

500|$|... "The Negotiation" [...] {{was written}} by supervising {{producer}} Michael Schur and directed by Jeffrey Blitz. It featured {{the end of the}} story arc featuring Roy Anderson's attempt to win back Pam, his former fiancée. Roy's portrayer, David Denman, reported he was [...] "really grateful" [...] that executive producer Greg Daniels allowed his character to develop, [...] "where all of a sudden, he wasn’t just a complete idiot but felt bad for being a bad boyfriend and wanted to try to get the girl back. It’s so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone wants you to be the same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that." [...] Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was [...] "inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together" [...] and end the series' love triangle. [...] "Otherwise," [...] he explained, [...] "it gets kind of tiring and old. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> appropriate time , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys." [...] Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim–Pam storyline [...] "to the next stage," [...] rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself. Denman briefly returned in the series' fifth, seventh, and ninth seasons.|$|E
500|$|After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to {{face him}} {{so that he could}} repeat his {{performance}} against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, [...] "How do you like that, you hayseed?" [...] Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only [...] from home base (the modern release point is about [...] farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 42, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: [...] "For my part, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> greatest game of ball I ever took part in." [...] In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Apocalypto {{gained some}} passionate champions in the Hollywood community. Actor Robert Duvall called it [...] "maybe the best movie I've seen in 25 years".

I admire Apocalypto for its frankness, but also for the power and artistry of the filmmaking." [...] Actor Edward James Olmos said, [...] "I was totally caught off guard.

That was when it ended, really. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> day after she said that that Brett phoned me up and said, 'I've kicked her out.'" [...] After Frischmann's departure, the character of the group changed. [...] "If Justine hadn't left the band," [...] Anderson said, [...] "I don't think we'd have got anywhere. It was a combination of being personally motivated, and the chemistry being right once she'd left." [...] Anderson and Butler became close friends and began writing several new songs together. However, the band's music was out-of-step with the music of its London contemporaries as well as the American grunge bands.

[...] Daley recalled that it was strange playing against his former Gopher teammates in the 1943 Jug game: [...] "It was strange as I was playing against my teammates and friends, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> idea of winning the Little Brown Jug that motivated me. We beat Minnesota 49-6 and the Jug came to Michigan. It was a wild story." [...] The Michigan victory snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Gophers. [...] In addition to Daley, the 1943 Michigan team also benefited from the arrival of another wartime transfer, Pro Football Hall of Famer Elroy [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Hirsch from Wisconsin. [...] The press referred to Daley and Hirsch as [...] "a pair of 'lend-lease' satellites." ...|$|E
