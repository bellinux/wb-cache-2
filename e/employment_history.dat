Analysing the biographical data set from the German Pension Insurance (SUF VVL 2004) the <b>employment</b> <b>histories</b> of individuals aged 21 to 60 can be mirrored in detail. We relate differences in pension benefits to employment breaks due to unemployment and parental leave in the individual life cycle, distinguishing by gender. Three different career phases (early, middle and late) are distinguished and respective social policy phases are considered. As predicted by human capital theory, the losses due to career interruptions in the early and middle employment period differ. However, the negative effects due to unemployment in the late employment period are only weak. This finding detects special characteristics of the covered age-groups in the data set. <b>employment</b> <b>histories,</b> career interruptions, pension benefits...|$|R

40|$|Many {{issues in}} {{strategy}} and technology management are categorical. Errors in classification of the dependent variable cause systematic bias in regression estimates. In {{the context of the}} linear probability model, we characterize the misclassification bias as being proportional to the difference between two measures. One is the “bias ” in the explanatory variable, conditional on false negative, multiplied by the probability of false negative. The other is the “bias ” in the explanatory variable, conditional on false positive, multiplied by the probability of false positive. Further, the misclassification bias decreases with the variance of the explanatory variable. We apply the theoretical proposition to an analysis of the effect of human capital on the mobility of scientists and engineers. We show that LinkedIn profiles provide more accurate <b>employment</b> <b>histories</b> than patent records. The difference in the estimated coefficients between regressions using <b>employment</b> <b>histories</b> from LinkedIn and patent records exactly equals the bias predicted by our proposition...|$|R

2500|$|The summary {{described}} above {{was provided to}} the defense along with a companion summary that defined a [...] "covert" [...] CIA employee as a “CIA employee whose employment is not publicly acknowledged by the CIA or the employee." [...] It is important {{to bear in mind}} that the IIPA defines “covert agent” differently. It states: [...] "The term 'covert agent' means— (A) a present or retired officer or employee of an intelligence agency ... (i) whose identity as such an officer, employee, or member is classified information, and (ii) who is serving outside the United States or has within the last five years served outside the United States." [...] The CIA summary of Ms. Wilson's <b>employment</b> <b>history</b> claims that she [...] "engaged in temporary duty (TDY) travel overseas on official business", though it does not say whether such travel in fact occurred within the last five years. Further, {{it is not clear that}} engaging in temporary duty travel overseas would make a CIA employee who is based in Washington eligible for protection under the IIPA. In fact, it seems more likely that the CIA employee would have to have been stationed outside the United States to trigger the protection of the statute. To our knowledge, the meaning of the phrase [...] "served outside the United States" [...] in the IIPA has never been litigated. Thus, whether Ms. Wilson was covered by the IIPA remains very much in doubt, especially given the sparse nature of the record.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the wage effects {{of different types}} of career interruptions. We consider the timing and duration of non-employment spells by exploiting an administrative data set of German social security accounts (IAB employment sample) supplemented with information on the employees? entire working lives (IAB supplement sample I). These data allow us to distinguish between employment breaks due to registered unemployment, formal parental leave, training or other reasons – a distinction which can only be approximated using just the IAB employment sample. Our IV fixed effects estimation results suggest that women?s labor supply is endogenously determined, whereas men?s <b>employment</b> <b>histories</b> can be treated as exogenous. Career interruptions reduce the wage rates of both men and women. Moreover, the wage cuts resulting from unemployment, parental leave and additional home time are larger than the pure human capital effects of missing experience, hinting at a possible stigmatization of workers with discontinuous <b>employment</b> <b>histories.</b> [...] career interruptions,returns to experience,wage differentials,panel estimation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Given the {{acceleration}} of population ageing and policy changes to extend working lives, evidence is needed {{on the ability of}} older adults to work for longer. To understand more about the health impacts of work, this study examined the relationship between <b>employment</b> <b>histories</b> before retirement and trajectories of frailty thereafter. METHODS The sample comprised 2765 women and 1621 men from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. We used gendered typologies of life-time employment and a frailty index (FI). Multilevel growth curve models were used to predict frailty trajectories by <b>employment</b> <b>histories.</b> RESULTS Women who had a short break for family care, then did part-time work till 59 years had a lower FI after 60 years than those who undertook full-time work until 59 years. Women who were largely family carers or non-employed throughout adulthood, had higher levels of frailty at 60 years but experienced a slower decline with age. Men who worked full-time but early exited at either 49 or 60 years had a higher FI at 65 years than those who worked full-time up to 65 years. Interaction between <b>employment</b> <b>histories</b> and age indicated that men in full-time work who experienced an early exit at 49 tended to report slower declines. CONCLUSIONS For women, experiencing distinct periods throughout the lifecourse of either work or family care may be advantageous for lessening frailty risk in later life. For men, leaving paid employment before 65 years seems to be beneficial for decelerating increases in frailty thereafter. Continuous full-time work until retirement age conferred no long-term health benefits...|$|R
