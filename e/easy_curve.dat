He wandered through the trees for some time, and then struck a road that seemed to his urban English eyes to be remarkably wide but not properly [...] "made." [...] Neither hedge nor ditch nor curbed distinctive footpath separated it from the woods, and it went in that long <b>easy</b> <b>curve</b> which distinguishes the tracks of an open continent. Ahead he saw a man carrying a gun under his arm, {{a man in a}} soft black hat, a blue blouse, and black trousers, and with a broad round-fat face quite innocent of goatee.

6000|$|As they thus pressed forward, longing doubtless to {{exchange}} the <b>easy</b> <b>curving</b> line, which the sinuosities {{of the bay}} compelled them to adopt, for a straighter and more expeditious path, Sir Arthur observed a human figure on the beach advancing to meet them.

60|$|For all that, {{he went on}} {{and found}} a strange delight in {{watching}} Barbara. Her clothes harmonized with the soft colors of lichen and stone; her movements were confident and light. He got no sense of effort; her pose was seldom strained and the lines of her limbs and body flowed in <b>easy</b> <b>curves.</b> He thought she rather flitted than labored up the rock. Practice no doubt accounted for much, but something was due to temperament. Barbara did not hesitate; she trusted her luck and went ahead.|$|R
60|$|As he paddled up to {{the point}} where the Rajah's stockade came down to the river, the nipas were left behind {{rattling}} their leaves over the brown water, and the big trees would appear on the bank, tall, strong, indifferent in the immense solidity of their life, which endures for ages, to that short and fleeting life in the heart of the man who crept painfully amongst their shadows in search of a refuge from the unceasing reproach of his thoughts. Amongst their smooth trunks a clear brook meandered for a time in twining lacets before it made up its mind to take a leap into the hurrying river, over the edge of the steep bank. There was also a pathway there and it seemed frequented. Willems landed, and following the capricious promise of the track soon found himself in a comparatively clear space, where the confused tracery of sunlight fell through the branches and the foliage overhead, and lay on the stream that shone in an <b>easy</b> <b>curve</b> like a bright sword-blade dropped amongst the long and feathery grass.|$|E
60|$|THE Coreys {{were one}} of the few old {{families}} who lingered in Bellingham Place, the handsome, quiet old street which the sympathetic observer must grieve to see abandoned to boarding-houses. The dwellings are stately and tall, and the whole place wears an air of aristocratic seclusion, which Mrs. Corey's father might well have thought assured when he left her his house there at his death. It is one of two evidently designed by the same architect who built some houses in a characteristic taste on Beacon Street opposite the Common. It has a wooden portico, with slender fluted columns, which have always been painted white, and which, with the delicate mouldings of the cornice, form the sole and sufficient decoration of the street front; nothing could be simpler, and nothing could be better. Within, the architect has again indulged his preference for the classic; the roof of the vestibule, wide and low, rests on marble columns, slim and fluted like the wooden columns without, and an ample staircase climbs in a graceful, <b>easy</b> <b>curve</b> from the tesselated pavement. Some carved Venetian scrigni stretched along the wall; a rug lay {{at the foot of the}} stairs; but otherwise the simple adequacy of the architectural intention had been respected, and the place looked bare to the eyes of the Laphams when they entered. The Coreys had once kept a man, but when young Corey began his retrenchments the man had yielded to the neat maid who showed the Colonel into the reception-room and asked the ladies to walk up two flights.|$|E

The GNoSR bought up substantial blocks of M&BR shares, and a revised route had to be surveyed, converting the planned coastal branch line to a main line, with better gradients, <b>easier</b> <b>curves,</b> and a location at Bervie from which the line could run northwards.|$|R
5000|$|The Syston and Peterborough Railway {{was opened}} in stages; {{the third and}} last section of line, between [...] and [...] opened for goods traffic on 20 March 1848, and for {{passengers}} on 1 May 1848.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{a method for}} obtaining the {{approximate}} solution {{for the evolution of}} single-step transformations under non-isothermal conditions. We have applied it to many reaction models and obtained very simple analytical expressions for the shape of the corresponding transformation rate peaks. These analytical solutions represent a significant simplification of the system's description allowing <b>easy</b> <b>curve</b> fitting to experiment. A remarkable property is that the evolutions of the transformed fraction obtained at different heating rates are identical when time is scaled by a time constant. The accuracy achieved with our method is checked against several reaction models and different temperature dependencies of the transformation rate constant. It is shown that its accuracy is closely related with that of the Kissinger method...|$|E
50|$|After leaving Bristol, {{the main}} line was laid on <b>easy</b> <b>curves</b> and {{gradients}} as far as Taunton; there is a slight summit at Flax Bourton cutting the line is generally level, in part traversing the Somerset Levels, running north-west of the Mendip Hills and south-east of the Quantock Hills. From Taunton the gradients are more difficult, with some sharper curvature. The line crosses the flank of the Blackdown Hills. There is a summit at Whiteball, approached by a ten-mile (16 km) climb from Taunton, stiffening to typically 1 in 80 in the final three miles (5 km). In the up direction, the climb is practically continuous from Exeter to Whiteball, on moderate gradients as far as Cullompton, then stiffening to 1 in 155 with a final 2 miles (3 km) at 1 in 115.|$|R

30|$|Curves or {{surfaces}} that do {{not provide}} explicit information for precise location of landmarks are ubiquitous. The simple solution is to place landmarks at predetermined intervals along the curve, e.g., at equidistant intervals. Points placed with such a criteria that stay on the curve/surface are called semi-landmarks [19, 20]. The geometry is <b>easier</b> for <b>curves</b> in 2 D or 3 D {{but it is not}} so easy to define semi-landmarks for non-planar surfaces in 3 D.

Unfortunately, such operators are costly to design, and application designers tend to rely on less efficient off-the-shelf operators. To address this issue, an open-source architecture generator framework is introduced.

This paper begins with general instructions for downloading, compiling, and executing the software. This is followed by explanations of the Monte Carlo and next-event approaches, using two examples: craps() uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of winning the dice game Craps, and ssq 3 () uses a next-event approach to estimate several measures of performance associated with a single-server queue. ...|$|R
40|$|The task of {{building}} a description language for audio synthesis and processing consists of balancing a variety of conflicting demands and constraints such as <b>easy</b> learning <b>curve,</b> usability, flexibility, extensibility, and run-time performance.

This paper describes the object-oriented models and design patterns used in version 4 of the CREATE Signal Library (CSL), a full rewrite that included an effort to use concepts from the ” 4 MS ” metamodel for multimedia systems, and to integrate a set of design patterns for signal processing. We refer the reader to other publications for an introduction to CSL, and will concentrate on design and implementation choices in CSL 4 that simplify the kernel classes, improve their performance, and ease their extension while using best-practice software engineering techniques. ...|$|R
