5000|$|In TV receivers, the {{received}} {{radio frequency}} signal is converted to IF in tuner and then demodulated. The output of the demodulator consists of a VF and an aural signal which is in fact an FM subcarrier modulated by AF. (The subcarrier is 5.5 MHz in system B and 4.5 MHz in system M [...] ) The aural signal and the VF are separated by a simple filter. The only extra stage needed for AF (other than the loudspeaker) is an FM demodulator. [...] The <b>intercarrier</b> <b>receiver</b> system makes for easier tuning of a TV station. The viewer could fine tune such a set {{to get the best}} picture reception, and not lose sound reception. (Although AF VF signals are combined in the IF stages of the transmitters, they are separated in baseband stages of the receivers.) ...|$|E
50|$|In analog television, {{the analog}} audio {{portion of a}} {{broadcast}} is invariably modulated separately from the video. Most commonly, the audio and video are combined at the transmitter before being presented to the antenna, but separate aural and visual antennas can be used. In all cases where negative video is used, FM {{is used for the}} standard monaural audio; systems with positive video use AM sound and <b>intercarrier</b> <b>receiver</b> technology cannot be incorporated. Stereo, or more generally multi-channel, audio is encoded using a number of schemes which (except in the French systems) are independent of the video system. The principal systems are NICAM, which uses a digital audio encoding; double-FM (known under a variety of names, notably Zweikanalton, A2 Stereo, West German Stereo, German Stereo or IGR Stereo), in which case each audio channel is separately modulated in FM and added to the broadcast signal; and BTSC (also known as MTS), which multiplexes additional audio channels into the FM audio carrier. All three systems are compatible with monaural FM audio, but only NICAM may be used with the French AM audio systems.|$|E
