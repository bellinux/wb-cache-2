5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E
500|$|An <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> {{has only}} a frame to support the charged diaphragm. It uses ultra-thin {{stretched}} Mylar (Biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate) film as {{the main component of}} its drive units. There are two perforated plates with a potential difference of up to 10,000 volts, between which a very thin film, coated with a mildly electrically conductive substance, is sandwiched. Sound is produced when the audio signal [...] amplified by a step-up transformer [...] sets the film diaphragm into motion. The different charge between the two plates allows the diaphragm to be alternately attracted and repelled by each plate. In the original QUAD, two bass panels flank one treble panel to provide full range sound.|$|E
50|$|An {{uncommon}} way {{of driving}} an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> without a transformer is {{to connect the}} plates of a push-pull vacuum tube amplifier directly to the stators, and the high voltage supply between the diaphragm and ground.|$|E

5000|$|Although the ESL-63 was {{discontinued}} in 1999, Quad maintains {{production of}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers.</b> Quad introduced ESL-988 and the ESL-989 in 1999, and two new models in 2005 [...] - [...] the smaller 2805 {{and the larger}} 2905 [...] - [...] that incorporate electronic and transducer refinements.|$|R
50|$|Discussion of {{electrostatic}} {{speakers and}} the available technology led Sanders and Sutherland {{to design and}} build an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker.</b> Sanders organized a research and development team to transform a design he had tinkered with {{for more than a}} decade into a marketable electrostatic transducer.|$|E
50|$|An {{electrostatic}} tweeter {{operates on}} the same principles as a full-range <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> or a pair of electrostatic headphones. This type of speaker employs a thin diaphragm (generally plastic and typically PET film), with a thin conductive coating, suspended between two screens or perforated metal sheets, referred to as stators.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{tendency}} to attract dust, insects, conductive particles, and moisture, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> diaphragms will gradually deteriorate and need periodic replacement. They also need protection measures to physically isolate their high voltage parts from accidental contact with humans and pets. Cost-effective repair and restoration service is available for virtually every current and discontinued electrostatic loudspeaker model.|$|E
50|$|The term High-end audio {{refers to}} {{playback}} equipment used by audiophiles, {{which may be}} bought at specialist shops and websites. High-end components include turntables, digital-to-analog converters, equalization devices, preamplifiers and amplifiers (both solid-state and vacuum tube), horn and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers,</b> power conditioners, subwoofers, headphones, and acoustic room treatment.|$|R
50|$|These effects {{mean that}} OTLs have {{selective}} speaker load requirements, {{just like any}} other amplifier. Generally a speaker of at least 8 ohms is required, although larger OTLs are often quite comfortable with 4 ohm loads. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> (often considered difficult to drive) often work especially well with OTLs.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} ESL, {{in production}} between 1957 and 1985, has been hailed in Sound & Vision {{as one of}} the most important speakers of the 20th century. It was succeeded in 1981 by the ESL-63, which remained in production until 1999. As of 2013, Quad maintains four <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> in its range.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, Guy Lamotte {{was hired}} as chief designer. He {{successfully}} developed the NA T01 and NAT101 FM tuners and piloted {{the development of the}} Hi-Cap power supply and the −5 modifications to the company's burgeoning pre-amplification (NAC42 and 32) and the NAXO active crossover and the ARO uni-pivot tonearm developed jointly with David Beck. Lamotte privately worked on a prototype <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> design that attracted media attention. It was brought into the Naim fold in 1987, after the Linn/Naim partnership ended. Roy George, who attended Southampton University and who was appointed Technical Director of Naim in 1985, is credited with designing many of Naim's iconic products.|$|E

5000|$|Notable quotes {{about the}} Rectilinear III:"One {{of the most}} natural {{sounding}} speakers I have ever used...""Our side-by-side comparison with a full range <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> (Quad), which we consider {{to be one of}} the finest reproducers available, proved to our satisfaction that the two could not be told apart except in the low bass, where the Rectilinear III was clearly superior.""We have never heard better sound reproduction in our home, from any speaker of any size or price.""The sound of the Rectilinear III was almost perfectly neutral. It had absolutely no hollow or boomy quality on male voices and possessed the light, open, airy character that we always liked in a speaker". Julian Hirsch, Stereo Review, Dec. 1967 ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} similar speaker designs to the Magneplanar. Martin-Logan and Quad Electroacoustics, among others, make {{electrostatic}} loudspeakers, which are another {{variation on the}} dipole model. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> operate on a somewhat different principle. While the voice coils in the Magneplanar are conductive wires or foil strips mounted {{on a sheet of}} Mylar film, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> suspend a charged conductive film between two grids (stators) which move the film. One disadvantage of both designs is that a very large panel is required to produce deep bass. Magnepan has addressed this via the physical size of the speakers - a physically large radiating surface produces more bass. Martin-Logan has addressed the bass problem by mounting a conventional cone bass driver in a separate section of the speaker chassis, generally resulting in a physically smaller speaker than the Magneplanar.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s MartinLogan {{released}} the world's first electrostatic home cinema center-channel speaker and on-wall surround channel speakers, establishing the brand {{in the emerging}} home theater market. It was during {{this time in the}} early 1990s that some of MartinLogan's most popular <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> were introduced, including the Aerius, SL3, Quest, and Cinema.|$|R
50|$|MartinLogan's next product {{began to}} take form in 1997 {{in the form of}} the 2000-pound Statement e2 loudspeaker. The design and {{engineering}} behind the Statement e2 fueled the next generation of MartinLogan <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> (not to mention ML's first non-electrostatic product). Released in 1999, the Prodigy electrostatic loudspeaker incorporated much of the design and engineering knowledge gained during the Statement e2 project. Prodigy in turn inspired a new generation of electrostatic products including the Odyssey, Ascent, Aeon and Theater.|$|R
50|$|The two {{companies}} diverged during the 1980s, {{at the dawn}} of digital audio. This was partly due to the convergence of technology, but also because Naim had significantly fewer dealers than Linn. This presented problems for Linn dealers trying to sell Linn speakers which were specifically designed to work at their best with Naim amplification. Both Naim and Linn began broadening their product ranges and started encroaching on each other's historical areas of expertise: In 1985, Linn launched its LK1/LK2 amplification combination, signalling the definitive end of the partnership. Naim began making loudspeakers and Linn expanded its range of electronic components. In 1987, Naim announced that chief designer Guy Lamotte had been working on a prototype <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> design, and that a product launch was imminent. However, the product never saw the light of day, having been axed because of cost escalation. In 1995, Naim announced the launch of the Armageddon power supply for the LP12.|$|E
5000|$|To {{generate}} a sufficient field strength, the audio signal on the grids must be of high voltage. The electrostatic construction {{is in effect}} a capacitor, and current is only needed to charge the capacitance created by the diaphragm and the stator plates (previous paragraphs referred to as grids or electrodes). This type of speaker is therefore a high-impedance device. In contrast, a modern electrodynamic cone loudspeaker is a low impedance device, with higher current requirements. As a result, impedance matching is {{necessary in order to}} use a normal amplifier. Most often a transformer is used to this end. Construction of this transformer is critical as it must provide a constant (often high) transformation ratio over the entire audible frequency range (i.e. large bandwidth) and so avoid distortion. The transformer is almost always specific to a particular <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker.</b> To date, Acoustat built the only commercial [...] "transformer-less" [...] electrostatic loudspeaker. In this design, the audio signal is applied directly to the stators from a built-in high-voltage valve amplifier (as valves are also high impedance devices), without use of a step-up transformer.|$|E
50|$|Another early {{subwoofer}} enclosure {{made for}} home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45 cm) driver to provide servo control {{information to the}} amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 was reviewed very highly in 1970 by High Fidelity magazine.Another of the early subwoofers was developed during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey.

40|$|Given {{the recent}} {{stimulation}} {{of interest in}} the electrostatic loudspeaker (ESL), one would suspect that this type of speaker is a relatively new development. However, this is not the case; the appearance of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> even predates that of the more commonly found dynamic coil speakers, dating back to the early 1920 ’s. It is known that condenser microphones have enjoyed a great deal of success since their introduction; why then, have these speakers—which operate on the same principle—taken so long to take root in mainstream audio application? On closer inspection, we learn that these unique speakers were, upon their initial release, plagued by unwanted discharges, electrical breakdown, low efficiency, rapid oxidation of unstable structural materials, and difficulty in obtaining thin, manageable membranes—in general, there were serious issues and concerns regarding their reliability. With the introduction of the much more rugged and reliable dynamic coil loudspeaker in the 1930 ’s, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> quickly became forgotten, taking a back seat to cheaper and more efficient alternatives. The problems associated with ESL’s arose partially from an early, crude design, but moreover from a lack of qualit...|$|R
50|$|The {{directionality}} of electrostatics {{can also}} be a disadvantage in that it means the 'sweet spot' where proper stereo imaging can be heard is relatively small, limiting {{the number of people who}} can fully enjoy the advantages of the speakers simultaneously. In 1992 Critical Mass introduced the first <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> for use in the mobile environment (car audio). Critical Mass engineer and CEO Wayde Alfarone's design capitalized on the directional nature of electrostats by creating separate sound fields for different seating locations in the vehicle.|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the <b>speaker.</b> <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|R
40|$|New {{technology}} is usually expensive {{and it takes}} time for manufacturers to make the technology more accessible. In the stereo industry, the first Super Audio Compact Disk (SACD) player made by Sony, SCD- 1, sold for $ 5, 000 in 1999; in 2002 the cheapest of Sony's new SACD players, SCD-CE 775, had a $ 250 MSRP, while the SCD- 1 continued to be Sony's flagship model. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speaker</b> manufacturer MartinLogan developed a technology trademarked ClearSpars for their Statement e 2 speakers, which came to the market in 2000 with a list price of $ 80, 000 per pair. MartinLogan later applied the technology to their mid-price ($ 3300 per pair) Aeon i in 2003. The amplifier manufacturer Conrad-Johnson introduced in 2000 its current top pre-amplifier, ART Series 2, and in 2003 added to their product line a stripped-down version of the ART, the Premier 17 LS, whose price is less than one-third {{the price of the}} ART. The four-wheel-drive vehicle manufacturer Land Rover introduced their mid-price model Discovery in 1986, after they remodeled their luxury line Range Rover in the early 80 s. In these examples, before the firms could scale down their new technologies for the mass markets, they sold only the high-end products; and after the more affordable low-end products became available, they sold both kinds of products. Furthermore, these products are durable goods, and so by the time the firms introduced the low-end products, the consumers who had bought the high-end products were no longer in the market. In this paper we abstract from the inter-firm competition. That is, we assume that the durable goods market is monopoly, and study the quality decision and the pricing of the durable goods monopolist whose first-generation product has higher quality than the second-generation one, which is not available at the time the first-generation product is first introduced to the market. In addition to Coasian dynamics, or intertemporal price discrimination, the issue involves intertemporal quality discrimination. Our analysis focuses on whether the monopolist would produce goods with qualities higher than the optimum. In static quality (or quantity) discrimination models, where a monopolist can use several quality-price packages to screen consumers, {{it is well known that}} a monopolist would discriminate the consumers by offering the efficient quality only to the consumer with the highest valuation, and offering everyone else a quality less than the optimum. In no circumstances could the consumers get above-optimum quality in the static model. [See Mussa and Rosen (1978) and Maskin and Riley (1984). ] However, in our model of intertemporal quality discrimination, we find that the monopolist will produce goods of above-optimum quality in its product line when the discount factor is small. Coase conjecture, durable goods monoply, quality discrimination, screening...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> {{enjoy some}} {{popularity}} among do-it-yourself (DIY) loudspeaker builders. They {{are one of}} the few types of speakers in which the transducers themselves can be built from scratch by an amateur. Basic hardware for complete ESL DIY projects is available all over the web. Such supplies include resistors and capacitors for RC-circuit frequency equalization, if necessary; step-up transformers; perforated metal sheets or grids and insulating plastics for the stators; polymer film and conductive paint (e.g. a liquid graphite suspension) for the membrane; simple tensioning equipment for proper membrane tuning; and a frame, usually of wood, to hold everything together. A widely read resource by ESL enthusiasts is The Electrostatic Loudspeaker Design Cookbook (...) by notable ESL specialist Roger Sanders.|$|R
50|$|Other {{manufacturers}} currently producing electrostatic loudspeakers include Immersion from Australia;, Solosound in The Netherlands, King's Audio, Panphonics from Finland, Pune based Cadence Audio, T+A and Silberstatic from Germany. In late 2014, Taiwanese technology manufacturer BenQ released world's first portable <b>electrostatic</b> Bluetooth <b>speaker</b> treVolo.|$|R
50|$|Since many <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> are {{tall and}} thin designs without an enclosure, they act as a {{vertical}} dipole line source. This makes for rather different acoustic behavior in rooms compared to conventional electrodynamic loudspeakers. Generally speaking, a large-panel dipole radiator is more demanding of a proper physical placement within a room when compared to a conventional box speaker, but, once there, it {{is less likely to}} excite bad-sounding room resonances, and its direct-to-reflected sound ratio is higher by some 4-5 decibels. This in turn leads to more accurate stereo reproduction of recordings that contain proper stereo information and venue ambience. Planar (flat) drivers tend to be very directional giving them good imaging qualities, on the condition that they have been carefully placed relative to the listener and the sound-reflecting surfaces in the room. Curved panels have been built, making the placement requirements a bit less stringent, but sacrificing imaging precision somewhat.|$|R
50|$|Graphene's {{light weight}} {{provides}} relatively good frequency response, suggesting uses in <b>electrostatic</b> audio <b>speakers</b> and microphones. In 2015 an ultrasonic microphone and speaker were demonstrated that could operate at frequencies from 20 Hz-500 kHz. The speaker operated at a claimed 99% efficiency {{with a flat}} frequency response across the audible range. One application was as a radio replacement for long-distance communications, given sound's ability to penetrate steel and water, unlike radio waves.|$|R
50|$|Distortion {{measurements}} on loudspeakers {{can only go}} as low as the distortion of the measurement microphone itself of course, at the level tested. The microphone should ideally have a clipping level of 120 to 140 dB SPL if high-level distortion is to be measured. A typical top-end speaker, driven by a typical 100watt power amplifier, cannot produce peak levels much above 105 dB SPL at 1 m (which translates roughly to 105 dB at listening position {{from a pair of}} speakers in a typical listening room). Achieving truly realistic reproduction requires speakers capable of much higher levels than this, ideally around 130 dB SPL. Even though the level of live music measured on a (slow responding and rms reading) sound level meter might be in the region of 100 dB SPL, programme level peaks on percussion will far exceed this. Most speakers give around 3% distortion measured 468-weighted 'distortion residue' reducing slightly at low levels. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> can have lower harmonic distortion, but suffer higher intermodulation distortion. 3% distortion residue corresponds to 1 or 2% Total harmonic distortion. Professional monitors may maintain modest distortion up to around 110 dB SPL at 1 m, but almost all domestic speaker systems distort badly above 100 dB SPL.|$|R
40|$|Graphene has {{extremely}} low mass density and high mechanical strength, key qualities for efficient wide-frequency-response <b>electrostatic</b> audio <b>speaker</b> design. Low mass ensures good high frequency response, while high strength allows for relatively large free-standing diaphragms necessary for effective low frequency response. Here {{we report on}} construction and testing of a miniaturized graphene-based electrostatic audio transducer.

5000|$|Among <b>electrostatic</b> {{full-range}} <b>speakers</b> {{that are}} no longer made is the KLH 9, the earliest US full-range design. Under ideal, in-room conditions, the bass is well supported down to 40 Hz @ -3 dB (70 Hz under full anechoic conditions) but starts rolling off as high as 80 Hz if the woofer membranes were excessively tensioned in production or due to age. There were several Acoustat models manufactured, and the Infinity Servo-Statik and its successors which used a dynamic woofer/subwoofer at low frequencies. Sanders Sound Systems is the successor to the defunct Innersound.|$|R
50|$|Sonigistix {{started out}} as a project out of the UBC Electrical Engineering company and existed for two years on the UBC campus. Its founder was Brent Bolleman and its first raison d'être was to refine and market an {{electrostatic}} computer product based on the design of Quad <b>Electrostatics.</b> <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>speakers</b> have their own problems due to the need for the membrane requiring high voltage, which is dangerous and has the requirement of a step up transformer, which is costly. The ultimate desire was to have a speaker that looked great and sounded great, so the conversion to planar magnetic design, which had problems of its own but easier dealt with, most notably was the need for rare earth magnets, which were expensive. Much of the focus of the transition focused on how to reduce this cost element and make the speakers more appealing to a larger pool of consumers. The early unnamed company started sending out prototypes to United Technologies. Through this the company made contacts with Woody Jackson a high end audio products expert based in Little Rock Arkansas, and Dave Clark an audio engineer who had ties to Delphi based in Detroit. Clark the task of designing the subwoofer part of the package. Another challenge as the planar magnetic design had a bottom end of 100Hz and it was key to make the crossover design seamless.|$|R
50|$|This {{relative}} lack of loud bass is often remedied with a hybrid design using a dynamic loudspeaker, e.g. a subwoofer, to handle lower frequencies, with the electrostatic diaphragm handling middle and high frequencies. Many feel that the best low frequency unit for hybrids are cone drivers mounted on open baffles as dipoles transmission line woofers or horns, since they possess roughly the same qualities (at least in the bass) as <b>electrostatic</b> <b>speakers,</b> i.e. good transient response, little box coloration, and (ideally) flat frequency response. However, {{there is often a}} problem with integrating such a woofer with the electrostatics. This is because most electrostatics are line sources, the sound pressure level of which decreases by 3 dB for each doubling of distance. A cone speaker's sound pressure level, on the other hand, decreases by 6 dB for each doubling of distance because it behaves as a point source. This can be overcome by the theoretically more elegant solution of using conventional cone woofer(s) in an open baffle, or a push-pull arrangement, which produces a bipolar radiation pattern {{similar to that of the}} electrostatic membrane. This is still subject to phase cancellation, but cone woofers can be driven to far higher levels due to their longer excursion, thus making equalization to a flat response easier, and they add distortion thereby increasing the area (and therefore the power) under the frequency response graph, making the total low frequency energy higher but the fidelity to the signal lower.|$|R
500|$|Acoustical Manufacturing Company had {{launched}} a ribbon-hybrid, horn-loaded [...] "Corner Ribbon Loudspeaker" [...] in 1949, {{but this was}} not commercially successful. The electrostatics were designed by David Williamson, and the company's founder, Peter Walker, from a principle elaborated by Edward W. Kellogg for General Electric that was granted a patent in 1934. However, more immediately, a book published in the US in 1954 extolling the scientific merits of the electrostatic [...] transducer inspired Walker to develop an electrostatic loudspeaker of his own; this was technologically enabled by the Mylar film developed by Dupont that came to market in 1949. Walker demonstrated a prototype <b>electrostatic</b> panel <b>speaker</b> (with exceptional clarity in the midrange), and a full-frequency infinite baffle speaker (with ample bass response) at the British Sound Recording Association Annual Exhibition in May 1955. After more research, the large panel speaker with better response over the whole frequency range was demonstrated to the Physical Society in March 1956. The ESL entered commercial production in 1957, and was discontinued only in 1985.|$|R
