40|$|Lubricants are {{important}} components {{of almost all}} air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Their primary function is to lubricate the compressor, provide sealing of clearances between low and <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sides</b> of the compressor and remove frictional heat. But the lubricant is in contact with refrigerant at all times in the refrigeration cycle and plays a thermo-fluidic role that can impact both system capacity and coefficient of performance (COP). Lubricants can influence capacity by altering the refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficients, and increasing pressure drop required to maintain set point temperatures. Lubricants can also affect the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Â Recent research has conclusively demonstrated that the optimization of lubricant/refrigerant properties can provide improvements in energy efficiency and COP. Â Examples of optimization of refrigerant/lubricant properties for improved energy efficiency have been demonstrated for pure refrigerants such as R- 32, R- 744 and R- 290. Â This paper discusses the extension of our previous techniques for refrigerant/lubricant optimization to low global warming potential refrigerant blends; in particular, to mildly flammable alternatives to R- 404 A (GWP= 3952) with GWP 3 ̆c 150. Â The {{first part of the}} presentation is a comparison between refrigerant/lubricant solution property data for R- 404 A and various low GWP candidate replacement refrigerants with a commercial ISO 32 polyol ester (POE) compressor lubricant.

The trends in solution viscosities and composition are correlated to performance in full system tests that are presented in a separate paper. The results suggest that there are opportunities to improve system performance through proper matching of lubricant chemical structure and compatibility with the refrigerant...|$|R

In the present study, a R 744 based air conditioning cycle with two expansion valves is considered for proper control of <b>high</b> <b>side</b> <b>pressure</b> and quality of refrigerant at evaporator exit. A system simulation model is developed for this cycle considering detailed model for each component. Both the gas cooler and evaporator considered here are crossflow heat exchangers with spiral fin and tube geometry. A discretized approach is considered for developing the models for gas cooler as well as evaporator. Elemental Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) and Log Mean Enthalpy Difference (LMED) approaches are used to model the gas cooler and evaporator, respectively (Yin et al., 2001 a; Threlkeld, 1970 a). An empirical model proposed by Brown et al. (2002 a) is considered for modelling the reciprocating compressor. Expansion process in the valves {{is assumed to be}} isenthalpic. Using the developed model, the effects of variation of various important environmental parameters on system performance is analyzed.
