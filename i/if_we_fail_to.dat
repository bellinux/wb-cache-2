As in either case, some will become a means to saving others, then we are permitted to count the numbers. This approach requires that we downplay the moral difference between doing and allowing.|$|E

"Islam and Hinduism... are not {{religions}} in {{the strict}} {{sense of the}} word, but are, in fact, different and distinct social orders, and it is a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality, and this misconception of one Indian nation has troubles and will lead India to destruction <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> revise our notions in time.

To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built for the government of such a state." ...|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher {{of science}} Elliott Sober once argued {{along the same}} lines as Popper, tying {{simplicity}} with [...] "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, {{in the sense that it}} requires less information to a question. He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an epistemic justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a sui generis existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: [...] "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 June 1935, Ribbentrop {{arrived in}} London. The talks began on Tuesday, 4 June 1935, at the Admiralty office with Ribbentrop heading the German {{delegation}} and Simon the British delegation. Ribbentrop, who {{was determined to}} succeed at his mission, no matter what, began his talks by stating the British could either accept the 35:100 ratio as [...] "fixed and unalterable" [...] by the weekend, or the German delegation would go home, and the Germans would build their navy up to any size they wished. Simon was visibly angry with Ribbentrop's behaviour: [...] "It is not usual to make such conditions {{at the beginning of}} negotiations". Simon walked out of the talks. On 5 June 1935, a change of opinion came over the British delegation. In a report to the British Cabinet, it was [...] "definitely of the opinion that, in our own interest, we should accept this offer of Herr Hitler's while it is still open.... If we now refuse to accept the offer for the purposes of these discussions, Herr Hitler will withdraw the offer and Germany will seek to build to a higher level than 35 per cent.... Having regard to past history and to Germany's known capacity to become a serious naval rival of this country, we may have cause to regret it <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> take this chance...". Also, on 5 June, during talks between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Foreign Office's naval expert and chief of the Foreign Office's American Department and Ribbentrop's deputy, Admiral Karl-Georg Schuster, the Germans conceded that the 35:100 ratio would take the form of tonnage ratios, and the Germans would more or less build their tonnage up to whatever the British tonnage was in various warship categories. On the afternoon of that same day, the British Cabinet voted to accept the 35:100 ratio, and Ribbentrop was informed of the Cabinet's acceptance in the evening.|$|E

500|$|The ship {{spent most}} of April and May 1913 {{undergoing}} repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work. In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, {{to act as a}} supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the hold space in Alaska proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska. McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous.
