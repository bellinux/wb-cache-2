40|$|Electron {{clouds in}} the beam pipe of high-energy proton or {{positron}} storage rings can give rise to significant incoherent emittance growth, at densities far below the coherent-instability threshold.

Formation of halo or beam-core blow up, respectively, are the result. Key ingredients for both processes are synchrotron motion and electron-induced tune shift.
