5000|$|In {{his book}} Shakespeare, Cinema, and Society, John Collick compares Méliès's film to the Expressionist {{theatrical}} productions of Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig, saying that Méliès's use of [...] "multiple exposures and <b>dream-like</b> Expressionist <b>imagery</b> … unconsciously recreated the spirit, {{if not the}} intention, of Appia's and Craig's ideas." [...] Collick also highlights that by condensing the play into a brief succession of fragmentary scenes, Méliès was able {{to concentrate on the}} theme of madness in an artistically expressive way.|$|R
2500|$|The film script {{seems to}} aim at making this an epic film, a [...] "genre" [...] which {{typically}} requires a big budget provided by a major film studio. That Ed Wood filmed the story with minimal financial resources underlines one of the qualities of his work: His ideas tended to be too expensive to actually put on film, and yet the director attempted them anyway. As Rob Craig argues, Wood's failed attempts result in the peculiar charm of the film to audiences. Craig finds that the film has {{much in common with}} both epic theatre ("grand melodrama on a minuscule budget") and the Theatre of the Absurd (characters acting as buffoons, nonsense and verbosity in dialogue, <b>dream-like</b> and fantasy <b>imagery,</b> hints of allegory, and a narrative structure where continuity is consistently undermined).|$|R
50|$|The psychosocial {{hypothesis}} {{builds on}} the finding that most ufo reports have mundane explanations like celestial objects, airplane lights, balloons, {{and a host of}} other misperceived things seen in the sky which suggests the presence of an unusual emotional climate which distorts perceptions and the perceived significance and anomalousness of merely terrestrial stimuli. In the more exotic situation where people claim direct contact with extraterrestrials, the need for a psychosocial approach seems obligated by the presence of at least 70 claims of people meeting Venusians and at least 50 claims of meeting Martians; both worlds now known to be uninhabitable and devoid of any advanced civilization. Hoaxing seems to explain some of these contactees claims, but visionary dreams, hallucinations, and other mental processes are clearly implicated in such myth-based material. By generalization, the other material suggesting the presence of extraterrestrial entities from elsewhere is hypothesized to be explainable by similar means. The observed presence of surreal <b>dream-like</b> activity and <b>imagery</b> or themes based in the cultural environment and historically understood sources reinforces the proposition that the extraterrestrial hypothesis is unnecessary and, by Occam's razor, probably incorrect.|$|R

50|$|Whereas her Lebanese contemporaries {{often take}} on a figurative style in order to {{demonstrate}} the central issues of the Palestinian struggle, Seraphim’s visual language is characterized as having complex layers of overlapping lines and improvisational <b>dream-like</b> <b>imagery.</b> In this way, Seraphim cultivates a shifting reality of infinite depth and creation. Her <b>dream-like</b> <b>imagery</b> also implies the unsteady nature of a long-held memory of a cherished place - {{and in doing so}} she transcribes her political concerns regarding her home through the lens of personal and surreal imagery while also encouraging the viewer to actively participate with the imagery presented. When asked, Seraphim cites the source of her surrealist imagery as memories of her childhood. She drew specific inspiration from the faded frescoes of winged beings on the ceiling of her grandfather's home, and former convent, in Jerusalem.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay on}} Pipilotti Rist's music was written {{following}} her {{exhibition at the}} Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. It {{was published in the}} book “Wishing for Synchronicity: works by Pipilotti Rist” in 2009. The essay argues that Rist's music, in conjunction with her video work, represents a utopia in the present, rather than one deferred. By showing a somatic immersion of actors amongst <b>dream-like,</b> or hallucinatory, <b>imagery</b> and ambient sound, Rist imagines environments where women can play securely and without inhibition, whether in countryside or city. Starting with sampled pop songs Rist then moves to electronic sound with collaborator Anders Guggisberg. Their treatments have close links to precedents in experimental music of the 1950 s and 60 s like compositions by Lou and Bebe Barron, Alvin Lucier and Pauline Oliveros. That Rist's later work frequently incorporates sounds of water recalls the music of composers like Wendy Carlos and Annea Lockwood as well as the practice of sound ecologists like Murray Schafer who advocated attunement to sounds that were disappearing under the sonic assault of urban industrial noise. Rist's videos exclude urban industrial sounds in preference for drifting mixes of water, voice and subtle electronic motifs with imagery of women subverting expected rules and patterns of behavior. In this respect they align with Michel De Certeau’s concept of “tactics” in navigating city streets where individuals unconsciously develop anti-geometric and anti-panoptic trajectories that embody present-day utopian practices...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{proposed}} a novel biophysical concept regarding on the appearance of brilliant lights during near death experiences (NDEs) (B&# 243;kkon and Salari, 2012). Specifically, perceiving brilliant light in NDEs has been proposed to arise due to the reperfusion that produces unregulated overproduction of free radicals and energetically excited molecules that can generate a transient enhancement of bioluminescent biophotons in {{different areas of the}} brain, including retinotopic visual areas. If this excess of bioluminescent photon emission exceeds a threshold in retinotopic visual areas, this can appear as (phosphene) lights because the brain interprets these intrinsic retinotopic bioluminescent photons as if they originated from the external physical world. Here, we review relevant literature that reported experimental studies (Imaizumi et al., 1984; Suzuki et al., 1985) that essentially support our previously published conception, i. e. that seeing lights in NDEs {{may be due to the}} transient enhancement of bioluminescent biophotons. Next, we briefly describe our biophysical visual representation model that may explain brilliant lights experienced during NDEs (by phosphenes as biophotons) and REM sleep associated <b>dream-like</b> intrinsic visual <b>imageries</b> through biophotons in NDEs. Finally, we link our biophysical visual representation notion to self-consciousness that may involve extremely low-energy quantum entanglements. This article is intended to introduce novel concepts for discussion and does not pretend to give the ultimate explanation for the currently unanswerable questions about matter, life and soul; their creation and their interrelationship...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Bash's {{approach}} changed radically, moving {{further and further}} into avant-garde territory. Often shattering the conventions of traditional theatre, and featuring <b>dream-like</b> <b>imagery,</b> his current style recalls the experiments of the Paris Surrealists during the 1920s. [...] Among his plays from this period are Das Nachtgespenst, Goldring, Nachthunde and The Final Thoughts Of Stanislaw Bashkiewicz.

50|$|Magritte’s {{idiosyncratic}} form of Surrealism {{emerged in}} the middle of the 1920s, following a short flirtation with Cubist and Futurist art. The Surrealist techniques and mechanisms espoused by André Breton and his followers were primarily concerned with elucidating <b>dream-like</b> <b>imagery</b> and manifesting the sub-conscious. Magritte's approach eschewed these notions; his art would be wholly rational, and informed by ‘lines of research’, which Paul Nougé categorised as ‘isolation of an object by the frame or some other means; more or less apparent distortion; modification of the substance of the object; change of scale; change of décor’. In The Adulation of Space Magritte has introduced several of these types of manipulation. The repoussoir effect of the amorphic grey structure surrounding the figures frames the truncated forms and obscures the viewer’s perception of scale. Other works from the late 1920s such as La Démon de la perversité and Découverte similarly pervert the natural scale and appearance of objects, whilst retaining an incontrovertible sense of rationality which is preserved by Magritte’s trompe l’œil technique.|$|E
5000|$|Jungian {{psychology}} {{is thought to}} have played an important influence upon the <b>dream-like</b> <b>imagery</b> in the paintings of French's maturity. The highly stylized, archaic-looking figures in his paintings suggest that they are representative of the ancestral memory of all mankind, what Carl Jung called [...] "the collective unconscious". French himself was never explicit about the sources of his imagery, although on a stylistic level, the influence of early Italian Renaissance paintings by such masters as Mantegna and Piero della Francesca is evident, as it is also in the work of both Tooker and Cadmus. On the level of content, he made only one, short, public statement regarding his intentions: [...] "My work has long been concerned with the representation of diverse aspects of man and his universe. At first it was mainly concerned with his physical aspect and his physical universe. Gradually I began to represent aspects of his psyche, until in The Sea (1946) and Evasion (1947), I showed quite clearly my interest in man's inner reality." ...|$|E

I had it all written out. It was about going through, through this land. This mythical ... because that's what I like to do is write a lot of mythical scenes. You know, like the history of the wars on Neptune. So far, only a crumpled single sheet of ruled yellow tablet paper is on exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and does not include any of the lyrics used in the Experience song. [...] Chandler admitted that in the early stages, he helped Hendrix shape the songs and lyrics to radio single length. Biographer Keith Shadwick comments that although much of the complexity may have been sacrificed, it resulted in verses that are [...] "simple, focused and striking." [...] After its release, Hendrix offered another explanation: [...] "He song's protagonist likes this girl so much, that he doesn't know what state he's in, ya know. A sort of daze, I suppose. That's what the song is all about." [...] This draws on an experience Hendrix had while still in New York, where he felt that a girl was attempting to use voodoo to trap him and he became ill.

These show an unexpected degree of detail and complexity and suggest {{a high degree of}} mental functioning during the altered state.

40|$|Earlier lesion and imaging {{studies in}} humans, {{as well as}} {{electrophysiological}} recordings in other animals, have suggested an important role for the thalamus during slow wave sleep (SWS). This structure {{has been shown to}} undergo disfacilitation and active inhibition during SWS, changing its firing pattern and thus altering sensory afference to the cortex during this state. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) decreases are reported in the human thalamus in association with delta (1 - 4 Hz) and, even further, with spindle (12 - 15 Hz) wave activity during SWS. These results support the physiological changes purported to occur in the thalamus during this state. We also found rCBF decreases in association with delta in the brainstem reticular formation, cerebellum, anterior cingulate and orbito-frontal cortex. These changes, together with the thalamic decreases, might provide the physiological substrate for the progressive attenuation of sensory awareness and motor activity that occur during SWS. Regional CBF increases as a function of delta activity were found mainly in the visual and auditory cortices, possibly supporting <b>dream-like</b> <b>imagery</b> during SWS...|$|E
