The spectra of the jet and disc components differ, as do their dependence on mass accretion properties.

This outburst in 2000 was well studied, and both disc and jet were known to contribute. During the outburst the data follow a well defined path in the CMD, describing what would be expected from a heated single-temperature blackbody of approximately constant area, except when the data appear redder than this track. This is due to the non-thermal jet component which dominates the OIR moreso during hard X-ray states at high luminosities, and which is quenched in the soft state. The CMD therefore shows state-dependent hysteresis, in analogy with (but not identical to) the well established X-ray hardness-intensity diagram of black hole transients. The blackbody originates in the X-ray illuminated, likely unwarped, outer accretion disc. We show that the CMD can be approximately reproduced by a model that assumes various correlations between X-ray, OIR disc and OIR jet fluxes. We find evidence for the OIR jet emission to be decoupled from the disc near the peak of the hard state. Comment: MNRAS accepted; 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

Aims. By establishing a relation between the transverse stratification of the jets, the internal shock properties, and the multiple observed AGN jet morphologies and behaviours, our aim is to provide a consistent global scheme of the various AGN jet structures. Methods. Working on a large sample of AGN radio <b>jets</b> <b>monitored</b> in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) by the MOJAVE collaboration, we determined the consistency of a systematic association of the multiple knots with successive re-collimation shocks. We then investigated the re-collimation shock formation and the influence of different transverse stratified structures by parametrically exploring the two relativistic outflow components with the specific relativistic hydrodynamic code AMRVAC. Results. We were able to link the different spectral classes of AGN with specific stratified jet characteristics, in good accordance with their VLBI radio properties and their accretion regimes. High-frequency synchrotron peaked BL Lacs, associated with advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) discs, are consistent with the simulations of a very weak outer jet (< 1 % of the total energy) and reproduce stationary equal-distance internal shocks damped within a short distance from the central object. Flat spectrum radio quasars, associated with standard discs (optically thick, geometrically thin), have properties that are nicely reproduced by simulations of two jet components with similar energy fluxes by presenting a very strong first internal shock. Finally, low- and intermediate-frequency synchrotron peaked BL Lacs, associated with hybrid discs (ADAF in the centre and standard outer), are characterized by simulations with a relatively powerful outer jet enhancing inner stationary shocks near the core with moving shocks at large distance, accompanied by an increase in the jet aperture angle.

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} jet {{grouting}} methodology, {{and the current}} state of practice and research. Current methods of prediction of jet grout diameters are highly empirical and site specific, and do {{not take into account the}} jet hydrodynamics and soil properties explicitly. A rational model to describe the jet excavation mechanism for cohesive soil is presented in this thesis, with the aim of providing an improved prediction tool that can be used in jetting design. The model is based on the assumption that the velocity distribution in the cutting jet is equivalent to that of a free jet with boundaries corresponding to the dimensions of the cavity excavated in the ground. The shape of the cavity formed depends on the erosional properties of the soil and jet expansion is limited by the resistance at the jet-soil interface. It is hypothesized that the shape of the cavity excavated follows the locus of the jet radius satisfying the condition of constant wall shear stress. The model predicts that the limit of jet penetration is reached when the dynamic pressure at the jet tip becomes equal to the ultimate soil bearing resistance. The model was validated by laboratory jetting tests, using soil specimens manufactured from powdered kaolin clay, cement and water. Cement-soil ratios (CSR) of 2. 5 to 7. 5 % were used to produce specimens with undrained shear strength (Su) ranging from 5 to 45 kPa. A period of at least 3 days was allowed for the specimen to cure in the test tank before jetting was commenced. The tests were conducted using different nozzle diameters, jetting pressures, rotation speeds and soil strengths. The specimens were exhumed after completion of each test to map the shape of the cuts excavated. (cont.) The insitu shear strength of the specimens was obtained using torvane and laboratory vane shear tests. Samples were also obtained for density and moisture content measurements. The experimental results showed that the measured and predicted shapes of cut were in reasonable agreement, with the predicted jet width being conservative in most cases. A strong linear correlation was found between jet penetration, nozzle diameter, nozzle pressure difference and soil bearing capacity. It was found that a bearing capacity coefficient (Sc) of 2. 4 was applicable for failure at the jet tip. This value of Sc was corroborated by field trial data. Wall shear stresses back-calculated from the experiments were much smaller than the residual soil strengths obtained from laboratory vane shear tests and correspond more closely to the erosional strength of clays. The model enables the lift step of the <b>jetting</b> <b>monitor</b> to be computed directly. The present research demonstrated that valuable information regarding the excavation mechanism can be obtained by careful examination of the actual cut in a soil formed by a jet. It is recommended that further work be done to investigate the erosional process at the jet-soil interface and the properties of the grouted soil, using higher jetting pressures and soils with higher shear strengths. The effect of withdrawal rate on column formation and uniformity of mix is of interest. The brittleness of the grouted product and its effect on strength and deformation behavior is also important.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{specific features}} of breakup of capillary jets of dilute polymer solutions associated with transition from dripping to <b>jetting.</b> Experiments <b>monitored</b> {{with a high}} speed camera reveal a new scenario of transition and breakup via periodic growth and detachment of large terminal drops. In this regime, thin short jet terminates with large terminal drop, {{much greater than the}} drops usually observed in the course of `normal' jet breakup. The jet is apparently steady-state; the terminal drop experiences a regularly repeating evolution. It first grows while slowly moving upstream; then eventually it turns back, accelerates, becomes much thicker than the jet, and detaches. The phenomenon is specific for macromolecular solutions. Due to capillary instability the primary jet starts to develop the beads-on-string pattern characteristic for polymeric jets before meeting the terminal drop. Therefore, the process appears as `gobbling' of the chain of tiny beads by a greedy terminal drop. Quantitative characteristics of `gobbling' are determined using computer-aided prosessing of video images. The underlying mechanism is discussed and a basic theory of breakup is presented. The dynamics of the terminal drop growth and motion prove to be governed primarily by mass and momentum balances involving capillary, gravity and inertial forces, and the drop detachment event is controlled by kinetics of thinning of interconnecting ligaments that form between droplets. The elasto-capillary thinning process is driven by surface tension and resisted by viscoelasticity of dissolved polymer molecules. Quantitative characteristics of oscillatory regimes are derived from the above qualitative description using mass and momentum balances for the jet and the terminal drop and the theory of polymeric fluid filaments thinning under combined action of the capillary pressure and axial tensile force. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We present {{intensive}} quasi-simultaneous X-ray {{and radio}} {{monitoring of the}} narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051, over a 16 month period in 2000 - 2001. Observations were made with the Rossi Timing X-ray Explorer (RXTE) and the Very Large Array (VLA) at 8. 4 and 4. 8 GHz. In the X-ray band NGC 4051 behaves much like a Galactic black hole binary (GBH) system in a `soft-state'. In such systems, there {{has so far been}} no firm evidence for an active, radio-emitting jet like those found in `hard state' GBHs. VLBI observations of NGC 4051 show three co-linear compact components. This structure resembles the core and outer hot spots seen in powerful, jet-dominated, extragalactic radio sources and suggests the existence of a weak <b>jet.</b> Radio <b>monitoring</b> of the core of NGC 4051 is complicated by the presence of surrounding extended emission and by the changing array configurations of the VLA. Only in the A configuration is the core reasonably resolved. We have carefully removed the contaminations of the core by extended emission in the various arrays. The resulting lightcurve shows no sign of large amplitude variability (i. e. factor 50 %) over the 16 month period. Within the most sensitive configuration (A array) we see marginal evidence for radio core variability of ~ 25 % (~ 0. 12 mJy at 8. 4 GHz) on a 2 -week timescale, correlated with X-ray variations. Even if the radio variations in NGC 4051 are real, the percentage variability is much less than in the X-ray band. Within the B configuration observations, where sensitivity is reduced, {{there is no sign of}} correlated X-ray/radio variability. The lack of radio variability in NGC 4051, which we commonly see in `hard state' GBHs, may be explained by orientation effects. Another possibility is that the radio emission arises from the X-ray corona, although the linear structure of the compact radio components here is hard to explain.
