When Hughes was rejected after just two terms by Lindisfarne College at Wynnstay, Wrexham, his father unsuccessfully offered to pay double the normal fees if they would keep him as a pupil. In 1975, aged ten, Hughes was sent to Bank Hall, a residential school for <b>educationally</b> <b>subnormal</b> children, in Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire. In 1979 he transferred to Woodlands private school in Deganwy, Wales. Despite his parents paying for extra private tuition Hughes failed to gain any qualifications. In 1981, when 16 years old, he took a seven-year-old boy into a derelict house where he [...] "exposed himself and made indecent suggestions" [...] before attempting to strangle his victim. The boy later recalled: [...] "He picked me off the ground and threw me down, he was a very strong man. He wound up astride me with both hands around my neck." [...] The boy pretended to be dead until Hughes left. Hughes was convicted of assaulting the boy, placed under a two-year mental health supervision order, and committed under the Mental Health Act to St Andrew's psychiatric hospital, Northampton, followed by Garth Angharad Hospital in Dolgellau, a facility for the treatment of mentally abnormal offenders. On release, Hughes returned to live with his mother, recently separated from his father, in Colwyn Bay, North Wales.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY A {{population}} {{study has}} been carried out among schoolchildren in the City of Coventry in order to ascertain the frequency of mental retardation associated with the fragile X chromosome. The prevalence of the fragile X mental retardation syndrome in the 11 to 16 year age group (the age of greatest ascertainment) was about 1 0 per 1000 and therefore indicates that the syndrome is a major cause of mental retardation. Estimates of the prevalence of mental retardation in males associated with the fragile X chromosome have ranged from 0 - 19 to 0 - 92 per 10 O 0.

40|$|Is {{the cause}} of {{language}} deficiency in some children {{to be found in}} inadequate acquisition of linguistic rules or is poor functioning due to deficit on some psychological dimension? A group of children in schools for the <b>educationally</b> <b>subnormal</b> were tested on a short term memory (STM) task. Materials were unstructured strings of words and twenty-four eight-word sentences manifesting different transformational rules. Seven levels of performance on unstructured strings (STM) were identified and the degree of facilitation provided by sentence structure of any kind was related to these levels. The most significant result was the differential effect of sentence types at different levels of STM. It was concluded that STM limitations may well account for some language deficiencies. Recent linguistic work suggests an explanation in terms of the different amounts of computation involved in the internal organisation of sentences of the same length. Subjects will fail to process such sentences as make demands on STM beyond their capacity. The notion of linguistic competence (i. e. implicit knowledge of a complex system of rules or abstract objects which are manipulated in the acts of speaking and under...|$|E

The overall incidence was one case per 2500 live births. The cases were regularly reviewed and all survivors except one were assessed at age 10 years. Nine of 11 with extrahepatic biliary atresia died from liver disease by 2 years of age, one died at 5 years, and the survivor has cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Four out of seven with a 1 antitrypsin deficiency died aged 1 to 3 years from liver disease and one of the survivors has cirrhosis. All three infants with intrauterine infection and one with chromosomal abnormality died in infancy. Three children with other associated factors, choledochal cyst, galactosaemia, and rhesus isoimmunisation, recovered completely with no persisting liver disease.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{language}} of retarded children have indicated that their under-standing and use of language is poor when compared with their mental age and that they are more preoccupied with the "here and now " rather than past or future events. Fifty 4 -year-olds, 50 5 -year-olds and 50 E. S. N. (M) (moderately <b>educationally</b> <b>subnormal)</b> children were presented with a story-telling task using a book of pictures. A linguistic analysis was made of each story using a clausal analysis. The types of clauses, number of clauses, use of the past tense, and use of conjunctions were assessed. A longitudinal study of 12 of the E. S. N. (M) and 12 of the normal children was also carried out over one year. The longitu-dinal study showed a rapid increase {{in the use of the}} past tense in the normal children only, and that the length of story and use of tense were far less consistent over time in individual E.

40|$|Clinical {{observation}} {{prompted the}} hypothesis that failure of response to high frequency tones outside the speech range is associated with linguistic impairment. Pure tone audiometric assessment of school children was carried out, special equipment being used to ascertain normal upper limits of hearing. In {{a representative sample of}} 209 children the mean upper limits in the age groups 7 to 12 were about 18, 000 cycles per second, but a significant lowering of limit with age was then apparent, the mean at age 15 being just above 16, 000 c. p. s Further surveys of maladjusted children, retarded readers and <b>educationally</b> <b>subnormal</b> children demonstrated that high frequency auditory acuity is positively associated with intelligence and with introversion. From 484 children tested 20 cases of relative high frequency weakness (HFW) were selected. The group included 9 boys and 11 girls aged 8 to 13, with a ride range of intelligence. These children were individually tested with a battery of eight measures of linguistic development. They proved to be grossly retarded in inferior to 20 matched controls. The most significant group difference were in speech articulation, vocabulary and oral language development. Paucity of ideas, looseness of expression, limited verbal comprehension and general linguistic retardation were also reflected in written composition and tests of sentence structure and reading comprehension. Only in mechanical word recognition was the HFW group's inferiority not statistically significant. The school histories of these HFW children were characterised by retardation or impatient in speech, language, academic attainment and behaviour. It is suggested that HFW is not merely a sensory impairment and may more profitably be regarded as an intervening variable. Attention is drawn to psychological aspects of pure tone audiometry, and discussion is in terms of "Vigilance", "set", response consistency and extravagation. In addition to their theoretical implications the findings would appear to be of immediate clinical and educational significanc...|$|E
40|$|RESPIRATORY {{failure in}} {{neurological}} disease is usually caused by respiratory muscle paralysis; common examples are polyneuritis, polio-myelitis and myasthenia. This report describes {{a patient with}} a cerebral tumour who had respiratory failure, shown by carbon dioxide retention, but {{who did not have}} respiratory muscle paralysis. His respiratory status was monitored by frequent estimations of mixed venous Pcoa. These measurements are easily performed by the house physician at the bedside without distress to the patient. There are three especial points of interest in this case. First, mixed venous Pco 2 was a more sensitive index of respiratory status than minute volume, respiratory frequency or ventilatory capacity. Secondly, measurements of Pco 2 showed that the patient's respiratory failure waxed and waned as his clinical state worsened and then improved after radio-therapy. Lastly, observations were made which suggest a possible mechanism of respiratory failure when the lungs are normal and respiratory muscles adequate. Case History. â€”J. C. Male. Age 18. <b>Educationally</b> <b>subnormal.</b> In August 1965 he was seen by his general practitioner because of diplopia and was noticed to have a right external rectus palsy.

40|$|PART 1. The {{results of}} a survey in one hundred Secondary and twenty five special schools revealed: (a) Considerable support from headteachers and {{physical}} educationalists for the view that physical education can give experience of success to those {{with a history of}} failure. (b) Little concern for the desirability of finding appropriate material and teaching techniques designed especially for slow-learning girls. (c) A lack of both proper facilities and appropriate staff in special schools. PART 2. Experimental work was undertaken with four groups of adolescent <b>educationally</b> <b>subnormal</b> (mild) girls from three different schools, one of these groups acting as control. These groups were given: (a) Programmes of 'creative danceâ€™ emphasising both partner and group experience. (b) Sociometric tests before and after the programme. (c) Behaviour assessment tests before and after the programme. As a result of this work the following points emerged: A. (i) The sociometric status of girls in the control group was relatively constant, although those girls of low sociometric status were more strongly rejected in the second test than in the first test. (ii) The sociometric status of girls in one of the experimental groups (^ 1) from a school with a well established physical education programme was also relatively constant and a reversal of the predicted 'sociodynamic' trend was statistically insignificant. (iii) After a rather more substantial dance programme two other experimental groups showed greater change in sociometric status and the reversal of the predicted 'sociodynamic' trend was statistically significant. B. (i) After behaviour assessment tests, the girls in the control group achieved significantly lower scores in the second test. (ii) The girls in the two experimental groups (as in A. iii) achieved significantly better scores in the second test. (iii) In one experimental group (as in A. ii) changes in behaviour, though positive, were insignificant. Summary In this study there was some evidence that programmes of creative dance led to better behaviour as judged by teachers and to changes in social interaction, as measured by sociometric tests, which could be interpreted as beneficial. 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome, identify problems in reaching a diagnosis, to provide recommendations for improvement and estimate a minimum prevalence {{for all types of}} Down syndrome. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was carried out over a five-year period. Genesis, a database located in the Department of Medical genetics, was used to identify the number of Down syndrome karyotypes including trisomy, translocation, and mosaic sample variants. Age of diagnosis was determined using date of receipt. Karyotyping requests for a clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome were also identified. Patient notes and cytogenetic laboratory reports were used to identify clinical indication for karyotyping. SETTING: Regional Genetics Centre, covering all cytogenetic analyses for referrals within the entire Northern Ireland population. RESULTS: 208 postnatal cases of Down syndrome were identified, 197 (94. 7 %) trisomy, 3 (1. 45 %) translocation, and 8 (3. 85 %) mosaic variants. 112 (54. 8 %) were male and 96 (46. 2 %) female. 268 samples were taken to confirm or exclude a clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome. 185 of these had Down syndrome, 77 were normal, and 6 had another abnormality. 90 % and 100 % of trisomy and translocation Down syndrome respectively were diagnosed on the basis of clinical features. This fell to 37. 5 % of mosaic Down syndrome patients being diagnosed clinically (p < 0. 001). Simian crease, sandal gap, epicanthic folds, hypotonia, upslanting palpebral fissures, and protruding tongue are the most frequent characteristic features seen. Similarly epicanthic folds, protruding tongue, simian crease and sandal gap, hypotonia, and upslanting palpebral fissures are also described in a significant proportion of karyotypically normal individuals, thus arousing a suspicion of Down syndrome. 89. 4 % of patients were diagnosed between day 1 and 7 of life. Of 10. 6 % patients diagnosed after day 7 of life, 7. 6 % were adults and 3 % children. The minimum prevalence was estimated at 167. 9 per 100, 000, or 1 in 595 births. CONCLUSION: In a defined population, with a prevalence of around 1 in 600 births, accurate clinical diagnosis occurred in 90 %, 100 %, and 37. 5 % of trisomy, translocation, and mosaic patients. 49. 5 % of patients had {{one or more of the}} following phenotypic findings: Simian crease, sandal gap, epicanthic folds, hypotonia, upslanting palpebral fissures, and protruding tongue. However, the same six features aroused a suspicion of Down syndrome in individuals with normal karyotyping, thus causing undue stress and worry to parents. Mosaic cases may be more common than previously recognised, and often do not have dysmorphic features. It is therefore a diagnosis that should always be considered in those who are <b>educationally</b> <b>subnormal</b> without a definitive diagnosis...|$|E
