Variation in slaughterhouse <b>husbandry</b> <b>practice</b> was considerable (stocking density range, 1. 0 – 3. 1 pigs m− 2; range {{of time spent in}} lairage prior to slaughter, 0 – 3 h). Brooms and/or electric goads were used to move pigs in all slaughterhouses and in one Dutch abattoir handling with sticks seemed to contribute considerably to skin damage. The level of agonistic behaviour was lowest during the first 10 min in lairage. In the Dutch slaughterhouses, large individual differences in aggression between pigs were observed. Pigs in Belgian slaughterhouses were tranquillized prior to transport, resulting in generally low levels of agonistic behaviour. The percentage of resting animals increased steadily up to an average of 36 % in the Dutch abattoirs and 45 % in the Belgian abattoirs after 1. 5 h. In both the Dutch and the Belgian slaughterhouses, skin damage was higher in the front (2. 3 ± 0. 1 and 2. 1 ± 0. 3, respectively) and in the middle region (2. 2 ± 0. 2 and 2. 1 ± 0. 2, respectively) than in the hind region (1. 7 ± 0. 1 and 1. 4 ± 0. 2, respectively) of the pig. For the Dutch slaughterhouses, skin damage was significantly associated with time kept in lairage (P < 0. 05) and with stocking density (P < 0. 05). It is suggested that to decrease aggression and skin damage and thus to increase welfare in the Dutch slaughterhouses visited, stocking density should be lower and pigs should be slaughtered as soon as possible after arrival...|$|E

Estrus synchronization is the alternative strategy to bypass the critical problem of estrus detection. Synchronization program allows fixed timed artificial inseminations (FTAI) to evade the estrus detection. The most recently developed programs include protocols for re-synchronization following first or subsequent inseminations. These re-synchronization protocols may involve selected forms of hormonal intervention during the diestrus and pro-estrus periods following FTAI, or following pregnancy diagnosis by ultrasound from 28 days after FTAI. Almost all programs involve strategically timed treatment of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).

Indeed, an analysis of the outcomes of murine enrichment studies suggests that both views are accurate, and thus inclusion of environmental enrichment in the mouse cage should be done with the understanding that while the use of appropriate cage complexities can certainly enhance animal welfare and concomitantly provide a better animal model for scientific purposes, the wrong choice of enrichment may negatively impact the welfare of the animals or the research.

40|$|The {{immediate}} post-weaning {{period is}} one of the most stressful phases in a pig's life, and during this period, piglets are usually exposed to environmental, social and psychological stressors which have direct or indirect effects on gut health and overall growth performance. In this review, the impact of <b>husbandry</b> <b>practices</b> on gut health outcomes and performance of piglets is discussed. <b>Husbandry</b> <b>practices</b> in the swine barn generally include nutrition and management practices, maintenance of hygienic standards and disease prevention protocols, and animal welfare considerations. Poor <b>husbandry</b> <b>practices</b> could result in reduced feed intake, stress and disease conditions, and consequently affect gut health and performance in weaned piglets. Reduced feed intake is a major risk factor for impaired gut structure and function and therefore a key goal is to maximize feed intake in newly weaned piglets. In weaned piglets, crowding stress could reduce pig performance, favor the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria resulting in diarrhea, stimulate immune responses and interfere with beneficial microbial activities in the gut. Sanitation conditions in the swine barn plays an important role for optimal piglet performance, because unclean conditions reduced growth performance, shifted nutrient requirements to support the immune system and negatively affected the gut morphology in weaned piglets. Appropriate biosecurity measures need to be designed to prevent disease entry and spread within a swine operation, which in turn helps to keep all pigs and piglets healthy. Collectively, <b>husbandry</b> <b>practices</b> relating to feeding and nutrition, animal welfare, biosecurity and disease prevention are important determinants of gut health and piglet performance. Thus, it is suggested that adopting high <b>husbandry</b> <b>practices</b> is a critical piece in strategies aimed at raising pigs without the use of in-feed antibiotics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{species of}} porcine coccidia, Zsospora suis, when inoculated into piglets, {{produced}} diarrhea, dehydration, {{weight loss and}} death. Gross lesions were characterized by a fibrino-necrotic membrane within the jejunum and ileum. Villous atrophy and variable erosion, often with an adhered necrotic membrane, were seen microscopically. Asexual and sexual stages of I. suis were seen within the intestinal epithelium and oocysts were recovered from the feces. The seventy of clinical disease and lesions were dose-related. In 1934, researchers recognized pig diarrhea and enteritis associated with coccidia and identified a new species of porcine coccidia as Isospora suis [2]. The oocysts of eight species of Eimeria and one species of Isospora in swine have been described [131.

40|$|Assessing how genes {{flow across}} populations {{is a key}} {{component}} of conservation genetics. Gene flow in a natural population depends on ecological traits and the local environment, whereas for a livestock population, gene flow is driven by human activities. Spatial organization, relationships between farmers and their <b>husbandry</b> <b>practices</b> will define the farmer’s network and so determine farmer connectivity. It is thus assumed that farmer connectivity will affect the genetic structure of their livestock. To test this hypothesis, goats reared by four different ethnic groups in a Vietnamese province were genotyped using 16 microsatellites. A Bayesian approach and spatial multivariate analysis (spatial principal component analysis, sPCA) were used to identify subpopulations and spatial organization. Ethnic group frequencies, <b>husbandry</b> <b>practices</b> and altitude were used to create cost maps that were implemented in a least-cost path approach. Genetic diversity in the Vietnamese goat population was low (0. 508) compared to other local Asian breeds. Using a Bayesian approach, three clusters were identified. sPCA confirmed these three clusters and also that the genetic structure showed a significant spatial pattern. The least-cost path analysis showed that genetic differentiation was significantly correlated (0. 131 – 0. 207) to ethnic frequencies and <b>husbandry</b> <b>practices.</b> In brief, the spatial pattern observed in the goat population was the result of complex gene flow governed by the spatial distribution of ethnic groups, ethnicity and <b>husbandry</b> <b>practices.</b> In this study, we clearly linked the livestock genetic pattern to farmer connectivity and showed the importance of taking into account spatial information in genetic studies...|$|R
