40|$|Abstract The {{practice}} of <b>food</b> <b>prohibition</b> or food taboo has existed {{among the various}} local indigenous sects {{of the world for}} several generations. Such practices are usually attached to some myths or beliefs among the practicing population. The myths or beliefs are passed from generation to generation by means of stories, folklores, legends and even religious practices. The Urhobo people are found in the Southern part of Nigeria and they are found in a region that is surrounded by an evergreen forest. The people enjoy a lot of unique delicacies such as “Ukhodo ” (yam and unripe plantain dish), starch meals, banga soup (from palm kernel), and oghwevwri soup (made with dried or smoked fish, bush meat, unique spices and oil palm). But then, the people practice some <b>food</b> <b>prohibition</b> with various reason attached to these acts that have various health implications for the local population...|$|E
50|$|Sometimes <b>food</b> <b>prohibitions</b> enter {{national}} or local law, {{as with the}} ban on cattle abattoirs in most of India, and horse slaughter in the United States. Even after reversion to Chinese rule, Hong Kong has not lifted its ban on supplying meat from dogs and cats, imposed during British colonial rule.|$|R
50|$|<b>Food</b> <b>prohibitions</b> can {{be defined}} as rules, codified by {{religion}} or otherwise, about which foods, or combinations of foods, may not be eaten and how animals are to be slaughtered or prepared. The origins of these prohibitions are varied. In some cases, they are thought to be a result of health considerations or other practical reasons; in others, they relate to human symbolic systems.|$|R

This weevil larva (Rhynchophorus phoenicis F., Curculionidae) is commonly known, and if we except local and specific <b>food</b> <b>prohibitions,</b> it is widely appreciated as food throughout Central Africa. This resource is frequently mentioned in the literature dealing with food consumption in this region, with precise information about its nutritional value. Nevertheless, there exists no detailed description of gathering processes.

60|$|We {{have here}} that {{which appears to}} be the origin, or one of the origins, of <b>food</b> <b>prohibitions,</b> on the one hand, and of totemism on the other. When it is remembered that the old Israelites sprang from {{ancestors}} who are said to have resided near, or in, one of the great seats of ancient Babylonian civilisation, the city of Ur; that they had been, it is said for centuries, in close contact with the Egyptians; and that, in the theology of both the Babylonians and the Egyptians, there is abundant evidence, notwithstanding their advanced social organisation, of the belief in spirits, with sorcery, ancestor-worship, the deification of animals, and the converse animalisation of gods--it obviously needs very strong evidence to justify the belief that the rude tribes of Israel did not share the notions from which their far more civilised neighbours had not emancipated themselves.|$|R
50|$|Environmentalism, ethical {{consumerism}} {{and other}} activist movements are {{giving rise to}} new prohibitions and eating guidelines. A fairly recent addition to cultural <b>food</b> <b>prohibitions</b> is the meat and eggs of endangered species or animals that are otherwise protected by law or international treaty. Examples of such protected species include some species of whales, sea turtles, and migratory birds. Similarly, sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification discourage the consumption of certain seafoods due to unsustainable fishing. Organic certification prohibits certain synthetic chemical inputs during food production, or genetically modified organisms, irradiation, {{and the use of}} sewage sludge. The Fair Trade movement and certification discourage the consumption of food and other goods produced in exploitative working conditions. Other social movements generating taboos include Local Food and The 100-Mile Diet, both of which encourage abstinence from non-locally produced food, and veganism, in which adherents endeavour not to use or consume animal products of any kind.|$|R

40|$|Food taboos or <b>food</b> <b>prohibitions</b> {{are still}} {{controversial}} in ecological anthropology and in human ecology. In the literature, the explanations for such taboos find their {{origin in the}} book of Leviticus in the Bible, or in the abundance of fat found in the tissue of different fish species, or on the consequences for conservation practices. In this comparative study, we show the various interpretations concerning the food taboos observed in tropical societies, including their association to the availability of resources, i. e., the protein coming from local fish resources. We show that, in the Amazon and on the Atlantic Forest coast, fish food taboos, or dietary prohibitions during illness, are associated with carnivorous fish, especially piscivorous fish, and the fish that are recommended for consumption during illness are usually herbivorous or invertebrate eaters. Explanation for this preference is based into the consideration that, at high trophic levels, animals may accumulate toxins by eating plants, invertebrates, or other fish. We therefore consider that fish food taboos may represent an adaptive strategy of local inhabitants of the Atlantic Forest coast and of Amazonian rivers...|$|R

40|$|The Consumption of Unclean Foods and Cannibalism for Survival in the West in the Early Middle Ages. This {{article is}} based on a {{comparison}} of information furnished by the Libri Paenitentiales with that of the Chroniques and Annales. Seven types of <b>food</b> <b>prohibitions</b> werefound, whose goal was to create a division between the pure and the impure, most of them were related to the consumption of certain meats declared to be unclean. It seems that the transgression of these taboos was particularly marked during the periods of severe famine and can thus be explained by the necessity of survival. During these crisis years, the population had recourse to the consumption of carrion, a variety of refuse and even human flesh. Nine cases of cannibalism were documented in various parts of Europe between 793 and 1032. Overly pessimistic conclusions about the behavior of men in the Early Middle Ages should not, however, bedrawn : while the scarcity of food led some people to such aberrations, the struggle against hunger more generally led people to produce more food and to produce it better.

40|$|The {{symbolic}} {{significance of}} food {{may be seen}} in the cultural and religious practices of many societies. This is a detailed study of two cultural and religious communities in the city of Durban, South Africa, the purpose of which is to explore the role of food, its preparation and consumption, in identity construction. This study investigates how <b>food</b> and dietary <b>prohibitions</b> amongst observant Jews and Hindus in Durban preserve and maintain social and religious identities, and describes the fundamental features of the religion and culture of the participants in this study. This comparative study uses qualitative research based on 14 interviews with Jews and 20 Hindus. The study adopts a sociological perspective to explain how their dietary exclusions, of the pig and the cow respectively, are observed in everyday practice and on special occasions, and how these practices shape and maintain group identity formation. Drawing on sociology, anthropology and religious studies literatures this thesis examines why animals that are perfectly edible and consumed by many humans, such as the pig and the cow, are excluded from the dietary practices of these religious groups and how this is sustained in multicultural communities in a diaspora, geographically distant from their communities of origin. The study finds that in Durban the anthropological insights of Mary Douglas remain apposite – showing that ideas of purity and pollution are essentially about boundary maintenance and are found in the classification systems of both Hinduism and Judaism as lived religions in Durban. The thesis demonstrates that whatever threatens the cognitive classifications demanded by these religions is prohibited, lest the categories are distorted. This study also shows that where there are proscriptions there are prescriptions, and these are based on a complex set of ritual practices around which group identities are constructed. It concludes that these specific <b>food</b> <b>prohibitions</b> are not only sufficient, but necessary for the creation, maintenance and preservation of each group’s religious and social identities. The thesis concludes by reflecting on the tenaciousness and power of these forms of human traditions and beliefs in shaping and reshaping a sense of self into the 21 st century...|$|R

6000|$|The {{question}} of the real bearing upon theology of the influence exerted by the teaching of Philo's contemporary, Jesus of Nazareth, is one upon which it is not germane to my present purpose to enter. I take it simply as an unquestionable fact that his immediate disciples, known to their countrymen as [...] "Nazarenes," [...] were regarded as, and considered themselves to be, perfectly orthodox Jews belonging to the puritanic or pharisaic section of their people, and differing from the rest only in their belief that {204} the Messiah had already come. Christianity, it is said, first became clearly differentiated at Antioch, and it separated itself from orthodox Judaism by denying the obligation of the rite of circumcision and of the <b>food</b> <b>prohibitions,</b> prescribed by the law. Henceforward theology became relatively stationary among the Jews,[59] {{and the history of}} its rapid progress in a new course of evolution is the history of the Christian Churches, orthodox and heterodox. The steps in this evolution are obvious. The first is the birth of a new theological scheme arising out of the union of elements derived from Greek philosophy with elements derived from Israelitic theology. In the fourth Gospel, the Logos, raised to a somewhat higher degree of personification than in the Alexandrian theosophy, is identified with Jesus of Nazareth. In the Epistles, especially the later of those attributed to Paul, the Israelitic ideas of the Messiah and of sacrificial atonement coalesce with one another and with the embodiment of the Logos in Jesus, until the apotheosis of the Son of man is almost, or quite, effected. The history of Christian dogma, from Justin to Athanasius, is a record of continual progress in the same direction, until the fair body of religion, revealed in almost naked purity by the prophets, is {205} once more hidden under a new accumulation of dogmas and of ritual practices of which the primitive Nazarene knew nothing; and which he would probably have regarded as blasphemous if he could have been made to understand them.|$|R
40|$|Public health {{agencies}} face considerable challenges {{trying to prevent}} overweight and obesity in society, primarily because a person 2 ̆ 7 s own behavior is often {{the root cause of}} the disease. Individuals make personal choices about their diet, exercise, and lifestyle, so disease is often thought of as a matter of personal, not governmental, responsibility. This Commentary shows how law {{can be used as a}} tool to prevent overweight and obesity (see Table). The tools discussed in this article include: - Disclosure - e. g., labels and consumer information - Tort liability - e. g., inadequate disclosure of risks, misleading advertisements, and targeting children - Surveillance - e. g., reporting of glycosylated hemoglobin for diabetes management - Targeting children and adolescents - e. g., restricting food advertising during children 2 ̆ 7 s programs; counter advertising to promote good nutrition and physical activity; limiting the use of cartoon characters; and restricting web-based games and promotions - Taxation of unhealthy food - e. g., 2 ̆ 2 junk food, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 snack, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Twinkie 2 ̆ 2 tax provides disincentive for purchasing calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods; tax revenue could also be used to promote healthy nutrition - School policies - e. g., require schools to adhere to dietary guidelines and portion size; increase opportunities for nutrition education and physical activities - Built Environment - e. g., limit fast food restaurants, build recreational parks and bike paths, expand mass transportation, and provide lighting and playgrounds in housing developments - <b>Food</b> <b>Prohibitions</b> - e. g., ban trans fat from restaurants Despite the undoubted political risks, should public {{health agencies}} push for strong measures to control obesity, perhaps even banning hazardous foods? The justification lies with the epidemic rates of overweight and obesity, the preventable morbidity and mortality, and the stark health disparities based on race and socioeconomic status.

The National Cholesterol Education Program has embarked on a campaign based on intensive medical treatment of 60 million Americans with high blood cholesterol levels, but the degree of benefit of dietary change or pharmaceutical intervention or both to reduce blood cholesterol values remains a subject of disagreement within the scientific community. Evidence from comparative international studies suggests that to lower coronary heart disease mortality substantially, dietary alterations and general societal changes must be greater than those possible under the National Cholesterol Education Program's approach of physician-centered patient counseling. The nation's priority to prevent coronary heart disease should be a public policy approach, the goal of which is to reduce for the entire population all coronary disease risk factors.

40|$|Under EU {{medicinal}} law, any substance or {{combination of}} substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease {{in human beings}} is a medicinal product {{by virtue of its}} presentation. Under EU food law it is prohibited to attribute to any food the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease. However, if certain conditions are fulfilled, it is allowed to make health claims for foods. Medicines are excluded from the definition of food. A product cannot at the same be both a food and a medicinal product. Authorities in the Netherlands take the position that the EU prohibition on medicinal claims for foods is redundant because every product for which such claim is made, is a medicinal product by virtue of its presentation. By consequence, claims not (fully) authorised as health claims are enforced as infringements on medicinal law. Against this background, the authors systematically and comparatively analyse the <b>food</b> aw <b>prohibition</b> on medicinal claims in relation to the concept of medicinal product by presentation. They argue that the presentation criterion is structural in nature and depends on the overall impression an averagely well-informed consumer acquires regarding a product. The prohibition on medicinal claims is behavioural in nature. In the view of the authors, it is possible to promise consumers too much regarding beneficial properties of a food without actually making them believe that the food is a medicinal product. Thus, they argue against the Dutch interpretation regarding the delineation of EU medicinal law and EU food law and in favour of a interpretation adhered to by most other EU member states...|$|R

5000|$|The dietary laws of Judaism (Kashrut, adj. Kosher), {{in keeping}} with Leviticus 11:7, forbid, among other kinds of meat, the eating of pork in any form, {{considering}} the pig to be an unclean animal as food (see taboo <b>food</b> and drink).The <b>prohibition</b> is repeated in Deuteronomy: [...] "And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you. Ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass."(Deuteronomy 14:8). A similar prohibition is repeated in the Bible {{in the book of}} Isaiah, chapter 65 verse 2-5. From the strict reading to the relevant Torah passage, pork is as forbidden as the flesh of any other unclean animal, but probably due to extensive use of pork in modern days, abhorrence of pork is far stronger and emotional in traditional Jewish culture than that of other forbidden foods. Many Ancient Jews also held the prohibition on pigs above other taboos. In De Specialibus Legibus, Philo of Alexandria, a first-century Jewish writer, relates that pigs were lazy scavengers, the embodiment of vice. Philo also argued that since pigs will eat the flesh of human corpses, that men should abstain from eating them {{so as not to be}} contaminated.|$|R
40|$|Food taboos {{are widely}} seen {{all over the}} world. This is a {{complicated}} phenomenon in which various elements in each cultural area are intricately intertwined. One of the strictest food taboos is based on religious reasons. Grounds for food taboos in each religion are presented in each doctrine. However, holiness, purity, impurity etc. are vague ideas from an objective viewpoint. Therefore, it might be difficult for those outside of a certain religious group to accept these <b>prohibitions.</b> <b>Food</b> taboos are seen in {{the doctrine of the}} Jainism too. Jainism regards non-violence (ahiṃsā) as the highest virtue and has practiced non-violence for about 2, 500 years in India. There are two kinds of food taboos in Jainism. One is intended for the mendicant and the other is intended for the layperson. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify a part of food taboos of Jainism by focusing on the latter. To consider food taboos in Jainism, this paper adopts the following order. In case of Jainism, it is expected that non-violence has a big influence on food taboos. Therefore, firstly, we survey the Jaina view of life and Jaina bioethics. The Jaina view of life distinguishes immobile beings (sthāvara) and mobile beings (trasa). Furthermore, it holds that the hierarchy of the living thing is based on the number of sense organs. In this paper we confirm that these greatly influence the degree of violence (hiṃsā). Secondly, we investigate the prohibited food on the basis of the original text and the previous works. Concretely, we examine the one that is called "Fundamental virtue (mūlaguṇa) " of the layperson. By this procedure, we clarify the next two points. The first is that the texts are divided into four types. The second is that six kinds of food taboos, i. e. the abandonment of meat, the abandonment of alcohol, the abandonment of honey, the abandonment of five kinds of plants, the abandonment of the midnight snack, and the abandonment of non-filtered water are seen in these texts. Finally, we consider the conditions and the reasons which bring about the above-mentioned food taboos in detail. We can make the following conclusions on the basis of such considerations. That is, the standard of the food taboos of Jainism are extremely lucid from the viewpoint of the non-Jain too, because they are based on non-violence alone...|$|R
