5|$|The attack {{force was}} placed on alert to launch what had been {{designated}} Operation Paravane on 8 September. <b>Good</b> <b>weather</b> was vital for the operation, and the airmen waited at their home bases {{for the next two}} days as forecasts proved unfavourable. Meanwhile, the Air Ministry, No. 5 Group and British military liaison officers in the USSR continued to work with the relevant Soviet headquarters to finalise the arrangements for Force A's flight from Norway to Yagodnik.|$|E

5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats {{driven by a}} sail. The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel. In <b>good</b> <b>weather,</b> the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} of AMiBA is to observe both the {{temperature}} and polarization anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background at multipoles between 800 and 8,000 (corresponding to between 2 and 20 arcminutes on the sky), as well as observing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies, which has a maximum decrement around 100GHz. In its initial configuration, it measures up to multipoles of 3,000 with a resolution of around 6 arcminutes. The telescope only observes at night during <b>good</b> <b>weather,</b> using planets for calibration.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, these roads {{remained}} rudimentary {{and were}} impassible {{in bad weather}} and a nuisance in <b>good</b> <b>weather,</b> which limited the economic possibilities of those regions of Delaware and Maryland. The Good Roads Movement in the 1890s and 1900s spurred investment and advocacy for constructing all-weather roads that connected the population centers of the states, although the instigating forces in each state were different. State agencies in Maryland spearheaded the tasks of studying the issues and recommending increasingly effective courses of action. In Delaware, it was the philanthropic measure of a worldly man of one of Delaware's leading families that brought good roads {{to much of the}} state.|$|E

5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of <b>good</b> <b>weather.</b> West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 race, {{officials}} {{decided to}} advance the competition's start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early start date was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9days and 26minutes. That race was marked by <b>good</b> <b>weather,</b> and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted the trail and mushers {{during the second half}} of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{their second}} innings after lunch, {{there was a}} little {{improvement}} for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not {{out at the end of}} the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in <b>good</b> <b>weather</b> on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground.|$|E

5|$|The British commanders {{distributed}} the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade throughout camps around the Reykjavik area, {{to act as}} an emergency force which could quickly counter any German invasion. The British gave their division patch to the brigade, and it was worn {{for the remainder of the}} Marines' time in Iceland. The Marines were joined by units of the U.S. Army and Army Air Corps in August 1941. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade troops spent much of their time in Iceland building infrastructure and bases to fortify Iceland against potential German attack. On 22 September, the British division departed Iceland and command was assumed by the United States Army. During the winter of 1941–1942 the brigade saw no combat and spent much of its time attempting to construct fortifications and drill for combat, hampered by a lack of supplies, communications equipment, transportation, and <b>good</b> <b>weather.</b> Aside from the occasional German reconnaissance aircraft, no German forces came to Iceland.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to land in}} Brønnøysund was a Hansa-Brandenburg seaplane of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service on 23 July 1922. It was piloted by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn Lützow-Holm, en route from Horten to Kirkenes. The following thirteen years Brønnøysund only saw occasional landings, when Norwegian Air Lines started a service from Bergen to Tromsø on 7 June 1935, which included {{a stop at the}} harbor in Brønnøysund. Passengers and mail would be rowed out to the waiting aircraft. The first season the route was flown using a single-engine Junkers W 34. The aircraft turned out to be too small and a larger Junkers Ju 52 was introduced the following season. Flights were dependent on <b>good</b> <b>weather</b> and were only operated during the summer. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1938. All civilian flights were terminated during World War II, although the town would see occasional military landings.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{people of}} the Fanno Creek watershed were the Atfalati or Tualaty tribe of the Kalapuya, said to have displaced even earlier inhabitants, the Multnomahs, prior to European contact. The valleys of the Willamette River and its major tributaries such as the Tualatin River consisted of open grassland maintained by annual burning, with scattered groves of trees along the rivers and creeks. The Kalapuya moved {{from place to place}} in <b>good</b> <b>weather</b> to fish, to hunt small animals, birds, waterfowl, deer, and elk, and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included camas and wapato. In addition to fishing for eels, suckers, and trout, the Atfalati traded for salmon from Chinookan tribes near Willamette Falls. During the winter, the Kalapuya lived in longhouses in settled villages. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18thcentury with Europeans, who carried malaria, smallpox, measles, and other diseases. Added pressure came from white settlers who seized and fenced native land, regarded it as private property, and sometimes punished natives for trespassing. Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the Grande Ronde reservation further west.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was part}} of 1st Parachute Brigade, which by mid-1942 had been expanded into 1st Airborne Division {{under the command of}} Major-General F.A.M. Browning. In July 1942 the 1st Parachute Battalion was selected to participate in the Dieppe Raid, and got as far as being loaded onto transport aircraft before poor weather cancelled the operation; when the raid was planned for a second time the parachute battalion was removed because their deployment was too dependent on there being <b>good</b> <b>weather</b> {{on the day of the}} raid. In midSeptember, as 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that an American airborne unit, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, was to be used during the invasion, Browning successfully advocated for the 1st Parachute Brigade to also be included. He argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and CommanderinChief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach the brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by crossposting personnel from the newlyformed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November 1942.|$|E

30|$|Coatings are {{one or two}} {{component}} organic liquids {{that are}} applied to a prepared concrete surface {{in one or more}} coats. The primary purpose of the coating application is to prevent the ingress of water into the concrete and the diffusion of chloride ions. Different types of coatings include epoxies, acrylics, and urethanes. Epoxies are abrasion resistant and have a high adhesive strength, but are susceptible to degradation by UV light (Sohanghpurwala 2006). On the other hand, acrylics are brittle and normally have a low impact strength. Urethanes have a high impact strength and <b>good</b> <b>weathering</b> characteristics, but low abrasion resistance. The service life of coatings depends on the type of coating material applied and the field exposure conditions.|$|R

Escalating the case into a media frenzy, the senior partners of the law firm are embarrassed by Weathers' behavior and unconventional methods and try to fire him.
