5|$|Most teleost {{species are}} oviparous, having {{external}} fertilisation with both eggs and sperm being {{released into the}} water for fertilisation. Internal fertilisation occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods. This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ. Fewer than {{one in a million}} of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a mature fish, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous. In these, the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development. Some of these species, like the live-bearing aquarium fish in the Poeciliidae family, are ovoviviparous; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo, and when this is exhausted, the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column. Other species, like the splitfins in the family Goodeidae, are fully viviparous, with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta-like structure that develops in the uterus. Oophagy is practised by a few species, such as Nomorhamphus ebrardtii; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus, and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some halfbeaks.|$|E

25|$|The overall Best Global Universities rankings {{encompass}} the top 750 institutions {{spread out across}} 57 countries – up from the top 500 universities in 49 countries ranked last year. The first step in producing these rankings, which are powered by Thomson Reuters InCitesTM research analytics solutions, involved creating a pool of 1,000 universities {{that was used to}} rank the top 750 schools. In comparison with US News National University Ranking. the Global University Ranking is focused on the research power and faculty resources for students, while the National Ranking is only focused on undergraduate studies. Therefore, for graduate studies and international students, the Best Global Universities Ranking <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> reference than National University Ranking.|$|E

25|$|An {{article in}} the American journal for Economics has {{addressed}} the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy {{is the best way to}} make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruist movement.|$|E

500|$|Angharad Llwyd, writing before St Ceidio's was rebuilt, {{referred}} to it as a [...] "small edifice" [...] in a [...] "dreary spot". The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis, describing the rebuilt church, was more complimentary: [...] "The expense of the re-edification was very moderate; the ancient foundations were preserved, the same stones were used, and though the present building <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> one than the former, its style is strictly the same." [...] However, he too thought that the church was in a [...] "dreary spot". The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1851. [...] He said that the rebuilding of the church had been done [...] "on the whole in a neat style", with the inside [...] "very fairly arranged".|$|E

500|$|The album's title Meddle is {{a play on}} words: a medal, and to interfere. [...] Storm Thorgerson of the art-design group Hipgnosis {{originally}} {{suggested a}} close-up shot of a baboon's anus for the album cover photograph. [...] He was overruled by the band, who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have [...] "an ear underwater". [...] The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling. [...] The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water). Thorgerson has expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: [...] "I think Meddle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> album than its cover". Thorgerson's colleague Aubrey Powell shares his sentiments, saying: [...] "Meddle was a mess. [...] I hated that cover. [...] I don't think we did them justice with that at all; it's half-hearted." [...] The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band (Floyd's last until 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason).|$|E

Liberation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> film than critics allowed".

2500|$|Wilson Yip {{stated that}} Ip Man 2 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> film than its {{predecessor}} in terms of characterization and storyline. The film focuses on disputes between the disciples of Hung Ga and Wing Chun martial arts, {{as well as the}} conflict and rivalry of the two practitioners. Wing Chun, as taught by Ip Man, is being viewed as a martial art meant only for girls; Hung Ga, as taught by Hung Chun-nam, is being seen as a macho form of boxing. Of the two characters, Yip commented, [...] "Sammo Hung's character is not exactly villainous, but he's very overbearing, just like his torrential Hung Ga. In contrast, Ip Man is very unassuming, much like his fist." [...] Yip also stated that the film has some moments of [...] "family drama", such as the ongoing conflict between Ip and his wife Wing-Sing.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Ford cites several {{scholars}} who have weighed in against this view, and continues, [...] "most scholars disagree with this decision {{and find it}} the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions". Scholars and readers who appreciate the original order believe that Lewis was simply being gracious to his youthful correspondent {{and that he could}} have changed the books' order in his lifetime had he so desired. They maintain that much of the magic of Narnia comes from the way the world is gradually presented in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe – that the mysterious wardrobe, as a narrative device, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> introduction to Narnia than The Magician's Nephew, where the word [...] "Narnia" [...] appears in the first paragraph as something already familiar to the reader. Moreover, they say, {{it is clear from the}} texts themselves that The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was intended to be read first. When Aslan is first mentioned in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, for example, the narrator says that [...] "None of the children knew who Aslan was, any more than you do"— which is nonsensical if one has already read The Magician's Nephew. Other similar textual examples are also cited.|$|E
2500|$|NME {{noted that}} the album sees Minogue [...] "dropping her {{considerable}} concern for cool and bouncing back to her disco-pop roots", adding that [...] "Light Years {{is all you need}} to know about Kylie in less than an hour: fun, perfectly-formed, not too taxing and occasionally annoying." [...] Yahoo! Music's Gary Crossing referred to the album as [...] "a polished, well-produced yet largely undemanding collection of disco, Hi-NRG, Ibizan trance, funk, 60s film and TV themes and Latin-flavoured tunes which like the Minogue minx's attire leaves very little to the imagination." [...] He also opined that [...] "ou just get the feeling that if those concerned put as much effort into the songwriting as they did into the glossy album sleeve photo shoot things might have been a whole lot better." [...] Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie viewed the album as [...] "inconsequential stuff and as with all Kylie's albums the quality is disappointingly uneven. But the best tracks have an engagingly bouncy quality and taken as a whole this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> record than most critics would like to admit." [...] Select praised the album, stating that [...] "apart from the foul Lloyd-Webber-esque ballad 'Bittersweet Goodbye', it's an unrelenting hoot" [...] and that [...] "it's all contrived to within an inch of its life, heaving with potential singles and brazenly derivative.
