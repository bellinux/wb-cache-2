Named for its chairman and principal author, zoologist and conservationist A. Starker Leopold, the report proved influential for future preservation mandates.|$|E
5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>management.</b> Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the concept}} is {{routinely}} used in {{the proceedings of the}} United Nations, and in the UN Daily News. For example, the UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner states that the challenge of agriculture is to [...] "feed a growing global population without pushing humanity's footprint beyond planetary boundaries." [...] The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Yearbook 2010 also repeated Rockström's message, conceptually linking it with <b>ecosystem</b> <b>management</b> and environmental governance indicators.|$|E

CEMAR Certified Fisheries Professional, Gordon Becker, has requested that the impacts that the EIS should address include [...] "blocking steelhead and other Covered Species access to habitat, altering downstream hydrology and water quality in San Francisquito Creek, introduction, perpetuation, and dispersal of exotic species, degrading downstream habitat, dewatering, and other direct and indirect take of Covered Species".|$|E
2500|$|The {{capacity}} of canyons to focus and concentrate organic matter can promote high abundances {{and diversity of}} fauna. [...] However, variability in environmental conditions and topography is very high, both within and between canyons, and this {{is reflected in the}} variability of the structure and dynamics of the biological communities. [...] Our understanding of biological processes in canyons has greatly improved with the use of submersibles and ROVs, but this research has also revealed that the relationships between fauna and canyons are more complex than previously thought. [...] The diversity of submarine canyons and their fauna means {{that it is difficult to}} make generalisations that can be used to create policies for canyon <b>ecosystem</b> <b>management.</b> [...] It is important that the role of canyons in maintaining biodiversity, and how potential anthropogenic impacts may affect this, is better understood. [...] HERMIONE will address this challenge by examining canyon ecosystems from different biogeochemical provinces and topographic settings, in light of the complex interactions among habitat (topography, water masses, currents), mass and energy transfer, and biological communities.|$|E
40|$|Well-managed {{forests and}} {{woodlands}} are a renewable resource, producing essential raw material with minimum waste and energy use. Rich in habitat and species diversity, forests {{may contribute to}} increased ecosystem stability. They can absorb the effects of unwanted deposition and other disturbances and protect neighbouring ecosystems by maintaining stable nutrient and energy cycles and by preventing soil degradation and erosion. They provide much-needed recreation and their continued existence contributes to stabilizing rural communities. Forests are managed for timber production and species, habitat and process conservation. A subtle shift from multiple-use <b>management</b> to <b>ecosystems</b> <b>management</b> is being observed and the new ecological perspective of multi-fitnctional forest management {{is based on the}} principles of ecosystem diversity, stability and elasticity, and the dynamic equilibrium of primary and secondary production. Making full use of new technology is one of the challenges facing forest management today. Resource information must be obtained with a limited budget. This requires better timing of resource assessment activities and improved use of multiple data sources. Sound <b>ecosystems</b> <b>management,</b> like any other management activity, relies on effective forecasting and operational control.

40|$|Research PaperManaging {{fisheries}} resources {{according to an}} ecosystem approach is an idea that emerged from science and ecology and has now {{found its way into}} the international regulation of regional and high seas fisheries. Several fisheries agreements now impose an obligation on states to consider the protection of marine ecosystems. The impact of this relatively new obligation on institutional decision making has yet to be fully determined but implementation of <b>ecosystem</b> based <b>management</b> is impeded by strict requirements for scientific knowledge. At a domestic level, the concept of adaptive management is providing a useful approach to implementing <b>ecosystem</b> resource <b>management.</b> Institutions adopting an adaptive regulatory scheme confront the challenges of complexity and uncertainty in ecosystem analysis through iterative policy and institutional design adjustments.
