A strong and dose-related induction of peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, and of carnitine acyltransferase and acyl-CoA hydrolase activities {{was recorded in}} liver homogenates of mice fed diets supplemented with different contents [0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 1, or 1 % (w/w) ] of <b>fenoprofen</b> for 6 d. Peroxisomal glycolate oxidase and mitochondrial butyryl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenases were unaffected or increased. Hepatic catalase activity was significantly increased in mice fed the diet with 0. 05 and 0. 1 % <b>fenoprofen</b> but, surprisingly, was not stimulated in mice fed the 1 % fenoprofen-containing diet. A time-related but unequal induction of acyl-CoA oxidases and catalase was observed with the 0. 1 % <b>fenoprofen</b> diet: at 21 d of treatment, the induction of lignoceroyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA oxidase activities were fivefold stronger than that of catalase activity. In mice treated with 1 % <b>fenoprofen</b> for up to 6 d, only acyl-CoA oxidase activities {{were found to be}} significantly increased. Morphometric analysis of the liver peroxisomes in mice treated with 0. 1 % <b>fenoprofen</b> evidenced an increase in size, volume density, and surface density along with a reduced ratio between perimeter and area of the peroxisomal profiles. No morphological marker for very long chain fatty acid deposition could be detected in livers from fenoprofen-treated animals. Our findings clearly demonstrate that <b>fenoprofen</b> acts as a peroxisome proliferator in the liver of mice and do not support the occurrence of in vivo reduction of very long chain fatty acid oxidation in liver from treated animals...|$|E

40|$|The 2 -arylpropionic acids (2 -APA) or profens, is {{a family}} of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflamatory Drug (NSAIDS), widely used in human and {{veterinary}} medicine {{for the treatment of}} the arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders and hyperthermia. The molecule of <b>fenoprofen</b> (FPF), a member of the familiy of 2 -APA, contains an asymetric carbon atom and exists as two enantiomeric forms, R-(-) <b>fenoprofen</b> and S-(+) <b>fenoprofen.</b> The R-(-) FPF enantiomer is metabolically inverted to their optic antipode, the S-(+) FPF enantiomer as result of the action of a metabolic pathway known as chiral inversion.

To test this hypothesis we studied the chiral inversion of R-(-) FPF in cats with toxic hepatic disease (THD) induced by carbon tethrachloride (CCl 4).

H 2 O 2 by trickle bed reactor-synthese of N 2 O 5 and O 3 paired syntheses of inorganic chemicals, indirect 'ex-cell' and in-cell processes for organic synthesis, new electrochemical route by electro reductive carboxylation for producing optically active precurser to naproxen, Ibuprofen and <b>fenoprofen</b> are dealt in this review. Apart from electrosynthesis, waste recovery by electrodialysis or electrolysis is briefly describe...|$|E
40|$|The target phosphoramidates 5 a-e were {{prepared}} in one step from 3 -hydroxypropyl derivatives 3 a-e of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<b>fenoprofen,</b> ketoprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, diclofenac). The products 3 a-e and 5 a-e were evaluated for their cytostatic and antiviral activity against malignant tumour cell lines and normal human fibroblasts (WI 38). All phosphoramidate derivatives 5 a-e possess significantly greater inhibitory activities than the corresponding 3 -hydroxypropyl derivatives 3 a-e, whereby compound 5 a showed {{the most potent}} inhibitory activities against cervical, pancreatic and colon carcinoma cell lines (IC(50) = 5 - 7 muM). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The major area of {{new drug}} discoveries for the {{treatment}} of arthritis is in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIA). Unfortunately, as yet no new and safe drug of major significance has appeared. Aspirin still ranks high beside the newcomers. Indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen, <b>fenoprofen</b> and tolmetin are described and their roles in therapy are discussed. A further group of older drugs receiving new application in the treatment of arthritis is presented. These include penicillamine and the immunosuppressive drugs. Gold and chloroquin are also discussed to put these agents in their proper perspective...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an open study on drug {{acceptability}} are presented using the anti-inflammatory compound <b>fenoprofen</b> calcium (Fepron; Fenopron). The work {{was carried out by}} 80 General Practitioners each reporting on 10 patients, following a protocol that was both easy to comply with and limited in its objective. Analysis of the data suggests that results obtained may be of interest to clinicians, epidemiologists and industrialists. It is further suggested that similar studies should be conducted with drugs already familiar to both practitioners and patients and eventually with other therapeutic procedures such as acupuncture or electrical analgesia.

40|$|AbstractThe {{adsorption}} of macrocyclic antibiotic eremomycin on the capillary wall {{has been}} studied and concentration of EOF reversion has been determined. The combination of coupled chitosan coating and macrocyclic antibiotic as run buffer additive has been proposed for chiral separation. The advantages (time analysis and efficiency) of coupled chitosan-coated capillary over fused-silica capillary have been shown. The effect of experimental parameters, influencing the enantioseparation, has been investigated. Carboxylic acids bearing Î±-C*-asymmetric carbon atom (ibuprofen, indoprofen, ketoprofen, <b>fenoprofen,</b> flurbiprofen, mandelic, 3 -phenylbutiric, 2 -phenoxypropionic, and Î±-methoxyphenylacetic acids) have been enantioseparated with the separation selectivity being more than 1. 04. The analysis time was less than 9 minute...|$|E
