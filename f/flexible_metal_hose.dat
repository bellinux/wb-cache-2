50|$|With {{a history}} {{of more than one}} hundred years, <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> have given rise to other {{flexible}} line elements, including metal expansion joints, metal bellows and semi-flexible and <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> pipes.

50|$|A <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> is a <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> line element. There are {{two basic}} types of <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> that differ in their design and application: stripwound hoses and {{corrugated}} hoses. Stripwound hoses have a high mechanical strength (e.g. tensile strength and tear strength). Corrugated hoses can withstand high pressure and provide maximum leak tightness on account of their material. Corrugated hoses also exhibit corrosion resistance and pressure tightness under the most extreme conditions, such as in aggressive seawater or at extreme temperatures such as found in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas. They are particularly well suited for conveying hot and cold substances.|$|R
50|$|Common uses include {{manufacture}} of rod, wire, sheet, and foil. Lubaloy is a component in such objects as trumpets and cymbals, doorknobs and locks, ammunition, valves, gears, and bearings. It {{is a common}} alloy used to make coins. This alloy {{plays an important role}} in manufacturing tools for use around explosive gases, and in cryogenics. It is used as a test control metal for protective coatings research. Other items include plates, tubes, pipes, forgings, castings, bushings, washers, terminals, connectors, <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> <b>hose,</b> and conductors.|$|E
50|$|A cloudbuster {{consists}} of an array of parallel hollow metal tubes which are connected at the rear {{to a series of}} flexible metal hoses which are equal or slightly smaller in diameter to the parallel tubes. Alternatively, the rear of the tubes are joined together to a single large diameter pipe and <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> <b>hose.</b> The open end of these hoses are placed in water, which Reich believed to be a natural orgone absorber. The pipes can be aimed into areas of the sky to draw energy to the ground like a lightning rod. The remains of one of Reich's cloudbusters can be found in Rangeley, Maine.|$|E
5000|$|Emil Witzenmann was {{considered}} the inventor of expansion joints. [...] In 1920, he applied for a patent for the first so-called flexible metal tube expansion joint, German Reichspatent No. 367 185, from 29 July 1920. From a technical point of view, this precursor of today's expansion joints is a large, pressure-tight <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> with a defined, restricted freedom of movement. In the 1930s, the 'metal hose' or 'flexible metal tube' principle {{was replaced by the}} metal bellows as the central functional element. This design principle - metal bellows with connection pieces - is still the structural basis of modern metal expansion joints today.|$|E

50|$|From 1886 to 1905, Heinrich Witzenmann {{continued}} to develop numerous noteworthy profiles for hose production {{which are still}} of technical significance today. In 1894, he registered a patent for the double <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> consisting of two coaxial <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> twisted in opposite directions. Further modifications of the original form focused {{on the use of}} different hose materials and different substances for the thread seal, including rubber, textile threads, asbestos and wire.|$|R

50|$|The <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> {{properties}} {{are determined by}} several factors: the profile shape, the strip dimensions, the material and, if applicable, the type of seal.|$|R
50|$|Emil Witzenmann, son of Heinrich Witzenmann, {{developed}} {{a form of}} the <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> in 1909 that eliminated the need {{for any kind of}} sealing thread, be it of rubber, textile fibre or asbestos. In this type of hose, the strip edges do not interlock but abut each other and are seamlessly welded together. In 1920, Emil Witzenmann invented the metal expansion joint. This invention was based on the double-walled, welded, corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> (with a wound protection sheath) with radial flexibility. In 1929, it became possible {{for the first time to}} produce metal bellows. These were also developed by Albert Dreyer of Lucerne, but independently of Witzenmann.|$|R
40|$|Single and {{two-phase}} {{heat transport}} {{systems for the}} thermal control of large space facilities require fluid lines that traverse joints and either rotate or move in some other manner. Flexible hoses are being considered as one means of traversing these joints. To test the resilience of flexible hoses to bending stress, a test assembly was constructed {{to determine the number}} of flexing cycles the hoses could withstand before losing their ability to maintain a constant pressure. Corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> and Teflon hoses were tested at different pressures with nitrogen gas. The <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> had lives ranging from 30, 000 to 100, 000 flexing cycles. But, even after 400, 000 cycles, the Teflon hoses remained essentially intact, though some leakage in the convoluted Teflon is noted...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{variant of}} the <b>metal</b> <b>hose</b> {{can be attributed to}} the inventor Siegfried Frank of Frankfurt, Germany. In 1894, he patented the method of rolling a helical corrugation into a smooth rigid pipe. Heinrich Witzenmann had already made experiments in this direction several years earlier, but did not continue his efforts to create a patentable result. It wasn't until the twenties and thirties of the 20th century that the hotel administrator Albert Dreyer of Lucerne, Switzerland, succeeded in creating a satisfactory annular corrugation for the manufacture of <b>metal</b> corrugated <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Stripwound <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> {{also include}} [...] "bendable arms", or [...] "swan necks". These {{consist of a}} round wire coil over which a {{triangular}} wire is wound. They can be bent in any direction and remain stationary in any position. These are used for the flexible supports of lamps, magnifying glasses and microphones, for example.|$|R

50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>hoses</b> resist high {{pressures}} and offer maximum tightness {{on account of}} the material from which they are manufactured. Their flexibility lends them tensile and tear strength. Also, they are characterised by their corrosion and pressure resistance, even under extreme conditions such as when exposed to aggressive seawater, strong vibrations and extreme temperatures such as in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} {{contributes to}} the LNG supply chain {{by the development of}} a validated calculation model for corrugated flexible hoses or pipes developed for LNG Transfer. The model builds upon experience gained by TNO Technical Sciences (Fluid Dynamics) in a large number of flow tests carried out on hoses in a large range of diameters from 4 to 18 -inch. LNG transfer rates are in general relatively high as the time involved should be limited from economical point of view. In large scale offshore LNG transfer, flow rates up to 5000 m 3 /h are applied and in future flow rates up to 10. 000 m 3 /h are foreseen. Typical values mentioned for offshore operations in tandem transfer range from 50 to 150 meters hose length and hose diameter up to 20 -inch. The pressure losses in LNG offshore transfer, but also in smaller scale applications, can be considerable. The pressure loss depends on flow rate, length of the hose, internal diameter and internal hose corrugation geometry. High pressure losses will impose additional requirements on LNG pumps and might result in cavitation at the downstream end of the hose as the average pressure drops below vapor pressure. Furthermore the impact of local boiling phenomena due to heat-ingress and cavitation, possibly effected by vortex shedding along the internal corrugations, is not known. Once the gaps in the data base are filled a validated prediction model is available, which can be used in guidelines and standards. So far the EN 1474 (part 2 : Design and testing of transfer hoses) does not specify a maximum allowable pressure loss and the prescription of the requirement for the test is limited: "Flow rate testing (ambient or cryogenic) : demonstrate that the hose is capable of operating at its maximum flow rate and confirm the predicted head loss " The final goal of the project is to obtain a validated prediction model for the calculation of pressure losses in LNG transfer with <b>flexible</b> multi-composite and <b>metal</b> <b>hoses</b> based on input of parameters as operating conditions and hose geometry. Also input for guidelines and standards in LNG transfer with flexibles such as EN 1474 will be generated, which can be used in for qualification of LNG equipment...|$|R
