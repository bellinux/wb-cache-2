However, in such a phenomenon for ecological feasible development, planning requires an understanding of the <b>growth</b> <b>dynamics,</b> if not people will continue moving from our villages in search of greener pasture living only the aged men and women to farm, this is noticeable in Amesi, Akpo, and Achina towns in Aguata local government area. They major in the production of yam, Cocoyam and cassava through consistent agriculture. These agricultural activities have in recent time suffered a setback due to massive out-migration of their youths to the urban centres, thereby resulting in food scarcity and over population in urban environment.|$|E

50|$|The mollusc {{shell is}} a {{biogenic}} composite material {{that has been}} the subject of much interest in materials science because of its unusual properties and its model character for biomineralization. Molluscan shells consist of 95-99% calcium carbonate by weight, while an organic component makes up the remaining 1-5%. The resulting composite has a fracture toughness ~3000 times greater than that of the crystals themselves. In the biomineralization of the mollusc shell, specialized proteins are responsible for directing crystal nucleation, phase, morphology, and <b>growths</b> <b>dynamics</b> and ultimately give the shell its remarkable mechanical strength. The application of biomimetic principles elucidated from mollusc shell assembly and structure may help in fabricating new composite materials with enhanced optical, electronic, or structural properties.|$|R
