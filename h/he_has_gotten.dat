500|$|To put {{it another}} way, a thing or person is often seen as having a [...] "defining essence" [...] or a [...] "core identity" [...] that is unchanging, and {{describes}} what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. [...] "Mark's hair has turned gray as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> older, {{but he is still}} the same person"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete [...] "occasions of experience" [...] that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as [...] "the essence of a thing" [...] or [...] "the identity/core of a person" [...] is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. [...] Identities do not define people, people define identities.

[...] It's hard to imagine a Suns game without The Gorilla, but for 11-plus seasons, the team had no official mascot. There was one attempt to create a Suns-related mascot, with a sunflower costume. The idea, however, never really caught on. It appears we’re stuck, happily, with this furry goodwill ambassador. These days, the king of the jungle now rules as the dean of NBA mascots after his 2005 induction into the Mascot Hall of Fame. The Gorilla makes over 350 appearances a year with charities, schools, hospitals and local businesses. In addition to attending Phoenix Suns home games, Go has also become a world-traveler making appearances in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. He can also be found around the United States at various sporting events. When the Gorilla is not working he enjoys long walks on the court, high flying slam dunks and eating bananas.|$|E
