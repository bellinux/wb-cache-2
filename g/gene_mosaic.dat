M. elsdenii strains carrying tet(OWO) genes exhibited the highest tetracycline MICs (128 to > 256 μg/ml), suggesting that tet(O) -tet(W) mosaic genes provide the selective advantage of greater tetracycline resistance for this species.

40|$|AbstractPodocytes are {{specialized}} {{cells of}} the kidney that form the blood filtration barrier in the kidney glomerulus. The barrier function of podocytes depends upon the development of specialized cell–cell adhesion complexes called slit-diaphragms that form between podocyte foot processes surrounding glomerular blood vessels. Failure of the slit-diaphragm to form results in leakage of high molecular weight proteins into the blood filtrate and urine, a condition called proteinuria. In this work, we test whether the zebrafish pronephros {{can be used as}} an assay system for the development of glomerular function with the goal of identifying novel components of the slit-diaphragm. We first characterized the function of the zebrafish homolog of Nephrin, the disease gene associated with the congenital nephritic syndrome of the Finnish type, and Podocin, the gene mutated in autosomal recessive steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Zebrafish nephrin and podocin were specifically expressed in pronephric podocytes and required for the development of pronephric podocyte cell structure. Ultrastructurally, disruption of nephrin or podocin expression resulted in a loss of slit-diaphragms at 72 and 96 h post-fertilization and failure to form normal podocyte foot processes. We also find that expression of the band 4. 1 /FERM domain <b>gene</b> <b>mosaic</b> eyes in podocytes is required for proper formation of slit-diaphragm cell–cell junctions. A functional assay of glomerular filtration barrier revealed that absence of normal nephrin, podocin or mosaic eyes expression results in loss of glomerular filtration discrimination and aberrant passage of high molecular weight substances into the glomerular filtrate...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequencies}} {{of the newly}} identified streptococcal superantigen genes smez, spe-g, and spe-h were determined in a panel of 103 clinical isolates collected between 1976 and 1998 at various locations throughout New Zealand. smez and spe-g were found in every group A Streptococcus (GAS) isolate, suggesting a chromosomal location. The spe-h gene was found in only 24 % of the GAS isolates and is probably located on a mobile DNA element. The smez gene displays extensive allelic variation {{and appears to be}} in linkage equilibrium with the M/emm type. 22 novel smez alleles were identified from 21 different M/emm types in addition to the already reported alleles smez and smez- 2 with sequence identities between 94. 5 and 99. 9 %. Three alleles are nonfunctional due to a single base pair deletion. The remaining 21 alleles encode distinct SMEZ variants. The mosaic structure of the smez gene suggests that this polymorphism has arisen from homologous recombination events rather than random point mutation. The recently resolved SMEZ- 2 crystal structure shows that the polymorphic residues are mainly surface exposed and scattered over the entire protein. The allelic variation did not affect either V� specificity or potency, but did result in significant antigenic differences. Neutralizing antibody responses of individual human sera against different SMEZ variants varied significantly. 98 % of sera completely neutralized SMEZ- 1, but only 85 % neutralized SMEZ- 2, a very potent variant that has not yet been found in any New Zealand isolate. SMEZ-specific V� 8 activity was found in culture supernatants of 66 % of the GAS isolates, indicating a potential base {{for the development of a}} SMEZ targeting vaccine.

An extreme form of antigenic variation, based around switching {{the composition of}} a variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, is exhibited by the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei, which causes human disease. The molecular details of VSG switching in T. brucei have been extensively studied {{over the last three}} decades, revealing in increasing detail the machinery and mechanisms by which VSG expression is controlled and altered.

All MPs were competent in systemic transport but required the fusion at their C terminus of the coat protein-interacting Cterminal 44 aa (A 44) of the AMV MP. Except for the TMV MP, the presence of the hybrid virus in upper leaves correlated with the capacity to move locally. These results suggest that all the MPs assigned to the 30 K superfamily should be exchangeable not only for local virus movement but also for systemic transport when the A 44 fragment is present. 201...|$|R
40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are {{characterized}} by aggregative patterns of adherence and are a known cause of severe diarrhea in children of developing countries. EAEC strain 60 A was originally isolated from a child with diarrhea in Mexico and contains a virulence plasmid termed pLMJ 50. The plasmid contains 90, 299 base pairs of DNA and encodes more than 100 genes. pLMJ 50 was marked with a chloramphenicol resistance gene and was shown to confer autoaggregation and biofilm formation, as well as virulence in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Our goal is to determine which genes on pLMJ 50 are responsible for pathogenicity. Tests run thus far have shown that pLMJ 50 carries genes predicted to encode aggregative adherence fimbriae, the Aap dispersin and its secretion system, the AggR regulator and a serine protease autotransporter precursor. A tranposon insertion mutagenesis library was used to confirm the contributions {{of some of these}} genes to C. elegans virulence. Other genes found on this plasmid include conjugative transfer genes, plasmid maintenance genes, open reading frames most likely of bacteriophage origin, and multiple insertion elements flanking putative virulence genes. Plasmids isolated from other naturally occurring EAEC strains have exhibited some, but not all of the genes that we have found on pLMJ 50. Interestingly, sequencing of pLMJ 50 has also shown that it lacks toxin genes located in other EAEC strains.

40|$|SummaryThe Wnt/β-catenin pathway and Nanog are key {{regulators}} {{of embryonic}} stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and the reprogramming of somatic cells. Here, we demonstrate that the repression of Dkk 1 by Nanog, which leads indirectly to β-catenin activation, is essential for reprogramming after fusion of ESCs overexpressing Nanog. In addition, β-catenin is necessary in Nanog-dependent conversion of preinduced pluripotent stem cells (pre-iPSCs) into iPSCs. The activation of β-catenin by Nanog causes fluctuations of β-catenin in ESCs cultured in serum plus leukemia inhibitory factor (serum+LIF) medium, in which protein levels of key pluripotency factors are heterogeneous. In 2 i+LIF medium, which favors propagation of ESCs in a ground state of pluripotency with many pluripotency <b>genes</b> losing <b>mosaic</b> expression, we show Nanog-independent β-catenin fluctuations.

40|$|Enolase {{genes from}} land plants and apicomplexa (intracellular parasites, {{including}} the malarial parasite, Plasmodium) share two short insertions. This observation {{has led to}} the suggestion that the apicomplexan enolase {{is the product of a}} lateral transfer event involving the algal endosymbiont from which the apicomplexan plastid is derived. We have examined enolases from a wide variety of algae, as well as ciliates (close relatives of apicomplexa), to determine whether lateral transfer can account for the origin of the apicomplexan enolase. We find that lateral gene transfer, likely occurring intracellularly between endosymbiont and host nucleus, does account for the evolution of cryptomonad and chlorarachniophyte algal enolases but fails to explain the apicomplexan enolase. This failure is because the phylogenetic distribution of the insertions—which we find in apicomplexa, ciliates, land plants, and charophyte green algae—directly conflicts with the phylogeny of the gene itself. Protein insertions have traditionally been treated as reliable markers of evolutionary events; however, these enolase insertions do not seem to reflect accurately the evolutionary history of the molecule. The lack of congruence between insertions and phylogeny could be because of the parallel loss of both insertions in two or more lineages, or what is more likely, because the insertions were transmitted between distantly related genes by lateral transfer and fine-scale recombination, resulting in a <b>mosaic</b> <b>gene.</b> This latter process would be difficult to detect without such insertions to act as markers, and such <b>mosaic</b> <b>genes</b> could blur the “tree of life” beyond the extent to which whole-gene lateral transfer is already known to confound evolutionary reconstruction...|$|R

Evidence is provided that the full-length transcript, the probable template for reverse transcription, can serve as a polycistronic mRNA for translation of genes I through V and perhaps also gene VI. Expression of all the genes on the polycistronic mRNA is trans activated by the gene VI protein. Reporter gene expression appears most efficient when its start codon is in close proximity to the stop codon of the preceding gene, as for the native genes of caulimoviruses.

5000|$|Mosaic {{coevolution}} is {{a theory}} in which geographic location and community ecology shape differing coevolution between strongly interacting species in multiple populations. These populations may be separated by space and/or time. Depending on the ecological conditions, the interspecific interactions may be mutualistic, antagonistic or even an arms race showing variation in specific traits over a broad geographical area. In mutualisms, both partners benefit from the interaction. When both partners experience a decreased fitness, it is an antagonistic relationship. Arms races consist of two species adapting ways to [...] "one up" [...] the other. Several factors affect these relationships, including hot spots, cold spots, and trait mixing. Reciprocal selection occurs when a change in one partner puts pressure on the other partner to change in response. Hot spots are areas of strong reciprocal selection, while cold spots are areas with no reciprocal selection or where only one partner is present. The three constituents of geographic structure that contribute to this particular type of coevolution are: natural selection {{in the form of}} a geographic mosaic, hot spots often surrounded by cold spots, and trait remixing by means of genetic drift and <b>gene</b> flow. <b>Mosaic,</b> along with general coevolution, most commonly occurs at the population level and is driven by both the biotic and the abiotic environment.

40|$|Metabolic {{control theory}} {{is used to}} derive {{conditions}} under which two deleterious mutations affecting the dynamics of a metabolic pathway act synergistically. It is found that two mutations tend to act mostly synergistically when they reduce {{the activity of the}} same enzyme. If the two mutations affect different enzymes, the conclusion depends on the way that fitness is determined by aspects of the pathway. The cases analyzed are: selection for (1) maximal flux, (2) maximal equilibrium concentration (pool size) of an intermediate, (3) optimal flux, (4) optimal pool size. The respective types of epistasis found are: (1) antagonistic, (2) partly synergistic, (3 - 4) synergism is likely to predominate over antagonism. This results in somewhat different predictions concerning the effect of metabolic mutations on fitness in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The fact that bacteria are largely clonal but have often a <b>mosaic</b> <b>gene</b> structure is consistent with expectations from the model...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic genes {{consist of}} exons that contain the coding sequence, and of introns that are non-coding and {{are removed from}} {{premature}} mRNA after transcription. The spliceosome machinery, a large ribonucleoprotein that recognizes specific intronic features, catalyzes two consecutive transesterification reactions that result in splicing of the nuclear introns and liga-tion of adjacent exons. 1 Such a <b>mosaic</b> <b>gene</b> structure {{is certainly one of}} the most important features that allowed the appearance of complex organisms during evolution of higher Eukaryotes. 2 Indeed, land plants and animals, including humans, have intron-rich genomes (> 3 introns per kb coding sequence) as compared with more simple organisms such as most fungi (< 3 introns per kb coding sequence). 3, 4 Yet, more than 30 y after their discovery, the origin of spliceosomal introns is still unknown. Analyses of gain and loss of introns in diverse eukaryotic lineages kept th...|$|R
