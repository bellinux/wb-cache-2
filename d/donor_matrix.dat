40|$|The {{efficacy}} of existing articular cartilage defect repair strategies are limited. Native cartilage tissue forms via {{a series of}} exquisitely orchestrated morphogenic events spanning through gestation into early childhood. However, defect repair must be achieved in a non-ideal microenvironment over an accelerated time-frame compatible with the normal life of an adult patient. Scaffolds formed from decellularized tissues are commonly utilized to enable the rapid and accurate repair of tissues such as skin, bladder and heart valves. The intact extracellular matrix remaining following the decellularization of these relatively low-matrix-density tissues is able to rapidly and accurately guide host cell repopulation. By contrast, the extraordinary density of cartilage matrix limits both the initial decellularization of donor material {{as well as its}} subsequent repopulation. Repopulation of donor cartilage matrix is generally limited to the periphery, with repopulation of lacunae deeper within the matrix mass being highly inefficient. Herein, we review the relevant literature and discuss the trend toward the use of decellularized donor cartilage matrix of microscopic dimensions. We show that 2 -µm microparticles of <b>donor</b> <b>matrix</b> are rapidly integrate with articular chondrocytes, forming a robust cartilage-like composites with enhanced chondrogenic gene expression.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether nitroglycerin (NTG) treatment affects matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene expression and activities in human macrophages. BackgroundNitroglycerin {{is one of the}} most frequently used therapeutic agents for the symptomatic relief of stable or unstable coronary artery disease; however, its effects on vascular biology are poorly characterized. Despite its powerful vasodilator activity, NTG has not been shown to improve outcomes in coronary disease. We now describe evidence that NTG has potentially pro-inflammatory effects in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). MethodsHuman monocytes were isolated from whole blood by elutriation and allowed to differentiate into macrophages over eight to 10 days. The MDMs were then treated for 4 or 24 h with control media, pharmacologically relevant doses of NTG or other nitric oxide <b>donors.</b> <b>Matrix</b> metalloproteinase activity was measured by zymography, protein levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels were quantified by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. ResultsThe major MMP expressed by MDMs was MMP- 9. Nitroglycerin treatment stimulated a dose-dependent increase in MMP- 9 mRNA levels (NTG 200 pmol: 193 ± 6 % and NTG 2, 000 pmol: 372 ± 9 % compared to controls, p < 0. 005) and MMP- 9 activity (NTG 200 : 142 ± 5. 5 % and NTG 2, 000 : 167 ± 11 % compared to controls, p < 0. 005). Nitroglycerin 2, 000 pmol also increased MMP- 2 and MMP- 7 mRNA levels to 187 ± 8 % and 183 ± 21 % of control values, respectively (p < 0. 05). Furthermore, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 1 (the major tissue inhibitor of MMPs) mRNA and protein levels were decreased in NTG 2, 000 pmol-treated MDMs compared with control cells (mRNA: 67 ± 7 %, p < 0. 005; protein: 45 ± 5 %, p < 0. 005). ConclusionsNitroglycerin in pharmacologically relevant concentrations activates MMP but represses TIMP expression in human macrophages. The subsequent imbalance in MMP/TIMP expression associated with NTG treatment could promote matrix degradation, with potentially adverse effects on plaque stability...|$|R

40|$|We {{and others}} have {{published}} on the rapid manufacture of micropellet tissues, typically formed from 100 – 500 cells each. The micropellet geometry enhances cellular biological properties, {{and in many cases}} the micropellets can subsequently be utilized as building blocks to assemble complex macrotissues. Generally, micropellets are formed from cells alone, however when replicating matrix-rich tissues such as cartilage it would be ideal if ma-trix or biomaterials supplements could be incorporated directly into the micropellet during the manufacturing process. Herein we describe a method to efficiently incorporate donor cartilage matrix into tissue engineered cartilage micropellets. We lyophilized bovine carti-lage matrix, and then shattered it into microscopic pieces having average dimensions < 10 μm diameter; we termed this microscopic <b>donor</b> <b>matrix</b> “cartilage dust (CD) ”. Using a microwell platform, we show that ~ 0. 83 μg CD can be rapidly and efficiently incorporated into single multicellular aggregates formed from 180 bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stro-mal cells (MSC) each.

40|$|Power-conversion {{efficiencies}} {{of organic}} heterojunction solar cells {{can be increased}} by using semiconducting donor–acceptor materials with complementary absorption spectra extending to the near-infrared region. Here, we used continuous wave fluorescence and absorption, as well as nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study the initial charge transfer step for blends of a donor poly(p-phenylenevinylene) derivative and low-band gap cyanine dyes serving as electron acceptors. Electron transfer is the dominant relaxation process after photoexcitation of the donor. Hole transfer after cyanine photoexcitation occurs with an efficiency close to unity up to dye concentrations of B 30 wt%. Cyanines present an efficient self-quenching mechanism of their fluorescence, and for higher dye loadings in the blend, or pure cyanine films, this process effectively reduces the hole transfer. Comparison between dye emission in an inert polystyrene matrix and the <b>donor</b> <b>matrix</b> allowed us to separate the influence of self-quenching and charge transfer mechanisms. Favorable photovoltaic bilayer performance, including high open-circuit voltages of B 1 V confirmed the results from optical experiments. The characteristics of solar cells using different dyes also highlighted the need for balanced adjustment of the energy levels and their offsets at the heterojunction when using low-bandgap materials, and accentuated important effects of interface interactions and solid-state packing on charge generation and transport...|$|E

Central to the recent first successful use of stem cells to create an organ replacement in man was our development of a bioreactor environment. Critical design features were the abilities to drive the growth of two different cell types, to support 3 D maturation, to maintain biomechanical and biological properties and to provide appropriate hydrodynamic stimuli and adequate mass transport. An analytical model was developed and applied to predict oxygen profiles in the bioreactor-cultured organ construct and in the culture media, comparing representative culture configurations and operating conditions. Autologous respiratory epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs, then differentiated into chondrocytes) were isolated, characterized and expanded. Both cell types were seeded and cultured onto a decellularized human <b>donor</b> tracheal <b>matrix</b> within the bioreactor. One year post-operatively, graft and patient are healthy, and biopsies confirm angiogenesis, viable epithelial cells and chondrocytes.

40|$|Osteochondral defects of the talus pose a {{difficult}} therapeutic challenge. An experimental animal {{model of the}} ankle joint is not available. The {{aim of this study}} was to test a newly developed animal model for osteochondral defects of the ankle in vivo. Osteochondral defects were created in the talus of goat hind legs using a posterolateral surgical approach. The defects were filled with either autologous cancellous bone or <b>donor</b> demineralized bone <b>matrix</b> or left empty as control. After 12 weeks of healing, the specimens were analyzed with radiography, macroscopy, microcomputed tomography, histology, histomorphometry, and fluorescence microscopy. It was possible to create a standardized defect in each talus. The implanted material remained in place. The analyses showed that most bony tissue was generated in the defects filled with autologous bone and least in the control defects. Our findings show that a standard osteochondral defect can be created in the talus by a relatively simple procedure in a large animal that allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The model can be used in future experiments to investigate alternative treatment methods before they are introduced into clinical practic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{performances}} {{of two different}} controlled-release systems were analyzed. In a reservoir-type drug-delivery patch, the transdermal flux {{is influenced by the}} properties of the membrane. A constant thermodynamic drug activity is preserved in the <b>donor</b> compartment. Monolithic <b>matrices</b> are among the most inexpensive systems used to direct drug delivery. In these structures, the active pharmaceutical ingredients are encapsulated within a polymeric material. Despite the popularity of these two devices, to tailor the properties of the polymer and additives to specific transient behaviors can be challenging and time-consuming. The heuristic approaches often considered to select the vehicle formulation provide limited insight into key permeation mechanisms making it difficult to predict the device performance. In this contribution, a method to calculate the flux response time in a system consisting of a reservoir and a polymeric membrane was proposed and confirmed. Nearly 8. 60 h passed before the metoprolol delivery rate reached ninety-eight percent of its final value. An expression was derived for the time it took to transport the active pharmaceutical ingredient out of the polymer. Ninety-eight percent of alpha-tocopherol acetate was released in 461. 4 h following application to the skin. The effective time constant can be computed to help develop optimum design strategies...|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles are {{interesting}} systems to study {{because of their}} large range of potential uses in biological imaging and sensing. We investigated molecular nanoparticles formed by fast injection of a small volume of molecularly dissolved fluorene-derivative amphiphilic molecules into a polar solvent, which resulted in solid spherical particles of ∼ 80 nm diameter with high stability. Energy transfer {{studies were carried out}} on two-component nanoparticles that contained mixtures of donor and acceptor amphiphiles of various fractions. We conducted time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on the two-component nanoparticles in order to determine whether the fundamental donor-acceptor interaction parameter (the Förster radius) depends on the acceptor concentration. The Förster radius was found to be large for very low incorporated acceptor fractions (< 0. 1 %), but it declined with increasing concentration. These changes were concomitant with shifts in the acceptor emission and absorption circular dichroism spectra that indicated an increasing clustering of acceptors into domains as their fraction was raised. In addition, for acceptor fractions below 2 % the extracted Förster radii were found to be significantly larger than predicted from donor-acceptor spectral overlap calculations, in accordance with efficient excitation diffusion within the <b>donor</b> <b>matrix,</b> aiding the overall transfer to acceptors. We conclude that energy transfer in two-component nanoparticles shows a complex interplay between phase segregation of the constituent donor and acceptor molecules and excitation diffusion within their domains...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: {{to develop}} a graft bearing an immunologically tolerated tissue-engineered venous valve (TE graft) that will be {{incorporated}} into a native vessel, and restore normal valve function {{for the treatment of}} chronic venous insufficiency. Methods: twenty-four TE grafts were grown using decellularised allogeneic ovine veins as <b>donor</b> <b>matrix,</b> which was subsequently repopulated with the future recipient's myofibroblasts (MFB) and endothelial cells (EC). TE grafts were implanted into the external jugular vein. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 6, and 12 weeks (n = 4, each). Autografts served as controls (1 week, n = 4; 6 weeks, n = 4). Specimen for histology and immunohistochemistry were taken. Results: the matrix was successfully repopulated with MFB and EC (n = 8). Patency on venography in the TE graft-group was 4 / 4, 4 / 4, and¾ at 1, 6, and 12 weeks, and 4 / 4 (4 / 4) in autografts at 1 (6) weeks, respectively. Except for 2 TE grafts after 12 weeks, valves were competent (duplex ultrasound). Patent TE grafts were merely distinguishable from autografts with minor inflammatory reactions. Reflux was caused by neo-intima formation related to the basis of the TE graft. Conclusion: acellularisation and consecutive in vitro autogeneic re-seeding of valved venous conduits can lead to immunologically acceptable, patent, and competent implants in sheep.

40|$|Liver {{transplantation}} (LTx) is {{the standard}} therapy for patients with terminal liver failure. Nonetheless long-term survival is still affected by serious side effects of immunosuppression. Hepatocyte transplantation (HcTx), a possible alternative to LTx until now has not shown long-lasting clinical success. The {{aim of this study}} was to create a novel rat model for investigating the feasibility of combining an orthotopic LTx and transplantation of autologous liver cells isolated from the patient’s own diseased liver. Therefore, we performed allogeneic LTx with Retrorsin-pretreated liver grafts from female donors (Dark Agouti) into female recipients (Lewis). Following this procedure syngeneic hepatocytes and hepatic progenitor cells (hPC) were isolated from 2 -AAF/PH -preconditioned male Lewis rats and these combined liver cells were transplanted into the recipient’s spleen (cLCTx). Once these cells have engrafted, it is postulated that these syngenic cells will repopulate the allogeneic liver graft as they have a selective advantage over the donor tissue. It is hypothesized that this will lead to a neo-hybrid liver graft (NHL), reducing the necessity of immunosuppression and possibly inducing tolerance to both the entire engrafted tissue and the allogeneic <b>donor</b> <b>matrix.</b> Aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the feasibility of the NHL concept in the Dark Agouti/Lewis rat model under stable immunosuppression (cyclosporin A). Animals were sacrificed at four different time-points (day 8, 15, 30, 90) after LTx. In order to analyse the degree of cell engraftment and repopulation, Y-chromosome detection of transplanted male cells was performed by Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation (FisH). Immunohistochemical analyses of hPC specific markers (OV- 6, Thy- 1 and EpCam) in combination with proliferation specific staining (PCNA) were used to identify transplanted cells. Correlating immunohistochemical results of hPC specific markers and proliferation stains with FisH demonstrated efficient engraftment of transplanted cells. The results of FisH-based detection of the transplanted liver cells were as follows: day 8 with 7. 75 % +/- 0. 79 % SEM, day 15 7. 97 % +/- 0. 85 % SEM, day 30 10. 20 % +/- 0. 91 % SEM and day 90 with 19. 61 % +/- 0. 78 % SEM after combined cLCTx and LTx. The percentage of Y-chromosome-positive cell nuclei obtained on day 8, 15 and 30 each demonstrated significant difference (p < 0, 001) in comparison to day 90. The increasing quantity of Y-chromosome-positive cell nuclei detected during follow-up confirmed successful repopulation of the liver graft and thus leading to the establishment of a NHL. Animals surviving the first 3 days after combined liver transplantation and liver cell transplantation (cLTx) showed stable liver function until they were sacrificed. Survival rate after cLTx (n= 29) was 75. 86 % thus underlining the feasibility of this newly established rat model. The Neo-Hybrid Livergraft therefore provides a valuable foundation for future experimental research models regarding the induction of operational tolerance...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesPatients with {{bicuspid}} aortic valves (BAV) are {{predisposed to}} developing ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) {{at an earlier}} age than patients who develop degenerative TAAs and have a tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). The hypothesis tested is that BAV-associated aortopathy is mediated by a mechanism of matrix remodeling that is distinct from that seen in TAAs of patients with tricuspid aortic valves. MethodsAortic specimens were collected during ascending aortic replacement, aortic valve replacement, and heart transplants from nonaneurysmal (NA) <b>donors</b> and recipients. <b>Matrix</b> architecture of the aortic media was assessed qualitatively using multiphoton microscopy followed by quantification of collagen and elastin fiber orientation. α-Elastin was determined and matrix maturity was assessed by quantifying immature and mature collagen and lysyl oxidase (Lox) expression and activity in aortic specimens. Matrix metalloproteinase- 2 / 9 activity was quantified in aortic smooth muscle cells. ResultsElastin and collagen fibers were more highly aligned in BAV-NA and BAV-TAA cases than in TAV-TAA cases, whereas TAV-TAA cases were more disorganized than TAV-NA cases. α-Elastin content was unchanged. Immature collagen was reduced in BAV-NA and BAV-TAA cases when compared with TAV-NA and TAV-TAA cases. Mature collagen was elevated in TAV-TAA cases compared with TAV-NA and BAV-TAA cases. There was a trend toward elevated Lox gene expression and activity and matrix metalloproteinase- 2 / 9 activity for TAV-TAA, BAV-NA, and BAV-TAA specimens. ConclusionsThe highly aligned matrix architecture in patients with BAVs indicates that wall remodeling is distinct from TAV-TAA. Altered matrix architecture and reduced collagen maturity suggest that the effector molecules mediating the remodeling of TAAs are different in BAV and TAV cases...|$|R
40|$|Layers {{composed}} of binary blends of a polymer and a fullerene derivative {{are at the}} heart of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells. The efficiency and stability of these devices critically depend on the distribution of the polymer and fullerene materials within the blend layer. Whereas time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, particularly in combination with cluster ion beams, has frequently been used to probe similar organic materials, the quantification of the results is often missing due to a lack of understanding of all the parameters influencing the measurement results. This study contributes to improved quantification by exploring the role of the bulk composition and interfacial material on parameters such as sputtering yield, mass fragmentation, and ionization. We show that the argon cluster sputtering yields of these materials may be described by two widely acknowledged sputtering yield relationships. Their fitting parameters depend on the layer composition in a manner that is consistent with a lower energy required for sputtering of layers with higher fullerene derivative content. Similarly, we show that changes in composition impact the ion yields nonlinearly, which is an important source of quantification uncertainty. We provide evidence that, for the case of the fullerene derivative mixed with different <b>donor</b> materials, the <b>matrix</b> effect (i. e., the deviation from a linear response) correlates linearly with the electronegativity of the species in the donor material. Finally, with respect to the quantification of the composition at the interface with the substrate, we present a charge transfer mechanism that describes observed enhancements of the secondary ion intensities. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{feasibility}} of reconstructing ex situ an entire bioartificial thyroid gland suitable for transplantation we have bioengineered a rat thyroid lobe using its decellularized stromal / vascular matrix, eventually 3 D recellularized with thyroid stem / precursor cells. Sprague-Dawley male rats (220 – 240 g) were used as thyroid <b>donors,</b> and lobe <b>matrixes</b> obtained by freezing / detergent / enzyme processing. Test matrixes were made electrondense and analyzed by microtomography (microTC). Primary thyroid cells and ABCG 2 -positive, thyroid stem/precursor elements were expanded and isolated either in primary monolayer or 3 D matrigel cultures for 72 h, using low-glucose DMEM and high vs low serum media. Following trypsinization, 250 – 450. 000 cells were harvested to coat the empty follicular and vascular cavities of the inner matrix surface, and grown up to 21 days in static conditions. The colonized matrixes were either fixed in aldheydes for processing by light (LM), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron (SEM) microscopy or denaturated to get total proteins, and run for ABCG 2 westen blotting. Culture supernatants were collected every 48 h, and free thyroid hormone levels assessed with chemiluminescent immunoassays. Complete decellularization and maintenance of the 3 D native architecture of the thyroid SVS were achieved. Thyroid-derived cell, including differentiated thyrocytes, elements showing epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, and stem/precursor cells were found both to heterotopically migrate inside matrix septa and to orthotopically aggregate, link and give rise to intracytoplasmic cavities, up to recellularize the decellularized follicular spaces. Thyroid hormone secretion occurred for at least 7 days. These {{results show that the}} natural 3 D matrix of the rat thyroid acts as a scaffold to bioengineer ex situ a functional thyroid lobe with progenitor-like elements (Fig.), suggesting that a biocompatible construct can be realized for eventual transplantation replacement.

40|$|Background: Endothelial {{and smooth}} muscle cells {{were used as}} seeding cells and {{heterogeneous}} acellularized matrix was used as scaffold to construct the tissue-engineered graft. Methods: A 2 weeks piglet was selected as a donor of seeding cells. Two-centimetre length of common carotid artery was dissected. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were harvested by trypsin and collagenase digestion respectively. The isolated cells were cultured and expanded using routine cell culture technique. An adult sheep {{was used as a}} <b>donor</b> of acellularized <b>matrix.</b> The thoracic aorta was harvested and processed by a multi-step decellularizing technique to remove the original cells and preserve the elastic and collagen fibers. The cultured smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells were then seeded to the acellularized matrix and incubated in vitro for another 2 weeks. The cell seeded graft was then transplanted to the cell-donated piglet to substitute part of the native pulmonary artery. Results: The cultured cells from piglet were characterized as endothelial cells by the presence of specific antigens vWF and CD 31, and smooth muscle cells by the presence of specific antigen α-actin on the cell surface respectively with immunohistochemical technique. After decellularizing processing for the thoracic aorta from sheep, all the cellular components were extracted and elastic and collagen fibers kept their original morphology and structure. The maximal load of acellular matrix was decreased and 20 % lower than that of untreated thoracic aorta, but the maximal tensions between them were not different statistically and they had similar load-tension curves. Three months after transplantation, the animal was sacrificed and the graft was removed for observation. The results showed that the inner surfaces of the graft were smooth, without thrombosis and calcification. Under microscopy, a great number of growing cells could be seen and elastic and collagen fibers were abundant. Conclusion: Cultured self-derived endothelial and smooth muscle cells could be used as seeding cells and heterogeneous acellularized matrix could be used as scaffold in constructing tissue-engineered graft...|$|R
40|$|Flow cytometry (FCM) {{uses the}} {{principles}} of hydro- dynamic focusing, light scattering, light excitation, and emission of fluorochrome molecules to generate specific multi-parameter data from particles and cells. FCM became rapidly a routine method for clinical decision-making in clinical diagnostic laboratories, e. g. for lymphocyte subset enumeration, CD 34 + cell enumeration and HLA-B 27 screening. Therefore, various efforts to standardize testing and reduce variability between laboratories have been undertaken. Also, clinical cell analysis by flow cytometry has entered the same process of development of instrumental validation, internal and external quality control (QC), and External Quality Assessment (EQA) as any other laboratory medicine activities. In this thesis, we analyze {{the impact of these}} standardization efforts on clinical cell analysis by FCM with special attention to external quality assurance programs which currently are operational in the Benel! ux countries. Firstly, we retrospectively analyzed the results of 7 EQA send-outs to assess the quality of flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening. The HLA- B 27 pos samples were correctly classified as positive by the large majority of participants, the classification of HLA-B 27 neg samples as negative was less straightforward. Ten samples were correctly classified as such by 97 % of the participants, whereas only 64 % of the participants correctly classified the remaining eight samples as HLA-B 27 neg. Inspection of the reactivity patterns of the individual mAb with HLA-B 27 neg samples revealed that ABC-m 3 showed very little cross-reactivity apart from its well-known cross-reactivity with HLA- B 7, whereas the cross-reactivity patterns of GS 145. 2 and FD 705 were more extensive. However, the small sample size (n= 18) and the distribution of HLA-B antigens other than HLA-B 27 did not allow assignment of specificities to these cross-reactions. Therefore, we further analyzed the cross-reactivity patterns of commercially available anti-HLA-B 27 mAb (i. e., ABC-m 3, FD 705, and GS 145. 2) with an extensive cell panel with other HLA-B antigens. Test cells were selected as to express HLA-B antigens with known serologic cross-reactions (HLA-B 7, B 12, B 13, B 16, B 17, B 22, B 37, B 40, B 41, B 42, B 47, and B 48). Cells without B 27 cross-reactive antigens (B 5, B 8, B 14, B 15, B 21, and B 35) and cells positive for B 27 were included as controls. All mAbs tested showed cross-reactivity, ranging from weak (Â±) to strong (+), with different antigens and different degrees of intensity. If one mAb had been used for HLA-B 27 screening, many false- positive B 27 assignments would have yielded. This problem largely can be avoided by the combined use of two different mAb. The combination of FD 705 and GS 145. 2 yielded the best results. Tise finding resulted in a proposal for a standard operating procedure for flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, which is p! ublished and nowadays adopted by Current Protocols in Cytometry. In addition, we evaluated the suitability of long-term stabilized whole blood specimens as positive or negative procedure controls for flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, and as test samples in an external quality assessment (EQA) scheme. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 9 blood bank donors with known HLA-B typing. Commercially available HLA-B 27 mAb were tested periodically between 1 week and 12 months and the forward scatter (FSC), sideward scatter (SSC), and fluorescence signals of lymphocytes were compared as a function of time. Furthermore, a pilot send-out with stabilized blood samples of 4 blood bank donors was distributed among the participants to the Benelux EQA scheme for HLA-B 27 screening and results were compared with historical EQA data obtained using non-stabilized blood samples from the same <b>donors.</b> <b>Matrix</b> effects were observed, however there were no major effects on FSC and SSC characteristics of lymphocytes. Fluorescence of stabilized samples increa! sed as compared to fresh samples, but the discrimination between HLA-B 27 positive and HLA-B 27 negative samples remained feasible post stabilization in most cases. In the pilot EQA send-out the results obtained with stabilized samples were less concordant due to variable quality of these samples. In our opinion, long-term stabilized whole blood samples may be useful as true HLA-B 27 positive and true HLA-B 27 negative control cells for daily and longitudinal quality control of flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, and may be used for EQA purposes. However, long-term stabilized samples are not suitable for reagent validation purposes. Extensive quality control of stabilized samples is necessary before distribution to the laboratories. Secondly, to assess the effect of multiple variables on CD 34 + cell enumeration, we analyzed the results of 9 EQA send-outs in the Benelux countries. Therefore, robust multivariate regression, divergent to the statistics performed in most other studies, was used. We studied the effect of methodological aspects of CD 34 + cell counting on assay outcome and whether or not this exercise was effective in reducing between-laboratory variation. Five variables were associated with significant bias of absolute CD 34 + cell counts: (i) laboratory, (ii) gating strategy; (iii) CD 34 mAb fluorochrome; (iv) type of flow cytometer, and (v) method of sample preparation. In addition, laboratory and platform methodology (i. e., single vs. dual) contributed significantly to the variability of this assay. Our approach, i. e., EQA with targeted training and feedback in response to reported results, has been successful in reducing the variability of CD 34 + cell enumeration between participants. Thirdly, to assess the effect of multiple variables on CD 3 + T-cell, CD 4 + T-cell, CD 8 + T-cell, NK-cell, and CD 19 + B-cell enumeration, we analyzed the results of 10 EQA send-outs in the Benelux countries. Again, robust multivariate regression was used. We studied the effects of the methods used on assay outcome, and whether or not this EQA exercise was effective in reducing between-laboratory variation. Five variables were associated with significant bias of absolute lymphocyte subset counts: (i) platform methodology, (ii) sample preparation technique, (iii) gating strategies, (iv) sample stabilization, and v) laboratory. Platform methodology, sample stabilization, and laboratory also affected assay variability. With time, assay variability tended to decline; this trend was significant for B-cell counts only. Participants tended to standardize their techniques mainly with respect to sample preparation and gating strategies, but less with absolute counting techniques. Failure t! o fully standardize protocols may have led to only modest reductions in variability of results between laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Regenerative {{medicine}} of endocrine glands {{is one of}} {{the newest}} fields in biomedical research, and promises to become a primary strategy to treat a number of endocrine disorders. Using computational bioengineering we have recently suggested that the threedimensional (3 D) geometry of the thyroid, stromal / vascular matrix may act as an epigenetic guidance for growth and differentiation of developing thyrocytes (1 - 3). To test this hypothesis, we have bioengineered ex situ (i. e. on the laboratory bench) a bioartificial rat thyroid lobe using its decellularized stromal/vascular matrix as a natural 3 D scaffold, to be eventually recellularized with thyroid stem/precursor cells. Sprague-Dawley male rats (125 - 225 g) were used as thyroid <b>donors,</b> and lobe <b>matrixes</b> were prepared using a N 2 freezing / Trypsin-EDTA / Triton-deoxycholate processing. Test matrixes were made electrondense, and analyzed by microTC (Skyscan 1172) to define their architecture. Primary thyroid cells were isolated after 72 h in primary monolayer culture, whereas presence of ABCG 2 -positive stem/precursor elements was determined using Western blotting. Following trypsinization, 250 - 450 x 103 cells were harvested and dropped onto the empty follicular cavities of the inner matrix of single lobe halves for homing. Cultures were kept in static conditions up to 14 days. The recellularized matrixes were either fixed in aldheydes and analyzed with light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy, or denaturated and processed for ABCG 2 immunoblotting (polyclonal rabbit anti-human 1 : 2000, Cell Signalling). Culture supernatants were collected every 48 h for assessment of FT 3 and FT 4 by immuno-chemiluminescence (Beckman-Coulter). Complete decellularization and maintenance of the 3 D native architecture of the lobe matrix were achieved. Thyroid-derived cells including thyrocytes, epithelialmesenchymal elements, and stem/precursors were found to migrate inside matrix septa, selfassemble like follicule, and recellularize the decellularized native follicular spaces. Thyroid hormone secretion occurred for at least 7 days. These results show that the 3 D matrix of the rat thyroid may guide both differentiated and stem-like elements to self-assemble into functional follicular units, up to the lobar recellularization. This raises the possibility that a bioartificial, immuno-tolerant thyroid gland be bioengineered ex situ using autologous stem cells, and eventually transplanted...|$|R
40|$|Fractured rock {{formations}} represent a valuable source of groundwater {{and can be}} highly susceptible to contamination by dense, non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). The goal {{of this research is}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} three accepted remediation technologies for addressing DNAPL contamination in fractured rock environments. The technologies under investigation in this study are chemical oxidation, bioremediation, and surfactant flushing. Numerical simulations were employed to examine the performance of each of these technologies at the field scale. The numerical model DNAPL 3 D-RX, a finite difference multiphase flow-dissolution-aqueous transport code that incorporates RT 3 D for multiple species reactions, was modified to simulate fractured rock environments. A gridding routine was developed to allow the model to accurately capture DNAPL migration in fractures and aqueous phase diffusion gradients in the matrix while retaining overall model efficiency. Reaction kinetics code subroutines were developed for each technology so as to ensure the key processes were accounted for in the simulations. The three remedial approaches were systematically evaluated via simulations in two-dimensional domains characterized by heterogeneous orthogonal fracture networks parameterized to be representative of sandstone, granite, and shale. Each simulation included a DNAPL release at the water table, redistribution to pools and residual, followed by 20 years of ‘ageing’ under ambient gradient conditions. Suites of simulations for each technology examined a variety of operational issues including the influence of DNAPL type and remedial fluid injection protocol. Performance metrics included changes in mass flux exiting, mass destruction in the matrix versus the fractures, and percentage of injected remedial fluid interacting with the target contaminant. The effectiveness of the three remediation technologies covered a wide range; the mass of contaminants destroyed were found to range from 15 % to 99. 5 % of the initial mass present. Effectiveness of each technology was found to depend on a variety of critical factors particular to each approach. For example, in-situ chemical oxidation was found to be limited by the organic material present in the matrix of the rocks, while the efficiency of enhanced bioremediation was found to be related to factors such as the location of indigenous bacteria present in the domain and rate of bioremediation. In the chemical oxidation study, the efficiency of oxidant consumption was observed to be poor across the suite of scenarios, with greater than 90 % of the injected permanganate consumed by natural oxidant demand. This study further revealed that the same factors that contributed to forward diffusion of contaminants prior to treatment are critical to this remediation method as they can determine the extent of contaminant destruction during the injection period. Bioremediation in fractured rock was demonstrated to produce relatively good results under robust first-order decay rates and active microorganisms throughout the fractures and matrix. It was demonstrated that under ideal conditions, of the total initial mass present, up to 3 / 4 could be reduced to ethene, indicating bioremediation may be a promising treatment approach due to the effective penetration of electron <b>donor</b> into the <b>matrix</b> during the treatment period and the ongoing treatment that occurs after injection ceases. However, when indigenous bacteria was assumed to exist only within the fractured walls of sandstone, it was found that under the same conditions, the rate of dechlorination was 200 times less than the Base Case. Since the majority of the mass resided in the matrix, lack of bioremediation in the matrix significantly reduced the effectiveness of treatment. Surfactant treatment with Tween- 80 was proven to be a relatively effective technique in enhanced solubilisation of DNAPL from the fractures within the domain. However, by comparing the aqueous and sorbed mass at the start and end of the Treatment stage, it is revealed that surfactant treatment is not efficient in removing these masses that reside within the matrix. Furthermore, DNAPLs identified in dead end vertical fractures were found to remain in the domain by the end of the simulations across all scenarios studied; indicating that the injected surfactant experiences difficulty in accessing DNAPLs entrapped in dead end fractures. Altogether, the results underscore the challenge of restoring fractured rock aquifers due to the field scale limitations on sufficient contact between remedial fluids and in situ contaminants in all but the most ideal circumstances.
