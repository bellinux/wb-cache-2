25|$|Religions {{are filled}} with {{different}} fears that humans have had throughout many centuries. The fears aren't just metaphysical (including the problems of life and death) but are also moral. Death {{is seen as a}} boundary to another world. That world would always be different depending on how each individual lived their lives. The origins of this intangible fear are not found in the present world. In a sense we can assume that fear was a big influence on things such as morality. This assumption, however, <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of concepts such as moral absolutism and moral universalism – which would hold that our morals are rooted in either the divine or natural laws of the universe, and would not be generated by any human feeling, thought or emotion.|$|E

The Grand Master Wizard, angered, sentences all four to Wizard Prison. Once at the prison, Abracadaniel challenges Bubblegum to a knife fight. Bubblegum bests him, but refuses to kill him, which causes a riot. In midst of the fray, Finn and Jake learn that the cold spell, instead of curing a cold, actually produces ice; they creatively use it freeze the entire complex. Bubblegum, Finn, and Jake escape {{and return to the}} Candy Kingdom, where Bubblegum distracts Starchy with magic while she administers a vaccine.|$|E
500|$|Focusing on {{the quality}} of the poem, Stuart Sperry, argued in 1973, [...] "'Ode to a Nightingale' is the supreme {{expression}} in all Keats's poetry of the impulse to imaginative escape that <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the knowledge of human limitation, the impulse fully expressed in 'Away! away! for I will fly to thee.'" [...] Wolf Hirst, in 1981, described the poem as [...] "justly celebrated" [...] and claimed that [...] "Since this movement into an eternal realm of song is one of the most magnificent in literature, the poet's return to actuality is all the more shattering." [...] Helen Vendler continued the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that the poem was an attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later dropped. In 1983, she argued, [...] "In its absence of conclusiveness and its abandonment to reverie, the poem appeals to readers who prize it as the most personal, the most apparently spontaneous, the most immediately beautiful, and the most confessional of Keats's odes. I believe that the 'events' of the ode, as it unfolds in time, have more logic, however, than is usually granted them, and that they are best seen in relation to Keats's pursuit of the idea of music as a nonrepresentational art." ...|$|E

A spokesman for the ICTY told Radio Free Europe that [...] "any claim that the number of victims {{after the fall of the}} Srebrenica enclave was around the 2,000 mark, and most of those killed in battle, is an absolutely outrageous claim. It's utterly false, and it <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of all of the evidence painstakingly collected in the investigation into the tragedy." [...] He described the effort to minimise the number of victims as [...] "frankly, disgusting." [...] Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the ICTY, described the report's authors as [...] "totally blind, profoundly insensitive and clearly willing to obstruct all efforts to find reconciliation, truth and justice." [...] Del Ponte's legal adviser, Jean-Jacques Joris, criticised the report as [...] "a saddening example of revisionism and an element which certainly stands in the way of reconciliation in the region." [...] The ICTY prosecutors subsequently used the report as evidence in the trial in 2004 of Miroslav Deronjić; in their verdict, the judges called it [...] "one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} {{throughout}} the novel involves the natural human propensity {{to search for}} meaning with the constant risk of apophenia. Followers of the seemingly random clips seek connections and meaningfulness in them but are revealed to be victims of apophenia as the clips are just edited surveillance camera footage. Likewise, Cayce's mother turns to investigating electronic voice phenomena after Cayce's father disappears. Science fiction critic Thomas Wagner underscores the desire for meaning, or pattern recognition, using a comparison between the film clips and Cayce's search for her father after the attacks: he very randomness and ineffability of the clips <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of our natural human tendency towards pattern recognition ... he subculture that surrounds [...] "following the footage" ... an effective plot device for underscoring the novel's post-9/11 themes: to wit, {{the uncertainty of the}} fabric of day-to-day life people began to feel following that event … [...] as people don't like uncertainty, don't like knowing that there's something we can't comprehend. And if we can't fit something into an existing pattern, then by golly we'll come up with one. Within the marketing world, Cayce is portrayed not as an outside rebel, but rather a paragon of the system. Inescapably within the system, she seeks an epistemological perspective to objectively interpret patterns. The review in The Village Voice calls this search [...] "a survival tactic within the context of no context—dowsing for meaning, and sometimes settling for the illusion of meaning".|$|E

To be sure, {{this is a good}} idea, and others notice it. They {{naturally}} imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea.

2500|$|No {{consistent}} distinction {{exists between}} cormorants and shags. The names 'cormorant' and 'shag' were originally the common {{names of the}} two species of the family found in Great Britain, Phalacrocorax carbo (now referred to by ornithologists as the great cormorant) and P. aristotelis (the European shag). [...] "Shag" [...] refers to the bird's crest, which the British forms of the great cormorant lack. As other species were discovered by English-speaking sailors and explorers elsewhere in the world, some were called cormorants and some shags, depending on whether they had crests or not. Sometimes the same species is called a cormorant {{in one part of}} the world and a shag in another, e.g., the great cormorant is called the black shag in New Zealand (the birds found in Australasia have a crest that is absent in European members of the species). Van Tets (1976) proposed to divide the family into two genera and attach the name [...] "cormorant" [...] to one and [...] "shag" [...] to the other, but this <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of common usage and has not been widely adopted.|$|E
