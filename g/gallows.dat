5|$|Frank Carter the {{original}} vocalist of <b>Gallows</b> announced in early July 2011 {{that he would}} be leaving <b>Gallows</b> because of differing opinions in writing the band's follow-up album to their second release Grey Britain. His departure was effective on 1 August after the band's final tour dates. Just eight days after Frank's departure, on the 9 August 2011, MacNeil was confirmed as the new <b>Gallows</b> vocalist. MacNeil has stated that the members of <b>Gallows</b> asked him initially out of coincidence that Alexisonfire had disbanded and <b>Gallows</b> needed a new singer. With Frank's departure fans of the band started to believe that he left because he wanted to continue playing heavy music, while the band wanted to go in a more melodic direction; the band decided to release something to show this as false.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2015, Kanellis managed Bennett and Matt Taven {{to capture}} New Japan Pro Wrestling's IWGP Tag Team Championship at Invasion Attack 2015. The {{following}} day, NJPW announced that, due to Kanellis' popularity, the promotion had booked its first match involving female wrestlers since October 2002, which would see Kanellis {{team up with}} Bennett and Taven to take on Amber <b>Gallows,</b> Doc <b>Gallows</b> and Karl Anderson at Wrestling Dontaku 2015 on May 3. Kanellis pinned Amber to win the match. On July 5 at Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall, Kanellis accompanied Bennett and Taven to their first IWGP Tag Team Championship defense against Doc <b>Gallows</b> and Karl Anderson. The Kingdom lost the match and the championship, after Doc <b>Gallows</b> superkicked Kanellis, which distracted Bennett, leaving Taven alone to lose the match.|$|E
5|$|The A118 runs east to {{west from}} Stratford in East London to the <b>Gallows</b> Corner. At the <b>Gallows</b> Corner, the road intersects with the A127 road to Southend and the A12 trunk road between London and East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of small named-places in and around Milnrow, {{including}} Clegg, Firgrove, <b>Gallows,</b> Haugh, Newhey, Kitcliffe, Ogden, and Tunshill. Newhey, at the south of Milnrow by Shaw and Crompton, is the most distinct of these areas, and, with its own parish church and Metrolink station, is invariably given as a separate village. The <b>Gallows</b> public house is said to occupy the land of an ancient execution site; <b>Gallows,</b> a former hamlet at northeastern Milnrow, is named in reference to a baronial <b>gallows.</b> Kitcliffe, Ogden and Tunshill, to the east of central Milnrow, are hamlets that occupy the upper, mid and lower Piethorne Valley respectively.|$|E
5|$|Gogol Bordello, <b>Gallows</b> and Roots Manuva {{would support}} Rage Against the Machine at the concert.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 1828, Corder {{was taken}} to the <b>gallows</b> in Bury St Edmunds, {{apparently}} too weak to stand without support.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the <b>gallows,</b> Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick Darby, who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the <b>gallows.</b>|$|E
5|$|The name Gallox is {{believed}} to be derived from <b>gallows</b> as the village <b>gallows</b> were nearby, when it was called Gallocksbrigge. The bridge is close to Dunster Working Watermill and the base of the hill on which Dunster Castle sits and povides access {{to the site of the}} Deer park. It also falls within the Dunster Conservation Area. It has been in the guardianship of English Heritage since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{single storey}} 1855 {{refractory}} block {{is on the}} same axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The <b>gallows</b> chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The <b>gallows</b> operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E
5|$|The street {{became popular}} with entertainers {{including}} bear-baiters, theatres and public houses. However, {{it was not}} attractive to {{the middle and upper}} classes due to the nearby Tyburn <b>gallows</b> and St Giles, then a notorious rookery, or slum. The <b>gallows</b> were removed in 1783, {{and by the end of}} the century, Oxford Street was built up from St Giles Circus to Park Lane, containing a mix of residential houses and entertainment. The Princess's Theatre opened in 1840, and is now the site of Oxford Walk shopping area.|$|E
5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the <b>gallows.</b> He begged to see Anna, but the guards {{told him she}} was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he could no longer feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the <b>gallows</b> to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Fremantle Prison {{came under}} local control in 1886, a {{refractory}} block with <b>gallows</b> was planned. It {{was completed in}} 1888, and first used in 1889 to execute a convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. The <b>gallows</b> room was the only lawful place of execution in Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. Martha Rendell {{was the only woman}} to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke, executed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{areas within}} Hyde Park include Speakers' Corner (located in the {{northeast}} corner near Marble Arch), close to the former site of the Tyburn <b>gallows,</b> and Rotten Row, which is the northern boundary of {{the site of the}} Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Since the prison's closure, six {{cells have}} been {{restored}} {{to represent the}} varying living conditions at different times in the prison's history. The main block also houses the <b>gallows,</b> solitary confinement cells, and two chapels.|$|E
5|$|The final tag team {{match of}} the event, the IWGP Tag Team Championship, pitted the Bullet Club's Karl Anderson and Doc <b>Gallows</b> against challengers Meiyu Tag (Hirooki Goto and Katsuyori Shibata). The champions {{controlled}} Goto {{early in the}} match, but after Goto tagged in Shibata, all four men battled in the ring. At {{the end of the}} match, Anderson was kicked off the ring apron by Shibata; this led to a pinfall on <b>Gallows</b> after a double-team GTS and Shibata's Penalty Kick, giving Meiyu Tag the title after 9 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} that Cragh had voided his bowels and bladder while {{hanging from the}} <b>gallows,</b> which was considered {{at that time to}} be a sign of death.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was also}} {{completed}} on the tunnels during 2005/06, {{and the main}} cell block was restored with an eighteen month, $1.9 million project in 2006 and 2007. The <b>gallows</b> room was restored in 2013 to conditions {{at the time of}} the last execution, in 1964.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} King Edward I in 1278 {{reported that there}} were at that time 94 privately owned gibbets and <b>gallows</b> in use in Yorkshire, including one owned by the Archbishop of York. What was unusual about Halifax was that the custom lingered on there for so long after it had been abandoned elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Cena {{returned}} at WrestleMania 32, helping The Rock {{fend off}} The Wyatt Family. Cena then made his full {{return on the}} Memorial Day edition of Raw on May 30, four months earlier than had been expected for his type of injury. He was confronted by AJ Styles, only to be betrayed by Styles, who joined his former Club teammates Luke <b>Gallows</b> and Karl Anderson in attacking Cena. This set up a match between Cena and Styles at Money in the Bank, which Styles won with interference from <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson. On the July 4 episode of Raw, Cena was again attacked by the Club, but was saved by Enzo Amore and Big Cass. Subsequently, a six-man tag team match was made between the two teams for Battleground. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Cena was drafted to the SmackDown brand, while also defeating Club member Luke <b>Gallows</b> via pinfall in a singles contest. Cena, Amore and Cass defeated The Club at Battleground after Cena pinned Styles. Cena continued his feud with Styles, which resulted in him losing their match at SummerSlam on August 21. With Styles later winning the renamed WWE World Championship, Cena challenged him and previous champion Dean Ambrose in a triple threat match for the title at No Mercy. He lost the match after being pinned by Styles, which came after Ambrose and Cena simultaneously made Styles submit, therefore restarting the match. Cena then took a hiatus from WWE to film American Grit season 2.|$|E
5|$|His {{character}} {{took on a}} {{more sinister}} direction on the November 27, 2009, episode of SmackDown when he revealed that he had converted Luke <b>Gallows,</b> who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and <b>Gallows</b> to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E
5|$|Nine of {{the accused}} – Alizon Device, Elizabeth Device, James Device, Anne Whittle, Anne Redferne, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock and Jane Bulcock – were found guilty during the two-day trial and hanged at <b>Gallows</b> Hill in Lancaster on 20 August 1612; Elizabeth Southerns died while {{awaiting}} trial. Only one {{of the accused}}, Alice Grey, was found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|On the August 28 {{episode of}} Raw, Matt {{participated in a}} 15-man battle royal for the Intercontinental Championship where he {{eliminated}} Karl Anderson after allowing him to hit the ring post from the apron, but would later be eliminated by Luke <b>Gallows</b> from ringside as the duo would attack him afterwards. On 30 October's edition of Raw, Hardy failed to win the Intercontinental Championship from The Miz.|$|E
5|$|Sheppard's tale {{may have}} been an {{inspiration}} for William Hogarth's 1747 series of 12 engravings, Industry and Idleness, which shows the parallel descent of an apprentice, Tom Idle, into crime and eventually to the <b>gallows,</b> beside the rise of his fellow apprentice, Francis Goodchild, who marries his master's daughter and takes over his business, becoming wealthy as a result, eventually emulating Dick Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London.|$|E
5|$|The Young Bucks {{regained the}} title on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2015 in a {{three-way}} match with Roppongi Vice and reDRagon. Also during the event, Bullet Club {{was involved in}} the first NJPW match to feature female wrestlers in over twelve years, where Karl Anderson, Doc <b>Gallows</b> and his wife Amber <b>Gallows</b> were defeated by Maria Kanellis, Matt Taven and Michael Bennett in a six-person intergender tag team match. On July 5 at Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall, Kenny Omega lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship to the 2015 Best of the Super Juniors winner Kushida in his fourth defense, while Anderson and <b>Gallows</b> defeated Bennett and Taven in a rematch to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship for the third time. In the main event, Styles lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Kazuchika Okada in his second defense. From July 20 to August 15, five members of Bullet Club took part in the 2015 G1 Climax with Fale, <b>Gallows</b> and Styles in block A and Anderson and Takahashi in block B. Both Styles and Anderson entered their last round-robin matches with a chance to advance to the finals, but were eliminated after losing to Hiroshi Tanahashi and Satoshi Kojima, respectively. On August 16, The Young Bucks lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to reDRagon in their second defense. From September 4 to 6, Styles and The Young Bucks represented Bullet Club in American promotion Chikara's 2015 King of Trios tournament, where they made it to the finals, before losing to Team AAA (Aero Star, Drago and Fénix). On September 23 at Destruction in Okayama, Omega defeated Kushida, following outside interference from Anderson, to regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. On October 23, Chase Owens became the newest member of Bullet Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Rey Mysterio and CM Punk was {{continued}} from several previous pay-per-views. After months of feuding, Mysterio challenged Punk to a Straight Edge Society Pledge vs. Hair match at Over the Limit. Had Punk won, Mysterio would {{have joined the}} Straight Edge Society, Punk's faction which promoted the straight edge lifestyle. Had Mysterio won however, Punk agreed to have his head shaved. On May 14, Mysterio and Punk faced {{each other in a}} singles match, but the Straight Edge Society (Luke <b>Gallows,</b> Serena, and a mystery masked man) interfered and attacked Mysterio. The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into the Straight Edge Society, and mocked Punk, claiming everyone would be laughing at Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit. Later that night, Mysterio teamed with Montel Vontavious Porter to defeat Punk and <b>Gallows</b> in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} torture of a dog {{as a child in}} the First stage of cruelty, Nero {{progresses}} to beating his horse as a man in the Second stage of cruelty, and then to robbery, seduction, and murder in Cruelty in perfection. Finally, in The reward of cruelty, he receives what Hogarth warns is the inevitable fate of those who start down the path Nero has followed: his body is taken from the <b>gallows</b> after his execution as a murderer and is mutilated by surgeons in the anatomical theatre.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a <b>gallows</b> in the background.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a major {{coaching}} route, {{there were}} several obstacles along it, including the bridge over the Tyburn. A turnpike trust {{was established in the}} 1730s to improve upkeep of the road. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their final journey from Newgate Prison to the <b>gallows</b> at Tyburn near Marble Arch. Spectators drunkenly jeered at prisoners as they carted along the road, and could buy rope used in the executions from the hangman in taverns. By about 1729, the road had become known as Oxford Street.|$|E
5|$|From July 21 to August 8, {{five members}} of Bullet Club {{took part in the}} 2014 G1 Climax with Fale and <b>Gallows</b> wrestling in block A and Anderson, Styles and Takahashi in block B. All five failed to advance from their blocks with Fale {{finishing}} third and <b>Gallows</b> ninth in their block of eleven and Styles finishing second, Anderson third and Takahashi tied sixth in their block. Styles was eliminated due to losing to block winner Okada in their head-to-head match. On August 10, Global Force Wrestling (GFW) founder Jeff Jarrett joined Bullet Club, attacking Hiroshi Tanahashi after he had defeated Styles in a non-title match. On September 21 at Destruction in Kobe, Fale lost the IWGP Intercontinental Championship back to Shinsuke Nakamura in his first defense. Bullet Club lost their two remaining singles titles on October 13 at King of Pro-Wrestling with Takahashi losing the NEVER Openweight Championship back to Tomohiro Ishii in his second title defense, while in the main event Styles lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Hiroshi Tanahashi in his third defense, after Jeff Jarrett's outside interference was stopped by the returning Yoshitatsu.|$|E
5|$|On April 2 at WrestleMania 33, Jeff {{made his}} {{surprise}} return to WWE, {{along with his}} brother Matt, being added as last-minute participants in the ladder match for the Raw Tag Team Championship against the teams of Luke <b>Gallows</b> and Karl Anderson, Cesaro and Sheamus, and Enzo Amore and Big Cass. The Hardy Boyz emerged victorious, marking it their seventh tag team title reign in WWE, their first win as a team at WrestleMania as well as Jeff's first victory at WrestleMania. The next night on Raw, The Hardy Boyz successfully defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Luke <b>Gallows</b> and Karl Anderson. At Payback, the Hardy Boyz retained their championships against Cesaro and Sheamus. After the match, they were attacked by Cesaro and Sheamus. The next night on Raw, the villainous Cesaro and Sheamus would explain their actions, claiming the fans were more supportive of 'novelty acts' from the past like The Hardy Boyz, who they feel didn't deserve {{to be in the}} match at WrestleMania. Subsequently, at Extreme Rules, the Hardy Boyz lost the titles in a steel cage match against Cesaro and Sheamus, and failed to regain it back the following month at the inaugural Great Balls of Fire event. On August 20 at the SummerSlam pre-show, The Hardy Boyz teamed with Jason Jordan against The Miz and The Miztourage (Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas) in a losing effort.|$|E
5|$|On February 11 at The New Beginning in Osaka, Fale, Takahashi and Tonga {{defeated}} the Briscoes and Yano in a rematch {{to capture the}} NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Later that same event, The Young Bucks lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to Matt Sydal and Ricochet in a three-way match, also involving reDRagon. Three days later at The New Beginning in Niigata, Fale, Takahashi and Tonga lost the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship back to the Briscoes and Yano.

5|$|On January 4, 2016, at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome, Bullet Club was {{involved}} in five championship matches. In the first, The Young Bucks defeated reDRagon, Roppongi Vice and the team of Matt Sydal and Ricochet to regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. In the following match, Fale, Takahashi and Tonga were defeated by Toru Yano and the ROH tag team The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) in a match to determine the inaugural NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions.

Hours after the event {{it was reported that}} Anderson, <b>Gallows</b> and Styles had all given their notice to NJPW and would be leaving the promotion for WWE. The following day, the rest of Bullet Club turned on Styles and kicked him out of the group with Omega taking over the leadership. Omega also announced his graduation from the junior heavyweight division, stating {{that he did not want}} a rematch with Kushida, but instead a match with Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The West Florida Seminary, {{also known}} as the Florida State Seminary, opened for classes in Tallahassee in 1857, {{absorbing}} the Florida Institute, which had been established as an inducement for the state to place the seminary in the city. The former Florida Institute property, located where the historic Westcott Building now stands, is the oldest continuously used site of higher education in Florida. The area, slightly west of the state Capitol, was formerly and ominously known as <b>Gallows</b> Hill, a place for public executions in early Tallahassee. In 1858 the seminary absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy, established in 1843, and became coeducational.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{earthworks}} {{were built}} up from local chalk; the ditches dug around the fortification {{would not have}} provided enough for the mound itself, and local tradition suggests {{that much of the}} earth was quarried instead from the nearby <b>Gallows</b> Pits in the town. The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging with wooden shovels, and probably without pickaxes. It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24,000 man days of effort to build.|$|E
5|$|The stone {{packhorse}} bridge {{crosses the}} River Avill {{at the southern}} end of the village, below Dunster Castle at a point which may have been the limit of tidal flow during the medieval period. It was important for the transport of wool and other goods to the market within the village which was established by 1222. The name is derived from the nearby <b>gallows.</b> The narrow bridge is approach via a raised causeway for pedestrians, while wheeled traffic uses the adjacent ford.|$|E
5|$|When Karl Alexander died suddenly, Oppenheimer {{was arrested}} and accused of various things, {{including}} fraud, embezzlement, treason, lecherous relations with the court ladies, accepting bribes, and trying to reestablish Catholicism. The Jewish community tried unsuccessfully to ransom him. After a heavily publicized trial during which no proofs were produced, {{he was sentenced to}} death. When his jailers demanded that he convert to Christianity, he refused. Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was led to the <b>gallows</b> on 4 February 1738, and given a final chance to convert to Christianity, which he refused to do.|$|E
