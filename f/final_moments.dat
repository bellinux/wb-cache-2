5|$|One of {{the most}} {{discussed}} potential nominees is Paul Henderson, who scored the winning goal in the <b>final</b> <b>moments</b> of the deciding eighth game of the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union. This {{is one of the}} best-known moments in hockey and Canadian sports history. While there is little question of the historical significance of that goal, Henderson's NHL statistics are not at a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction. His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists.|$|E

5|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard was a {{standard}} match that featured Triple H and The Rock. Continuing the storyline of The Rock's injured arm, Triple H was scripted to target and attack The Rock's arm. Towards the <b>final</b> <b>moments</b> of the bout, Triple H asked Chyna, his valet, {{to retrieve a}} folding chair. The referee, however, took it away from him, which led to an argument between Triple H and the referee; the mishap prompted Triple H to push the referee down. The referee disqualified Triple H for this action; thus, The Rock won the match. After the match, Mankind ran in to save The Rock from Triple H and Chyna.|$|E

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, is being {{given a chance to}} prove her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with an uncanny knack for arriving {{just in time to see}} his victims' <b>final</b> <b>moments.</b> What she does not expect, however, is for Death to play a role himself.|$|E

5|$|Yerevan Square, {{where the}} robbery took place, was renamed Lenin Square by the Soviet {{authorities}} in 1921, {{and a large}} statue of Lenin was erected in his honor in 1956. Despite being convicted of the bloody robbery, Kamo was originally buried and had a monument erected in his honor in Pushkin Gardens, near Yerevan Square. Created by the sculptor Iakob Nikoladze, it was removed during Stalin's rule, and Kamo's remains were moved to another location. The statue of Lenin was torn down in August 1991—one of the <b>final</b> <b>moments</b> of the Soviet Union—and replaced by the Liberty Monument in 2006. The name of the square was changed from Lenin Square to Freedom Square in 1991.|$|E
5|$|According to custom, pretenders to {{the throne}} had {{historically}} been put to death upon the naming of a new sovereign. Radama was opposed to this practice and asked the brothers to help ensure his accession {{to the throne}} with minimum bloodshed {{on the day of}} the queen's death. Rainilaiarivony successfully maintained authority over the palace guards anxiously awaiting the command from either faction to slaughter the other. When the queen's attendant quietly informed him that her <b>final</b> <b>moments</b> were approaching, Rainilaiarivony discreetly summoned Radama and Rainivoninahitriniony from the Prime Minister's palace to the royal Rova compound and ordered the prince crowned before the gathered soldiers, just as the queen was pronounced dead. Ramboasalama was promptly escorted to the palace where he was obliged to publicly swear allegiance to King Radama.|$|E
5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas {{is able to}} turn Kachimov by forging evidence {{that he is an}} MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a replaceable resource.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, few {{professional}} football games took longer than {{two and a}} half hours to play, and the Jets–Raiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that Heidi begin at 7:00p.m. ET, but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7p.m. approached, NBC's switchboards were jammed by viewers phoning to inquire about the night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. Heidi began as scheduled, preempting the <b>final</b> <b>moments</b> of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern half of the country, to the outrage of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Jack Verge {{departed}} for England aboard the RMS Mongolia on 25 May 1907, to spend {{three years in}} the UK and Europe undertaking further studies in medicine, while also playing rugby.

Verge's brother, meanwhile, continued to play for University and also played fullback for Metropolitan against the Anglo-Welsh touring team in Sydney on 15 August 1908, which the tourists won 13–16 with a try in the <b>final</b> <b>moments,</b> and against the Ponsonby team on tour from New Zealand in August 1909. On his return from Europe, Verge practised as a doctor in Macquarie Street before joining the army, and did not play competitive rugby again.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, George thinks Liz {{is breaking}} the rules by taking a personal call; he gets angry and wrestles the handset from her. Later, Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her <b>final</b> <b>moments,</b> and Liz, {{who has made a}} complaint about George's conduct, tells him that she took a call from an ex-soldier, in tears because his mother committed suicide following the death of her cat. Andy realises that the man's mother is the caller from the previous night. George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call. Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael, again claiming that she has taken an overdose. Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe, hanging up on her.|$|E

5|$|The game, {{which was}} the sixth edition of the bowl, was {{expected}} to be an offensive shootout. Boise State averaged 42.4points during the 2007 season, while East Carolina averaged 31. That expectation turned out to be justified as East Carolina took a 31–14 lead in the first half. The Broncos fought back in the second half, however, tying the score at 38 late in the fourth quarter after East Carolina's Chris Johnson fumbled the ball, allowing Bronco defender Marty Tadman to recover the ball and return it 47yards for a touchdown. The game remained tied until the <b>final</b> <b>moments</b> as East Carolina's Ben Hartman made a 34–yard game-winning field goal as time expired. The attendance of 30,467 was the largest crowd to attend a Hawaii Bowl game that did not feature the host school. Boise State's loss dropped them to a final 2007 record of 10–3, while East Carolina's final-game win earned them a record of 8–5.|$|E
5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the <b>final</b> <b>moments</b> showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E
5|$|Three endings exist. In the first, Maxim, possessed, {{has already}} bitten Lydie.

In the second, Maxim struggles against the possession and urges Juste to kill him. In his <b>final</b> <b>moments,</b> he thanks Juste for killing him and reveals that he had wished to save him from his fate as a Belmont. Outside the castle, Lydie awakens, unharmed, and tells Juste not to blame himself for Maxim's death. The third ending begins {{the same as the}} first, except that, during the fight, Maxim notices that Juste wore his bracelet and resists the possession. Dracula flees into a weakened form using the gathered remains and fights Juste, planning to use his blood to return himself to full power. Vanquishing him, Juste escapes the castle together with Maxim and Lydie, whose bite marks disappear by the time she regains consciousness. Outside the castle, the three resolve to return home.|$|E
