40|$|The Konus (1924) {{approach}} to constructing price <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> involves evaluating the expenditure {{function of a}} representative consumer at different vectors of prices. Muellbauer (1976) has shown that if consumer preferences exhibit price-independent generalised linearity (PIGL) then this representative consumer exists. This paper computes Konus price <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> derived from expenditure functions belonging to the logarithmic PIGL class. The parameters of the expenditure functions are estimated in a Bayesian framework. Results are summarised {{in the form of}} estimated posterior probability density functions for expenditure shares and associated <b>index</b> <b>numbers.</b> Uncertainty concerning the functional form of the representative expenditure function is resolved through Bayesian model averaging.

25|$|In the CII schema, each pigment has {{a generic}} <b>index</b> <b>number</b> that {{identifies}} it chemically, regardless of proprietary and historic names. For example, Phthalocyanine Blue BN {{has been known}} {{by a variety of}} generic and proprietary names since its discovery in the 1930s. In much of Europe, phthalocyanine blue is better known as Helio Blue, or by a proprietary name such as Winsor Blue. An American paint manufacturer, Grumbacher, registered an alternate spelling (Thanos Blue) as a trademark. Colour Index International resolves all these conflicting historic, generic, and proprietary names so that manufacturers and consumers can identify the pigment (or dye) used in a particular color product. In the CII, all phthalocyanine blue pigments are designated by a generic color <b>index</b> <b>number</b> as either PB15 or PB16, short for pigment blue 15 and pigment blue 16; these two numbers reflect slight variations in molecular structure that produce a slightly more greenish or reddish blue.|$|E

25|$|Like spiral galaxies, {{lenticular}} galaxies can {{possess a}} central bar structure. While the classification system for normal lenticulars depends on dust content, barred lenticular galaxies are classified by {{the prominence of}} the central bar.

The prominence of the bar increases with <b>index</b> <b>number,</b> thus SB03 galaxies have very well defined bars that can extend through the transition region between the bulge and disk. Unfortunately, the properties of bars in lenticular galaxies have not been researched in great detail. Understanding these properties, as well as understanding the formation mechanism for bars, would help clarify the formation or evolution history of lenticular galaxies.|$|E
25|$|Nova Scotia's tartan was {{designed}} by Bessie Murray, the President of the Halifax Weavers' Guild, {{with the help of}} Isabel MacAulay, Canada's expert on Clan Systems, tartans and traditional Scottish wear. Isabel was owner of Bond Textiles in Yarmouth, The Tartan House in Halifax, the Gaelic College Craft Center in St.Anne's, Cape Breton, and was once the president of the Women's Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Bessie had originally displayed the tartan on the kilt of a shepherd in a panel at a breeders' convention in Truro in 1953, but the design was so admired that it was afterwards used as the province's tartan. Isabel registered the new regional tartan at the Court of the Lord Lyon in 1956, making it the first provincial tartan in Canada, and officially adopted by the province in the Nova Scotia Tartan Act of 1963. Blue are used for the sea; white, for the granite rocks and surf; gold, for the Royal Charter; and red for the lion rampant on the provincial flag.
