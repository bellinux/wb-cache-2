25|$|Traditionally rods {{are made}} from bamboo, while {{contemporary}} rods are usually made from fibreglass or carbon fibre. In contrast with nets, which are usually used in subsistence and commercial fishing, <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are more often used in recreational fishing and competitive casting. <b>Fishing</b> <b>rods</b> come in many sizes, actions, lengths and configurations depending on whether {{they are to be}} used for small, medium or large fish or in different fresh or salt water situations. Various types of <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are designed for specific types of fishing. Fly rods are used to cast artificial flies, spinning rods and bait casting rods are designed to cast baits or lures. Ice <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are designed to fish through small holes in ice covered lakes. Trolling rods are designed to drag bait or lures behind moving boats.|$|E

50|$|Spin {{fishing is}} an angling {{technique}} where a spinning lure {{is used to}} entice the fish to bite. Spin fishing is used in both freshwater and marine environments. Spin fishing is distinguished between fly fishing and bait cast fishing {{by the type of}} rod and reel used. There are two types of reels used when spin fishing, the open faced reel and the closed faced reel. The spin <b>fishing</b> <b>rod</b> has no trigger attached {{to the base of the}} <b>fishing</b> <b>rod.</b> This is what differentiates the spin <b>fishing</b> <b>rod</b> from the bait casting <b>fishing</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|R

25|$|Telescopic <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are {{designed}} to collapse down to a short length and open to a long rod. 20 or even 30ft rods can close to {{as little as a}} foot and a half. This makes the rods very easy to transport to remote areas or travel on buses, compact cars, or public buses and subways. Telescopic <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are made from the same materials as conventional multi-piece rods. Graphite, carbon, and sometimes fibreglass, or composites of these materials, {{are designed}} to slip into each other so that they open and close. The eyes on the spinning rods are generally, but not always, a special design to aid in making the end of each section stronger. Various grade eyes available in conventional rods are also available in telescopic <b>fishing</b> <b>rods.</b> The eyeless Tenkara style rods are also of this type and are typically made from carbon and/or graphite.|$|E
25|$|In theory, {{an ideal}} rod should {{gradually}} taper from butt to tip, be tight {{in all its}} joints (if any), and have a smooth, progressive taper, without 'dead spots'. Modern design and fabrication techniques, along with advanced materials such as graphite, boron and fiberglass composites as well as stainless steel(see Emmrod)- have allowed rod makers to tailor both the shape and action of <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> for greater casting distance, accuracy, and fish-fighting qualities. Today, <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> are identified by their weight (meaning the weight of line or lure required to flex a fully loaded rod) and action (describing {{the speed with which}} the rod returns to its neutral position).|$|E

25|$|Back- or butt-rests {{can also}} be used with modern <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> {{to make it easier to}} pull big fish off the water. These are fork-like {{supports}} that help keep the rod in position, providing leverage and counteracting tensions caused by a caught fish.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>rods</b> can be {{constructed}} out of {{a vast number of}} materials. Generally they are made with either fiberglass, graphite, or a new generation composite, also known as carbon fibre. Many times carbon fibre and graphite are used together in the rod making process.|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> retain cork as {{a common}} {{material}} for grips. Cork is light, durable, keeps warm and tends to transmit rod vibrations better than synthetic materials, although EVA foam is also used. Reel seats are often of graphite-reinforced plastic, aluminium, or wood. Guides are available in steel and titanium {{with a wide variety}} of high-tech metal alloy inserts replacing the classic agate inserts of earlier rods.|$|E
25|$|Composites or {{composite}} materials are {{a combination of}} materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately. Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing (and, subsequently, finding applications for) stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce weight, susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors. Carbon fiber reinforced composites, for instance, {{have been used in}} such diverse applications as spacecraft and <b>fishing</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|E

25|$|The 18th {{century was}} mainly {{an era of}} {{consolidation}} of the techniques developed in the previous century. Running rings began to appear along the <b>fishing</b> <b>rods,</b> which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialized for different roles. Jointed rods became common {{from the middle of}} the century and bamboo came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Some rods {{are joined}} through a metal bus. These add mass to the rod which helps {{in setting the}} hook and help {{activating}} the rod from tip to butt when casting, resulting in a better casting experience. Some anglers experience this kind of fitting as superior to a one piece rod. They are found on specialised hand-built rods. Apart from adding the correct mass, depending {{on the kind of}} rod, this fitting also is the strongest known fitting, but also the most expensive one. For that reason they are almost never to be found on commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|E
25|$|Care for {{telescopic}} <b>fishing</b> <b>rods</b> is {{much the}} same as other rods. The only difference being that one should not open the telescopic rod in manner that whips a closed rod into the open position rapidly. Whipping or flinging a telescopic fishing rod open may and likely will cause it to be difficult to close. When closing the rods make a slight twisting motion while pushing the sections together. Often the rods come with tip covers to protect the tip and guides. Additionally, extra care must be taken not to get dirt or sand in the joints; due to their design this can easily damage this style of rod.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the mid-1800s}} rods were {{generally}} made in England. This changed in 1846 when American Samuel Phillippe introduced an imported fishing rod {{the first six}} strips of Calcutta cane made in Bavaria where Phillippe was importing Violins that he passed off as his own hand work. Split-cane rods were later independently produced after Phillippe started to sell the imported rods to a New York retailer and then copied by Americans Charles Orvis, Hiram Leonard and Englishman William Hardy in the 1870s and mass production methods made these rods accessible to the public. Horton Manufacturing Company first introduced an all steel rod in 1913. These rods were heavy and flexible and did not satisfy many customers.
