40|$|The giraffe {{population}} (Giraffa camelopardalis) <b>in</b> Niger is <b>the</b> last {{representative of}} the peralta sub-species which lived throughout West Africa {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. Protected since the 1970 s, giraffes cohabit with humans in cultivated landscapes. This may not have appeared to pose many problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, but the relationship between farmers and giraffes has deteriorated with the expansion of cultivated land and that of the giraffe population, with reported cases of giraffes damaging crops. A survey was conducted <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> affected villages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Koure´ area to establish the nature, severity and distribution of the damage and to evaluate the local populations' perception of the problem. Cowpeas are fed upon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field at <b>harvest</b> time and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>granaries,</b> as well as ripe mangoes, during the most critical period for giraffes' nutrition. The vast majority of farmers interviewed consider giraffes to be rather a problem in spite of tourism revenues they can obtain from them. This opinion has individually little correlation with damage rate on crops or easy access to tourism revenues. The damage risk factors are first and foremost considered as uncontrollable by the farmers, even if technical protection measures could easily be put <b>in</b> place locally. <b>The</b> inter-relationships between the socio-economic context and the way the problem is perceived are discussed.

40|$|Part 1 : Simulation, Optimization, Monitoring and Control TechnologyInternational audienceThe temperature, humidity, air {{composition}} and pH value {{are very important}} parameters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>granary</b> that keep <b>the</b> grain safely store and good quality. Nowadays only temperature and moisture are used in most granary monitor and control system. Air composition, pH and insect pest are not monitored because classic industrial personal computer or microcomputer {{are not able to}} handle these real-time multiply tasks at the same time. So it is necessary to design a monitor and alarm system to monitor these parameters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>granary</b> to minimize or curtail damage or loss. Applying the advanced embedded technology and sensor technology, a set of granary temperature and humidity monitor and alarm system is designed based on the ARM. Temperature sensor, humidity sensor, air composition sensor and pH value sensor are selected to monitor <b>the</b> parameters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>granary.</b> Based on <b>the</b> ARM microprocessor LPC 2290, the hardware system consists of serial communication module, LCD display module and alarm module. Based on the embedded operation system, the software completes the allocation design and testing of the tasks and realizes the functions such as pulse frequency signal acquisition, analog signal A/D convert, serial digital signal communication, alarm in different grades and LCD display. All the parameters can be real-time displaying on the LCD screen. The system meets the requirement of the monitor and alarm functions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>granary...</b>|$|R

40|$|Peanut (Arachis hypogoea) is an {{important}} crop in Mali, West Africa. However, {{one of the main}} problems related to peanut production and commercialization is the detection of high levels of aflatoxin B 1 in peanut-derived products for consumption. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the rate of progress of Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin B 1 in granaries located in 26 villages and also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>granaries</b> located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corresponding 26 markets in Mali and 2) to correlate the progress of the A. flavus and aflatoxin B 1 with environmental variables outside <b>the</b> peanut <b>granaries.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that peanuts stored and consumed in rural areas are highly contaminated by A. flavus and aflatoxin B 1, with average rates of aflatoxin B 1 significantly above the accepted international standards especially between the months of June and December. There was a moderate relationship (r 2 = 0. 58) between the aflatoxin B 1 levels for two granary types, located at the villages and <b>the</b> corresponding <b>granaries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> markets. The analysis of the aflatoxin B 1 levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> villages and its relation with the weather conditions outside <b>the</b> <b>granaries</b> revealed that for one village (Tiele), high relative air humidity was a contributing factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of A. flavus and levels of the aflatoxin B 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>granary.</b> <b>The</b> results indicated that maximum aflatoxin B 1 production occurs in presence of warm temperatures and relative humidity above 80...|$|R
