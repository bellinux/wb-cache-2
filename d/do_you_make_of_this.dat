6000|$|Harry flushed. [...] "I {{suppose you}} mean to hint that Frank {{imagined}} it all, sir? Well, he told you the man struck a match, and though sulphur matches don't give much light they make a considerable smell. Do you notice any particular odor in this room?" [...] Then he stooped suddenly {{and picked up a}} half-burned match. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>this?</b> I haven't struck one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ay, ay, to be sure,' {{said the}} Captain, 'what's the good o' them {{in two or}} three hundred fathoms o' water!' Then, {{returning}} to the letter, he read on:--'"But if he should be by, when it is opened;"' the Captain involuntarily looked round, and shook his head; '"or should know of it at any other time;"' the Captain shook his head again; '"my blessing on him! In case the accompanying paper is not legally written, it matters very little, for there is no one interested but you and he, and my plain wish is, that if he is living he should have what little there may be, and if (as I fear) otherwise, that you should have it, Ned. You will respect my wish, I know. God bless you for it, and for all your friendliness besides, to Solomon Gills." [...] Bunsby!' said the Captain, appealing to him solemnly, 'what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>this?</b> There you sit, a man as has had his head broke from infancy up'ards, and has got a new opinion into it at every seam as has been opened. Now, what do you make o' this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twelve {{hundred dollars}} {{looks to be}} a good figger for a dress, ain't it? But Malviny knows, I reckon, what ought to be worn at the Tooilleries, and she don't want our Mamie to take a back seat before them furrin' princesses and gran' dukes. It's a slap-up affair, I kalkilate. Let's see. I disremember whether it's an emperor or a king that's rulin' over thar now. It must be suthin' first class and A1, for Malviny ain't the woman to throw away twelve hundred dollars on any of them small-potato despots! She says Mamie speaks French already like them French Petes. I don't quite make out what she means here. She met Don Caesar in Paris, and she says, 'I think Mamie is nearly off with Don Caesar, who has {{followed}} her here. I don't care about her dropping him TOO suddenly; the reason I'll tell you hereafter. I think the man might be a dangerous enemy.' Now, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>this?</b> I allus thought Mamie rather cottoned to him, and it was the old woman who fought shy, thinkin' Mamie would do better. Now, I am agreeable that my gal should marry any one she likes, whether it's a dook or a poor man, as long as he's on the square. I was ready to take Don Caesar; but now things seem to have shifted round. As to Don Caesar's being a dangerous enemy if Mamie won't have him, that's a little too high and mighty for me, and I wonder the old woman don't make him climb down. What do you think?" ...|$|E
40|$|What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> exchange: I {{mean what}} I say—ask Saddam Hussein. I {{told him what}} I was going to do, {{and that is exactly}} what I did. (George Bush, 2003) A large part of the {{opposition}} to Bush's war was based on recognition that Iraq is only a special case of the "imperial ambition" that is widely condemned and rightly feared. (Noam Chomsky, 2003) Bush gave an intentional explanation of his action as "regime change" in Iraq. As president, Bush gave the order and so initiated this intentional action. But intentional actions are public, and Chomsky had reckoned that this action Bush's action—was undertaken with a different intention, namely "imperial ambition. " Many intentional actions lead to divergent interpretations as to whether an agent°s avowed intention or an intention attributed by an observer is the operative intention behind an action. Elsewhere, intentionality "dropped out. " Despite being fundamental for two millennia, its marginalization resulted from the rise of the ABCs of 20 th-century psychology: associationism, behaviorism, and "cognitive revolution. " There are two versions of what happened. One is that intentionality was excised {{on the grounds that it}} was no more necessary than phlogiston in chemistry; compare Skinnerian behaviorism. The other was that intentionality was admissible, provided that an observer°s interpretation had exclusive priority over an agent°s avowals, which were in fact dispensable; compare cognitive psychology...|$|E
