50|$|Despite {{normally}} {{playing as}} a forward, Derby manager Nigel Clough tried {{him in an}} unfamiliar holding midfield role during the 2011-12 preseason, with the side switching to a new 4-1-3-2 formation. Doyle featured 6 times in the 2011-12 season, with one start against Peterborough United on November 5, 2011. Doyle saw first team opportunities reduced due {{to the emergence of}} Mason Bennett and Callum Ball. <b>Doyle</b> was <b>ruled</b> out for four to six weeks due to a torn hamstring after picking up the injury in a reserve game in March 2012.|$|R

Carlton, <b>ruled</b> it shall be the duty of the State Road Department to {{maintain}} the state roads and enforce the laws enacted to preserve its physical structure. The road department hired 12 weight inspectors who were placed under the supervision of the division engineers because of the ruling. This was the beginning of state law enforcement in Florida.|$|R
2500|$|Writer Arthur Conan Doyle also criticised the [...] "rubber regime" [...] in his 1908 work The Crime of the Congo, {{written to}} aid {{the work of the}} Congo Reform Association. <b>Doyle</b> contrasted Leopold's <b>rule</b> to the British rule of Nigeria, arguing that decency {{required}} those who ruled primitive peoples to be concerned first with their uplift, not how much could be extracted from them. As Hochschild describes in King Leopold's Ghost, many of Leopold's policies, in particular those of colonial monopolies and forced labour, were influenced by Dutch practice in the East Indies. Similar methods of forced labour were employed to some degree by Germany, France, and Portugal where natural rubber occurred in their own colonies.|$|R
40|$|In {{regenerating}} southern pine, {{maintenance of}} riparian zones (RZs) {{is a major}} land concession for soil and water protection and wildlife habitat enhancement. However, there are few data quantifying the volume and value of residual timber in such areas. We inventoried merchantable timber in nine RZs of three widths in sapling-class East Texas pine plantations. Present, discounted, and projected volumes and values of residual timber were determined. Average per-acre volumes of narrow, medium, and wide RZs were 337, 1438, and 2542 board feet (<b>Doyle</b> log <b>rule)</b> and 4. 6, 8. 2, and 7. 2 cords, respectively. At US $ 154. 00 and US $ 57. 00 per thousand board feet for pine and hardwood saw timber, respectively, and US $ 15. 00 and US $ 5. 00 per cord for pine and hardwood pulpwood, respectively, average present per-acre values were US $ 46. 41, US $ 209. 93 and US $ 352. 75 for narrow, medium, and wide RZs. Interest rates {{for the growth of}} trees from 1981 to 1989 ranged 3. 7 %- 23. 5 % for pine and 2. 2 %- 6. 1 % for hardwood. For the 1981 - 1989 discount period, average per-acre net annual equivalents of narrow, medium, and wide RZs were US $ 4. 52, US $ 20. 46, and US $ 34. 38, respectively. Stumpage values at the time of harvest projected at 7 % compound interest for 30 years ranged US $ 10. 66 -US $ 3547. 54 per acre and for 80 years ranged US $ 313. 93 -US $ 104 499. 95 per acre.

40|$|Reliable {{dimensional}} data for old-growth pine-dominated {{forests in the}} Gulf Coastal Plain of Arkansas are hard to find, but sometimes unfortunate circumstances provide good opportunities to acquire this information. On July 11, 2013, a severe thunderstorm with high winds struck the Levi Wilcoxon Demonstration Forest (LWDF) near Hamburg, Arkansas. This storm uprooted or snapped dozens of large pines and hardwoods and provided an opportunity to more closely inspect these rare specimens. For instance, the largest tree killed in this event, a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), was 105 cm in diameter at breast height, 39. 3 m tall, and if the tree had been sound would have yielded 3, 803 board feet (<b>Doyle</b> log <b>rule)</b> of lumber. Gross board foot volume yield was also estimated from two other recently toppled large pines, an 85 -cm-DBH loblolly and an 86 -cm-DBH shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), which tallied 2, 430 and 2, 312 board feet Doyle, respectively. A number of the other wind thrown pines on the LWDF were sound enough to count their rings for a reasonable (Â± 2 - 5 years) estimate of their ages. The stump of the fallen national champion shortleaf pine had 168 rings, and counts from other pines toppled by this storm had from 68 to 198 rings. We also searched for a new champion shortleaf pine using a LiDAR canopy height model of the LWDF to narrow our search. This preliminary assessment produced a number of targets that exceeded 40 m in height; further field checking of the tallest of these trees found that these were loblolly pines up to about 44 m. We eventually found shortleaf pines between 37 and 41 m tall, with diameters of up to 85 cm, indicating that the LWDF could still contain the Arkansas state champion...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 One of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges facing foresters is the development of a raw material measurement system designed to give a complete inventory of log volume and to assist in planning the complete management of log production. This paper introduces a concept of production analysis in terms of solid fiber content. The basis for the development of this concept is the measurement of logs and log production in terms of cubic feet. Total raw material accountability is maintained throughout the manufacturing process. A mill study was undertaken to compare the results of this type of analysis with results obtained by traditional analytical methods. It was found that raw material management by this analysis can be useful in measuring the effectiveness of a production design. This analysis has further usefulness in projecting the results of proposed changes in production design. The mill study was undertaken with the log input, primary lumber products, and sawmill residuals measured in terms of cubic feet of wood fiber. This study is referred to as treatment A in this paper. The mill study data were used to project two changes in sawing practices, treatments B and C, and the expected results are presented. The 471 logs in the study had a volume of 172, 850 board feet gross, and 143, 490 board feet net, Scribner scale. The logs had a volume of 24, 574 cubic feet on the basis of Smalian's cubic foot rule. The volumes in the study were assigned dollar values on the basis of grade and projected on the basis of an annual cut of 30 million board feet, assuming the same variables encountered in the test material. By using the values assigned to the products in Treatment A, the total value of products was 2, 802, 481, based on the assumed 30 million board feet cutting schedule. The yearly product value for Treatment B was 175, 769 more than Treatment A, and the yearly product value for Treatment C was 302, 632 more than Treatment A. It is emphasized that any comparison of other situations with those defined in this paper must be carefully qualified. A review of present and past log measurement systems includes a discussion of the British Hoppus Foot, and the shaku and koku units of measure used in Japan. Various cubic foot rules discussed include Newton's formula, Huber, Smalian, Rapraeger and Sorensen. The more common board foot rules include Scribner, Scribner Decimal C, Spaulding, British Columbia rule, International 1 / 4 -inch and 1 / 8 -inch <b>rules,</b> Brereton, and <b>Doyle</b> log <b>rules.</b> Measurement by displacement and weight is discussed. Efforts in comparing the economics of different measurement methods are reported. The development of log residual products during manufacture is discussed. These present both problems in terms of disposal and opportunities for additional economic development. A concerted effort is needed to design mensurational techniques that will act as incentives toward the most complete and profitable utilization of our forest resource. Toward this end it is suggested that those in the field of forest mensuration coordinate their efforts with the research and utilization fields toward a complete understanding of the complex problem of wood measurement. This paper concludes that cubic analysis of log input and production outflow can better serve the needs of the forest products industry...|$|R
