40|$|Current {{and future}} {{high-performance}} systems will be constructed using multi-core chips. These systems impose higher demands {{to the memory}} system. Lack of adequate memory bandwidth will limit application performance. To reduce memory bandwidth we propose to use cache injection of <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> messages. The objective of this work is to demonstrate benefits of cache injection and {{provide a basis for}} studying injection policies. Current architectures place <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> data into main memory and {{it is up to the}} processor to fetch data into a cache. Fetching data into a cache is usually done by prefetching which anticipates accesses to blocks of memory. Cache injection provides an alternative approach by placing <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> data directly into a processor’s cache. This technique reduces memory bandwidth by eliminating fetchin...|$|R

As previous mention, all nine nodes are actually receiving message from the whole network, so {{they have the same}} conditions of the <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> traffic. Moreover, we can assume that the message rate in Table 9 indicates the intranode performance of single node. If a node cannot handle such <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> traffic and cause output message loss, the loss rate should be increased with the message rate.|$|R

As other bit rates and data bandwidths, the asymptotic throughput is measured in bits per second (bit/s), very seldom bytes per second (B/s), where 1 B/s is 8 bit/s.

50|$|Polling is an {{alternative}} to interrupt-based processing. The kernel can periodically check {{for the arrival of}} <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> packets without being interrupted, which eliminates the overhead of interrupt processing. Establishing an optimal polling frequency is important, however. Too frequent polling wastes CPU resources by repeatedly checking for incoming packets that have not yet arrived. On the other hand, polling too infrequently introduces latency by reducing system reactivity to incoming packets, and it may result in the loss of packets if the incoming packet buffer fills up before being processed.|$|R
30|$|Assign {{and process}} {{sections}} The first pass labels network and elevation data with the section they belong to. The details {{are described in}} Algorithm 2. The data is processed by two mappers. The first mapper reads <b>network</b> <b>lines</b> data network_i as text and calculates the section id based on the coordinates of the <b>network</b> <b>lines.</b> The key value pairs emitted from the mapper are <sectionID_j,networkline_l >. The second mapper similarly reads elevation data elevation_j and calculates the section id and emits key-value pairs <sectionID_j,elevation_i >. The reducer reads the data and aggregates all elevation and <b>network</b> <b>line</b> observations for the section id and applies the flight plans builder algorithm for the section. It first builds a spatial index for all the elevation points for the subregion based on the network and elevation data in memory. It then identifies subregions as quadcopter and conventional subregions based on the elevation and autonomy constraints, shrinking, expanding and merging subregions as needed. The final key-value pairs emitted in the reducer consist {{of the details of}} each subregion within a section, namely the subregion id subregion_j, the subregion extent xsr_j,ysr_j,xer_j,yer_j which represents the diagonal coordinates of the subregion starting from bottom left edge xsr_j,ysr_j to top right edge xer_j,yer_j. It also includes a flag indicating if it is a quadcopter or conventional drone subregion, the <b>network</b> <b>lines</b> and elevation points and waypoints waypoint_k,...,waypoint_l for a quadcopter or conventional drone to follow along the <b>network</b> <b>lines</b> in the subregion.

40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} deployment and usage of gigabit networks, traditional network anomaly detection based intrusion detection systems have not scaled accordingly. Most, if not all, systems deployed assume {{the availability of}} complete and clean data {{for the purpose of}} intrusion detection. We contend that this assumption is not valid. Factors like noise in the audit data, mobility of the nodes, and the large amount of data generated by the network make it difficult to build a normal traffic profile of the network for the purpose of anomaly detection. From this perspective, the leitmotif of the research effort described in this dissertation is the design of a novel intrusion detection system that has the capability to detect intrusions with high accuracy even when complete audit data is not available. In this dissertation, we take a holistic approach to anomaly detection to address the threats posed by network based denial-of-service attacks by proposing improvements in every step of the intrusion detection process. At the data collection phase, we have implemented an adaptive sam-pling scheme that intelligently samples <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> data to reduce the volume of traffic sampled, while maintaining the intrinsic characteristics of the network traffic. A Bloom filters based fast flow aggregation scheme is employed at the data pre-processing stage to further reduce the response time of the anomaly detection scheme. Lastly, this dissertation also proposes an expectation-maximization algorithm based anomaly detec-tion scheme that uses the sampled audit data to detect intrusions in the <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> traffic. ii In loving memory of my grandparent...|$|R
