40|$|In {{industry}} {{different methods}} of surface hardening {{are widely used}} to increase reliability and durability of friction unit parts. Among these methods are areas of focus based on deformcutting technology (DC) i. e. method of chip-free mechanical treatment. It is shown that DC method allows us to produce through- or partial-hardening surface layers of a large thickness (0, 4 … 1. 5 mm) on steel with no additional heat sources. The standard metal-cutting equipment and common tools are used for deform-cutting process. The significant heat generation in the deform-cutting zone and mechanical effect from the tool allow us to heat undercut layers to the phase transformation point to have the <b>hardening</b> <b>structure</b> {{as a result of}} heat removal to the cold balk. The <b>hardening</b> <b>structure</b> formation occurs at significant heating and cooling rate (106 C/c) with large degrees and rates of strain. The deform-cutting modes and working face tool grinding determine the type and properties of the <b>hardening</b> <b>structure.</b> To produce the <b>hardening</b> <b>structure</b> would require the heat transfer and force action augmentation while treatment. These researches deal with through- and partial surface hardening samples produced by turning steel 35 shafts. While through hardening the phase transformation carry among the whole thickness of the undercut layer; while partial hardening the hardening interlayer formed {{on the side of the}} cutting tool contact. The depth of hardening zone of samples with through hardening layers is 0, 5 mm; the depth of hardening zone of partial hardening samples is 0, 8 mm. Micro-hardness of the through hardening layers is 653 HV 0, 1 and 485 HV 0, 1 for the partial hardening layers. The metallographic analysis shows that the hardening zone formed while deform cutting has disperse structure; there are ferrite ghosts in it. The tempering at temperatures of 200 – 700 C showed that the micro-hardness of the hardening structures formed while deform cutting is larger than the micro-hardness of the samples after quenching. There special structures formed while deform cutting demand more in-depth study using different methods of physical-chemical analysis and mechanical testing. </p...|$|E

Focus {{is placed on the}} relationship between the <b>hardening</b> <b>structure</b> and humidity-resistance of the {{composite binder}}. The results show that the α-starch composite binder has good humidity-resistance due to its special complex structure. SEM observations illustrate that the composite binder consists of reticular matrix and a ball- or lump-shaped reinforcement phase, and the specific property of the binding membrane with heterogeneous structure is affected by humidity to a small extent. Based on the analyses on the interplays of different ingredients in the binder at hardening, the structure model and hygroscopicity-resistant mechanisms of the hardening composite binder were further proposed.

It is found that effect of Sp on rheological properties of pastes CEM I and CEM II is different.

40|$|In this paper, two complex critical-state {{models are}} {{implemented}} in a displacement finite element code. The two models {{are used for}} structured clays and sands, and are characterized by multiple yield surfaces, plastic yielding within the yield surface, and complex kinematic and isotropic hardening laws.

This scheme employs the classical elastoplastic stiffness matrix and requires only the first derivatives of the yield function and plastic potential. This explicit scheme is used to integrate the two complex critical-state models - the sub/super-loading surfaces model (SSLSM) and the kinematic <b>hardening</b> <b>structure</b> model (KHSM). Various boundary-value problems are then analysed. The results for the two models are compared with each other, as well with those from standard Cam-clay models.

The plain cement pastes and waste modified pastes (with cements replacement for 10 % of additives), also pastes with the well-known pozzolana additive, microsilica (MS), were investigated. The studies of development of <b>hardening</b> <b>structure</b> by ultrasound wave velocity (UWV) measurement method, of change of mineral composition and physical-mechanical properties were carried out. Impact of additives is subject to both the own properties (chemical, mineral composition and fineness) of additive and of cement. FCC accelerates noticeably the development of initial structure of finer cement (PCR) only. Beyond 24 h development of structure in all FCC modified pastes is going somewhat slower, nevertheless, after 28 days their structure is already more compact than that of plain pastes. The strength properties are changing accordingly. The development of initial structure of CD modified PCR, and especially PCSN, pastes is going faster, PCN - almost does not change. Beyond 24 h compacting of structure of all CD modified pastes was slower. For the early strength of cements, the impact of CD was negligible, after 28 and 90 days the strength of CD modified PCR and PCN pastes was lower than that of plain pastes. In the case of PCSN, the slag is activated by alkali and the strength increased. CD additive, like MS and FCC, decreases the OH" concentration in the liquid phase of hydrating cement suspensions at the initial period (till 3 h), however further in the course of 28 days it was growing and became higher than that of plain cement suspensions.

30|$|Shakedown {{analysis}} for <b>hardening</b> <b>structures</b> {{has been investigated}} by many researchers. Among hardening models, the isotropic hardening law is generally not reasonable in situations where structures are subjected to cyclic loading {{because it does not}} account for the Bauschinger effect and rejects the possibility of incremental plasticity. The unbounded kinematic hardening model has already been introduced theoretically by Melan [1] and later by Prager [2]. Applications of this model have been investigated by Maier [3] and Ponter [4]. The unbounded kinematic hardening model cannot estimate the plastic collapse and also incremental plasticity but only low-cycle fatigue, while low-cycle fatigue limit with the kinematical hardening model seems not to be essentially different from the perfectly plastic model, cf.
