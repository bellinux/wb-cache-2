40|$|Abstract. The hot ring {{compression}} test of <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> covered with an oxide scale film {{is carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of the oxide scale film on the hot forging characteristics. For changing the chemical compositions of the oxide scale, the oxide scale film is generated at air or steam atmosphere. The nominal coefficient of shear friction of the <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> covered with the oxide scale film is estimated from the plastic deformation behavior during the {{ring compression}} test. The estimated coefficient of shear friction of the <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> covered with the oxide scale film is found to be lower than that of the <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> without the oxide scale film. Furthermore, the oxide scale generated at steam atmosphere provides lower friction characteristics in comparison with the oxide scale generated at air atmosphere. The mechanism of the reduction of friction with the oxide scale is discussed...|$|R

50|$|A {{ball mill}} {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls. The grinding media is the balls, which may be made of <b>steel</b> (<b>chrome</b> <b>steel),</b> stainless steel, ceramic, or rubber. The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as manganese steel or rubber. Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills. The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter.|$|R

50|$|In any {{location}} {{with high}} neutron fluxes, such as within the cores of nuclear reactors, neutron activation contributes to material erosion; periodically the lining materials themselves must be disposed of, as low-level radioactive waste. Some materials are more subject to neutron activation than others, so a suitably chosen low-activation material can significantly reduce this problem (see International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility). For example, Chromium-51 will form by neutron activation in <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> (which contains Cr-50) that {{is exposed to}} a typical reactor neutron flux.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} dance pole typically {{consists of}} a hollow <b>chrome,</b> <b>steel,</b> or brass pole with a circular cross section, running from floor to ceiling. Affixing at the ceiling gives more stability, but is not always realized, especially at night clubs with higher ceilings or at transportable devices. In the United States, the diameter is usually 50mm (2 inches), or the now more popular 45mm (1.75 inches), allowing it to be gripped comfortably with one hand. In Asia, the diameter is usually 45mm or less.|$|R

A prerequisite for successful refining by argon–oxygen or argon–hydrogen plasma is a clean, slag-free surface in the bath. In the case of critical carbon content, an argon–oxygen plasma can contribute to the substantial acceleration of the deoxidation reaction. The values of sulphur content reduction attained are interesting. This above is also applicable to the refining of alloyed and stainless <b>chrome</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R

Having studied the information about cold bulk-metal forming in the available literature, I have suggested two variants of manufacturing processes. The suggested manufacturing variants consist of four forming operations which combine upsetting and extrusion. As far as the chosen variant is concerned, there have been made technological and strength calculations for the individual operations. As regards the designed technology, I have opted for the automatic multistation forming machine TPZK 25, produced by the company ŠMERAL Brno...|$|R

50|$|On 22 November 1938 AMX presentedits new track fitted only to {{the right}} side of a trials vehicle so that direct {{comparisons}} could be made with the old track type. After 1500 kilometres the normal track was completely worn out and the AMX track was now fitted to a second vehicle; after testing had resumed on 9 January 1939 only after 3700 km on 21 March the new track was worn. The commission concluded that the new type was clearly superior in durability, but that this was caused by the use of <b>chrome</b> <b>steel</b> that made it 70% more expensive, too pricy for the French Army.|$|R

Soon a Klingon appears, conversing with the village leader, Apella, and Kirk's group ducks to hide. Apella and the Klingon discuss the manufacture of improved weapons.
