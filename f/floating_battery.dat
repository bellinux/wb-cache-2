5|$|Apart {{from three}} destroyers {{launched}} in 1940 and four submarines from the inter-war years, Brazil's warships were old and mostly obsolete pre-First World War vessels. The mainstays of the fleet, Minas Geraes, São Paulo, , and , {{were all over}} thirty years old. Although Minas Geraes had been further refitted from 1939 to 1943, the ship was still too old and in too poor a condition for any {{active role in the}} Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> in the port of Salvador {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 1940, Italy invaded Greece, {{initiating}} the Greco-Italian War {{as part of}} the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's expansionist ambitions. The Greek army quickly defeated the Italians and pushed them back to Albania. Less than two weeks later, the Italian fleet was badly damaged in the British Raid on Taranto, which significantly reduced the threat the Italian Regia Marina posed to the Greek fleet. From the start of the conflict, Kilkis was used as a <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> based in Salamis. Spare guns from Kilkis and Lemnos were employed as coastal batteries throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{regularly}} {{supplied the}} islandswith food from Britain, and visiting vessels brought bags of earth {{that allowed the}} development of a vegetable garden. Smith supported the islands with several gunvessels, including the converted hoys , , and , the fireship , and the Musquito-class <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> , which he had had purpose-built for the defence of the islands. Lieutenant Charles Papps Price, captain of Badger and an unpopular officer who had repeatedly been passed over for promotion, commanded the British occupation; Price {{spent most of his time}} on the islands with a prostitute he had brought from Portsmouth.|$|E
50|$|The Palestro-class ironclad <b>floating</b> <b>batteries</b> {{were four}} <b>floating</b> <b>batteries</b> {{built for the}} French Navy in 1859-62 to replace the Crimean War-built vessels because of fears that the 1855 ships would {{deteriorate}} {{because they had been}} built hurriedly with poor wood.|$|R

5|$|With Wolfe {{dead and}} several other key {{officers}} injured, British troops fell into a disorganised pursuit of the retreating French troops. The 78th Fraser Highlanders were ordered by Brigadier-General James Murray to pursue the French with their swords, but were met near the city by a heavy fire from a <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> covering the bridge over the St. Charles River as well as militia that remained in the trees. The 78th took {{the highest number of}} casualties of all British units in the battle.|$|E
5|$|All three ships {{served in}} the Active Squadron for {{the first decade of}} their careers, which proved to be uneventful. They were {{transferred}} to the Reserve Squadron in 1905, and by the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, they were serving as training ships. They provided fire support to Italian troops fighting in Libya during the conflict and took part in the seizure of several Ottoman ports, including Tripoli. During World War I, Sardegna was used as a guard ship in Venice, while Re Umberto served as a <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> in Brindisi and Sicilia was reduced to a depot ship. All three ships survived the war and were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{continued}} to see {{service in the}} Greek fleet until the early 1930s, with Kilkis serving as the flagship of the fleet. In 1932, Lemnos was disarmed and used as a barracks ship, and Kilkis {{was reduced to a}} training ship. Lemnos was used as a barracks ship after 1937, and Kilkis became a <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> at Salamis Naval Base in 1940. During the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, both ships were attacked and sunk in Salamis. German Ju-87 Stuka dive-bombers bombed both ships in the harbor; Kilkis was sunk outright while Lemnos was beached to avoid sinking. Both ships were broken up {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Petropavlovsk was still incomplete. She was {{nevertheless}} {{used as a}} <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> {{in the defense of}} Leningrad in August of that year. Several other ships, including the cruiser , joined Petropavlovsk in shelling the advancing Germans. On 7 September, the ship fired on German forces encircling the city; she fired forty salvos from her forward main battery turrets—the only two operational—expending some 700 rounds of ammunition during the attack. On 17 September 1941, the ship was disabled by German heavy artillery; after being hit 53 times, the ship was forced to beach herself to avoid sinking.|$|E
5|$|Rostislav was {{actively}} engaged in World War I until {{the collapse of the}} Black Sea Fleet in the beginning of 1918. She was the first Russian ship to fire on enemy targets on land during World War I, the first to be hit by a German airstrike, and the first to destroy a submarine, albeit a Russian one. In April 1918 the fleeing Bolsheviks abandoned Rostislav in Sevastopol. A year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines. The White forces used the ship as a towed <b>floating</b> <b>battery,</b> then scuttled her in the Strait of Kerch in November 1920.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} of Crimea from May to November 1918 {{did not affect}} the abandoned ship. The Anglo-French forces that replaced the Germans stayed in Sevastopol until April 1919. Before leaving, the British destroyed Rostislavs engines on April 25. The White forces of Baron Wrangel used the disabled ship as a <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> in the Sea of Azov. The ship, manned by a ragtag volunteer crew, was stationed in the shallow waters of the Strait of Kerch to harass the Reds in Taman and prevent a landing in the Crimea. After the defeat of Wrangel's land forces, the crew scuttled Rostislav in the Strait of Kerch to prevent the Red forces from breaking through to the Black Sea.|$|E

50|$|On July 19 and 20, Tordenskjold {{gathered}} his ships in Rivö fjord, consisting of seven ships of the line, two frigates, four barges, three <b>floating</b> <b>batteries</b> and four galleys, comprising roughly 500 cannons and around 6000 men. On July 21, an assault begun on Nya Älvsborg using barges and <b>floating</b> <b>batteries.</b> The Danes {{spread out and}} used the surrounding islands for cover as they closed in on the fortress. Mortars were set up at nearby Aspholmarna.|$|R
5|$|The {{two ships}} of the Baltic Fleet {{did not play}} a {{prominent}} role in the Winter War, but did have their anti-aircraft guns significantly increased before Operation Barbarossa in 1941. However this did not help either ship as they attempted to provide fire support for the defenders of Leningrad. Marat had her bow blown off and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was badly damaged by multiple bomb hits in September. The former was sunk, but later raised and became a <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> {{for the duration of the}} Siege of Leningrad while the latter spent over a year under repair, although this was lengthened by subsequent bomb hits while in the hands of the shipyard. Both ships bombarded German and Finnish troops so long as they remained within reach, but Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya did not venture away from Kronstadt for the duration of the war. Parizhskaya Kommuna remained in Sevastopol until forced to evacuate by advancing German troops. She made one trip to besieged Sevastopol in December 1941 and made a number of bombardments in support of the Kerch Offensive during January–March 1942. She was withdrawn from combat in April as German aerial supremacy had made it too risky to risk such a large target.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Floating</b> <b>Battery</b> of Charleston Harbor was an ironclad {{vessel that}} was {{constructed}} by the Confederacy in early 1861, {{a few months before}} the American Civil War ignited. Apart from being a marvel to contemporary Charlestonians, it was a strategic naval artillery platform that took part in the bombardment of Fort Sumter on April 12 and April 13, 1861, making it the first <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> to engage in hostilities during the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|In 1939 December {{the ship}} served as <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> ship Batterijschip Vliereede off Vlieland for several weeks. In early 1940 she was laid up {{waiting to be}} scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Soon she {{was back}} in Britain, being fitted out at Woolwich between September and October 1803 for service with Trinity House. The Navy next used her as a <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> in 1804.|$|E
25|$|Between September and October 1803 the Navy had Musette fitted {{out as a}} <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> {{for service}} on the River Yealm. Lieutenant John Bevan {{commissioned}} Musette in November 1803. Lieutenant Dundas replaced Bevan in December 1804.|$|E

25|$|The Confederates {{promptly}} made repairs, unspiked the guns, built new gun carriages, {{and reinforced}} the fortifications at Ft. Moultrie. Dozens of new batteries and defense positions were constructed throughout the Charleston harbor area and armed with weapons captured from the arsenal. Intent on gaining a strategic advantage in artillery position, the Confederates adopted the contemporary military idea of implementing <b>floating</b> <b>batteries.</b> The French Navy had enjoyed success using <b>floating</b> <b>batteries</b> in the Battle of Kinburn (1855) to demolish Russian forts during the Crimean War.|$|R
25|$|Sometime in {{the dark}} hours between April 9 and April 10, the battery was towed and emplaced near {{the western end of}} Sullivan's Island by order of Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard. It was manned by members of Company D of the South Carolina Artillery Battalion and {{commanded}} by Capt. Hamilton. On April 12, Hamilton's <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> commenced in a 34-hour intermittent artillery siege against Union army forces occupying Ft. Sumter.|$|E
25|$|The <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> Duque de Tetuán was an ironclad warship, a low-freeboard vessel {{similar in}} design to a monitor, of the Spanish Navy, and was {{constructed}} during the Third Carlist War to provide coastal defense and fire support for troops ashore. Completed {{after the end}} of the conflict for which it was designed, the ship was assigned to the defense of Ferrol. It remained in this duty, though briefly decommissioned in 1897, until it was decommissioned and scrapped in 1900.|$|E
25|$|Faà di Bruno was an Italian monitor built during World War I. Although {{called a}} monitor, Faà di Bruno {{was more of}} a {{self-propelled}} barge with a bow welded on. She was decommissioned in 1924, but returned to service as the <b>floating</b> <b>battery</b> GM 194 at the beginning of World War II. She was towed to Genoa and {{spent the rest of the}} war there. The ship was captured by the Germans after the Surrender of Italy in 1943 and was renamed as Biber. She was surrendered in May 1945 and scrapped afterwards.|$|E
