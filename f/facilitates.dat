In the present study, which deals with the mechanism of the <b>facilitated</b> diffusion of H+ and O 2 in solutions of earthworm hemoglobin, examples for both types of facilitation are presented. Only translational, not rotational, diffusion of earthworm hemoglobin appears {{to lead to a}} <b>facilitated</b> O 2 flux. In contrast, substantial <b>facilitated</b> H+ fluxes of comparable size arise from rotational diffusion as well as from translational diffusion of this large protein. This is derived from measurements of <b>facilitated</b> H+ and O 2 fluxes in earthworm hemoglobin solutions and determinations of the rotational and translational diffusion coefficients of earthworm hemoglobin {{with the help of a}} theoretical treatment of <b>facilitated</b> diffusion by rotational carrier diffusion.

40|$|This {{graduation}} report {{studies the}} <b>facilitating</b> {{role of the}} municipality in the urban area development process in the Netherlands. Though this role is often mentioned in articles, {{it has not been}} defined due to a gap in literature and a gap in practical knowledge on the subject. This research tries to reduce that gap, by understanding the municipal roles, goals, measures and means to steer urban area development projects better and by conceptualising the <b>facilitating</b> role. This is done by answering the main research question: ‘What does the role of a <b>facilitating</b> municipality in the urban area development process in the Netherlands entail?’. An extensive literature study and a case study with five embedded cases provide valuable information to answer that question. The <b>facilitating</b> role is part of a framework of four municipal roles to steer urban area development projects: shaping plans, regulating markets, stimulating markets and <b>facilitating</b> the process. The <b>facilitating</b> role is supported by three measures: acquiring market information and knowledge, managing market rooted networks and organising the municipal project team. These measures are supported by a set of means and pre-conditions. The <b>facilitating</b> role is about <b>facilitating</b> the process of urban area development and does not mean ‘letting go’, ‘laissez-fair’ or <b>facilitate</b> only market party stakeholders. The <b>facilitating</b> role can be played by the municipality in all phases of the life-cycle of an urban area and regardless of the form of public-private co-operation...|$|R
