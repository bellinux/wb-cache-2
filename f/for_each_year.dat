5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{have studied the}} {{surviving}} Pipe rolls, using them {{as the basis for}} study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.|$|E
