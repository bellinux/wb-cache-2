In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience. With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than <b>generic</b> <b>ads.</b> The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by “bid phrases” representing those queries where the advertisers {{would like to have}} their ad displayed. Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content, and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach. However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads.

When the schedules by which the OFDMA subchannels are assigned to wireless links are binary, obtaining a characterization of the maximum rates that can be reliably communicated by these networks can be shown to be NPhard. To circumvent this difficulty, we provide efficient means for computing two lower bounds on the achievable weighted sum rates. The first bound is obtained by using geometric programming approximation techniques, whereas the second bound is obtained by rounding the solutions of a relaxed version of the cross layer design problem.

40|$|Abstract. In many RFID {{applications}} it {{is necessary}} to be able to identify the presence of (all) the tags of a predefined group, e. g., to establish that all components of a kit are present. If the interrogation is offline, by RFID readers that do not share any secret keys with the tags, then a record of simultaneous presence, or a grouping proof, has to be generated by the tags themselves. This type of proof is typically obtained by assigning to each tag in the group a unique group identifier. In certain situations, however, the entire group may not be present, and it may be sufficient that a (an ad hoc) subgroup proof is generated. In this paper we consider ad hoc subgroup proofs. We first describe a <b>generic</b> <b>ad</b> hoc subgroup proof by extending a previously proposed grouping proof to an ad hoc setting.

40|$|SUMMARY Since a {{radio channel}} is shared among {{terminals}} {{in an ad}} hoc network, packet collisions are frequent. In case of transmitting packets especially using TCP, data and ACK packets are transmitted in opposite directions on the same radio channel. Therefore, frequent collisions are unavoidable, and this seriously degrades TCP throughput. It is possible to transmit to two or more nodes which adjoin from a certain node simultaneously on the radio channel. To {{reduce the likelihood of}} packet collisions when an intermediate node transmits both data and ACK packets, these two types of packet can be combined and transmitted {{at the same time to}} increase the efficiency of radio channel utilization. In this paper, we propose a new technique to improve TCP performance by combining data and ACK packets. Our proposed technique is applicable to <b>generic</b> <b>ad</b> hoc networks easily. By means of a simulation using networks with various topologies, we have found that throughput can be improved by up to 60 % by applying our proposed technique. key words: ad hoc network, TCP, collision, throughput, simulation 1...|$|E

After 20 years from its introduction, we unfold the transition from evolutionary stability (ESS) to branching, along with gradual change in environmental, control, or exploitation parameters. The transition is a catastrophic evolutionary shift, the branching dynamics driving the system to a nonlocal evolutionary attractor that is viable before the transition, but unreachable from the ESS. Weak evolutionary stability hence qualifies as an early-warning signal for branching and a testable measure of the community’s resilience against biodiversity. We clarify a controversial theoretical question about the smoothness of the mutant invasion fitness at incipient branching. While a supposed nonsmoothness at third order long prevented the analysis of the ESS-branching transition, we argue that smoothness is generally expected and derive a local canonical model in terms of the geometry of the invasion fitness before branching.

In mobile communica-tions, related research works focus on the collection of user’s personal information by the mobile apps, protection against such data collection, {{and the implications of}} additional traffic generated by the ads on the mobile device resource utilization. In this work, we present a novel analysis of targeted advertising in the Google AdMob advertising network and show insights about the relevance of Google user profiles, and the categories of apps used, on the in-app ads served on smartphones. We define the classes of ads based on the match between received ads and the app (contextual ads), and Google AdMob user’s profile (targeted ads). Our analysis reveals that, for all comparable experiments, the proportion of targeted ads is in all cases higher than the proportion of contextual ads. Moreover, blocking the targeting (disabling targeting in an AdMob user profile settings) results in a significant drop in the number of received ads with some experimental instances receiving no ads at all. Overall, the number of targeted ads is comparatively lower than the number of <b>generic</b> <b>ads.</b> Although this could be partially due to the limited size of ad pools at the time of our experiments, there is also an indication that, although user’s information is collected, the subsequent use of such information for ads is still low.

The GHG account-ing was done by distinguishing between direct contributions at the AD facility and indirect upstream or downstream contribu-tions. GHG accounting for a <b>generic</b> <b>AD</b> facility with either biogas utilization at the facility or upgrading of the gas for vehicle fuel resulted in a GWF from – 375 (a saving) to 111 (a load) kg CO 2 -eq. tonne – 1 wet waste.

This large range was a result of the variation found for a number of key parameters: energy substitu-tion by biogas, N 2 O-emission from digestate in soil, fugitive emission of CH 4, unburned CH 4, carbon bound in soil and fertilizer substitution. GWF for a specific type of AD facility was in the range – 95 to – 4 kg CO 2 -eq. tonne – 1 wet waste. The ranges of uncertainty, especially of fugitive losses of CH 4 and carbon sequestration highly influenced the result.

40|$|The {{advances}} in low power micro-processors, wireless networks and embedded systems {{have raised the}} need to utilize the significant resources of mobile devices. These devices for example, smart phones, tablets, laptops, wearables, and sensors are gaining enormous processing power, storage capacity and wireless bandwidth. In addition, the advancement in wireless mobile technology {{has created a new}} communication paradigm via which a wireless network can be created without any priori infrastructure called mobile ad hoc network (MANET). While progress is being made towards improving the efficiencies of mobile devices and reliability of wireless mobile networks, the mobile technology is continuously facing the challenges of un-predictable disconnections, dynamic mobility and the heterogeneity of routing protocols. Hence, the traditional wired, wireless routing protocols are not suitable for MANET due to its unique dynamic ad hoc nature. Due to the reason, the research community has developed and is busy developing protocols for routing in MANET to cope with the challenges of MANET. However, there are no single <b>generic</b> <b>ad</b> hoc routing protocols available so far, which can address all the basic challenges of MANET as mentioned before. Thus this diverse range of ever growing routing protocols has created barriers for mobile nodes of different MANET taxonomies to intercommunicate and hence wasting a huge amount of valuable resources. To provide interaction between heterogeneous MANETs, the routing protocols require conversion of packets, meta-model and their behavioural capabilities. Here, the fundamental challenge is to understand the packet level message format, meta-model and behaviour of different routing protocols, which are significantly different for different MANET Taxonomies. To overcome the above mentioned issues, this thesis proposes an Interoperable Framework for heterogeneous MANETs called IF-MANET. The framework hides the complexities of heterogeneous routing protocols and provides a homogeneous layer for seamless communication between these routing protocols. The framework creates a unique Ontology for MANET routing protocols and a Message Translator to semantically compare the packets and generates the missing fields using the rules defined in the Ontology. Hence, the translation between an existing as well as newly arriving routing protocols will be achieved dynamically and on-the-fly. To discover a route for the delivery of packets across heterogeneous MANET taxonomies, the IF-MANET creates a special Gateway node to provide cluster based inter-domain routing. The IF-MANET framework can be used to develop different middleware applications. For example: Mobile grid computing that could potentially utilise huge amounts of aggregated data collected from heterogeneous mobile devices. Disaster & crises management applications can be created to provide on-the-fly infrastructure-less emergency communication across organisations by utilising different MANET taxonomies...|$|E

One issue in the public policy debate concerns whether price inflation is different for the elderly, particularly because the official Bureau of Labor Statistics price indexes for medical care have been growing more rapidly than the overall CPI, and medical care expenditures constitute a larger proportion of the elderlys budget than of the youngs. Using annual IMS data from 1990 to 1996, we examine empirically whether elderly-nonelderly price inflation differentials exist for prescription pharmaceuticals. We assess prices for prescription drugs destined for ultimate use by the elderly versus the nonelderly at three points in the distribution chain: initial sales from manufacturers, intermediate purchases by retail pharmacies, and final sales from retail pharmacies to patients or payors. We find that at the initial point in the distribution chain, no differences in price inflation exist for the aggregate of drugs destined for use by the elderly versus those for the nonelderly. At the intermediate sell-in point to pharmacy distribution, we examine antibiotics (ABs), antidepressants (ADs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs).

As a result, the dynamics of VANET are different from <b>generic</b> mobile <b>ad</b> hoc networks. The behavior of vehicles and their effect on the protocol performance has not been comprehensively investigated {{in the context of}} VANET. In this work, we analyze the performance of multi-hop TCP in a multi-lane highway environment where vehicles are configured as clients or routers trying to reach a fixed access point. In particular, we look at the effect of tuning transmission power in dense and sparse road scenarios on the TCP throughput and latency. To conduct our study, we have developed an integrated simulation tool that accurately models both the vehicular mobility and the networking protocol stack. Using our simulation tool we obtain detailed TCP statistics and correlate them with the location, velocity, and other properties of VANET nodes. We study scenarios with a single sender as well as multiple senders. In each case, results show that throughput significantly deteriorates as the number of hops from the sender to the access point increases. A higher number of hops results in higher losses due to interference and loss of connectivity, which causes TCP to throttle back the sending rate unnecessarily. I...|$|R

The class of PDEs to which the theory applies is evolution equations whose steady part is a gradient elliptic PDE. Examples are the 2 + 1 Ginzburg-Landau equation with real coefficients, and the 2 + 1 planar Swift-Hohenberg equation. © 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Networks using Support Vector Regression This paper {{describes}} follow-up {{research to}} {{a previous study}} by the authors which used Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to evaluate the likely impacts of implementing diversion strategies in response to incidents on highway networks. In the previous study, the training and testing of the CBR and SVR tools were performed on a single transportation network from South Carolina, which limited {{the applicability of the}} developed tool to the specific network for which it was developed. To address this limitation, the current study investigates the feasibility of developing a generic decision support system (DSS) capable of predicting traffic diversion impacts for new transportation networks that the tool has not previously seen. In such cases, users need only input the geometric and traffic variables, via a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and the tool, which uses a SVR model, will predict the benefits of diverting traffic for a specific incident on the new site. To illustrate the feasibility of developing such a tool, two different highway networks covering portions of I- 85 and I- 385 in South Carolina were used to train the SVR model, which was then tested on a third network covering portions of I- 89 in Vermont. The study found only a 15 percent difference between the predictions of the SVR model and those of a detailed simulation counterpart, demonstrating the feasibility of developing a <b>generic</b> DSS. <b>Adding</b> more sites and parameters to train the software is also expected to improve the prediction accuracy of the DSS...|$|R
40|$|Firms can {{now offer}} {{personalized}} recommendations to consumers who {{return to their}} website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this {{is more effective than}} simply showing <b>generic</b> brand <b>ads,</b> the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e. g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers {{should be aware of the}} multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{quantitative}} image analysis in radiology is universal: computer-aided detection, segmentation for 3 D volume visualization, image enhancement, pattern recognition etc. All need effective, robust and preferably <b>generic</b> (not <b>ad</b> hoc) algorithms for the computer. How to design such algorithms? A good inspiration source is the functionality {{of the visual}} system, the best investigated brain structure today. In this talk we will explain how we think the brain calculates features in images, why the retina measures at {{a wide range of}} resolutions and how we can exploit this in multi-scale analysis, and how we can learn to understand and exploit the Gestalt Laws. The visual system is strongly adaptive and self-learning. New optical recording techniques have given new insight in how the cells in the visual cortex are functioning. We will go through these functionalities step-by-step. What we discover, is quite amazing. We recognize huge amounts of filter banks in the first stages of vision: many filters analyse each pixel of the incoming image at a range of scales, orientations, derivative order, for each colour, and also as a function of time. Extensive feedback loops take care of optimal settings locally. We programmed these filters into the computer, and were able to build many interesting applications for (bio-) medical imaging: detection of catheters at seriously reduced levels of fluoroscopy X-ray radiation dose, automatic detection of polyps in the colon, quantitative analysis of ischemic heart ventricle deformation, breast cancer CAD, pulmonary emboli CAD and analysis of in-vivo microscopy images now so abundant in modern life-sciences research...|$|R
