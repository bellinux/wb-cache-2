The aim {{of the current study}} was to use low resolution electromagnetic tomography to localize the sources of D-Pos and D-Neg. Participants switched randomly between simple tasks and showed an increase in reaction time (RT) for switch relative to repeat trials, i. e., an RT switch cost. ERP waveforms showed a D-Pos in the cue-related interval and a D-Neg in the stimulus-related interval. D-Pos was localized to the superior parietal cortex, supporting arguments that D-Pos is associated with activating task rules during anticipatory reconfiguration. D-Neg was localized to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, implicating D-Neg in post-stimulus control...|$|E
40|$|With the {{explosive}} growth of the wireless market, the demand for low-cost and highly-integrated radio frequency (RF) transceiver has been increased. Keeping up with this trend, complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) has been spotlighted {{by virtue of its}} superior characteristics. However, there are challenges in achieving this goal, especially designing the transmitter portion. The objective of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of fully integrated CMOS transmitter module which includes power amplifier (PA) and transmit/receive (T/R) switch by compensating for the intrinsic drawbacks of CMOS technology. As an effort to overcome the challenges, the high-power handling T/R switches are introduced as {{the first part of this}} dissertation. The proposed <b>differential</b> <b>switch</b> topology and feed-forward capacitor helps reducing the voltage stress over the switch devices, enabling a linear power transmission. With the high-power T/R switches, a new transmitter front-end topology - differential PA and T/R switch topology with the multi-section PA output matching network - is also proposed. The multi-stage PA output matching network assists to relieve the voltage stress over the switch device even more, by providing a low switch operating impedance. By analyzing the power performance and efficiency of entire transmitter module, design methodology for the high-power handling and efficient transmitter module is established. Finally, the research in this dissertation provides low-cost, high-power handling, and efficient CMOS RF transmitter module for wireless applications.

40|$|Learning novel skills {{involves}} reorganization and optimization {{of cognitive}} processing involving a broad network of brain regions. Previous work has shown asymmetric costs of {{switching to a}} well-trained task versus a poorly-trained task, but the neural basis of these <b>differential</b> <b>switch</b> costs is unclear. The current study examined the neural signature of task switching {{in the context of}} acquisition of new skill. Human participants alternated randomly between a novel visual task (mirror-reversed word reading) and a highly practiced one (plain word reading), allowing the isolation of task switching and skill set maintenance. Two scan sessions were separated by two weeks, with behavioral training on the mirror reading task in between the two sessions. Broad cortical regions, including bilateral prefrontal, parietal, and extrastriate cortices, showed decreased activity associated with learning of the mirror reading skill. In contrast, learning to switch to the novel skill was associated with decreased activity in a focal subcortical region in the dorsal striatum. Switching to the highly practiced task was associated with a non-overlapping set of regions, suggesting substantial differences in the neural substrates of switching as a function of task skill. Searchlight multivariate pattern analysis also revealed that learning was associated with decreased pattern information for mirror versus plain reading tasks in fronto-parietal regions. Inferior frontal junction and posterior parietal cortex showed a joint effect of univariate activation and pattern information. These results suggest distinct learning mechanisms task performance and executive control as a function of learning...|$|E
40|$|An {{improvement}} in efficiency of direct digital frequency synthesis (DDFS) systems is demanded for {{low power frequency}} synthesis in wireless communications. Concurrently a reduction in cost is important for disposable, low resolution frequency synthesis in biomedical instrumentation systems. To meet both these needs a new ROM-less architecture is presented here that uses {{less than half the}} circuit area of previous state of the art systems and improves the efficiency by operating at up to a tenth of the power consumption. The main contribution presented in this thesis is a novel, efficient method of interpolation for DDFS that uses the nonlinear response of the CMOS <b>differential</b> <b>switch</b> already present in the high speed current steering DAC. The nonlinear response provides a smooth transition between the conventional, quantised DAC output. This interpolation may be performed with the conventionally discarded phase bits leading to highly compact and efficient DDFS architectures for application in instrumentation and communications systems. DDFS systems typically consist of a large overflowing accumulator to generate the phase, a ROM lookup table to convert the phase to amplitude and a DAC to perform the digital to analogue conversion. Approximations are often used {{to reduce the size of}} the ROM, however the most efficient DDFS systems remove the ROM completely and calculate the phase to amplitude conversion directly or store the conversion in a non-linear DAC. State of the art, high speed CMOS DACs consisting of thermometer decoded arrays of current steering cells are often used to reduce non-ideal effects that cause unwanted transients leading to a degradation in spectral purity (SFDR). A novel ROM-less technique is introduced here that uses the non-linear response of a current cell consisting of an ideal current source and differential current switch to interpolate between the output levels of a non-linear DAC. Using this technique two architectures are developed. A compact architecture using only four or six current cells suitable for instrumentation applications and a thermometer decoded architecture using 64 current cells for communications applications that require better spectral purity. The compact architecture is 100 % efficient as all the bias current is used to form the output. The only additional component is a small linear phase DAC. One compact system with a nonlinear DAC of four current cells achieved an SFDR of - 40 dBc up to output frequencies of 1 MHz for dielectrophoresis consumed only 5 μ W/MHz and a second compact system with a six cell nonlinear DAC for electrical impedance spectroscopy, achieved an SFDR of - 48 dBc for output frequencies up to 1 MHz and consumed only 8 μ W/MHz. As an extension to improve the SFDR a segmented system with 64 current cells was developed. The larger number of current cells required the use of a modified thermometer decoder that had the added benefit of improving the spectral purity by linearising the response of each cell. The total active area was 0. 6 mm 2, less than half of state of the art ROM-less DDFS systems that include a DAC. Although measurement results of the 64 cell system were disappointing, simulations suggest that these problems may be solved in a future chip that should be able to achieve - 70 dBc SFDR at 100 MHz. Despite the loss in performance from simulation to measurement, the measured 64 cell system still meets the spectral purity requirements of UMTS and Bluetooth, - 60 dBc SFDR. </p...|$|E
