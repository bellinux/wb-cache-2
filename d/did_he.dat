5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Hickenbottom {{posed for}} a non-nude layout in Playgirl magazine. Only after he posed <b>did</b> <b>he</b> {{discover}} Playgirl has a mostly homosexual readership, for {{which some of}} his fellow wrestlers teased him.|$|E
5|$|Israeli writer Amos Oz {{writes in}} his {{biography}} A Tale of Love and Darkness that Winesburg, Ohio had a powerful influence on his writing, showing him that literature must not necessarily always be about heroes.

5|$|Stanley {{never saw}} a Stanley Cup {{championship}} game, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever present the Cup. Although his term as Governor General ended in September 1893, {{he was forced to}} return to England on July 15. In April of that year, his elder brother Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby died, and Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby.|$|E
5|$|The goddess he worshipped {{the most}} zealously, however, was Minerva. Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> keep a {{personal}} shrine dedicated {{to her in}} his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage—in four different attested reverse types—and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.|$|E
5|$|The second {{hypothesis}} holds that Userkaf chose {{to return to}} 3rd dynasty (c. 2670–2610 BC) traditions: not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> choose to construct his mortuary complex on the north-east corner of Djoser's complex but its layout {{is similar to that}} of Djoser. Indeed, both are organized on a north–south axis and both have their entrances located at the south-end of the eastern side.|$|E

5|$|UFA Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) {{began to}} see Brownlee as a better leader than the indecisive Greenfield. A group of them {{attempted}} to force Greenfield to resign in Brownlee's favour. Though Brownlee opposed these attempts, initially threatening to resign if Greenfield <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> was eventually persuaded to accept the premiership if Greenfield willingly relinquished it. Brownlee became premier November 23, 1925.|$|E
5|$|After Paul {{wakes up}} and {{mentions}} that he argued with Diana, an anonymous caller informs Diana of what Paul said and she begins packing. Mark and his team arrive at her hotel, but they find the room is empty. Diana goes {{to the hospital to}} see Paul, he tries to call for help, but he is too weak. Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> would be in the morgue. She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving through the side entrance of the room.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Oxford, Hooper {{directed}} further television commercials, intending {{to break into}} the film industry the same way Ridley Scott, Tony Scott and Hugh Hudson <b>did.</b> <b>He</b> was introduced by his father to the television producer Matthew Robinson, who mentored Hooper and gave him his first television directing work. For Robinson, Hooper directed episodes of the short-lived Tyne Tees Television soap opera Quayside in 1997, four episodes of the Children's BBC television series Byker Grove in the same year, and his first episodes of the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1998.|$|E

All the time <b>does</b> <b>he</b> seek after bugs and flies. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not eat the bugs and flies, then why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> seek after them? I do not know. Only do I {{know that he is}} a funny white man. Also <b>does</b> <b>he</b> seek after the eggs of birds. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not eat the eggs. All that is inside he takes out, and only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> keep the shell. Eggshell is not good to eat. Nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> eat the eggshells, but puts them away in soft boxes where they will not break. He catch many small birds. But <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not eat the birds. He takes only the skins and puts them away in boxes. Also <b>does</b> <b>he</b> like bones. Bones are not good to eat. And this strange white man likes best the bones of long time ago which he digs out of the ground.|$|R
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|Between 1845 and 1847, Belgian-French {{composer}} César Franck {{wrote an}} orchestral piece based on Victor Hugo's poem Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne. The work exhibits {{characteristics of a}} symphonic poem, and some musicologists, such as Norman Demuth and Julien Tiersot, consider it {{the first of its}} genre, preceding Liszt's compositions. However, Franck did not publish or perform his piece; neither <b>did</b> <b>he</b> set about defining the genre. Liszt's determination to explore and promote the symphonic poem gained him recognition as the genre's inventor.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither <b>did</b> <b>he</b> like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first phase}} {{will be the}} family interview, for which one will need a family member to come along. The {{questions}} {{will be asked to}} the family member, and can be anything along the lines of [...] "Does he wear colorful clothing? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> wear tight clothing? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> wear accessories? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> put on makeup? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> behave feminine?" [...] etc. In order to get to the second phase, the personal interview, the doctor must be sufficiently convinced by the answers.|$|R

5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Domitian also {{revived the}} {{practice}} of the imperial cult, which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and Cassius Dio allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of Dominus et Deus. However, not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> reject the title of Dominus during his reign, but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.|$|E
5|$|During their {{approach}} to Guadalcanal, the Japanese force passed through a large and intense rain squall which, along with a complex formation plus some confusing orders from Abe, split the formation into several groups. The U.S. force steamed in a single column in Ironbottom Sound, with destroyers in the lead and rear of the column, and the cruisers in the center. Five ships had the new, far-superior SG radar, but Callaghan's deployment put none {{of them in the}} forward part of the column, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> choose one for his flagship. Callaghan did not issue a battle plan to his ship commanders.|$|E

5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said to behave {{in a way that}} caused popular resentment, taking provisions as they passed through the countryside while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E
50|$|He was a {{very modest}} person, who insisted that even the {{ordinary}} plumber or electrician knows more about his craft than <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>He</b> {{said he could not}} explain how <b>he</b> <b>did</b> what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> on the field of play, and that he just followed his instincts.|$|R
