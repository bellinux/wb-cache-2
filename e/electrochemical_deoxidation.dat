To minimize waste salts, the reacted salts {{have to be}} regenerated. This can be done either by converting CaO to CaCl 2 by chlorination with Cl 2 and adding calcium metal or by <b>electrochemical</b> <b>deoxidation</b> of CaO. In the first method, the addition of calcium metal increases the amount of reacted salts, and consequently the waste salts, while in the second method the quantity of reacted salts remains constant. The <b>electrochemical</b> <b>deoxidation</b> of CaO occurs in one step and the produced oxygen is evacuated. This article describes {{a study of the}} <b>electrochemical</b> <b>deoxidation</b> of CaO using a solid oxide membrane...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{reaction}} mechanism of electrochemical extraction of FexTi alloys direct from natural ilmenite in molten CaCl 2 has been investigated. The <b>electrochemical</b> <b>deoxidation</b> experiment process {{was carried out}} at 1000 °C and 3. 8 V, and a solid oxide oxygen-ion-conducting membrane (SOM) filled with carbon-saturated liquid metal was served as the inert anode of the electrolytic cell. The macro-/micro-structure variations of the samples during electrolysis were investigated. The reaction routes from natural ilmenite to FexTi alloys are proposed and discussed. It is found that element Fe is reduced firstly from ilmenite and thus serves as electronic conductor to accelerate subsequent deoxidation, FexTi alloys can be produced directly from natural ilmenite by electrolysis in molten salt. It is suggested that FexTi phase can be formed directly from FexTiOy compounds and/or from deoxidation-generated Ti and Fe through various reaction routes...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} oxygen from rare-earth metals (RE, RE=Gd, Tb, Dy, Er) by an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>deoxidation</b> method was investigated. A {{titanium}} basket containing the rare-earth metal sample, submerged in molten CaCl 2 electrolyte, formed the cathode of an electrolysis cell. A high-purity graphite anode was used. The calcium metal produced at the cathode effectively deoxidized the rare-earth metal. Carbon monoxide and dioxide were generated at the graphite anode. Rare-earth metals containing more than 2000 mass ppm oxygen were deoxidized to 10 – 50 mass ppm level by electrolysis at 1189 K for 36 ks (10 h). Cyclic voltammetry {{was used to}} characterize the molten salt {{at different stages of}} the process. The effectiveness of the process is discussed {{with the aid of a}} chemical potential diagram for RE–O solid solutions. The new electrochemical technique is compared with the conventional deoxidation methods reported in the literature. The possibility of nitrogen removal from the rare-earth metals by the electrochemical method is outlined...|$|E
40|$|Ti– 15 wt % Mo alloys were {{produced}} via the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>deoxidation</b> of (Ti,Mo) O 2 precursors (formed by sintering TiO 2 and MoO 2 blended powders) in a molten CaCl 2 electrolyte at 1173 K via the Fray–Farthing–Chen (FFC) Cambridge process. The reduction of (Ti,Mo) O 2 {{was characterized by}} analyzing several partially reduced samples taken periodically through the deoxidation process. Fully metallic samples were retrieved after 9 h of reduction. This relatively short reduction time relative to that documented in pure TiO 2 was attributed to the early formation of a conductive (Ti,Mo) O 2 network. TiO 2 is known to reduce through its lower oxides sequentially to form Ti. However, {{it was found that}} the presence of Mo reduced the number of lower Ti oxides traversed during reduction. This was believed to be beneficial as fewer crystallographic changes take place. The slowest step in the reduction of TiO 2 is known to be the deoxidation of Ti; this step was accelerated as Mo stabilized beta Ti at oxygen contents approaching TiO...|$|E
40|$|The oxygen {{potentials}} of four rare-earth metal – oxygen (RE–O: RE=Gd, Dy, Tb, Er) solid solutions {{have been}} measured by equilibration with yttrium – oxygen (Y–O) and titanium – oxygen (Ti–O) solid solutions. Rare-earth metal, yttrium and titanium samples were immersed in calcium-saturated CaCl 2 melt at temperatures between 1093 and 1233 K. Homogeneous oxygen potential {{was established in}} the metallic samples through the fused salt, which contains some dissolved CaO. The metallic samples were analyzed for oxygen after quenching. The oxygen potentials of RE–O solid solutions were determined using either Y–O or Ti–O solid solution as the reference. This method enabled reliable measurement of extremely low oxygen potentials at high temperature (circa pO 2 = 10 − 48 atm at 1173 K). It was found that the oxygen affinity of the metals decreases in the order: Y>Er>Dy>Tb>Gd>Ti. Values for the standard Gibbs energy of solution of oxygen in RE metals obtained in this study, permit assessment of the extent of deoxidation that can be achieved with various purification techniques. It may be possible to achieve an oxygen level of 10 mass ppm using an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>deoxidation</b> method...|$|E
40|$|Ti- 10 wt % W alloys were {{produced}} via the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>deoxidation</b> of mixed TiO 2 +WO 3 sintered precursors in a molten CaCl 2 electrolyte at 1173 K. Fully metallic samples were retrieved after 15 h of reduction. This reduction time was {{longer than that}} observed for metallization of (Ti,Mo) O- 2 sintered precursors. This was believed to occur {{as a result of}} significant differences in the reduction pathway, despite tungsten and molybdenum possessing similar interactions with titanium. It was found that the reduction initiated with the rapid reduction of WO 3 to a fine W-Ti particulate. TiO 2 then proceeded to reduce sequentially through the lower oxides, with concurrent formation of Ca(Ti,W) O- 3. Between 1 and 3 h of reduction the sample is believed to be composed of Ca(Ti,W) O- 3 and TiO. A comproportionation reaction between these two phases is then observed, resulting in the formation of W-Ti and CaTi 2 O 4. However homogenization between the product titanium and W-Ti does not take place until the titanium is sufficiently deoxidized; thus, beta-Ti forms late in the reduction process. It is believed that the late formation of beta-Ti in the reduction process, coupled with the lack of a conductive metal oxide network, accounts for the relatively slow reduction time...|$|E
