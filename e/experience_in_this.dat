5|$|Founded in 1962, Tatsunoko Production {{celebrated their}} 40th year of {{animated}} film production by releasing Karas in 2005, their first production being Space Ace in 1965. Keiichi Sato {{joined the company}} as the project director after he pitched its concept of a life-sized dark hero to the management. He researched production and direction techniques from kabuki, a form of traditional Japanese theater; and Japanese staged sword fights as materials for the project. Choreographed sword fights rendered with 3D animation were rare at that time, and Sato felt this would help distinguish the show. The use of theatrical elements and movie shooting techniques in its presentation sets Karas apart from its contemporaries. Producer Kenji Nakamura felt the team's lack of <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area pushed them to ignore their previous animation work experience and break free of restrictions influenced by traditional animation production.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> war was {{encouraging}} {{in that it}} had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would {{have a profound effect on}} Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E

A minute into Canada's preliminary round game versus Germany, Weber hit Yannic Seidenberg in the chin with his elbow, giving the German a concussion and sidelining him {{for the remainder of the}} tournament. After serving his suspension, Weber continued with the tournament, finishing with two points in six games played, including a goal in Canada's 5–1 quarterfinal victory over Switzerland.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Indonesian independence, Suharto served in the Indonesian National Army, primarily in Java. In 1950, as a colonel, he led the Garuda Brigade in suppressing the Makassar Uprising, a rebellion of former colonial soldiers who supported the Dutch-established State of East Indonesia and its federal entity, the United States of Indonesia. During his year in Makassar, Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours, the Habibie family, whose eldest son BJ Habibie was later Suharto's vice-president, {{and went on to}} succeed him as President. In 1951–1952, Suharto led his troops in defeating the Islamic-inspired rebellion of Battalion 426 in the Klaten area of Central Java. Appointed to lead four battalions in early 1953, he organised their participation in battling Darul Islam insurgents in northwestern Central Java and anti-bandit operations in the Mount Merapi area. He also sought to stem leftist sympathies amongst his troops. His <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period left Suharto with a deep distaste for both Islamic and communist radicalism.|$|E

25|$|Junior Seau was an American NFL player, and is {{a typical}} example of an {{individual}} with PTSD. He was born on January 19, 1969 and died on May 2, 2012. Seau was a very beneficial asset to the teams that he played for; throughout his career he played for San Diego Chargers from 1990 to 2002, Miami Dolphins from 2003–2005 and New England Patriots from 2006–2009. He played linebacker for all three teams and had extensive <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> role, despite many injuries throughout his career. After his career at the NFL he developed differences in his personality, due to brain injury; these changes consisted of impaired self-control and regulation, sensitive emotionally and also {{he was not able}} to socialise as he once was able to, which then led to alienation, something which was a strong opposite to his original personality. From there he developed insomnia and committed suicide via a self-inflicted gunshot to his heart.|$|E
25|$|The most {{innovative}} work of Friel's late period is Performances (2003). A graduate researching {{the impact of}} Leoš Janáček's platonic love for Kamila Stosslova on his work playfully and passionately argues with the composer, who appears to host her at his artistic retreat more than 70 years after his death; all the while, the Alba String Quartet's players intrude on the dialogue, warm up, then perform the first two movements of Janáček's Second String Quartet in a tableau that ends the play. The Home Place (2005), focusing on the aging Christopher Gore and the last of Friel's plays set in Ballybeg, was also his final full-scale work. Although Friel had written plays about the Catholic gentry, {{this is his first}} play directly considering the Protestant <b>experience.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> work, he considers the first hints of the waning of Ascendancy authority during the summer of 1878, the year before Charles Stuart Parnell became president of the Land League and initiated the Land Wars. After a sold-out season at the Gate Theatre in Dublin, it transferred to London's West End on 25 May 2005, making its American premiere at the Guthrie Theater in September 2007.|$|E

25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers {{can take}} a long time to heal, {{sometimes}} months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and acetylcysteine.|$|E
25|$|Historically, LDLT {{began with}} {{terminal}} pediatric patients, {{whose parents were}} motivated to risk donating {{a portion of their}} compatible healthy livers to replace their children's failing ones. The first report of successful LDLT was by Dr. Christoph Broelsch at the University of Chicago Medical Center in November 1989, when two-year-old Alyssa Smith received a portion of her mother's liver. Surgeons eventually realized that adult-to-adult LDLT was also possible, and now the practice is common in a few reputable medical institutes. It is considered more technically demanding than even standard, cadaveric donor liver transplantation, and also poses the ethical problems underlying the indication of a major surgical operation (hemihepatectomy or related procedure) on a healthy human being. In various case series, the risk of complications in the donor is around 10%, and very occasionally a second operation is needed. Common problems are biliary fistula, gastric stasis and infections; they are more common after removal of the right lobe of the liver. Death after LDLT has been reported at 0% (Japan), 0.3% (USA) and <1% (Europe), with risks likely to decrease further as surgeons gain more <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> procedure. Since the law was changed to permit altruistic non-directed living organ donations in the UK in 2006, the first altruistic living liver donation took place in Britain in December 2012.|$|E
25|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview with Autosport magazine, Villeneuve's manager Craig Pollock confirmed that Villeneuve's Formula One career was over. It was announced on August 24, 2007 that Villeneuve would run the remaining seven {{races in the}} Craftsman Truck Series driving a Toyota Tundra for Bill Davis Racing and undertake a full-time Sprint Cup Series schedule in 2008. In Villeneuve's first Truck Series race on September 22, 2007, in Las Vegas Motor Speedway, he qualified in seventh position, and finished 21st. He made his NASCAR Nextel Cup race debut in the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama over the weekend of October 5–7, 2007. He qualified sixth, however, due to his lack of <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> type of car, he elected to start the race {{from the back of}} the field and ran there for most of the race. He finished 21st due to a large number of accidents and mechanical failure on the other cars. Villeneuve failed to qualify for the 2008 Daytona 500. He lost his ride in Bill Davis Racing's No. 27 car due to a loss of sponsorship, two days after he caused a pileup in his qualifying race, when his car got loose, then slid back up the track, colliding with another car. He took part in the Nationwide race in Montreal for Braun Racing. The race started off in the sun, but before halfway, it began to rain and the teams were told to pit and use rain-tires, for the first time in NASCAR. Qualifying 5th, Villeneuve finished 16th after crashing into a car during a caution caused by poor visibility due to the rain. The race ended shortly after.|$|E

[...] He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its experience.
