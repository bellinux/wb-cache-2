5|$|I am {{thinking}} this {{morning of the}} men in the mills and factories; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the women who, for a paltry wage, are compelled to work out their lives; of the little children who, in this system, are robbed of their childhood, and in their early, tender years, are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon, and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul....|$|E
500|$|Critical and {{scholarly}} praise has been unanimous in declaring [...] "To Autumn" [...] {{one of the}} most perfect poems in the English language. A.C. Swinburne placed it with [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] as [...] "the nearest to absolute perfection" [...] of Keats's odes; Aileen Ward declared it [...] "Keats's most perfect and untroubled poem"; and Douglas Bush has stated that the poem is [...] "flawless in structure, texture, tone, and rhythm"; Walter Evert, in 1965, stated that [...] "To Autumn" [...] is [...] "the only perfect poem that Keats ever wrote [...] and if this should seem to take from him some measure of credit for his extraordinary enrichment of the English poetic tradition, I would quickly add that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> absolute perfection in whole poems, in which every part is wholly relevant to and consistent in effect with every other part." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2015, Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, {{who served}} in the House {{throughout}} Hastert's tenure as speaker, released a statement reading: [...] "Anyone who knows Denny is shocked and confused by the recent news. The former speaker should be afforded, like any other American, his day in court to address these very serious accusations. This is a very troubling development that we must learn more about, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> his family during this difficult time." [...] On June 4, 2015, Kirk announced that he would donate to charity a $10,000 contribution made to Kirk's 2010 Senate campaign by Hastert's Keep our Mission PAC. Kirk's announcement was made following the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)'s call upon the senator to [...] "return or donate Denny Hastert's money immediately." [...] The DSCC also called upon Republican Senators John Boozman of Arkansas and Roy Blunt of Missouri (who received $11,000 and $5,000, respectively, from Hastert's PAC in recent years) to return or donate the funds.|$|E
6000|$|But you {{stated that}} {{there was much more}} {{interest}} taken in the intellectual developments of the working classes in foreign countries than in England?--Yes; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland or <b>of</b> Zurich. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> France, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the working classes generally, not specially the manufacturing working classes. I used the words [...] "working classes" [...] generally.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{that just}} now. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> those who fled to Brussels this {{afternoon}} {{with the news}} of our victory and of Wellington's defeat." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{said some}} other things, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> my next move.|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, Seel {{received}} official {{recognition as}} a victim of the Holocaust by the International Organization for Migration's program for aiding Nazi victims. In April 2005, President Jacques Chirac, during the [...] "Journée nationale du souvenir des victimes et des héros de la déportation" [...] (the French equivalent to the Holocaust Memorial Day), said: [...] "In Germany, but also on French territory, men and women whose personal lives were set aside, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> homosexuals, were hunted, arrested and deported." [...] On 23 February 2008, the municipality of Toulouse renamed a street in the city in honour of Seel. The name plaque reads [...] "Rue Pierre Seel - Déporté français pour homosexualité - 1923-2005".|$|E
2500|$|Many coon {{songs were}} written by whites, but some {{were written by}} African-Americans. [...] Important black composers of coon songs include Ernest Hogan (who wrote [...] "All Coons Look Alike to Me", the most famous coon song); Sam Lucas (who wrote the most racist early coon songs by modern standards); {{minstrel}} and songwriter Sidney L. Perrin (who wrote [...] "Black Annie," [...] "Dat's De Way to Spell Chicken," [...] "Mamma's Little Pumpkin Colored Coons," [...] "Gib Me Ma 15 cents," [...] and [...] "My Dinah"); Bob Cole (who wrote dozens of songs, including [...] "I Wonder What The Coon's Game Is?" [...] and [...] "No Coons Allowed"); and Bert Williams and George Walker. [...] Even classic ragtime composer Scott Joplin wrote at least one coon song (<b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>Thinking</b> <b>of</b> my Pickaninny Days), and may have composed the music for several more, using lyrics written by others.|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. But excuse me: {{the gentleman}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> not celebrated.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, no, that <b>is</b> to say, <b>I</b> forget: some commonplace {{accomplishment}} {{in the art}} she has, I believe; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{that sort}} <b>of</b> thing; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the lady who taught me this air.' ...|$|R
60|$|I listened, {{without making}} any remark. To tell the truth, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Stella.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes;--but I am not {{thinking}} of myself only. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> myself, and you. In all my thoughts of myself <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> you too.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. COADE. Wasn't there a Lob in Shakespeare? No, {{of course}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Robin Goodfellow.|$|E
60|$|Dearest Mr. Boyd, {{since you}} admit that I am not prejudiced about Ossian, I take courage {{to tell you}} what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of.</b>|$|E
60|$|MISS FOSTER. My dear child, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> no such thing; {{that was}} immoral.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact they don't," [...] she answered, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> years, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> disposition. You have set going the {{greatest}} charitable scheme of the generation, and yet you are so young, so very young." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. [With a weary sigh.] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> all {{the things}} you've been saying to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No dangers," [...] I replied. [...] "Some little difficulty, perhaps. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{the safest}} {{way of putting}} my two letters into Fanny's hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} can be the one I mean," [...] said Lincoln perplexedly. [...] "The man <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> has a niece, Miss Richmond." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please be serious. Joe is an institution; besides, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{offering}} {{myself to}} the Government as a speaker now that we may use gas." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the moment}} when Annerly spoke of the supernatural <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} entirely different. The fact that he should speak {{of it at the}} very instant when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> something else, struck me as at least a very singular coincidence.|$|R
60|$|She. They say {{men have}} a keener sense of humour than women. Now <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the scandal.|$|R
60|$|Madam, when duty calls, Paradine Fouldes {{consents}} even to look ridiculous. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the Bellingham affair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you are as fond of {{adventure}} as I am, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> sending you with an envoy I am despatching to Warsaw.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} forgive any Yankee," [...] she {{retorted}} quickly. [...] "But {{we are not}} talking about him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the South, and of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{taking you}} with me, Mike; and, as {{possibly}} {{you may be}} of use in my search, I will tell you my story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't mean that, my dear girl. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> that. What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> this. Out of your {{compassion}} for me, in this maimed and broken state, you make {{so much of}} me--you think so well of me--you love me so dearly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> entirely what <b>I</b> meant, {{but it is}} a {{particular}} case <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of,</b> rather than a general one. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> your case and mine. I do not say that you might not do something towards adding to the happiness of mankind, but mankind are not yearning for it. On the other hand <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure that you could make me happy, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> yearning for that kind of happiness." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS T. (Still {{looking out}} of the window.) Eh? Oh, I beg your pardon. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} else.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I care for myself?" [...] Amelius asked indignantly. [...] "It's the poor woman <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of.</b> What can I do to clear her character?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are talking}} of bills, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> poor Clive," [...] the Colonel interposes. [...] "I {{wish you could}} give me good news for him, Barnes." ...|$|E

60|$|Wood. No faith, madam, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{the fair}} lady, who, at parting, bespoke so cunningly of me all my essences.|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the spiriting away {{of human}} beings rather than pictures. In {{particular}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the case of my aunt, Crispina Umberleigh.” ...|$|R
