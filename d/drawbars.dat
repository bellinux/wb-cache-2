5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a swell pedal for organ, a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control pedal to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled <b>drawbars</b> for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real <b>drawbars</b> instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>drawbars,</b> many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of <b>drawbars</b> for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the <b>drawbars.</b> The position of the <b>drawbars,</b> combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E

5|$|The {{first model}} in production, in June 1935, was the Model A. It {{contained}} {{most of the}} features {{that came to be}} standard on all console Hammonds, including two 61-key manuals, a 25-key pedalboard, an expression pedal, 12 reverse-color preset keys, two sets of <b>drawbars</b> for each manual, and one for the pedals.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of <b>drawbars.</b> A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{introduced}} {{their first}} integrated circuit (IC) model, the Concorde, in 1971. The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975, {{due to increased}} financial inefficiency, and switched to making IC models full-time. Console models included the 8000 Aurora (1976) and 8000M Aurora (1977), which contained <b>drawbars</b> and a built-in rotating speaker. Spinet organs included the Romance series, manufactured between 1977 and 1983. In 1979, a Japanese offshoot, Nihon Hammond, introduced the X-5, a portable solid-state clone of the B-3.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{experimental}} measurement was determination of relation among weight load of the tractor together, hitch height changes and <b>drawbar</b> characteristic. The measurement was realized on chassis dynamometer at MUAF in Brno. The first step consisted of rated speed characteristics measurement in conformity with OECD demands. The <b>drawbar</b> characteristic was measured under two selected gears. Adding 980 kg to the nominal wight of the tractor brought increasing maximal <b>drawbar</b> power and <b>drawbar</b> force together with decreasing of slip. The highest differences were observed during the mesurement of fifth gear shifted. The <b>drawbar</b> force grew up to 18. 9 % {{as well as the}} maximal <b>drawbar</b> power (15. 2 %). The maximal <b>drawbar</b> power at ninth gear gave 62. 8 kW. The hitch height was setting to 0. 54 m; 0. 64 m and 0. 74 m. When the hitch height was set from 0. 54 m to 0. 74 m the <b>drawbar</b> force an power on front axle was lower by reason of load reduction. As can be noticed from the final <b>drawbar</b> characteristics, both curves are identical up to border of maximal <b>drawbar</b> power. Small differences {{in the area of the}} highest slips can be ascribed to the rolling resistance...|$|R

5|$|The Hammond organ is an {{electric}} organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various {{models have been}} produced, most of which use sliding <b>drawbars</b> to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating {{an electric}} current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so it can drive a speaker cabinet. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.|$|E

The models for the Stage 3 are the Nord Stage 3 88, with 88 Hammer Action keys, the smaller and lighter HP 76, with 76 Hammer Action Portable keys, and the Compact, with 73 semi-weighted waterfall keys and, like the Electro 5D, physical <b>drawbars</b> for the organ section.|$|E
5|$|The Roland VK-7, {{introduced}} in 1997, attempted {{to emulate the}} sound of a Hammond using digital signal processing technology. An updated version, the VK-8, which appeared in 2002, also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie. Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001; this used buttons to emulate the physical action of pulling or pushing a drawbar, with an LED graph indicating its current state. Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then, and introduced the Nord Stage with the same technology. The Nord C2D was Clavia's first organ with real <b>drawbars.</b> Diversi, founded by former Hammond-Suzuki sales rep Tom Tuson in 2003, has specialised in Hammond clones, and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco.|$|E

40|$|This article aims to {{experimentally}} {{determine how}} the tractor’s weight distribution changes during loading by <b>drawbar</b> pull, and how the tractor’s weight affects its <b>drawbar</b> pull properties. Drive wheel ballasting has {{a significant effect on}} the <b>drawbar</b> pull and wheel slip of the tractor - travelling gear losses. To achieve these objectives, we conducted experimental measurements on the tractor Case IH Magnum 370 CVX. The results show that higher <b>drawbar</b> pull is achieved in tractors with a higher weight. The measured increase of <b>drawbar</b> pull was 15, 8 kN between maximal and minimal weight (∆ 2320 kg). All variants show an equal percentage increase in the weight on the rear axle of the tractor (+ 6 %). Increasing the tractor’s weight affected the <b>drawbar</b> pull as well as the wheel slip. As the tractor’s weight increases, there is a smaller increase in wheel slip as the <b>drawbar</b> pull increases. The results confirmed that tractor ballasting is important in order to achieve optimum <b>drawbar</b> pull properties, but it is necessary {{to keep in mind that}} the higher the weight of the machine or equipment, the larger the effect on the soil...|$|R

5|$|Though the {{instrument}} had been originally {{designed for use}} in a church, Hammond realized that the amateur home market was a far more lucrative business, and started manufacturing spinet organs in the late 1940s. Outside of the United States, they were manufactured in greater numbers than the consoles, and hence were more widely used. Several different types of M series instruments were produced between 1948 and 1964; they contained two 44-note manuals with one set of <b>drawbars</b> each, and a 12-note pedalboard. The M model was produced from 1948 to 1951, the M-2 from 1951 to 1955, and the M-3 from 1955 to 1964. The M series was replaced by the M-100 series in 1961, which used a numbering system to identify the body style and finish as used on earlier console series. It included the same manuals as the M, but increased the pedalboard size to 13 notes, stretching a full octave, and included a number of presets.|$|E
25|$|Drawbars: Usually {{found only}} on {{high-end}} keyboards and workstation, this feature allows the performer to emulate digitally-modeled {{sounds of a}} tonewheel electronic organ (hence drawbar).

The setting can be saved to the keyboard's user memory or storage device.|$|E
500|$|The {{labeling}} of the drawbar {{derives from the}} stop system in pipe organs, in which the physical length of the pipe corresponds to the pitch produced. Most Hammonds contain nine <b>drawbars</b> per manual.

500|$|The Nord Stage Organ Section {{provides}} {{physical models}} of three electric organs – the Hammond B3, the Vox Continental, and the Farfisa Compact.

For the Hammond and Vox organ emulations, pressing the [...] "down" [...] button illuminates more LEDs to visually emulate a drawbar being pulled out, while pressing the [...] "up" [...] button does the reverse. Since a real Farfisa organ selects sounds via rocker tabs instead of <b>drawbars,</b> the drawbuttons behave as tabs when the Farfisa emulation is selected on the Stage.

40|$|Abstract — The {{wheels of}} {{planetary}} rovers {{that are used}} in space explorations sometimes slip or lose contact with the ground while traversing a sandy terrain. In order to estimate the behavior of these rovers moving on loose soil, it is very im-portant to accurately estimate the <b>drawbar</b> pull of their wheels. Some wheel-soil interaction models based on terramechanics have been proposed for the estimation of the normal stress distribution and <b>drawbar</b> pull of such rovers. However, our experimental results (normal stress distributions are directly measured using a pressure sensor array, which is attached to the wheels of a rover) show that the distribution range of normal stress for small wheeled rovers obtained using the proposed method is considerably smaller than that obtained by using conventional method. Consequently, the <b>drawbar</b> pull estimated using conventional methods is inaccurate. Therefore, in this study, the normal stress distribution is directly measured using pressure sensors in order to estimate <b>drawbar</b> pull accurately. From the data obtained using the sensors, a soil parameter, which is generally very difficult to measure, is estimated. Then, the <b>drawbar</b> pull is estimated using this parameter. The <b>drawbar</b> pull estimated by using the proposed method is more accurate than that estimated using conventional methods. In this study, we propose a new method for the estimation of <b>drawbar</b> pull and also validate this method. I...|$|R
