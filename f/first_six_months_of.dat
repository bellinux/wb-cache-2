40|$|Abstract—As battery {{capacities}} {{are a key}} {{limiting factor}} of wireless sensor networks, harvesting energy from the environ-ment is very attractive. For outdoor applications, solar power {{seems to be the}} best suited energy source. However, the amount of energy delivered from the sun changes significantly over the year, which makes the dimensioning of the panel difficult. In this paper we discuss the most important impact factors and introduce a model that predicts the harvested solar power and the battery charge over the year. In addition, we present experimental results <b>of</b> the <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> our long term experiments for validating our model. I...|$|R

However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult, and the practice was abandoned after the initial trial period, leaving Lower Bay Station abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Before January 2009, {{inpatient}} discharges {{were done}} through central discharges {{system at the}} ground floor of finance department. Effective January 2010 a new decentralise inpatient discharges system at wad level was implemented. Before the implementation of the new system, data were collected from July 2009 to December 2009 on the total number of feedback form received, number of complaint on hassle of discharge and complaint of long waiting time. After the implementation of the new system, the same data were collected from January to June 2010. The two set of data were compared to see the impact of the new discharge system. Further monitoring was done by collecting data for the <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> 2011 and the <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> 2012. Based on the data collected it was found that for a period of July to December 2009, 295 complaints on hassle of discharges and 46 complaints on long waiting time. For the period from January to June 2010, there was no complaint on the hassle of discharges but 38 complaints on the long waiting time. Further monitoring was done from January to June 2011 and it was found that there was no complaint on the hassle of discharges but complaints on the long waiting time had reduced to 8 cases. For the period from January to June 2012, there was no complaint about the hassle but only 6 cases on the long waiting time.

They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples, Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year.|$|E
5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months.
