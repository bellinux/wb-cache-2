25|$|On July 1, Bohemond's {{force was}} {{surrounded}} outside Dorylaeum by Kilij Arslan. Godfrey and Raymond had {{separated from the}} vanguard at Leuce, and the Turkish army attacked at dawn, taking Bohemond's army (not expecting such a swift attack) entirely by surprise, shooting arrows into the camp. Bohemond's knights had quickly mounted but their sporadic counterattacks were unable to deter the Turks. The Turks were riding into camp, cutting down noncombatants and unarmoured foot soldiers, who were unable to outrun the Turkish horses and were too disoriented and panic-stricken to <b>form</b> <b>lines</b> of battle. To protect the unarmoured foot and noncombatants, Bohemond ordered his knights to dismount and form a defensive line, and with some trouble gathered the foot soldiers and the noncombatants into {{the centre of the}} camp; the women acted as water-carriers throughout the battle. While this formed a battle line and sheltered the more vulnerable men-at-arms and noncombatants, it also gave the Turks free rein to maneuver on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{original}} mural work that covered the walls and ceilings are deteriorated or lost, but reconstructed murals {{have been added to}} parts, especially in the spaces between the nerves of the vaults. These murals contain soft colors which <b>form</b> <b>lines,</b> geometrical shapes and floral shapes reminiscent of ironwork. These probably date to the last third of the 19th century but this is mostly conjecture. The side walls contain faded remnants of narrative scenes, which have not been dated either. One of the best conserved elements inside the church is the 16th century pulpit, made of sandstone sculpted with fine Gothic style designs. In each of the faces of the design, anagrams of the name of Christ or the coat of arms of the Augustinians appear. There is none like it from all of the Mexican colonial period. The original confession booths are built into the wall on the right hand side of the nave, separating the church and the cloister, with the priest entering one side and the confessor entering through the other. They were covered up for much of the church’s history until 1954, when Father Jose Maria Mendez moved the altars on this wall to reveal them. Between them and the baptistery area, there is a large door that leads to the cloister of the former monastery. In colonial times, this door was only opened for Mass on major festivals.|$|E

6000|$|When {{thrown up}} on the sand Wulf {{tried in vain to}} resist the {{backward}} rush of the water; he and Osgod were borne out again. When the next wave again swept them up Wulf saw the earl standing knee-deep in the water, and as he was swept past, Harold seized him and Osgod, and with tremendous strength lifted them right out of the water. [...] "Keep still!" [...] he shouted; [...] "your weight will help me to keep my feet." [...] Wulf felt his supporter quiver as the water rushed out, for he was waist-deep now; but directly afterwards he set them both down on their feet, saying, [...] "Run before the next wave comes."

Harold was with them, and directed those who had got ashore to <b>form</b> <b>lines,</b> taking hold of each other's hands, and so to advance far into the surf and grasp their comrades as they were swept up. Many were saved in this way, although some of the rescuers were badly hurt by floating pieces of wreckage, for the vessel had entirely broken up immediately after her course had been arrested.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the energy transfer efficiency from a Blumlein pulse <b>forming</b> <b>line</b> to a load (resistive load and an ion diode with self-magnetic insulation) and a short-circuit mode. The experiments were carried out with the TEMP- 4 M ion accelerator, which consist of a capacitive storage -Marx generator, a water Blumlein pulse <b>forming</b> <b>line</b> and a diode with self magnetic insulation. We have found that the energy loss is due to current leakage in the Blumline line during its charging. The energy loss observed is due to resistance of water which is used as a dielectric medium in pulse <b>forming</b> <b>line.</b> However, the main source of energy loss occurs in spark gaps and amounts to be 9 - 10 %...|$|R

60|$|The army of Sullivan, now left {{to itself}} before Newport, {{amounted}} to ten thousand men, having received the militia reinforcements. Lafayette advised the delay of hostile operations until {{the return of}} D'Estaing, but the American commander, piqued and chagrined at the departure of his allies, determined to commence the siege immediately without waiting for his tardy aid. On the 12th, however, came on a tempest of wind and rain which raged for two days and nights with unexampled violence. On the 14th the weather cleared up and the sun shone brightly, but the army was worn down and dispirited. The day was passed in drying their clothes, cleaning their arms, and putting themselves in order for action. By the next morning they were again on the alert. Expecting the prompt return of the French, they now took post on Honeyman's Hill, about {{two miles from the}} British lines, and began to construct batteries, <b>form</b> <b>lines</b> of communication, and make regular approaches. The British were equally active in strengthening their defences. There was casual cannonading on each side, but nothing of consequence. Several days elapsed without the re-appearance of the French. The situation of the besiegers was growing critical, when, on the evening of the 19th, they descried the expected fleet standing toward the harbor. All now was exultation in the camp. Should the French with their ships and troops attack the town by sea and land on the one side while the Americans assailed it on the other, the surrender of the place was inevitable.|$|E

50|$|Roll <b>forming</b> <b>lines</b> {{can be set}} up with {{multiple}} configurations to punch and cut off parts in a continuous operation. For cutting a part to length, the lines {{can be set up}} to use a pre-cut die where a single blank runs through the roll mill, or a post-cut die where the profile is cutoff after the roll forming process. Features may be added in a hole, notch, embossment, or shear form by punching in a roll <b>forming</b> <b>line.</b> These part features can be done in a pre-punch application (before roll forming starts), in a mid-line punching application (in the middle of a roll forming line/process) or a post punching application (after roll forming is done). Some roll <b>forming</b> <b>lines</b> incorporate only one of the above punch or cutoff applications, others incorporate {{some or all of the}} applications in one line.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ti and Au foils with a {{thickness}} of 10 µm were formed by indenting {{at a place}} neighboring another indented place sequentially {{by means of a}} hemispherical diamond tool with a radius of 5 µm.

Forming load and pitch were changed in single <b>line</b> <b>forming</b> and <b>forming</b> direction, <b>line</b> pitch and line number were changed in plural <b>line</b> <b>forming,</b> and bending angle was investigated. From the experimental results, bending angle of Ti foil was greater than that of Au one when same working conditions were employed. As the forming pitch increased, bending angle decreased. When the <b>forming</b> <b>line</b> pitch was changed, bending angle had the maximum peak at a pitch of 30 µm by one-way forming path and 25 µm by two-way forming path. Bending angle by one-way forming path was larger than that by two-way forming path.
