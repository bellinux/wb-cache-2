5000|$|Jam Nuts - Two nuts, {{tightened}} on each other. In {{this application}} a <b>thinner</b> <b>nut</b> {{should be placed}} adjacent to the joint, and a thicker nut tightened onto it. The thicker nut applies more force to the joint, first relieving the force on the threads of the <b>thinner</b> <b>nut</b> and then applying a force in the opposite direction. In this way the thicker nut presses tightly {{on the side of}} the threads away from the joint, while the <b>thinner</b> <b>nut</b> presses {{on the side of the}} threads nearest the joint, tightly locking the two nuts against the threads in both directions.|$|R
5000|$|The chuck may be {{held against}} the taper with a {{threaded}} retainer ring (large <b>thin</b> <b>nut),</b> typically wrenched with a spanner wrench of the pin or hook variety. The peak of popularity for building {{this type of}} spindle nose was the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R
50|$|A panel <b>nut</b> is very <b>thin</b> <b>nut</b> with a {{relatively}} large hole commonly used to mount threaded electrical switches.These are often used where light duty precision fasteners are needed. They have width close to {{the diameter of the}} fastener they secure. These usually have low thread count. They are of two types hexagonal panel nut and knurled round panel nut.Applications : Panel nuts are used in potentiometer control, light weight lock nut, switch hardware.Material :Brass, stainless steel, aluminium are the materials commonly used for this nut. Panel Nut Wrench: It is a double ended tube socket type tool for removing nuts.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} {{reported that the}} cookie was an accident, and that Wakefield expected the chocolate chunks to melt making chocolate cookies. In reality, Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, [...] "We had been serving a <b>thin</b> butterscotch <b>nut</b> cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie." ...|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{locking nuts}} exist {{to prevent this}} problem, but {{sometimes}} it is sufficient to add a second nut. For this technique to be reliable, each nut must be tightened to the correct torque. The inner nut is tightened to about a quarter to a half of the torque of the outer nut. It is then {{held in place by}} a wrench while the outer nut is tightened on top using the full torque. This arrangement causes the two nuts to push on each other, creating a tensile stress in the short section of the bolt that lies between them. Even when the main joint is vibrated, the stress between the two nuts remains constant, thus holding the nut threads in constant contact with the bolt threads and preventing self-loosening. When the joint is assembled correctly, the outer nut bears the full tension of the joint. The inner nut functions merely to add a small additional force to the outer nut and {{does not need to be}} as strong, so a <b>thin</b> <b>nut</b> (also called a jam nut) can be used.|$|R

5000|$|Acorns: Annual, singly or in pairs; nut oval, rounded or acute at apex, bright {{chestnut}} brown, shining, one and {{a quarter}} to one and one-half inches in length; cup, cup-shaped or turbinate, usually enclosing one-half or one-third of the <b>nut,</b> <b>thin,</b> light brown and downy within, reddish brown and rough outside, tuberculate near the base. Scales small, much crowded toward the rim sometimes making a fringe. Kernel white, sweetish.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chocolate}} chip cookie {{was invented by}} the American chef Ruth Graves Wakefield and chef Sue Brides in 1938. She invented the recipe during the period when she owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts. In this era, the Toll House Inn was a popular restaurant that featured home cooking. It is often incorrectly reported that she accidentally developed the cookie, and that she expected the chocolate chunks would melt, making chocolate cookies. In fact, she stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, [...] "We had been serving a <b>thin</b> butterscotch <b>nut</b> cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie." ...|$|R
50|$|Two Low Energy Detectors (LEDs) {{were located}} in {{positions}} 180° apart on {{opposite side of the}} <b>hexagon.</b> They had <b>thin</b> ~3 mm thick NaI detectors, also 5 in in diameter, covering the energy range from ~10—200 keV. Their FOV was defined to fan-shaped beams of 1.7° x 20° FWHM by passive, parallel slat-plate collimators. The slats of the two LEDs were inclined to ±30° to the nominal HEAO scanning direction, crossing each other at 60°.Thus, working together, they covered a wide field of view, but could localize celestial sources with a precision determined by their 1.7° narrow fields.|$|R
60|$|The blessings it confers are incalculable. Tear after year, the {{islander}} reposes {{beneath its}} shade, both {{eating and drinking}} of its fruit; he thatches his hut with its boughs, and weaves them into baskets to carry his food; he cools himself with a fan platted from the young leaflets, and shields his head from the sun by a bonnet of the leaves; sometimes he clothes himself with the cloth-like substance which wraps round {{the base of the}} stalks, whose elastic rods, strung with filberts, are used as a taper; the larger <b>nuts,</b> <b>thinned</b> and polished, furnish him with a beautiful goblet: the smaller ones, with bowls for his pipes; the dry husks kindle his fires; their fibres are twisted into fishing-lines and cords for his canoes; he heals his wounds with a balsam compounded from the juice of the nut; and with the oil extracted from its meat embalms the bodies of the dead.|$|R
60|$|It was bitterly cold, and as {{the three}} {{travellers}} stood there, ragged and sore and hungry, they thought they would never weary of gazing at the starry sky and sniffing the keen night air between the trees. But which way should they go? No path ran here, for the Earth-mulgars never let any path grow clear around their mounds. Thumb climbed a little way up a Gelica-tree that stood over them, and soon espied low down in the sky the Bear's bright Seven, which circle about the dim Pole Star. So he quickly slid down again to tell his brothers. It so happened, however, that in this tree grows a small, round, gingerish nut that takes two whole years to ripen, and hangs in thick clusters amid the branches. They have a taste like cinnamon, and with these the Earth-mulgars flavour their meat. And as Thumb slid heavily down, being stiff and sore now, and very heavy, he shook one of these same clusters, and down it came rattling about Nod's head. They have but <b>thin</b> shells, these <b>nuts,</b> and are not heavy, but they tumbled so suddenly, and from such a height, that Nod fell flat, his hands thrown out along the snow. He clambered up, rubbing his head, and in the quietness, while they listened, they heard as it were a distant and continuous throbbing beneath them.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the fatigue}} design {{processes}} {{of a car}} body is stress-based sheet metal fatigue near <b>nuts</b> welded to <b>thin</b> sheets (weld <b>nuts).</b> In this investigation, the influence from nut geometry and dimension, as well as sheet material and thickness on sheet metal fatigue life was studied by fatigue experiments and numerical analyses. The fatigue experiments were force-controlled and carried out on a weld nut specimen which, during the reversed loading that was applied, was designed to result in bending fatigue loading conditions of the sheet metal near the weld nut. The results from the experiments were Fa–N curves for various combinations of nut geometry and dimension, sheet material and thickness. Numerical analyses of the experiments were carried out by linear elastic finite element (FE) analyses, in order to transform the Fa–N curves to Wöhler (sig_a–N) curves. A simplified FE model of the weld nut, which is suitable for structural analysis of car body structures, was used. The structural stresses calculated using the FE model showed good agreement with the structural stresses calculated using an analytical model {{that is based on}} plate theory. The conclusion was that the simplified representation of the weld nut, and the mesh density used in the FE model, was appropriate for computation of the stress response near a weld nut subjected to bending fatigue loading conditions. Finally, ra–N curves were computed for each weld nut configuration using its experimental data set. A sig_a–N curve fitted to all data sets resulted in the relation sig_a = 9888 N^ 0. 312. The sig_a–N curves for the 21 weld nut configurations tested were gathered within a factor of three in fatigue life from this curve...|$|R
60|$|There {{is an old}} man, {{selling the}} meats of butternuts under the stoop of the hotel. He makes that his station during {{a part of the}} season. He was dressed in a dark thin coat, ribbed velvet pantaloons, and a sort of moccasins, or shoes, {{appended}} to the legs of woollen stockings. He had on a straw hat, and his hair was gray, with a long, <b>thin</b> visage. His <b>nuts</b> were contained in a square tin box, having two compartments, one for the nuts, and another for maple sugar, which he sells in small cakes. He had three small tin measures for nuts,--one at one cent, others at two, four, and six cents; and as fast as they were emptied, he filled them again, {{and put them on the}} top of his box. He smoked a pipe, and talked with one man about whether it would be worth while to grow young again, and the duty of being contented with old age; about predestination and freewill and other metaphysics. I asked him what his sales amounted to in the course of a day. He said that butternuts did not sell so well as walnuts, which are not yet in season; that he might to-day have sold fifty cents' worth of walnuts, never less than a dollar's worth, often more; and when he went round with a caravan, he had sold fifteen dollars' worth per day, and once as much as twenty dollars' worth. This promises to be an excellent year for walnuts. Chestnuts have been scarce for two or three years. He had one hundred chestnut-trees on his own land, and last year he offered a man twenty-five cents if he would find him a quart of good chestnuts on them. A bushel of walnuts would cost about ten dollars. He wears a pair of silver-rimmed spectacles.|$|R
60|$|Everything {{comes to}} an end, even a long story. After many weeks had passed slowly by, their sojourn in this village {{came to an end}} too. It was a dull place, very dull, and they had nothing to do; and the few poor people who lived there seemed to have very little or nothing to do. We will, therefore, pass it over, and resume our {{narrative}} at the point when the old trader announced to Barney that the flood was at its height and they would now continue their journey. They embarked once more in their old canoe with their goods and chattels, not forgetting Marmoset and Grampus, whose friendship during their inactive life had become more close than ever. This friendship was evidenced, chiefly, by the matter-of-course way in which Grampus permitted the monkey to mount his back, and ride about the village and through the woods, where dry places could be found, as long as she pleased. Marmoset was fonder of riding than walking, so that Grampus had enough to do; but he did not put himself much about. He trotted, walked, galloped, and lay down, when, and where, and as often as he chose, without any reference to the small monkey; and Marmoset held on through thick and <b>thin,</b> and nibbled <b>nuts</b> or whatever else it picked up, utterly regardless of where it was going to, or the pace at which it went. It was sharp, though, that small monkey, sharp as a needle, and had its little black eyes glancing on all sides; so that when Grampus dashed through under-wood, and the branches threatened to sweep it off, it ducked its head; or, lying flat down, shut its eyes and held on with all its teeth and four hands like a limpet to a rock. Marmoset was not careful as to her attitude on dog-back. She sat with her face to the front or rear, just as her fancy or convenience dictated.|$|R
40|$|Translation begins] Sunday 2030 My Darling, Just {{got back}} from Eglin Field. It was quite {{interesting}} they’ve got alot [sic] of stuff over there. We had a mail call while we were there, an AT- 7 flew down from Craig with a load. I’m sending you a letter we got from your mother. Tell her hello for me, and send her my love, she’s very sweet. I also {{got a letter from}} you written Thursday night. It didn’t sound like you honey, it was very disgusted and very bitter and I’m sorry. But darling it can’t be helped. The Army is running our lives and there’s {{nothing we can do about}} it. Keep that beautiful chin of yours up baby, don’t let it get you down, it’s much harder that way. Darling I’m making this promise to you that every minute, every second that we can be together we will be. We can’t afford to spend a second of our time thinking about the past of the future. What’s important is that we will have that time and we’ve got to pack into it a lifetime of laughs, of wonderful moments, and maybe a few sorrows. And if you think I’m going to live on the post you’re nuts, and if the Army <b>thins</b> so its <b>nuts</b> too. You bet I’m going to live with you darling, the Army or anyone isn’t strong enough to stop me. Honey we really have no right to complain, we’re really very lucky, there are many other couples who haven’t had the happiness that we are going to, and will never be able to. Darling we should thank God that we will have all those wonderful months together. We have had some tough weeks but we can’t be bitter about it. If we let that happen we’ll start blaming each other, and that’s the quickest way of breaking up a marriage. I can’t help what the Army does with me darling, from the job they’re doing over there I guess they know what they’re doing. All fighter pilots have to go through this and I’m glad to be getting it over with. It would be even tougher later wouldn’t it darling? So keep smilin’ baby, and I’ll see you Saturday. Yes, Saturday, I was going to surprise you but I guess you need some cheering up (conceited ain’t I?). If you feel a tenth as bad as I do darling, you sure must. It’s so damned lonesome around here anyway and being separated from you makes it so God damned much worse. Please darling tell me that you’re happy, because when you aren’t, I’m not. Remember honey, the most important thing in the world to me is you. I love you darling, I feel I should make some attempt to tell you how much, but I can’t. It’s as hard to grasp and as large as the infinity of the universe angel, and even Einstein can’t explain that, so how could I ever begin to. All I can tell you is I love you, I love you, again and again, and if I kept on from now ‘til doom’s day, and every “I love you” was materially a part of my love for you, I’d not have enough time darling. The time will pass honey. It will be the longest week of my life, but believe it or not science has proved that time waits for no one. I guess we’ve come the closest to disproving it though. Just think of the time we’ll have together, - it helps. And I will be able to live off the Post darling. It’s not exactly legal but what the Army doesn’t know won’t hurt it. I love you angel, I love you with all my heart. You have all my love all my life, my darling wife, and until Saturday honey, I remain, as always, Your devoted husband Judd P. S. – It’s the moments apart that make the moments together so much more enjoyable. [Translation ends...|$|R
