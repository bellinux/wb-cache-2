40|$|The {{rules of}} <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law of armed {{conflict}} are codified in a rather extensive body of treaty law. In addition, extensive {{research has been conducted}} into the rules of customary <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law. The author of this contribution will argue that there is another important source of positive <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law: principles of <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law. In this chapter, the role of the principles of <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law, the functions they perform and their legal significance as a source of <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law will be assessed. With general public international law as its starting point, the chapter discusses the sources of <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law. It explains the important role of the Martens Clause and provides examples of how the principles of <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law may be applied in contemporary armed conflicts...|$|R

International treaty law only binds States which are party to a particular treaty; customary international law, on the other hand, is, in general, binding on all States. And while some <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law treaties, such as the 1949 Geneva Conventions, are today universally ratified, {{this is not the}} case for all treaties. Here, customary <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law can be used to fill gaps in the protection provided in situations of armed conflict.|$|R

40|$|Disaster Response in Asia and the Pacific: A Guide to International Tools and Services is {{designed}} to help disaster managers in national Governments gain basic knowledge of how to use international tools and services. The guide is not prescriptive. It aims to support the growing disaster response and disaster response preparedness capabilities that exist at national level across Asia and the Pacific. The guide concentrates on key tools and services that can be helpful to disaster managers during the response and response preparedness phases of the disaster programme cycle. It does not include tools and services encompassed by disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts, nor does it cover longer-term disaster recovery instruments. The guide includes some entries relevant to conflict situations. It does not include tools or services that are being developed. The guide has three main sections: [I] <b>International</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> Architecture; [II] Tools and Services for Disaster Response; and [III] Tools and Services for Disaster Response Preparedness. The reverse chronological order of the guide - response before response preparedness - is intentional. It deliberately profiles tools and services for response before those for response preparedness to offer {{a better understanding of the}} utility of certain response preparedness activities and how they support response efforts. It has been produced in response to a call by UN Members States and other humanitarian stakeholders at the 2011 Regional <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>Partnership</b> Workshop for the AsiaPacific Region held in Shanghai, China for a handbook to guide disaster managers in understanding the interaction between national, regional and <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> response mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} role of the EU and its Member States in contributing to furthering the aims of <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law and increasing its implementation and effectiveness through its external promotion of compliance with <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law. Compliance theory is used to analyse the efforts of the EU to increase respect for the law by both third states and non-state actors. The current practice of promotion and enforcement by the EU is evaluated by considering the implementation of the EU Guidelines on Promoting Compliance with <b>International</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> Law. The various channels of influence open to the EU that have the potential to affect compliance with <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law are also investigated. The study explores the role that EU Member States play with regard to enforcement of the law, for example through supporting the exercise of universal jurisdiction, and considers the practice of the EU in promoting mechanisms of accountability. The study considers to what extent EU Member States fulfil their duty to ensure respect for <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law; whether effective and sufficient efforts underway to increase and sustain implementation of the EU guidelines; and what the EU could do as an institution to improve the enforcement of <b>international</b> <b>humanitarian</b> law internally and in its relations with third states.
