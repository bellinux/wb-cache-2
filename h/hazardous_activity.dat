A qualitative method has been conducted based on ten semi-structured interviews, consisting of auditors experienced in auditing industrial companies as well as corporate managers of the largest industrial companies within the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Furthermore, information has also been obtained from annual reports of the companies. This study shows that the auditors` practices, when conducting audits of environmental hazardous companies, do not include a comprehensive investigation of risks arising from environmental <b>hazardous</b> <b>activities.</b> Furthermore, the study shows that big, listed industrial companies have a strong internal control that manages their environmental risks. The companies are aware that they are exposed to risks due to their operations and they are taking adequate actions to control them such as different management systems...|$|R
