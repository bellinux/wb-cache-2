500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "This Love" [...] also {{features}} Levine and his then-girlfriend, model Kelly McKee, {{in a few}} intimate scenes. The video used creative camera angles, thereby avoiding possible FCC action. A version of the video where a stream of computer-generated flowers cover up more was created for more conservative markets. When asked about the video, Levine said: [...] "It was surprisingly not weird and surprisingly not sexual. It was totally comfortable. I didn't get horny or anything, which was weird since I shot <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend." ...|$|E

500|$|During the quarterfinal {{match against}} Brazil, Rapinoe came on as a {{substitute}} and served the precise cross to Abby Wambach's equalizer goal in the 122nd minute of the game: a goal that holds the record for latest goal ever scored in a World Cup match. Rapinoe would later convert her shot during the penalty shootout to help send the United States to the semifinals. Rapinoe described her last minute cross against Brazil: [...] "I just took a touch and friggin' smacked <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> left foot. I don't think I've hit a ball like that with my left foot. I got it to the back post and that beast in the air just got a hold of it." ...|$|E
500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Smith to earn {{recognition}} in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out {{in the top of}} the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E

He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> left.

When Villa was four, his chances of becoming a footballer were put in jeopardy when he suffered a fracture to the femur in his right leg, but he made a complete recovery. Due to the injury, {{he and his father}} worked on strengthening his left leg and Villa ultimately became ambidextrous. He recalls his father being consistently supportive: [...] "He would be there throwing me the ball over and over, making me kick <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> left leg when my right was in plaster after breaking it, I was four. I can barely remember a single training session when my dad wasn't there. I have never been alone on a football pitch." ...|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Who's That Chick?" [...] was {{originally}} intended for inclusion on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud, the song's accompanying daytime video {{was used as}} part of Doritos Late Night Campaign. Jonas Åkerlund directed both daytime and nighttime versions for the song, which featured different colors and styles. The daytime video leaked onto the Internet on September 17, 2010, before it was given an official release. In a press statement given by Rihanna, the singer revealed how she was exited to work with Doritos on the project, saying: [...] "I'm really excited about 'Who's That Chick?' and {{wanted to find a}} fresh and unique way to share <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> fans... When I saw how cool the augmented reality performance Doritos created was, I knew this was it. This was the way I wanted to make 'Who's That Chick?' available to the world, and I can't wait to see how my fans get engaged in this innovative experience." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] {{is about}} being a [...] "tortured soul" [...] in a [...] "volatile" [...] {{relationship}}. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush hinted at Foster to be the bases of the song. The narrator [...] "believes that his bad relationship is karma for his father being a rolling stone." [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] begins with Usher gasping [...] "My sons, Keep them... please forgive me." [...] Unterberger of Popdust concluded that the track gets more intense, as Usher sings in the song’s opening verse: [...] "I think this woman went and put a hex on me / Oh now, why’d I let her go and put that sex on me?". The pre-chorus features Usher yelping in falsetto: [...] "But she didn’t make me pay for <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> money! / OWWWW!!!". According to Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine, [...] "Usher soulfully pays for his father's promiscuous ways over melodic soundcapes".|$|E

And the first books, which I read, were in Russian. I {{was raised in the}} atmosphere of the Russian classical theatre school. The art, built on the system of Stanislavsky – that's the most realistic art. And the modern cinema stands on the same principle. A Russian person wants to find the truth. This is the base of the Russian culture. I never forget it, especially since I have Russian roots". When asked if she still feels Russian, after having left Russia at a young age, Milla replied, [...] "Definitely. I still speak Russian. I speak <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> daughter. I read her Russian stories and poems. My roots are very important — they make me who I am".|$|E

Jason Bovberg of the DVD Talk wrote that the season release is [...] "recommended." [...] He said [...] "Let me state up front that I adore this show.

We laugh uproariously at SpongeBob's adventures and I'm helplessly reduced to a boy about her age as I beam and giggle at the screen." [...] However, Bovberg called the included audio commentaries [...] "downright boring."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] FT Magazines Rosie Millard, Hedren discussed Hitchcock's attitude towards her after {{she decided not to}} work for him again: [...] "He did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely in my view that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E
500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of awe at the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. I can even do <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> left hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe even play us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E

In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
