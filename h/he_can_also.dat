5|$|McLean's favoured {{position}} is {{as a central}} midfielder, but <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> play as a left midfielder. He {{has said that he}} favours playing in the centre because he can get more of the ball and influence play more than when he is on the left. He is a naturally attacking player and when playing in the centre he makes runs to and beyond the striker which adds an extra dimension to his team's play.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{has been}} {{described}} as having all the skills necessary for forward play. His height, , makes him difficult to handle in the air – and he is also a good header of the ball. This means he can be used as an effective target man and his team can hit long balls up to him. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> score from corners and crosses. Samaras is also strong which further adds to his physical presence and makes him harder for defenders to play against.|$|E

Similar to the previous game, Dan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It also depletes completely if he drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game restarts from the last known save point. Dan can refill his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which automatically refill his health if it is depleted. Whilst defeating enemies, Dan's Chalice of Souls will gradually fill up, which can then be collected and traded with Professor Kift to unlock new weapons and items.|$|E
5|$|Hooper has all {{the main}} {{attributes}} to play as a striker, he is strong and can hold up the ball well. He {{is also a good}} finisher, he has been described as being a 'penalty box striker'. However, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> pass the ball well and this allows midfielders to play-off him. He has received praise since moving to Scotland. Newspaper The Daily Record described him as being one of the most skilled attackers in the SPL. They also said that he had shown that he could deal with the physical nature of the Scottish game, due to his ability to ride a challenge well.|$|E

5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise his pace, ball control, technical skills and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a more central position, as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{said that}} he understands Mandarin, though he could use some help {{speaking}} it; <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> read and write a little.

5|$|Red Dead Redemption is {{a western}} action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Players control John Marston, and {{complete}} missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. Outside of missions, players may freely roam the open world. Players interact with the environment and engage in combat with enemies, using various firearms. Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation, each with different attributes. These horses must be tamed {{in order to use}} them. Marston can utilize trains for quick travelling, but <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver. The game's undeveloped land makes up the largest portion of the game world, featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to crowded towns. Besides the American West, the player can also traverse a fictional Mexican state bordering the United States.|$|E

5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Majora's Mask expands on that of Ocarina of Time; it {{retains the}} concept of dungeon puzzles and ocarina songs, and introduces character transformations and a three-day cycle. As in previous installments, Link can perform basic actions such as walking, running and limited jumping, and must use items to battle enemies and solve puzzles. Link's main weapon is the sword, which can be upgraded throughout the game. Other weapons and items are available—Link can block or reflect attacks with a shield, stun enemies by throwing Deku Nuts, attack from a distance with a bow and arrows, and destroy obstacles and damage enemies with bombs. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> latch onto objects or paralyze enemies with the Hookshot. Magic power allows attacks such as magical arrows or spin attacks, {{and the use of}} special items.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E

5000|$|Dembélé {{primarily}} plays as {{a central}} midfielder; <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> however, <b>also</b> operate as an attacking midfielder. He {{has been described as}} a footballer who is [...] "big, powerful, technically gifted" [...] and who has excellent [...] "dribbling and passing abilities." [...] Former Fulham manager Martin Jol said, [...] "Dembélé is probably the best player on the ball I've ever seen." ...|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} less action-oriented {{segments}} in the game, where players have to solve environmental puzzles, which usually {{function as a}} 3D platformer. With time stuttering and collapsing, objects may get trapped in a time loop and either become platforms for players to proceed into the next section of the game, or create dangerous environmental hazards, which are extremely unstable. In the latter case they become obstacles that block the player's path. Jack can overcome them by using his time manipulation powers, such as slowing down or stopping time, {{so that he can}} proceed without getting hurt. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> revive frozen non-playable characters at several specific points of the game.|$|E
5|$|In Deathmatch, {{all players}} compete {{against each other}} and the strongest player wins. Team Deathmatch is similar, but players form two teams. In Capture the Flag, a player must {{retrieve}} the flag from his enemy's base, and bring it to his own team's base. In Sabotage, one team must place a bomb in three different locations, while the opposite team must protect these areas; the protectors win if the time limit is exceeded (except if the time is set to infinite). The bomb is always found {{at the beginning of the}} team base, and the player who holds the bomb must wait 12 seconds until he may drop it and take shelter from the ensuing detonation. In The Hunt, players must shoot ghosts, which become gradually smaller after receiving hits. The player only has one weapon, the hunting gun, with which <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> shoot human opponents. Power Up is a deathmatch game, in which boxes containing special, temporary abilities, such as invisibility and higher speed, are found throughout the map.|$|E
5|$|Talking to a demon has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, responding in a specific way to certain actions. There are four emotional responses that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times will cause the demon to perform an action: an angry demon will attack the party, a frightened demon will flee the battle, a joyful demon will give the player an item, and an interested demon will either leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a special place called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be fused using cards from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|E
