40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} are the upgrade truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> for single unit trucks of type, 1. 2 and 1. 22 which {{are not covered by}} AASHTO. The {{equivalency}} factors for front and rear axles of single unit trucks were developed using AASHO Road Test equation after considering the decrease in front axle load and the increase in rear axle load due to the axle load redistribution on upgrades. The axle loads on upgrades are function of position of center of gravity of the truck, wheel base, upgrade magnitude and truck weight. The truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> are obtained by summing up the equivalency factors of front and the corresponding rear axles. For upgrade truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> the new term H / B representing the ratio of the height of the center of gravity H to the base length of single unit truck is of great importance. The upgrade truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> were developed taking into consideration the following three values for upgrade namely; 0 %, 8 % and 12 %, four values of slab thickness namely; 6, 8, 10 and 12 inches (15. 24, 20. 32, 25. 40 and 30. 48 cm) and two extreme ratios of H / B of 0. 2 and 1. 0. Three values for terminal levels of serviceability of 2, 2. 5 and 3 were considered.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{methods for}} {{assessing}} reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> for several common systems that comprise independent components or subsystems. We consider improving {{the reliability of}} the systems by (a) a reduction method and (b) several duplication methods: (i) hot duplication; (ii) cold duplication with perfect switching; (iii) cold duplication with imperfect switching. Two measures for comparing system improvements are considered in this study, survival reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> and mean reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors.</b> We apply our study to: (1) some simple systems including parallel-series and series-parallel systems, with flexible lifetime distributions including generalized quadratic failure rate and exponentiated Weibull lifetime distributions; (2) networks and complex systems with multiple types of components. We choose the exponentiated Weibull and generalized quadratic failure rate distributions because they are flexible and enable comparisons with other reliability equivalence studies. We use the concept of survival signature to derive the reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> for any coherent system with any structure and with different lifetime distributions. In order to implement this approach, we use the ReliabilityTheory R package to derive survival reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> and mean reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> for networks and complex systems with multiple types of components. Numerical examples for simple and complex systems are presented, to illustrate how to apply the theoretical results and demonstrate the relative benefits of various system improvements. We explain and discuss the results obtained by presenting summary tables and figures, before presenting conclusions and recommendations that arise from this study. In particular, we deduce that considerable advances in reliability equivalence testing are made possible by specifying and analysing the survival signature, especially for the increasingly common context and practice of modelling networks and complex systems...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} modelling the relative effects of seine net biases and for deriving <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> to standardize fish abundance data sets collected using multiple sampling gears. Nearshore fish communities were sampled from 10 sites {{in each of the}} basin and riverine portions of the Swan–Canning Estuary, Western Australia, using beach seine nets of three different lengths (21. 5, 41. 5 and 133 m). The resulting data were subjected to generalized linear modelling to derive <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> relating catches from the two larger net types to those from the 21. 5 m net. <b>Equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> were derived on the basis of functional habitat guilds of fish (small benthic, small pelagic, demersal, pelagic). Prior to standardization, catches from the 41. 5 and 133 m nets consistently underestimated fish densities relative to those from the 21. 5 m net. Following standardization, the degree to which fish densities were underestimated by the two larger nets was reduced and/or eliminated for most guilds, and particularly {{in the case of the}} 133 m net. For both of the larger nets, standardized estimates of total fish density across all species were far closer to those recorded using the 21. 5 m seine, thus indicating that standardization of the fish abundance data had greatly reduced the overall effects of the biases introduced by the different net types. This approach could be applied to other systems and sampling methods, to facilitate more robust comparisons of fish abundances between studies with divergent sampling methodologies...|$|R

With the help of realistic speeding profiles sampled from a plug-in hybrid electric bus running on a fixed commuting line, this paper proposes a convenient and effective approach of determining the <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor</b> for an adaptive Equivalent Consumption Minimum Strategy. Firstly, with the adaptive law based on the feedback of battery SOC, the <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor</b> is described as a combination of the major component and tuning component. In particular, the major part defined as a constant is applied to the inherent consistency of regular speeding profiles, while the second part including a proportional and integral term can slightly tune the <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor</b> to satisfy the disparity of daily running cycles. Moreover, Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle is employed and solved by using the shooting method to capture the co-state dynamics, in which the Secant method is introduced to adjust the initial co-state value. And then the initial co-state value in last shooting is taken as the optimal stable constant of <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor.</b> Finally, altogether ten successive driving profiles are selected with different initial SOC levels to evaluate the proposed method, and the results demonstrate the excellent fuel economy compared with the dynamic programming and PMP method...|$|E
