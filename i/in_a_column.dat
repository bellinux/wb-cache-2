5|$|Since {{there were}} only 40 trained drivers in the Logorište barracks, Boro Ercegovac ordered {{soldiers}} who had never operated military vehicles to drive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column</b> starting from the barracks under fire at 3:30p.m. As the column advanced south towards Malići, elements of the 110th Infantry Brigade retreated {{from the village of}} Zastinja (on the right bank of the Korana River). The evacuating JNA column sustained casualties, although it was supported by the 9th Motorised Brigade and two detachments of the SAO Krajina TO from Vojnić. The SAO Krajina TO were later accused of killing civilians in the area.|$|E

Again the attack failed. Other attacks failed on September 4. A North Korean forward observer captured on Hill 518 said that 1,200 North Koreans were dug in on the hill {{and that they had}} large numbers of mortars and ammunition to hold out.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} {{version of}} the game {{was based on a}} popular online version from GSN's website. In this version, the online player has five minutes to make as many hands of 21 as they can using four columns. The player can play a card in any of their columns as long as the subsequent total is 21 or less; if the card cannot be played in any column, it must be discarded. Playing exactly five cards <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column</b> earns the player a bonus, while the jacks of spades and clubs allow any column to be cleared no matter what.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 2 the US Air Force {{delivered}} a 37-minute strike against Hills 518 and 346. The artillery then laid down its concentrations on the hills, and after that the planes came over again with napalm, leaving the heights on fire. Just after 10:00, and immediately after the final napalm strike, the 1st Battalion, US 7th Cavalry, attacked up Hill 518. The heavy air strikes and the artillery preparations had failed to dislodge the North Koreans. From their positions they fired on the climbing infantry, stopping the weak lead elements of the US force short of the crest. In the afternoon the US battalion withdrew from Hill 518 and attacked northeast against Hill 490, from which other North Korean troops had fired {{in support of the}} North Koreans on Hill 518. The next day at 12:00, the newly arrived 3rd Battalion resumed the attack against Hill 518 from the south, as did the 1st Battalion the day before, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column</b> of companies that resolved itself in the end into a column of squads. Again the attack failed. Other attacks failed on September 4. A North Korean forward observer captured on Hill 518 said that 1,200 North Koreans were dug in on the hill and that they had large numbers of mortars and ammunition to hold out.|$|E

Like that of the larger 1962 Plymouth models, the new Valiant cluster was highly regarded for its clean design and easy readability.

Automatic transmission pushbuttons were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column</b> at the left edge of the panel, and heater pushbuttons were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column</b> at the right edge.

25|$|Furthermore, {{the dynamic}} column method can be used. The {{particles}} are contacted with a solvent {{until they are}} completely soaked. This can be done prior or after packing into the column. The packed bed is then rinsed with the liquid extractant until inlet and outlet concentrations are the same. This approach is particularly interesting when particles are already packed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column</b> and shall be reused for a SIR application.|$|E
25|$|When the Los Angeles Times series appeared, Ceppos again {{wrote to}} defend the {{original}} series. He also defended the series in interviews with all three papers. The extent of the criticism, however, convinced Ceppos that The Mercury News had to acknowledge to its readers that the series had been subjected to strong criticism. He did this <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column</b> that appeared on November 3, defending the series, but also committing the paper to a review of major criticisms.|$|E

25|$|If {{cardinal}} {{numbers are}} written in letters, they should be written as one word up to 2000 (e.g. ezerkilencszázkilencvenkilenc ‘1,999’) {{and they should be}} divided by hyphens by the usual three-digit division over 2000 (e.g. kétezer-egy ‘2,001’). Numbers written in digits can be written without a space up to four digits; above that, they are divided by spaces from the end by the usual three-digit division (e.g. 9999 but 10nbsp&000). If numbers are written under each other <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column,</b> all can be divided by spaces.|$|E
25|$|Void {{volume is}} the amount of space <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column</b> that is {{occupied}} by solvent. It is the space within the column that is outside of the column's internal packing material. Void volume is measured on a chromatogram as the first component peak detected, which is usually the solvent that was present in the sample mixture; ideally the sample solvent flows through the column without interacting with the column, but is still detectable as distinct from the HPLC solvent. The void volume is used as a correction factor.|$|E

25|$|Adsorption {{is present}} in many natural, physical, {{biological}} and chemical systems and is widely used in industrial applications such as heterogeneous catalysts, activated charcoal, capturing and using waste heat to provide cold water for air conditioning and other process requirements (adsorption chillers), synthetic resins, increasing storage capacity of carbide-derived carbons and water purification. Adsorption, ion exchange and chromatography are sorption processes in which certain adsorbates are selectively transferred from the fluid phase {{to the surface of}} insoluble, rigid particles suspended in a vessel or packed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>column.</b> Pharmaceutical industry applications, which use adsorption as a means to prolong neurological exposure to specific drugs or parts thereof, are lesser known.|$|E
