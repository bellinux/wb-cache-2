500|$|In 1954, the 49ers {{compiled}} their Million Dollar Backfield, {{which was}} composed of four future Hall of Famers: Tittle; fullbacks John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry; and halfback Hugh McElhenny. [...] "It made quarterbacking so easy because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> in the huddle and call anything and you have three Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball," [...] Tittle reminisced in 2006. The team had aspirations for a championship run, but injuries, including McElhenny's separated shoulder in the sixth game of the season, ended those hopes and the 49ers {{finished third in the}} Western Division. Tittle starred in his second straight Pro Bowl appearance as he threw two touchdown passes, including one to 49ers teammate Billy Wilson, who was named the game's MVP.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Thompson starred {{alongside}} John Lynch, Geraldine Somerville, Lauren Cook and John Thomson in the Jim Doyle-directed film Re-Inventing Eddie. The {{movie is}} about a man named Eddie (Lynch), who is hounded by social services and branded a paedophile after an innocent bathtime game with his children is taken out of context. About two years later and shortly before entering teenagehood, Thompson successfully auditioned to feature in the BBC children's comedy programme Stupid!. Out of around 400 hopeful youngsters, {{he was one of}} only a few to be selected to appear in the show. Prior to Stupid!s launch on the CBBC channel in 2004, Thompson commented, [...] "When I first started going to auditions I was quite nervous but now <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> on with it. I go to quite a few and it gets easier." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> up there and screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't {{do a lot of}} videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E

500|$|Ville Valo is {{the main}} {{songwriter}} of HIM and his songs largely deal with themes of love. When talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: [...] "I didn't know {{how to cope with}} the world. Then I found an instrument, and through that I realized, that I am able to cope with the world and its evils, a bit better, through writing songs." [...] In terms of lyrical content, Valo has stated that [...] "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than touches me." [...] Valo also takes inspiration from literature, explaining that [...] "as a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive." [...] Valo and the rest of HIM have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative. Valo has described the music of HIM as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music".|$|E
500|$|For three seasons, {{the backfield}} {{challenged}} opposing defenses with Tittle's arm, Johnson's power, {{the speed of}} Perry, and the elusiveness of McElhenny. [...] "There was no greater running backs than Hugh McElhenny, John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry in the same backfield," [...] Tittle reminisced. [...] "It made quarterbacking so easy because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> in the huddle and call anything and you have three Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball." [...] They achieved their greatest success during their first year together, in 1954, in which they shattered the team record for rushing yards in a season. The 49ers led the league with 2,498 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns, and averaged 5.7 yards per carry and 208.2 rushing yards per game. Perry, McElhenny, and Johnson each finished the season in the top ten in rushing yards, with Perry and Johnson finishing first and second, respectively. McElhenny ranked eighth despite playing in only six games before being sidelined by a season-ending shoulder injury. Tittle, Perry, Johnson, and Detroit Lions halfback Doak Walker comprised the starting backfield in the 1955 Pro Bowl, and Perry was deemed the NFL's Player of the Year by the United Press. With the highly potent offense, many thought San Francisco was due to win a NFL championship, but defensive problems landed the 49ers in third place behind the Lions and Bears in 1954. Moreover, the offense struggled after McElhenny's injury.|$|E
2500|$|Hendrix's vocal for [...] "Stone Free" [...] {{has been}} {{compared}} to that for [...] "Hey Joe". [...] Biographer Keith Shadwick describes it as [...] "an almost conversational delivery... toying with blues intervals in a way that John Lee Hooker would build a blues phrase rather than delivering any defined melodic pattern." [...] The lyrics reflect Hendrix's lifestyle, as he explained in an interview: [...] "I stay one or two months in a place and then I must have a change... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> so restless, man—I might leave right away": ...|$|E
