25|$|In 2010, Buffett {{claimed that}} {{purchasing}} Berkshire Hathaway {{was the biggest}} investment mistake he had ever made, and claimed that it had denied him compounded investment returns of about $200billion over the subsequent 45 years. Buffett claimed that had he invested that money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), those investments would <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off</b> several hundredfold.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo's miscue {{on their}} final drive was {{particularly}} noteworthy {{in that it}} came after they had called a timeout, making a subsequent delay of game penalty highly unusual. One cited reason for {{this was the last}} second substitution of receivers Piccone and Ron Jessie into the huddle. Bills coach Chuck Knox later explained this was an attempt to prevent the defense from adjusting to new personnel, an attempt that would <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off</b> if the ball had been snapped on time, as Piccone did make a first down catch on the ensuing play.|$|E

25|$|Abrahams {{is badly}} beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last {{chance for a}} medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is {{overcome}} that the years of dedication and training <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off</b> with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams {{can get on with}} his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, Jackson Scholz, hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the polls, the UMP lost ground, but it {{maintained}} a workable majority. The Socialists unexpectedly gained seats. Their plea to voters {{to prevent an}} overwhelming UMP dominance of the legislature appears to <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off,</b> providing the Socialists {{with a measure of}} redemption from the election loss. UDF splinter groups, François Bayrou's MoDem and the New Centre, contested their first elections. MoDem won 4 seats (including Mayotte regionalist Abdoulatifou Aly), while the New Centre was able to form a parliamentary group, with 22 seats. It {{remains to be seen whether}} Bayrou's party, which polled the third highest vote (7.61% in round one), will develop into a major political force. Their result is an improvement on the UDF's result of 4.9% in 2002. The National Front (FN) polled its lowest vote since its splash onto the political scene in 1986. The FN lost more than 60% of its support base since 2002. Support for the Communist Party also declined, and they saw a loss of several seats, whilst several other left-wing parties won nine new seats. The Greens gained one new seat, despite a fall in their vote. One of the most stunning results was the surprise defeat of UMP party leader Alain Juppé by the Socialist Party candidate Michèle Delaunay. Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres was defeated as well losing to Socialist Party candidate Jean-Patrick Gille. The far right did not win any seats.|$|E

500|$|That same month, {{refinancing}} of {{the building}} was called into question. In the U.S., it is common business practice for the initial lender to provide an interim loan (the [...] "construction loan") to build a building. The interim loan is then paid off by a second lender, who becomes the mortgage lender and receives payments from the building's owner. Riggs Bank, a local D.C. bank, had provided the interim construction loan to Nassif. The New York City Employees Retirement System was to <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off</b> this construction loan. That payment was halted when the loan officer Nassif had dealt with was indicted for taking bribes to approve loans. When the pension fund refused to provide the loan, Riggs Bank sued for payment and threatened to foreclose on the Nassif Building.|$|E
500|$|Chris Schilling of [...] The Daily Telegraph {{described}} it as [...] "one of the most innovative and enjoyable survival horrors for many a year." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed wrote, [...] "Packed with inventive ideas and one engaging sequence after another, it's a spirited, poignant and unsettling game that not only delivers a long-overdue return to form, but reinvigorates horror adventures in the process." [...] According to Lark Anderson of GameSpot, [...] "Shattered Memories is a fantastic return to the core concept of personal fear, and though its developers made some unorthodox decisions—such as removing combat entirely—those decisions <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off</b> handsomely." [...] Nintendo Power called it audacious and compelling. In a retrospective feature, Nintendo World Report's Jonathan Metts generally agreed with Gamespot, stating that the installment [...] "is a noble and arguably successful attempt to revive and reform the survival horror genre. While perhaps not scary, it is genuinely disturbing, shocking, and always interesting." [...] According to Leigh Alexander of The A.V. Club, the innovation and uniqueness of the installment made it capable of standing alone from the Silent Hill series, without having to use the series' reputation or name to attract players. Conversely, Game Informers Tim Turi considered the frustrating controls and dull pacing to be major flaws, and wrote, [...] "If you’re a Silent Hill fan interested in a fresh take on the stale formula, this Wii entry may be the Cheryl you’ve been searching for—but it comes at a cost." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the {{new century}} dawned, Sydney {{implemented}} a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of Paul Williams, Barry Hall, Craig Bolton, Darren Jolly, Ted Richards, Peter Everitt, Martin Mattner, Rhyce Shaw, Shane Mumford, Ben McGlynn and Mitch Morton, amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of Daniel Motlop, Nick Dal Santo, James Kelly, Courtenay Dempsey and Sam Lonergan who went to , , [...] and the latter two to [...] respectively.

2500|$|In 1999, Ontario Hydro {{was broken}} up and its {{generation}} facilities re-formed into Ontario Power Generation (OPG). In {{order to make}} the successor companies more attractive for private investors, $19.4 billion in [...] "stranded debt" [...] was placed in the control of the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation. This debt is slowly paid down through a variety of sources, including a 0.7-cent/kWh tariff on all power, all income taxes paid by all operating companies, and all dividends paid by the OPG and Hydro One. Even with these sources of income, the amount of debt has grown on several occasions, and in 2010 stood at almost $15 billion. This is in spite of total payments on the order of $19 billion, ostensibly enough to <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off</b> the debt entirely if interest repayment requirements are ignored.|$|E

Bryant also stated that O'Neal would pay women up to US$1 million to stay quiet about their rendezvous.

2500|$|It {{was through}} happenstance that Andersson {{discovered}} first Pavel Datsyuk and then Henrik Zetterberg. In 1997 {{he went to}} Moscow to scout Dmitri Kalinin, noticed Datsyuk playing for the other team, and decided he needed {{to see more of}} Datsyuk. He made the trip a second time and would have come again, but the flight he and a scout from the St. Louis Blues were on was cancelled due to a storm. The Wings drafted Datsyuk 171st overall in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft and Andersson believes he was the only NHL scout to have seen Datsyuk play prior to the draft. The next year Andersson travelled with Jim Nill to a tournament in Finland to scout Mattias Weinhandl. Nill was distracted, however, by [...] "this little Zetterberg guy who always seemed to have the puck." [...] Andersson and Nill came away with a very high opinion of Zetterberg, whom they drafted 210th overall in the 1999 draft, and he has matured into a superstar in the NHL. Their decisions to go with Zetterberg and Datsyuk <b>have</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off</b> handsomely. The two star centers were named as finalists for the Frank J. Selke Trophy in 2008, with Datsyuk winning the award, while Zetterberg set a new franchise record for most points in a post-season (27) and won the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the 2008 playoffs. In 2009 Datsyuk was named as a finalist for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, having already won the award three consecutive times, and was again named a finalist for the Selke, both of which he was eventually awarded. He was also a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award.|$|E
