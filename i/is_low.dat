5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people <b>is</b> <b>low,</b> although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities <b>is</b> <b>low.</b> Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

30|$|From Table 1, {{some simple}} inferences can be made.

Whereas for such applications, E 2 EDelay and Jitter should <b>be</b> <b>low,</b> meaning that these parameters should have low values for better user perceived quality. For streaming kind of applications (including live streaming) Jitter should <b>be</b> <b>low,</b> Bandwidth should <b>be</b> high, and E 2 EDelay may <b>be</b> <b>low</b> to medium, but should not be high.

5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and <b>is</b> <b>low</b> in fiber.

Support and conflict in one relationship context were hypothesized to moderate the effects of experiences in the other relationship context. Adolescent-reported antisocial behavior <b>was</b> <b>low</b> when either parent-child relationships or friendships <b>were</b> <b>low</b> in conflict, and adolescent-reported depressed mood <b>was</b> <b>low</b> when either friendship conflict <b>was</b> <b>low</b> or parental support was high. Parent-reported antisocial behavior was high when high levels of conflict were reported in either parent-child or friendship relationships and adolescent-reported depressed mood was high when either parental or friendship support <b>was</b> <b>low.</b> Associations appear to be similar {{for boys and girls}} as no interactions involving gender were significant...|$|R

40|$|Both dietary {{iron and}} copper were {{inversely}} related to lead absorption as indicated by erythrocyte and kidney lead levels, dietary iron having the greatest effect. Kidney copper values were depressed when dietary iron <b>was</b> <b>low,</b> a condition which was worsened by lead. Lead tended to lower heart cytochrome c oxidase especially when dietary copper <b>was</b> <b>low,</b> but also when dietary copper and zinc were high. Lead interfered with hematopoiesis when dietary copper and/or iron <b>were</b> <b>low,</b> the effect being especially severe when both essential nutrients <b>were</b> <b>low.</b> These results show the importance of copper and iron nutriture and metabolism as factors which reduce lead toxicity, and emphasize the necessity of considering nutritional status in evaluating lead toxicity...|$|R

5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} three months in those with proximal DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk <b>is</b> <b>low</b> to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients {{should have at least}} three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk <b>is</b> <b>low,</b> suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested {{for three months}} of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E
