50|$|Sleeve {{couplings}} {{are also}} known as Box Couplings. In this case shaft ends are coupled together and abutted against each other which are enveloped by muff or sleeve. A gib head <b>sunk</b> <b>keys</b> hold the two shafts and sleeve together.in other words,this is the simplest type of the coupling. It is made from the cast iron and very simple to design and manufacture. It consists of a hollow pipe whose inner diameter is same as diameter of the shafts.The hollow pipe is fitted over a two or more ends of the shafts {{with the help of}} the <b>taper</b> <b>sunk</b> <b>key.</b> A key and sleeve are useful to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft.|$|R

5|$|One {{beneficial}} effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling {{of the former}} USS Spiegel Grove. Spiegel Grove was <b>sunk</b> in Florida <b>Keys</b> National Marine Sanctuary {{in an attempt to}} create an artificial reef. However, the ship turned over and landed on the bottom upside down. Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|R

40|$|Fish {{colonization}} on the Ebenezer II, a 25. 5 m {{merchant marine}} vessel, was studied from May 2002 - July 2003. The ship was scuttled in May 2002 off Broward County, Florida {{at a depth}} of 21 m and was censused 10 times during the study period using a modified Bohnsack and Bannerot visual census method. Adjacent natural reefs and the Mcallister, a nearby, 30 m tugboat deployed in June 1998, were censused during the same period. Distinct changes in the fish assemblage on the Ebenezer II were observed throughout the sample period. A pioneer assemblage was observed during the first three months, characterized by the settlement of juvenile fishes Â« 5 cm). Subsequently, numbers of juveniles decreased either through emigration, predation or growth. Resident species made up 52. 5 % of the total abundance but transient fish species made up 78 % of the total fish biomass during the study period. Surprisingly, attraction of adult fish from both natural reefs and the Mcallister was not a major factor in assemblage fonnation. The primary adult fishes attracted to the Ebenezer II were herbivores. These fishes steadily increased in abundance throughout the study period, presumably due to increased food availability as benthic algal communities developed. A similar trend of increasing herbivores with increasing soak time was observed on the Spiegel Grove, a 153 m vessel-reef <b>sunk</b> off <b>Key</b> Largo in May 2002. The fish assemblages on the artificial reefs were more similar to each other than to natural reefs. Vessel-reefs had sixty species in common, while the Ebenezer II only had thirty-nine species in common with natural reefs. Several species common to vessel-reefs were absent or rare on nearby natural reefs. This may indicate that vessel-reefs are providing early juvenile and adult habitat that is not available on natural reefs...|$|R
40|$|Data set for {{the paper}} {{entitled}} "Learning and forgetting in the jet fighter aircraft industry". Data set includes flayaway cost and number of procurement units for three types of aircraft: F- 22 A Raptor, F- 35 A Lighnight II, and A/F- 18 -E/F Super Hornet. Data set also includes military procurements deflator. Annual data. Samples periods: 2000 - 2009 for the Raptor, 2007 - 2015 for the Lighnight II, and 1997 - 2013 for the Super Hornet. Data set includes all information for estimating learning curves and forgotting as presented in the corresponding paper. Data set also includes procument units and flyaway cost for the EA- 18 G Glowler, which it is a posterior modification of the Super Hornet for electronic warfare. These data {{are not included in}} the research paper, but they can be used to check that flyaway cost is constant as production accumulated, and no learning-by-doing process is observed for this particular aircraft (as all learning was acquired during the previous production of the Super Hornet). Abstract: A recent strategy carried out by the aircraft industry to reduce the total cost of new generation fighter has consisted {{in the development of a}} single airframe with different technical and operational specifications. This strategy has been designed to reduce costs in the Research, Design, and Development phase with the aim of reducing the final unitary price of aircraft. This is the case of the F- 35 Lightning II, where three versions, with significant differences among them, are produced simultaneously based on a single airframe. Whereas this strategy seems to be useful to cut down pre-production <b>sunk</b> costs, remains <b>key</b> to study their effects on production costs. This paper shows that this strategy can imply larger costs in the production phase by reducing learning acquisition and hence, the total effect on the final unitary price of the aircraft is indeterminate. Learning curves are estimated based on the flyaway cost for the latest three fighter aircraft models: The A/F- 18 E/F Super Hornet, F- 22 A Raptor, and the F- 35 A Lightning II. We find that learning rates for the F- 35 A are significantly lower (an estimated learning rate around 9 %) than for the other two models (around 14 %) ...|$|R
