A theoretical concept called “localized creative destruction” is tested as a mechanism to explain the dynamics impacting the spatial distribution of manufacturing <b>establishment</b> <b>birth</b> and death <b>rates.</b> While no support of this process was found, results identify a convergence process occurring where counties with high initial birth/death rates have smaller changes in firm <b>birth</b> and death <b>rates.</b> The interpretation is that counties become more equally competitive in terms of firm formation dynamics in lieu of successful counties increasing their lead in the short run. This is potentially relevant to policymakers and economic development practitioners who are concerned with business retention and the impact of new manufacturing establishments on their existing base. location determinants, manufacturing, adjustment models, Community/Rural/Urban Development, L 60, R 11, R 12,...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to determine the importance of location factors influencing the spatial distribution of capital formation in U. S. manufacturing. The uneven distribution of manufacturing activity across space suggests that geographical location matters. In addition, factors influencing the spatial distribution of capital formation change over time in response to changes in technology, consumer preferences and globalization. The relative importance of location factors is empirically assessed utilizing different measures for capital stock, monetary as well as establishment counts. ^ The first essay evaluates the long-run steady state of growth factors hypothesized to influence the spatial distribution of U. S. manufacturing investment. Spatial spillovers at the state level are found to be of a competitive nature, implying that a factor that attracts more investment to a particular state is associated with lower investments in neighboring states. Investment generally flows to states with higher market demand, more productive labor, and more localized agglomeration of manufacturing activity. ^ The second essay considers location choice in the American manufacturing industry. Counts of manufacturing <b>establishment</b> <b>births</b> at the county level are used to test a conceptual model of location factors hypothesized to impact location decisions. A new spatial econometric method consistent with existing spatial autoregressive models is developed in order to model spatial dependence in <b>establishment</b> <b>births.</b> Results demonstrate the ability of the spatial lag count model to capture spatially heterogeneous trade-offs between firms achieving internal economies of scale and sharing in localized agglomeration economies. ^ The third essay addresses changes in capital formation by evaluating the importance of location factors on the <b>rate</b> of <b>establishment</b> <b>birth</b> and death in U. S. manufacturing at the county level. This essay extends previous research that has only considered factors important for attracting new manufacturing investment. The theoretical concept of “localized creative destruction” is used as a mechanism to explain the dynamics impacting the spatial distribution of manufacturing <b>establishment</b> <b>birth</b> and death <b>rates.</b> The analysis reveals differing impacts on <b>establishment</b> <b>birth</b> and death <b>rates</b> in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. ^ The empirical results across the three essays show that access to product markets, agglomeration economies, skilled labor, and transportation infrastructure remain important location factors in the process of capital formation in U. S. manufacturing. ...|$|R

From the Tax Foundation ranking California 48 out of 50 states for its unfriendly business taxes, to the Wall Street Journal publishing op-eds describing how California drives away jobs and businesses, an outside (and often inside) observer might think the current state of business in California is rather grim. In reality, California is not anywhere {{near the bottom of the}} pack in terms of the state's ability to foster new business formation. While it is true the rate of new business creation has slowed over the past several decades, so too has the rate of business destruction. This report details the data on: Where California ranks among other states in terms of new business growth and small business growth Whether the secular decline in new business creation is unique to California, or whether it is happening nationwide How California business creation has compared to select states and the nation as a whole over the last twenty years Main findings include: Both job creation and job destruction have been falling in California over the years. As a result, the long term pace of net job creation has remained relatively constant. California job creation and destruction has mirrored that of the broader economy. Not only has a similar trend occurred in the United States, but every other state has experienced a similar trend [...] without exception. Despite a high correlation with national trends, since 1976 <b>establishment</b> <b>birth</b> <b>rates</b> have actually been higher in California than in the United States overall in absolute terms.

40|$|The Appalachian Region {{has long}} {{suffered}} from poor economic performance as measured over {{a variety of}} dimensions. Even as the region has improved {{over the last few}} decades, Appalachia still lags behind the nation. A growing body of empirical work has found that reallocation is pervasive in the U. S. economy and is an integral component of economic growth. Productivity growth is improved when resources are shifted from less productive establishments towards more productive establishments either through changes in existing establishments or through the births and deaths of establishments. Establishments that use new products, technologies, and production processes replace establishments that do not in a continual process of creative destruction. Using establishment-level data, this paper examines the reallocation and productivity dynamics of the Appalachian Region. The first part of the paper compares the reallocation dynamics of Appalachia {{to the rest of the}} U. S. using a newly developed establishment-level database that covers virtually the entire U.

From this analysis, it is apparent that <b>establishment</b> <b>birth</b> and death <b>rates</b> and job creation and destruction rates for Appalachia are consistently below those for the rest of the U. S [...] The second part of the paper uses data from the Economic Censuses to determine whether the establishment and employment dynamics of the Appalachian Region are also qualitatively different (in terms of their productivity rankings) from their U. S. counterparts. It appears that the North subregion of Appalachia has reallocation and productivity dynamics that are consistent with an impeded creative destruction story. ...|$|R
