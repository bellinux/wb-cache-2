500|$|Xhinovci {{is unable}} to return to Germany because of his appearance, as the country has a series of laws which {{prohibit}} Nazi symbols, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs, and says {{that he would have}} to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the Serb-held section of Mitrovica. Xhinovci says that he is greatly disappointed with post-war Kosovo, as he believed that reconciliation between Albanians and Serbs would have occurred after the conflict. When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler, Xhinovci responded: [...] "It is easy. I <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> Hitler's character because he fought against my enemy. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies."

2500|$|Adams {{described}} himself as a [...] "radical atheist", adding [...] "radical" [...] for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told American Atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it.

This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.|$|E

[...] However, Keynes did not think Hayek's philosophy was of practical use; this was explained later in the same letter, commenting: [...] "What we need therefore, in my opinion, is not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion {{with the results of}} your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of them. Your greatest danger ahead is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States." ...|$|E

In 1987, his book When You Don’t Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide to Counseling and Therapy was published and subsequently adopted by the Psychology Today Book Club and the Psychotherapy Book Club. The book presents a self-diagnosing algorithm to help readers identify, based on effectiveness studies, potentially most promising forms of therapeutic care. The algorithm takes into account individual symptoms, circumstances, personality, and life goals. The book {{was followed by the}} publication of the author's summary appraisal of the effectiveness of psychotherapy, about which psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, a long-time critic of psychiatry, commented: [...] "It is one of the best, if not the best, that I have read on this subject."

She canvassed door-to-door for her 1972 legislative race while pregnant with her third child, William. In 1985, {{when looking at the}} trendline that showed that half of all pre-school children had mothers in the workforce, she assured Reagan that once the economy picked up [...] "all those women can go home and look after their own children". [...] As a long-time working mother herself, Whittlesey asserted this statement was taken out of context and did not reflect her intent of actively expanding choices, professional and personal, for women. The statement continued, [...] "They could care for their children themselves if they wished to do so because their husbands would have opportunities again in a thriving economy." [...] She emphasized Reagan's pledge to create more jobs for working people. Whittlesey was the only woman on Reagan's Senior White House Staff during her service there. According to David Broder, [...] "Whittlesey asserted in 1980 her position on women's rights and her fight as a woman to be effective politically, 'I sympathize with some of the goals of the women's movement, but they choose not to associate with me, so that's where we are.

2500|$|Sima {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by Confucius’s Spring and Autumn Annals, which on the surface is a succinct chronology from {{the events of the}} reigns of the twelve dukes of Lu from 722 to 484 BC. Many Chinese scholars have and still do view how Confucius ordered his chronology as the ideal example of how history should be written, especially with regards to what he chose to include and to exclude; and his choice of words as indicating moral judgements [...] Seen in this light, the Spring and Autumn Annals are a moral guide to the proper way of living. Sima took this view himself as he explained: It [...] distinguishes what is suspicious and doubtful, clarifies right and wrong, and settles points which are uncertain. It calls good good and bad bad, honours the worthy, and condemns the unworthy. It preserves states which are lost and restores the perishing family. It brings to light what was neglected and restores what was abandoned. [...] Sima saw the Shiji as being in the same tradition as he explained in his introduction to chapter 61 of the Shiji where he wrote: “Some people say 'It is Heaven’s way, without distinction of persons, to keep the good perpetually supplied. ' Can we say then that Po I and Shu Ch'I were good men or not? They clung to righteousness and were pure in their deeds…yet they starved to death…Robber Chih day after day killed innocent men, making mincemeat of their flesh…But in the end he lived to a great old age. For what virtue did he deserve this? …I <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> much perplexity. Is this so-called [...] 'Way of Heaven' right or wrong?” To resolve this theodical problem, Sima argued that while the wicked may succeed and the good may suffer in their own life-times, it is the historian who ensures that in the end good triumphs. For Sima, the writing of history was no mere antiquarian pursuit, but was rather a vital moral task as the historian would “preserve memory”, and thereby ensure the ultimate victory of good over evil. [...] Along these lines, Sima wrote: “Su Ch’in and his two brothers all achieved fame among the feudal lords as itinerant strategists. Their policies laid great stress upon stratagems and shifts of power. But because Su Ch’in died a traitor’s death, the world has united in scoffing at him and has been loath to study his policies…Su Ch’in arouse from the humblest beginnings to lead the Six States in the Vertical Alliance, and this is evidence that he possessed an intelligence surpassing the ordinary person. For this reason I have set forth this account of his deeds, arranging them in proper chronological order, so that he may not forever suffer from an evil reputation and be known for nothing else”. Such a moralizing approach to history with the historian high-guiding the good and evil to provide lessons for the present could be dangerous for the historian as it could bring down the wrath of the state onto to the historian as happened to Sima himself. As such, the historian had to tread carefully and often expressed his judgements in a circuitous way designed to fool the censor.|$|E
