50|$|Concrete can be colored in many ways; color hardener, {{integral}} liquid or powder, acid stains {{to name a}} few. The {{process of}} integrally coloring the concrete offers {{the advantage of the}} entire volume being colored; however, the surface strength is not increased as with the use of color hardener. <b>Dry</b> <b>shake</b> color hardener is another popular way to color concrete. You broadcast the hardener on the concrete as soon as it is floated for the first time. After letting the bleed water soak into the hardener you float and trowel it in. This method only covers the surface about 3/16 of an inch but it gives the concrete surface a longer wear life.|$|E

In this paper, the results of laboratory testing are contextualised by the project-story that steered the research programme. This is an example of a collaborative endeavour to implement a novel low-carbon construction technology in the field. Evolution of the design in parallel with laboratory testing resulted in the development and specification of a polished lime-pozzolan concrete floor incorporating site-won oolitic limestone aggregate. To the disappointment of the client and the design team, this innovative solution was abandoned at the point the contractor was appointed and changed to a proprietary polished metallic <b>dry</b> <b>shake</b> floor system.

40|$|The {{resistance}} of concrete surfaces to {{various types of}} wear can be a defining performance characteristic in certain applications. Some concrete structures are required to be abrasion-resistant; among them are dams, canals, roads, floors, footpaths, parking lots, and paths in parks. The work reported in this paper {{is based on a}} laboratory study of the concrete-surface treatments (CSTs) consisting of <b>dry</b> <b>shake</b> and screeding. Four control concrete mixtures were prepared with ordinary Portland cement (OPC), having a cement content (CC) of 350 kg/m 3 at water-cementitious ratio (w/cc) = 0. 70, 0. 75; and 280 kg/m 3 CC of w/cc = 0. 80, 0. 85. Other concrete mixtures were then prepared by substituting OPC in the control mixtures with 10, 20, 30, and 40 % local raw clay. Compressive strength, abrasion resistance, and air permeability of the surface-treated concretes were measured at the ages of six months, while drying shrinkage was monitored for up to year. Drying shrinkage of concrete reduced with decrease in w/cc ratio and increased with increase in raw clay content. Among all the mixtures, the control concrete of w/cm ratio = 0. 70 and the claycement concrete containing w/cm= 0. 80 at 70 % OPC/ 30 % raw clay showed the least and highest shrinkage increments respectively. Abrasion {{resistance of}} concrete, measured by the rotating-cutter method, increased with increasing clay content and decreasing compressive strength. However, abrasion performance results of clay-cement concrete mixtures with CSTs were generally higher.

50|$|Dermatitis {{may also}} occur from {{handling}} the hellebore plants without protection. This is typically {{caused by the}} ranunculin and protoanemonin found {{on the outside of}} the plant, including areas such as the leaves, stem, flower, and sap.

When collecting seeds from hellebore plants it is recommended to wait for the pods to <b>dry</b> and <b>shake</b> them out into a container or onto the ground to collect. Attempts to remove the seeds by hand will expose skin to the potent toxins in the sap of the hellebore, which can increase the damage done to the skin.

If the burning persists or intensifies, it is recommended to wash the affected areas thoroughly to remove the toxins and see a doctor.|$|R

40|$|Until now, {{there is}} no method {{can be used to}} {{accurately}} assess the particles size distribution as well as textural classes of gypsiferous soils for proper interpretation of physical behavior of these soils, and most laboratory methods involve pretreatment to remove gypsum from the samples. Therefore, the results of the particle size distribution do not reflect the size distribution of the whole soil. This study aimed to develop an alternative method to determine particle size distribution for some gypsiferous soils selected from Al-Ahsa governorate, Saudi Arabia. Five samples from different profiles with different gypsum content were selected to evaluate the modified method. Sand fractions were separated with three disaggregation methods: 1) <b>drying</b> sieving, 2) <b>shaking</b> for 5 hours in a 7 : 3 ethanol: water solution, and 3) sonication for 3 minutes in a 7 : 3 ethanol: water solution. The statistical analysis results revealed that the sonication for 3 minutes in a 7 : 3 ethanol: water solution was the most effective method for separating sand fractions as compared to <b>dry</b> sieving and <b>shaking.</b> Meanwhile, there was slight difference in separating sand fractions between sonication for 3 minutes and shaking for 5 hours. The particle size distribution by the developed method showed increasing in total sand content as compared to standard particle size method. Likewise, comparison of the CEC/clay ratio between the two methods also indicated that the developed method yielded clay contents more consistent with other property data for the same horizons. Consequently, the textural classes obtained from the two methods were different. Therefore; we concluded that the determination of particle size distribution for gypsiferous soils (≤ 40 % gypsum) using this developed method will improve the understanding and ability to proper interpret of physical behavior of these unique soils. We highly recommended using this developed method to separate soil particles from the gypsiferous soils...|$|R

The [...] "trim leaf" [...] (small leaves surrounding the flowers) are usually coated in {{a large amount of}} trichomes which are collected by various means to make hash.

Another method involves freezing the trim and then agitating it with ice to separate the trichomes, the mixture then is filtered through screen bags of decreasing screen sizes ranging from 25-200 µm which capture the plant matter and allow the trichomes to pass to the bottom bag where they collect into a wet paste. The paste is pressed to extract most of the water and pressed into cakes and dried. In a dry-ice sifting process the trim leaf is placed in a filter bag with <b>dry</b> ice and <b>shaken</b> to allow a very pure concentration of trichomes to pass through which can be kept as powder or pressed into cakes.|$|R
