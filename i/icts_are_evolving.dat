This intermediary role is critical considering the importance of knowledge and knowledge management approaches in agricultural innovation systems. According to USAID (2003), understanding the place of ICTs in a developing country agriculture depends on four key concepts: i) that knowledge is an increasingly significant factor of production; ii) that all actors in the agricultural sector are part of an evolving Agricultural Knowledge System (AKS); iii) that ICTs accelerate agricultural development by facilitating knowledge management for AKS members; and iv...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare is an {{information}} business with expanding {{use of information}} and communication technologies (ICTs). Current <b>ICT</b> tools <b>are</b> immature, but a brighter future looms. We examine 7 areas of ICT in healthcare: electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchange (HIE), patient portals, telemedicine, social media, mobile devices and wearable sensors and monitors, and privacy and security. In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise. Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices. <b>ICT</b> tools <b>are</b> <b>evolving</b> quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment...|$|R
40|$|Throughout history, {{information}} has been core to the communication, processing and storage of most tasks in the organisation, in this case in Small-Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs). The implementation of these tasks relies on Information and Communication Technology (<b>ICT).</b> <b>ICT</b> <b>is</b> constantly <b>evolving,</b> and with each developed ICT, it becomes important that organisations adapt to the changing environment. Organisations need {{to adapt to the}} changing environment by incorporating innovative ICT that allows employees to perform their tasks with ease anywhere and anytime, whilst reducing the costs affiliated with the ICT. In this modern, performing tasks with ease anywhere and anytime requires that the employee is mobile whilst using the ICT. As a result, a relatively new phenomenon called “Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD) is currently infiltrating most organisations, where personally-owned mobile devices are used to access organisational information that will be used to conduct the various tasks of the organisation. The use of BYOD in organisations breeds the previously mentioned benefits such as performing organisational tasks anywhere and anytime.

40|$|Abstract: Business {{models in}} the Information and Communication Technology (<b>ICT)</b> domain must <b>be</b> <b>evolved</b> when {{innovative}} technologies emerge. To perform this in a dependable way, empirical studies (e. g. market studies or workshops with business and technology experts) must be complemented by means of deductive approaches based on economic theories. In this paper a corresponding approach is introduced leading from empirically identified value network participants to a clear theory-based understanding of business interaction in value networks {{that will not be}} established before long terms of time but that have to be described exactly because of early investment decisions by potential partners providing the respective innovative technology. Thus, a framework for analysing each value network participant’s relationships is introduced and applied in the context of mobile grid technology leading to a confirmed process-logically structured value network. 1...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{construction}} industry has encountered numerous problems such as rework, design errors, accidents and building failure, time and economic losses, poor work efficiency, and low standard level of cooperation amongst team members of different sectors. As such, information communication technology (<b>ICT)</b> has <b>been</b> <b>evolved</b> to minimize all the aforementioned setbacks in the construction industry. In doing so, building information modeling (BIM) has been proposed to all construction members such as engineers, architects, contractors, and owners to take benefit from. Since BIM was emerged into the construction industry, it has received the attention of many researchers and practitioners. While there have been roughly numerous studies conducted on the benefits involved {{in the use of}} BIM, it is a unresolved point why {{there has not been a}} greater take up of exploiting BIM throughout the whole lifecycle of construction projects. Therefore, this paper is mainly aimed to examine the effectiveness of exploiting BIM throughout the three different phases of building’s lifecycle, including preconstruction, construction, and post construction in great details regarding the previous studies conducted in this field.

The school uses ICT {{as a teaching}} tool and it begins to be included at the leisure-time in school by the educators. Aim {{of this study is}} to examine how educators describe their perceptions and experiences of using ICT in the leisure activities. The questions is about how the educators use ICT, what they believe children learn of ICT, and which advantages and disadvantages they see with ICT at leisure-time in school. Through a qualitative approach, I have had my questions answered by six trained educators, five of whom are recreational educators and one who is a preschool teacher. These have individually answered my interview questions as an interview took place over a phone call, while the others answered the same questions by e-mail. The interview questions were open-ended questions that were formulated so the educators could respond so freely and fulfilling as possible. The survey shows that teachers use ICT in multimodal approach at leisure-time in school, both in informing parents and in activities with the children. The children use ICT tools as Smartboards, computers and Ipads. With these tools, they listen to music, play games and use various utility programs, which are helping them to develop in different knowledge topics. They also developed in interaction with each other as they learn to work together, take into account and listen to each other and to wait for their turn. The educators see benefits of ICT as it doubles as a great and practical support, both for the children and for themselves.

40|$|Information {{communication}} technology (<b>ICT)</b> governance <b>is</b> {{a subset of}} the larger notion of "corporate governance". As ICT issues become increasingly important and information becomes one of the most valuable assets of organisations, the sound governance of ICT becomes a major factor in organisational success. Standards such as the Australian New Zealand Standard on ICT Governance provide useful guidance to organisations about how best to meet their corporate and ICT governance 'obligations. At the same time, notions of what is meant by corporate and <b>ICT</b> governance <b>are</b> rapidly <b>evolving</b> in Australia, the EU and US. New concepts, models, theories and applications of governance are emerging as various disciplines such as management, politics, law, sociology, psychology, economics, ethics and computer science contribute to the governance dialogue and debate.

40|$|Through telemedicine, {{the health}} sector has seized the {{opportunity}} offered by development of information and communications technology (ICT) such as the business or industrial sectors, but <b>ICTs</b> <b>are</b> constantly <b>evolving.</b> To benefit from technological progress {{it is necessary to}} adapt the computer applications to these technologies, however this operation is costly to health facilities especially in developing countries. In terms of scientific research, this observation explains the development of model-driven engineering of computer systems such as the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach. MDA is a computer design approach for the development of computer systems that considers separately the functional needs of technical needs of an application. MDA mainly uses the models and their transformations whose traces allow MDA to capitalize expertise in terms of technology and to ensure some rapid modernization of applications to new technologies which results in a significant productivity gain. Today there is a huge requirement worldwide in the interoperable services, in particular with regard to their valuable contribution to the collaboration ability of remote information technology systems. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an interesting architectural pattern in which software components contribute to the collaboration and sharing of services. In this way, the principles of SOA are intended to ensure interoperability between heterogeneous and distributed applications. Web services {{are at the heart of}} SOA, which splits functions into different services, accessible over a computer network that enables users to associate and reuse them in the exploitation of applications. Health applications have a strong need to communicate with the remote institutions in order to provide the most relevant services to patients and to collaborate with other medical partners to solve complex tasks. For this purpose, the proposed research work shows how the paradigms of SOA and MDA can be configured to implement medical software applications on an e-health platform. The case study concerns the Telemedicine in French-speaking Africa (RAFT) project in which the joint use of MDA and SOA facilitates knowledge combination and reuse in the management of applications supporting a medical collaborative work environment...|$|R

The spaces of intervention as well as the different types of public being reached during fieldwork as well as through the use of <b>ICT</b> tools, <b>are</b> <b>evolving</b> constantly, as do the patterns of consumptions, the substances available (Research Chemicals, Legal Highs) and the ways these substances are being purchased. Risk Reduction, Community empowerment (including peer work) and Health promotion strategies are the basis of numerous Safer Nightlife projects. There is an increasing recognition and diffusion of these strategies but various specific programmes still need to be defined and evaluated with more precision. Safer Nightlife projects often share a lack of financial resources to fully develop their programmes and to maintain a continuous evaluation process. Evaluation is necessary at many levels from proving efficiency or re-orientating programmes, to justifying fundings. Evaluation will also allow field workers to communicate about their work and to fill the gap between them and the scientific community. The research and/or evaluation topics covered by the scientific community often differ from the needs of the front line projects and the partygoers. Field workers want to share the results obtained within their projects and need to evaluate them to ensure that they are evidence based before being disseminated. The DC&DII Safer Nightlife partners have chosen to elaborate this guideline to share information, knowledge and tools to promote the evaluation of Safer Nightlife programmes, to improve the existing ones and to help new projects include these evaluation issues from the start. This guideline is linked with the Digital Library of the DC&D Safer Nightlife project (www. democitydrug. org/safernightlife) where a variety of documents, tools and reports from the DC&D partners are available on-line to illustrate and complement the topics and examples proposed in this document...|$|R
