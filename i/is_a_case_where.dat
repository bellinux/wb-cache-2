2500|$|In 1971, the {{legislature}} created {{a commission to}} study the constitution and make recommendations to maintain its utility. After reviewing the document for two years, it was recommended that the constitution be amended to rewrite it in modern language and allow easier reference. [...] The amendment was approved by voters on November 5, 1974. [...] This did not alter {{the meaning of the}} constitution, although if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> meaning is ambiguous, the original document remains the final authority.|$|E
2500|$|However, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> the {{distinction}} between natural isomorphism and equality is usually not made. That is for the objects that may be characterized by a universal property. In fact, there is a unique isomorphism, necessarily natural, between two objects sharing the same universal property. A typical example is the set of real numbers, which may be defined through infinite decimal expansion, infinite binary expansion, Cauchy sequences, Dedekind cuts and many other ways. Formally these constructions define different objects, which all are solutions of the same universal property. As these objects have exactly the same properties, one may forget the method of construction and considering them as equal. This is what everybody does when talking of [...] "the set of the real numbers". The same occurs with quotient spaces: they are commonly constructed as sets of equivalence classes. However, talking of set of sets may be counterintuitive, and quotient spaces are commonly considered {{as a pair of}} a set of undetermined objects, often called [...] "points", and a surjective map onto this set.|$|E

2500|$|Prader–Willi syndrome, a {{generally}} non-hereditary genetic condition, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> GH is prescribed for benefits {{in addition to}} height. [...] GH {{is one of the}} treatment options an experienced endocrinologist may use when treating a child with PWS. [...] GH can help children with PWS in height, weight, body mass, strength, and agility[...] [...] Reports have indicated increase of growth rate (especially {{in the first year of}} treatment) and a variety of other positive effects, including improved body composition (higher muscle mass, lower fat mass); improved weight management; increased energy and physical activity; improved strength, agility, and endurance; and improved respiratory function. The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association (USA) recommends that a sleep study be conducted before initiating GH treatment in a child with PWS. [...] At this time there is no direct evidence of a causative link between growth hormone and the respiratory problems seen in PWS (among both those receiving and those not receiving GH treatment), including sudden death. [...] A follow-up sleep study after one year of GH treatment may also be indicated. [...] GH (specifically Pfizer's version, Genotropin) is the only treatment that has received an FDA indication for children with PWS. [...] The FDA indication only applies to children.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} items {{that may be}} sold with vendor financing, for example, {{automobile}} leasing, the notional cost of the good may effectively be hidden and the APR subsequently rendered meaningless. An example <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> an automobile is leased to a customer based on a [...] "manufacturer's suggested retail price" [...] with a low APR: the vendor may be accepting a lower lease rate as a trade-off against a higher sale price. Had the customer self-financed, a discounted sales price may have been accepted by the vendor; in other words, the customer has received cheap financing in exchange for paying a higher purchase price, and the quoted APR understates {{the true cost of}} the financing. In this case, the only meaningful way to establish the [...] "true" [...] APR would involve arranging financing through other sources, determining the lowest-acceptable cash price and comparing the financing terms (which may not be feasible in all circumstances). For leases where the lessee has a purchase option {{at the end of the}} lease term, the cost of the APR is further complicated by this option. In effect, the lease includes a put option back to the manufacturer (or, alternatively, a call option for the consumer), and the value (or cost) of this option to the consumer is not transparent.|$|E
