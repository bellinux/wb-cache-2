5|$|Athletes {{train to}} achieve <b>endurance,</b> strength, speed, skill and {{flexibility}} {{at different levels}} of intensity. Offseason training often occurs on dry land, sometimes on roller skis. The organization of cross-country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences. As with other sports that require <b>endurance,</b> strength and speed, some athletes have chosen to use banned performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{proposed a}} purpose-built aircraft, but tests indicated {{it would not}} outperform the already-operational 707, so the latter was chosen instead. To increase <b>endurance,</b> this design was to be powered by eight General Electric TF34s. It would carry its radar in a rotating dome mounted {{at the top of}} a forward-swept tail, above the fuselage. Boeing was selected ahead of McDonnell Douglas's DC-8-based proposal in July 1970. Initial orders were placed for two aircraft, designated EC-137D as test beds to evaluate the two competing radars. As the test-beds did not need the same 14-hour <b>endurance</b> demanded of the production aircraft, the EC-137s retained the Pratt & Whitney JT3D commercial engines, and a later reduction in <b>endurance</b> requirement led to retaining the normal engines in production.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the announcement of entries for the 2015 FIA World <b>Endurance</b> Championship and the European Le Mans Series seasons, the ACO announced the full 56 car entry list for Le Mans, plus seven reserves. In addition to the 35 guaranteed entries from the World <b>Endurance</b> Championship, 13 entries came from the European Le Mans Series, three from the United SportsCar Championship, two from the Asian Le Mans Series, {{while the rest of}} the field was filled with one-off entries only competing at Le Mans.|$|E

5|$|Other {{distinctive}} features are a relatively long, level croup, or {{top of the}} hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as <b>endurance</b> riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their <b>endurance,</b> and {{the superiority of the}} breed in <b>Endurance</b> riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored <b>endurance</b> events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.|$|E
