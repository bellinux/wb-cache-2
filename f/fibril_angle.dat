30|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the variability of the <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> of tracheids in earlywood of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.). Polarization confocal microscopy was chosen and compared with the method utilizing the orientation of soft rot cavities. There was a significant correlation between the soft rot and polarization confocal microscopy methods, which showed the same trend of high fibril angles in the first part of the earlywood followed by a decrease toward the end of earlywood. This declining trend was less pronounced in annual rings containing compression wood. Moreover, large variations in <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> occurred between neighboring tracheids. The investigation also emphasized the differences between X-ray diffraction and microscopic methods, as the large variation seen by the latter methods is not seen by the X-ray diffraction approach because of its large area of measurement. No correlation was found between fiber morphology (i.e., average length, width, density) and the average <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> in the investigated annual rings.|$|E
40|$|Many insects {{with smooth}} {{adhesive}} pads can rapidly enlarge their contact area by centripetal pulls on the legs, {{allowing them to}} cope with sudden mechanical perturbations such as gusts of wind or raindrops. The short time scale of this reaction excludes any neuromuscular control; it is thus {{more likely to be}} caused by mechanical properties of the pad?s specialised cuticle. This soft cuticle contains numerous branched fibrils oriented almost perpendicularly to the surface. Assuming a fixed volume of the water-filled cuticle, we hypothesized that pulls could decrease the <b>fibril</b> <b>angle,</b> thereby helping the contact area to expand laterally and longitudinally. Three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy on the cuticle of smooth stick insect pads confirmed that pulls significantly decreased the <b>fibril</b> <b>angle.</b> The <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> variation appeared insufficient to explain the observed increase in contact area. Direct strain measurements in the contact zone demonstrate that pulls not only expand the cuticle laterally (indicating a negative Poisson?s ratio of the pad?s cuticle), but also add new contact area at the pad?s perimeter...|$|E
40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} methodology based on micromechanical testing inside a {{scanning electron microscope}} is proposed to characterise bonding of paper layers connected by wet pressing. The peeling force–displacement evolution law that characterises the delamination of micromechanical double cantilever beam specimens of paper tissue have been extracted from such peeling tests. It is observed that the force–displacement evolution curve achieves a steady-state value related to the effective adhesive energy of the interface. This behaviour is explained by examining the complex load transfer mechanism between the layers exerted by cellulose fibrils. A {{statistical approach is used}} for the computation of the effective adhesive energy. It is argued that the observed force–displacement evolution law may be satisfactory described by a stochastic model that depends on the distribution function of the fibrils strength, and on two geometrical distribution functions related to the in-plane and out-of-plane <b>fibrils</b> <b>angles</b> with respect to the undeformed interface configuration.

40|$|Peripheral {{neuropathy}} affects approximately 50 % of the 15 million Americans with diabetes. It {{has been}} suggested that mechanical effects related to collagen glycation are related to the permanence of neuropathy. In the present paper, we develop a model for load transfer in a whole nerve, using a simple pressure vessel approximation, in order to assess the significant of stiffening of the collagenous nerve sheath on endoneurial fluid pressure. We also develop a fibril-scale mechanics model for the nerve, to model the straightening of wavy fibrils, producing the toe region observed in nerve tissue, and also to interrogate the effects of interfibrillar crosslinks on the overall properties of the tissue. Such collagen crosslinking has been implicated in complications in diabetic tissues. Our fibril-scale model uses a two-parameter Weibull model for fibril strength, in combination with statistical parameters describing <b>fibril</b> modulus, <b>angle,</b> wave-amplitude, and volume fraction to capture both toe region and failure region behavior of whole rat sciatic nerve. The extrema of equal and local load-sharing assumptions are used to map potential differences in diabetic and nondiabetic tissues.

40|$|Using the gecko as inspiration, {{important}} {{principles are}} revealed for reliable maneuvering on vertical surfaces. Foremost among {{these is the}} directional behavior of the gecko adhesive system, which per-mits control of adhesion via control of the tangential forces at the feet. Multiple hierarchical levels of compliance are also important for conforming intimately to surfaces {{with varying degrees of}} roughness and different length scales. In light of these requirements, most previously developed synthetic adhe-sives are not well suited for application on a climbing robot. We describe a synthetic fibrillar adhesive, termed Directional Polymer Stalks, made from relatively soft polyurethane (E ≈ 300 kPa). The <b>fibrils</b> are <b>angled</b> 20 ◦ with respect to vertical and are approximately 1 mm long and 380 µm in diameter. Rather than having a flat top, they have angled faces at 45 ◦. The directional nature of these angled stalks is shown, achieving a maximum adhesion of approximately 1 N for a 3. 9 cm 2 patch when pulled in the proper adhesive direction. When pulled in the non-adhesive direction, the adhesive forces are negligible. The application to a climbing robot is presented and limitations of the current design are discussed along with ongoing efforts to address them...|$|R
40|$|A new {{strain energy}} {{function}} for the hyperelastic modelling of ligaments and tendons whose fascicles have a helical arrangement of fibrils is derived. The stress-strain response {{of a single}} fascicle whose fibrils exhibit varying levels of crimp throughout its radius is calculated and {{used to determine the}} form of the strain energy function. The new constitutive law is used to model uniaxial extension test data for human patellar tendon and is shown to provide an excellent fit, with the average relative error being 9. 8 %. It is then used to model shear and predicts that the stresses required to shear a tendon are much smaller than those required to uniaxially stretch it to the same strain level. Finally, the strain energy function is used to model ligaments and tendons whose fascicles are helical, and the relative effects of the <b>fibril</b> helix <b>angle,</b> the fascicle helix <b>angle</b> and the <b>fibril</b> crimp variable are compared. It is shown that they all have a significant effect; the fibril crimp variable governs the non-linearity of the stress-strain curve, whereas the helix angles primarily affect its stiffness. Smaller values of the helix angles lead to stiffer tendons; therefore, the model predicts that one would expect to see fewer helical sub-structures in stiff positional tendons, and more in those that are required to be more flexible...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the “Basic phenomena in mechanical pulping” project financed by NER (the Nordic Energy Research) of which the PhD study was a part, was to show a radical reduction (30 %) in specific energy consumption {{in the production of}} mechanical pulp. Energy consumption is an important aspect in mechanical pulping as some 1200 - 2500 kWh/t is consumed during thermomechanical (TMP) refining. The specific energy consumption for producing thermomechanical pulp from Scots pine is normally 10 - 20 % higher than that of Norway spruce when compared at the same pulp freeness. Explanations for this difference have been searched from the higher extractives content of pine and from the differences in the physical and chemical structure of the fibre walls between pine and spruce. The main objective {{of this study was to}} obtain a better understanding of how wood raw material properties (fibre wall thickness, <b>fibril</b> <b>angle)</b> affect energy consumption and influence the fibre development in TMP pulping. The reduction in fibre wall thickness is higher for thick-walled materials than thinwalled materials. In the case of spruce, the thin-walled raw materials had lower external fibrillation and higher internal fibrillation than the thick-walled. Raw materials with thicker fibre walls produce more fines and external fibrillation and thus have low energy consumption (SEC) at a given freeness. However the effect was not strong enough to explain the difference generally observed between pine and spruce. The energy consumption to a given freeness in this study was found to be higher for Norway spruce than Scots pine due to harsher refining condition for the pine sampler. The results show a difference in the development of the fibre properties and resulting laboratory sheets with different fibre wall thickness and <b>fibril</b> <b>angle,</b> however the observed differences can not explain the difference in energy consumption generally seen between spruce and pine. Linear regression models were performed to study the effect of raw material properties on specific energy consumption. The models showed that at equal freeness, SEC was reduced by 40 kWh/t pr 0. 1 μm higher fibre wall thickness. In this trial energy consumption of the spruce pulps was on average 360 kWh/t higher than pine. The <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> had no significant effect on SEC to a given freeness. It was shown that fibre bendability is increasing with specific energy consumption upon mechanical pulp refining. Spruce TMP fibres were more flexible than pine after refining. Local damages of the fibre wall, such as delamination, kinks, and compressions were the main effect in the increasing of the bendability with the refining. The specific surface area was found to increase with specific energy consumption, external fibrillation of long fibres and with the fines content in paper leading to dense and strong paper. A regression model showed that a reduction in fibre wall thickness will increase paper density with 67 kg /m 3 pr 0. 1 μm of fibre wall thickness. It was found that <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> has a significant influence on paper roughness. Fibres with low <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> will give low roughness values, probably because these fibres collapse more easily. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Process Engineerin...|$|E

Wood samples were collected from five infested and five noninfested trees {{of each of the}} three species. Cross, radial, and tangential sections were taken from the wood samples, and samples were also macerated to separate the cells. Measurements were made of four anatomical characteristics: cell wall thickness, cell width, <b>fibril</b> <b>angle,</b> and tracheid length. Measurements were made of wood that was produced before infestation of the tree, wood of the same tree that was produced after infestation, and wood of noninfested trees. Wood produced after infestation in all three species is like compression wood in that the percentage of summerwood is greatly increased, tracheids are round in cross section, intercellular spaces are present, microscopic checking occurs in the cell waIIs, and false rings are present. The number of rays is almost double the number found in noninfested trees, and the diameter of the ray cells appears to be greater. Springwood cell walls of infested trees are sinuous in nature. Traumatic resin canals in tangential bands may be differentiated {{at any time during the}} growing season. Cell walls of the springwood of infested trees were significantly thicker than the springwood ceII walls of wood produced before infestation and also of noninfested trees for all three species, but there were no differences with regard to the summerwood.

This was true for both springwood and summerwood. <b>Fibril</b> <b>angle</b> in the summerwood and transition area in infested trees of each species was two to three times greater than the angle found in wood produced before infestation and in noninfested trees.

The model {{is used to}} fit mechanical tension test data from the equine common digital extensor tendon (CDET) and superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), which are used as archetypes of positional and energy-storing tendons, respectively. The fibril crimp and fascicle helix angles of the two tendon types are used as fitting parameters in the mathematical model to predict their values. The outer <b>fibril</b> crimp <b>angles</b> were predicted to be 15. 1 Â° Â± 2. 3 Â° in the CDET and 15. 8 Â° Â± 4. 1 Â° in the SDFT, and the average crimp angles were predicted to be 10. 0 Â° Â± 1. 5 Â° in the CDET and 10. 5 Â° Â± 2. 7 Â° in the SDFT. The crimp angles were {{not found to be}} statistically significantly different between the two tendon types (p = 0. 572).

This supports previous qualitative observations that helical substructures {{are more likely to be}} found in energy-storing tendons than in positional tendons and suggests that the relative compliance of energy-storing tendons may be directly caused by these helical substructures...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{structure}} and composition of articular cartilage change during development and growth. These changes lead to alterations in the mechanical properties of cartilage. In the present study, biomechanical, biochemical and structural relationships of articular cartilage during growth and maturation of rabbits are investigated. DesignArticular cartilage specimens from the tibial medial plateaus and femoral medial condyles of female New Zealand white rabbits were collected from seven age-groups; 0 days (n= 29), 11 days (n= 30), 4 weeks (n= 30), 6 weeks (n= 30), 3 months (n= 24), 6 months (n= 24) and 18 months (n= 19). The samples underwent mechanical testing under creep indentation. From the mechanical response, instantaneous and equilibrium moduli were determined. Biochemical analyses of tissue collagen, hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) and pentosidine (PEN) cross-links in full thickness cartilage samples were conducted. Proteoglycans were investigated depth-wise from the tissue sections by measuring the optical density of Safranin-O-stained samples. Furthermore, depth-wise collagen architecture of articular cartilage was analyzed with polarized light microscopy. Finite element analyses of the samples from different age-groups were conducted to reveal tensile and compressive properties of the fibril network and the matrix of articular cartilage, respectively. ResultsTissue thickness decreased from ∼ 3 to ∼ 0. 5 mm {{until the age of}} 3 months, while the instantaneous modulus increased with age prior to peak at 4 – 6 weeks. A lower equilibrium modulus was observed before 3 -month-age, after which the equilibrium modulus continued to increase. Collagen <b>fibril</b> orientation <b>angle</b> and parallelism index were inversely related to the instantaneous modulus, tensile fibril modulus and tissue thickness. Collagen content and cross-linking were positively related to the equilibrium compressive properties of the tissue. ConclusionsDuring maturation, significant modulation of tissue structure, composition and mechanical properties takes place.

A betterunderstanding of properties of these fibers will help to improve the performance ofthe paper industry. Fiber deforms with time when subjected to a load, which has to be compensated for in packaging materials {{by the use of}} thicker papers thus morematerial. This deformation increases in the variable climate. This well-known complex phenomenon is called mechano-sorptive creep and leads to large losses in the paper industry every year. In order to understand the influence on the creep phenomenon of different fibermorphology, and how and to what extent the <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> affects the mechano-sorptive creep, the creep behavior of four series of fibers from spruce were measured by DMA(Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer) at a constant humidity climate followed by animmediately cyclic humidity. The fibers used were mature latewood fibers, matureearlywood fibers, juvenile latewood fibers and juvenile earlywood fibers. The CLSM(Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy) was used to determine the microfibril angle ofthe fibers. The results of the tests show a higher creep rate at cyclic humidity than thatat constant humidity. The comparisons among fibers show that latewood fibers havehigher mechano-sorptive creep ratio (creep rate at cyclic humidity/ creep rate atconstant humidity) than earlywood fibers and that juvenile wood fibers have highercreep ratio than mature wood fibers.

Although the swollen fiber untwisted to some extent on washing with water, the shape of the twisted ribbons as observed by scanning electron microscopy was retained even after drying.

Experimental and computational analysis of simpler model systems has therefore been necessary, for instance, on the peptide fragment GNNQQNY(7 - 13) of yeast prion protein Sup 35 p. Expanding on a previous publication, we report here a detailed structural characterization of GNNQQNY <b>fibrils</b> using magic <b>angle</b> spinning (MAS) NMR. On the basis of additional chemical shift assignments we confirm the coexistence of three distinct peptide conformations within the fibrillar samples, as reflected in substantial chemical shift differences. Backbone torsion angle measurements indicate that the basic structure of these coexisting conformers is an extended beta-sheet. We structurally characterize a previously identified localized distortion of the beta-strand backbone specific to one of the conformers. Intermolecular contacts are consistent with each of the conformers being present in its own parallel and in-register sheet. Overall the M AS NMR data indicate a substantial difference between the structure of the fibrillar and crystalline forms of these peptides, with a clearly increased complexity in the GNNQQNY fibril structure.

As a hierarchical, semi-crystalline material, collagen mechanics can be studied using X-ray diffraction. The aim {{of the study was}} to describe multi-structural changes in tendon collagen following controlled plastic damage (5 % permanent strain). We used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to interrogate the spacing of collagen molecules within a <b>fibril,</b> and wide <b>angle</b> X-ray scattering (WAXS) to measure molecular strains under macroscopic loading. Simultaneous recordings of SAXS and WAXS patterns, together with whole-tissue strain in physiologically hydrated rat-tail tendons were made during increments of in situ tensile loading. Results showed that while tissue level modulus was unchanged, fibril modulus decreased significantly, and molecular modulus significantly increased. Further, analysis of higher order SAXS peaks suggested structural changes in the gap and overlap regions, possibly localising the damage to molecular cross-links. Our results provide new insight into the fundamental damage processes at work in collagenous tissues and point to new directions for their mitigation and repair. Statement of SignificanceThis article reports the first in situ loading synchrotron studies on mechanical damage in collagenous tissues. We provide new insight into the nano- and micro-structural mechanisms of damage processes. Pre-damaged tendons showed differential alteration of moduli at macro, micro and nano-scales as measured using X-ray scattering techniques. Detailed analysis of higher order diffraction peaks suggested damage is localised to molecular cross-links. The results are consistent with previous X-ray scattering studies of tendons and also with recent thermal stability studies on damaged material.

Models developed for differentiation between sapwood and heartwood using NIRS were very robust for four species, but sapwood depth could only be predicted well for one of the four species. Sun et al. [23] estimated the MFA and fiber length of bamboo by NIRS. The results showed that the PLS models of MFA and fiber length, based on noise combined with orthogonal signal selection spectra, gave the strongest correlations.|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between the fibre flexibility and cross-sectional area moment of inertia of thermomechanical pulp fibres was investigated. The main effects of refining {{were found to be}} internal fibrillation, external fibrillation, and fibre shortening. Internal fibrillation increases fibre flexibility and fibre collapsibility, improving fibre-to-fibre contact in a paper sheet. The raw materials used were pulps produced from six different Norway spruce logs and six different Scots pine logs, chosen in a manner that allowed variation of fibre wall thickness and <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> independently. Each wood sample was refined in four stages using a pressurized 12 " Sprout Waldron single disc refiner. Fibre flexibility was assessed by FiberMaster bendability measurements. Fibre bendability was measured on the + 48 Bauer McNett fractions of the twelve 2 nd, 3 rd, and 4 th stage thermomechanical pulps (TMP). The fibre cross-sectional samples were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An image analysis method to calculate the area moment of inertia of each fibre using numerical integration was developed. Fiber bendability increased with specific energy consumption for both wood species (spruce and pine) from the 2 nd refining stage to the fourth refining stage. Spruce had a higher rate of bendability increase than pine upon refining. It was expected that fibres with a low area moment of inertia would result in higher bendability, but no such correlation was found for either spruce or pine. Fibre bendability increased with internal fibrillation, as assessed from Simons staining. These results imply that local damage of the fibre wall such as delaminations, kinks, and compressions was the main effect in increasing the flexibility through refining of TMP...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) parameter T 2 relaxation time {{has been shown to}} be sensitive to the collagen network architecture of articular cartilage. The aim of the study was to investigate the agreement of T 2 relaxation time mapping and polarized light microscopy (PLM) for the determination of histological properties (i. e., zone and fibril organization) of articular cartilage. MethodsT 2 relaxation time was determined at 9. 4 T field strength in healthy adult human, juvenile bovine and juvenile porcine patellar cartilage, and related to collagen anisotropy and <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> as measured by quantitative PLM. ResultsBoth T 2 and PLM revealed a mutually consistent but varying number of collagen-associated laminae (3, 3 – 5 or 3 – 7 laminae in human, porcine and bovine cartilage, respectively). Up to 44 % of the depth-wise variation in T 2 was accounted for by the changing anisotropy of collagen fibrils, confirming that T 2 contrast of articular cartilage is strongly affected by the collagen fibril anisotropy. A good correspondence was observed between the thickness of T 2 -laminae and collagenous zones as determined from PLM anisotropy measurements (r= 0. 91, r= 0. 95 and r= 0. 91 for human, bovine and porcine specimens, respectively). ConclusionsAccording to the present results, T 2 mapping is capable of detecting histological differences in cartilage collagen architecture among species, likely to be strongly related to the differences in maturation of the tissue. This diversity in the MRI appearance of healthy articular cartilage should also be recognized when using juvenile animal tissue as a model for mature human cartilage in experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|Lack of {{straightness}} in timber is {{the most}} frequent complaint regarding solid (and laminated) timber products worldwide. Nowadays, customers demand higher quality in the shape stability of wood products than they did earlier. The final distortion of timber boards is mostly caused by moisture-related stresses in wood (drying distortions) and growth-related stresses (distortions appearing when logs are split up to timber boards by sawing). To get more knowledge on how these distortions can be reduced in wooden products, {{there is a need}} for improved understanding of this material behaviour through good numerical tools developed from empirical data. A three-dimensional finite element board distortion model developed by Ormarsson (Doctoral thesis, Publ. 99 : 7, 1999) has been extended to include the influence of growth stresses by incorporating a one-dimensional finite element growth stress model developed here. The growth stress model is formulated as an axisymmetric general plane strain model where material for all new annual rings is progressively added to the tree during the analysis. The simulation results presented include how stresses are progressively generated during the tree growth, distortions related to the redistribution of growth stresses during log sawing, and distortions and stresses in drying reflecting the effects of growth stresses. The results show that growth stresses clearly vary during tree growth and also form a large stress gradient from pith to bark. This in itself can result in significant bow and crook deformations when logs are sawn into timber boards. The distortion results from the simulations match well with the results observed in reality. The parametric study also showed that the radial growth stress distribution is highly influenced by parameters such as modulus of elasticity, micro <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> and maturation strain...|$|E
40|$|Wood is the {{original}} structural material, developed by nature to support tall plants. Every advantageous feature of wood as used in artificial structures {{is rooted in the}} plant's evolved capability to withstand the conditions of its survival: specifically wind and gravity loads. Wood resists these load types with remarkable efficiency with performance comparable to structural alloys. Additionally, wood exhibits the ductility and energy dissipation capacity required of structural materials to prevent catastrophic failure. The hierarchical structure of wood allows {{for a wide range of}} mechanical properties; through the modulation of various parameters at various length scales, the living tree grows wood with properties fine-tuned to handle the specific loading conditions. This thesis explores why and how this hierarchical structure works, with a focus on the cell wall material of stiff fibrils in a pliant matrix. Here we report a simple coarsegrained model of the fibrils and matrix to provide a bottom-up description of the mechanics. We identify the mechanical behaviors for varying fibril angles, and in addition, for varying fibril lengths, plot force-strain relationships and compare the data with experimental results and theoretical predictions, providing insight into fundamental structure-property relations of wood. While it presents a simple formulation, it can successfully describe several key phenomena, specifically the three regimes of mechanical behavior: elastic, plastic, and high-strain stiffening, as well as the dependence of modulus on the <b>fibril</b> <b>angle,</b> and as such provides a bottom-up mechanistic approach to wood mechanics. Additionally, the intersection of biological inspiration, computer simulation, and three-dimensional printing is discussed highlighting profound implications for future advanced material design. Previous research developed computer simulations of theoretical biomimetic "bone-like" materials, which were then printed as samples for experimentation. A fractured sample is investigated with optical and electron microscopy with emphasis on failure mechanisms and the quality and resolution of the printing process. The observed damage patterns are shown to correlate to the deformation and failure patterns predicted by simulation, an impressive first step towards more advanced biomimetic fabricated materials designed through computer simulation. by David Adler.

Most of companies {{have a very}} specialized raw material supply chain since they use almost one type of cultivar for their specific products. For example, I- 214 is very suitable for light packaging, consider as exclusive raw material in all industries. However, to prevent companies from a potential disease of their unique raw material, {{we need to find}} alternative cultivars. 14 cultivars were then characterized in terms of material, mechanic, peeling, wood pulp properties in a collaborative project (CNPF-IDF, FCBA, INRA, ENSAM).

In this research, we gave information about mechanical properties of LVL made from juvenile and supposed mature veneers from 14 poplar cultivars. Its objective was to classified veneer poplar cultivars into two categories: suitable for structural purposes and non-structural purposes. From each cultivars (theirs ages were 13 - 19 years old), we took two logs, then we peeled into 3 and 5. 2 mm thick veneers. We separated veneers that resulted from sapwood and heartwood to produce LVL panels mostly performed with juvenile wood or "more mature" wood. The veneers were glued using polyvinylacetate (PVAC). The boards were then cut into standardized samples (21 * 21 * 500 mm) for mechanical tests, i. e. four points bending tests (1280 samples). Before these tests, nondestructive measurements of the MOE have been made on the bending samples using the BING method (vibration tests). The results showed that correlation between destructive and non-destructive test was 0. 79 (it means nondestructive test could be used as reference to estimate MOE). Based on non-destructive test, poplar cultivars which were categorized for potential structural purposes, were: Brenta, Lambro, Soligo and Taro. The rest of poplar cultivars (A 4 A, Alcinde, Dvina, I- 214, Koster, Lena, Mella, Polargo, Trichobel and Triplo) were categorized in non-structural.

40|$|Mechanical pulping for {{producing}} pulps from softwood suitable for printing grade papers, like news, {{is a highly}} energy-intensive process consuming around 2000 kWh/t in electrical energy. Due to increasing energy costs and environmental issues {{there is a high}} demand for decreasing this energy consumption. The mechanical treatment of wet wood pieces in a refiner, in the mechanical pulp plant, is a complex mechanical loading. This is a process occurring between rotating discs at high speed and temperatures of 140 °C - 160 °C, where by means of shear and compression forces the fibres are separated and then made flexible, fibrillated and collapsed for good bonding ability. In this process also fines are created giving the optical properties of the paper. In mechanical pulping {{only a fraction of the}} applied energy is used for the structural changes of the wood material. Thus fundamental studies of the loading modes of wood under refining conditions and in particular under combined shear and compression loading are desired to gain more information regarding the possibility of affecting the mechanical pulping in an energy efficient way. The possibilities to study the behaviour of wood under a combined shear and compression load were in this thesis investigated using two methods: the Iosipescu shear test and the Arcan shear test. In both apparatus different combinations of shear and compression load were achieved by different rotations of the shear test device itself. Measurements with the Iosipescu device on a medium density fibreboard showed good agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations. Finite element analysis on wood showed, however, that with the use of a homogeneous material in the model the level of strain reached would be ten times smaller than experimentally measured. This fact is probably due to the honeycomb structure of the wood cells that allows for different local deformations that could not be represented by a continuous material model. Thus to study the deformations on the fibre level of wood an experimental equipment that uses smaller samples was needed. With a modified Arcan shear device such deformations under combined shear and compression load and in pure compression were possible showing different deformation patterns. During pure compression the cell walls bend in a characteristic “S” shape, independently of the shape of the fibre cells and their cell wall thickness. Under combined shear and compression, however, mainly the corners of the fibre cells deform giving a “brick” shape to the cells. In a second deformation performed in compression, the fibre cells follow the same deformation pattern as given by the first deformation type whether in compression or in combined shear and compression. The interpretation is that permanent defects in the cells themselves are introduced already in the first load cycle of the wood samples. The energy used under the different loading conditions showed that the first deformation required the largest amount of energy, for all loading conditions. The deformation in compression required larger amounts of energy than the deformation in combined loads. For subsequent deformations less energy was needed for compression if a combined load had preceded it. Due to the fact that less energy is needed to start to deform wood in combined load than under compression load, the application of a combined load as a first cycle may thus be a way to permanently deform fibres using less energy. To investigate the critical parameters determining the permanent deformation of cells, a finite element model of a network of twelve cells was developed. Special care was given to the material properties to study how the variation of the <b>fibril</b> <b>angle</b> in the different layers affects the deformation pattern of the wood fibres under the different loading conditions. The model shows that whether modelled as homogeneous linear isotropic material or as an orthotropic material defined for every layer of the cells wall, no difference in the deformation of the network of the fibres was achieved. It is probable that the deformation type is more determined by the geometry of the fibres themselves than by their material propertiesQC 2010100...|$|E
