5|$|Some {{substances}} {{which are}} toxic to humans {{have no effect}} on bees. If bees obtain their nectar from certain flowers, the resulting honey can be psychoactive, or even toxic to humans, but <b>innocuous</b> to bees and their larvae. Poisoning from this honey is called mad honey disease.|$|E
5|$|Early on 10 April, Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić, {{the head}} of the {{operations}} staff with the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb. He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to <b>innocuous</b> positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} seen as entirely <b>innocuous</b> when it was {{introduced}} on January 16, 1956. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and on January 18 it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. It then fell to the Senate to consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on February 20.|$|E
5|$|Early on 10 April, Nikolić {{left his}} post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb. He then {{returned}} to the headquarters, and announced that talks with the Germans for an armistice has started {{and that there was no}} longer any need for action. He also redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to <b>innocuous</b> positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance.|$|E
5|$|In April 1931, {{the same}} month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays {{recruited}} former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were <b>innocuous</b> and actually too favorable in their depiction of the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed and from 1930 to 1932 removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this <b>innocuous</b> affair may have played more heavily {{in the minds of the}} review panel.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) – Patrick and {{his wife}} Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in {{seemingly}} preposterous situations, all of which in context are perfectly <b>innocuous.</b> The couple's relationship with their neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcasesnot realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday from the day Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick to suspect that Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on malicious.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the backseat of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were <b>innocuous</b> and even overly favorable in depicting the police.

He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to <b>innocuous</b> positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance. On the same day, the 14th Panzer Division, supported by dive bombers, crossed the Drava and drove southwest towards Zagreb on snow-covered roads in extremely cold conditions. Initial air reconnaissance indicated large concentrations of Yugoslav troops on the divisional axis of advance, but these troops proved to be withdrawing towards Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|In {{the solitary}} phase, these {{grasshoppers}} are <b>innocuous,</b> {{their numbers are}} low, {{and they do not}} pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on <b>innocuous</b> plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{established}} his district headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York City. He chose the name Development of Substitute Materials (DSM), {{but this would}} not stick. Colonel Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the head of the}} Construction Branch in the Office of the Chief of Engineers thought it would attract undue attention. Instead, the new district was given the <b>innocuous</b> name of the Manhattan Engineer District, following the usual practice of naming engineer districts after the city in which their headquarters was located. The name of the project soon followed suit. It was formally established by the Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold on August 16, 1942.|$|E
5|$|While timid and <b>innocuous</b> towards humans, the bluespotted ribbontail ray {{is capable}} of inflicting an excruciating wound with its venomous tail spines. Its {{attractive}} appearance and relatively small size has resulted in its being the most common stingray found in the home aquarium trade. However, it seldom fares well in captivity and very few hobbyists are able to maintain one for long. Many specimens refuse to feed in the aquarium, and even seemingly healthy individuals often inexplicably die or stop feeding. A higher degree of success has been achieved by public aquariums and a breeding project is maintained by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (for example, a total of 15 pups were born at Lisbon Oceanarium from 2011 to 2013). The bluespotted ribbontail ray is utilized as food in East Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia; it is captured intentionally or incidentally using gillnets, longlines, spears, and fence traps.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} nocturnal and {{spend most of}} the day resting {{motionless}} on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. <b>Innocuous</b> to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the <b>innocuous</b> ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an <b>innocuous,</b> but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she could think well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E
5|$|His injury {{problems}} {{started as}} early as 1980, when he was 15 years old and saw Glentoran's physio Bobby McGregor to resolve a groin strain; Whiteside said that the highly physical massage he was subjected to damaged his pelvis and robbed him of his natural pace. His lack of pace was later seen as the one weakness in his game. Six weeks into his apprenticeship, in July 1981, and an <b>innocuous</b> looking challenge by a Preston North End player in an 'A' team game saw Whiteside requiring an operation on his right knee. Had the injury occurred {{a couple of years}} later he would have been able to have pioneering keyhole surgery, which could potentially have saved his career. After a seven-month lay-off and a further operation to remove cartilage, he returned to fitness in January 1982. He had to adapt his playing style to compensate for his damaged knee and pelvis, and developed well under youth team coach Eric Harrison.|$|E
5|$|Part of Guderian's {{original}} plan {{had called for}} a feint south towards and behind the Maginot Line, to mask the intention to thrust to the channel. General Franz Halder had dropped this from Fall Gelb, but Guderian resurrected it and ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to attack across the Stonne plateau. In this <b>innocuous</b> town, a vicious two-day battle took place in which the Germans {{came face to face}} with the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, for the only time. One of these tanks, commanded by Pierre Billotte, proved invulnerable to German anti-tank fire and took 140 hits, and knocked out 13 German tanks (two PzKpfw IV and eleven PzKpfw III) and a number of anti-tank guns. It transpired that the French had concentrated their own armour there to mount another attack on the Sedan bridgeheads. The battle of Stonne took place between 15 and 17 May, and the town changed hands 17 times. Ultimately the failure of the French to hold it meant the final failure to eliminate the Sedan bridgeheads.|$|E
5|$|When {{searching for}} food, diamond {{stingrays}} may form groups {{of up to}} hundreds of individuals. It is most active at night and preys mainly on burrowing invertebrates and small bony fishes, which are extracted from the bottom via suction or digging. This species is aplacental viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their yolk supply, they are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear 14 pups every summer in estuaries; mating {{is followed by a}} ten-month period of either sperm storage or arrested embryonic development, after which the embryos rapidly mature over 23 months. The slowest-growing stingray known, this species is not resilient against fishing pressure. It is caught for food by artisanal fishers in Latin America, particularly in Mexico where {{it is one of the}} most economically important rays. This has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in Mexico by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the species as a whole is listed as Data Deficient. Though <b>innocuous</b> towards humans, the diamond stingray's long, venomous tail spine is potentially dangerous.|$|E

25|$|As V is infinite-dimensional, {{the largest}} element (unit) of Sub V is not compact. However <b>innocuous</b> it sounds, the compact unit {{assumption}} {{is essential in}} the statement of the result above, {{as demonstrated by the}} following result.|$|E
25|$|An {{allergic}} reaction to certain otherwise <b>innocuous</b> substances - allergens, typically dust and mold spores (e.g. Aspergillus spp.). It is therefore {{most common in}} horses fed on hay and bedded on straw. Endotoxins from organisms in the bedding and feedstuffs may also play a role.|$|E
25|$|The famously {{articulate}} Muhammad Ali {{launched into}} an extraordinary tirade — even by his standards — when Parkinson challenged {{him on the}} nature of his religious beliefs. This so surprised the presenter (as he'd thought it to be an <b>innocuous</b> question) that he became lost for words.|$|E
25|$|Located in an <b>innocuous</b> building, the Voluntary Artist Studio's {{objective}} is to encourage traditional and contemporary art forms among the youth of Thimphu who are keen to imbibe these art forms. The works of these young artists are also available on sale in the 'Art Shop Gallery' of the studio.|$|E
25|$|After {{conceptual}} meetings, {{the writers}} began to introduce allusions to the Dominion into episodes of Season Two. The {{intention was to}} gradually increase the audience's awareness {{that there was a}} large and pervasive polity at work behind apparently <b>innocuous</b> events in the Gamma Quadrant. The Dominion and its methods are revealed across three episodes of the season.|$|E
25|$|News {{media have}} made portrayals of {{messengers}} ranging from <b>innocuous</b> urban libertines to reckless, cliquish nihilists. The latter portrayal is often sparked by local incidents involving bike messengers in collisions with other road-users or run-ins with authority figures. These incidents also occasionally lead to proposals for, and dispute over, new ordinances and regulations on messengers and messengering.|$|E
25|$|The (spinal cord) {{dorsal horn}} neurons {{give rise to}} the spinothalamic tract (STT), which {{constitutes}} the major ascending nociceptive pathway. As a consequence of spontaneous activity arising in the periphery, STT neurons develop increased background activity, enlarged receptive fields and increased responses to afferent impulses, including normally <b>innocuous</b> tactile stimuli. This phenomenon is called central sensitization. Central sensitization is an important mechanism of persistent neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|Masks are {{typically}} tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, {{it is often}} tested by various challenge agents. Isoamyl acetate, a synthetic banana flavourant, and camphor are often used as <b>innocuous</b> challenge agents. In the military, teargases such as CN, CS, and stannic chloride in a chamber {{may be used to}} give the users confidence in the efficiency of the mask.|$|E
25|$|Command {{hallucinations}} are hallucinations in {{the form}} of commands; they can be auditory or inside of the person's mind and/or consciousness. The contents of the hallucinations can range from the <b>innocuous</b> to commands to cause harm to the self or others. Command hallucinations are often associated with schizophrenia. People experiencing command hallucinations may or may not comply with the hallucinated commands, depending on the circumstances. Compliance is more common for non-violent commands.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to recoup profits and meet demand, some American {{turquoise}} is treated or enhanced to a certain degree. These treatments include <b>innocuous</b> waxing and more controversial procedures, such as dyeing and impregnation (see Treatments). There are however, some American mines which produce materials of high enough quality that no treatment or alterations are required. Any such treatments which have been performed should be disclosed to the buyer on sale of the material.|$|E
