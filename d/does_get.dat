5|$|Paulo {{was written}} to be unlikable, {{with the hope}} he would redeem himself when his backstory was {{revealed}} in his final episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki about not being included; however, he does little to help out around the camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he <b>does</b> <b>get</b> chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which <b>does</b> <b>get</b> absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E

25|$|If a wicket falls {{near the}} end of a day's play, {{especially}} if the light is failing, or if the bowlers seem particularly confident, the captain may choose to send in a non-specialist batsman, referred to as a nightwatchman. If the nightwatchman does not get out before the end of that day's play then the specialist batsman will have been protected, and will not need to bat until the following day when conditions are likely to have improved. If the nightwatchman <b>does</b> <b>get</b> out, the cost of losing a late wicket will have been minimised, because the specialist batsman is still available to bat.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011 several lesbian UK musicians got {{together}} {{to record the}} song 'It <b>Does</b> <b>Get</b> Better' {{under the banner of}} The L Project, an anti-LGBT-bullying fundraising initiative led by Georgey Payne (of lesbian band Greymatter) and Sofia Antonia Milone (of Geekgirl). The song's aim, with accompanying video, is to raise funds for charities Stonewall and Diversity Role Models for their work addressing the issue of LGBT bullying in schools, and also to help spread the message that it gets better. The song reached number 11 in the Official UK independent singles chart in February 2012, the week it was released, and spent several days {{at the top of the}} UK iTunes and Amazon rock and folk/rock charts.|$|E
25|$|North Face: A {{well-established}} {{and classic}} route, very popular amongst mountaineers {{as a good}} introduction to alpine north-face climbing. Graded at AD+ to D-, dependent upon conditions, the route has an average angle of around 52° and the summit takes around 4 hours or more to reach from the Torino Hut. The route's difficulties are being mainly in overcoming the initial bergschrund and the moving from the lower to the upper ice field. By keeping to the right hand side of the slope climbers are able to utilise rock belays {{for much of the}} climb. Dangers involve rock and ice fall, and an early start is necessary to ensure good snow conditions as the face <b>does</b> <b>get</b> exposed to the sun later in the day.|$|E

Emma notes she placed a GPS app on Henry’s phone to find him, but Henry had the phone left behind on the bus on purpose. At the same time, Zelena uses the Apprentice's wand and creates a portal door to return Merida and the Camelot {{residents}} to their homes (and also sends the Merry Men back to the Sherwood Forest for Roland to grow up there) just in case magic <b>does</b> <b>get</b> destroyed. Unfortunately, the portal becomes too strong that it dragged Zelena, Snow, David, and Hook into {{it because of the}} magic tied to the crystal. The portal closes and vanishes in thin air.|$|E
25|$|Edward now seeks {{comfort in}} a new favourite, Spencer, and his father, decisively alienating Isabella, who takes Mortimer as her lover and travels to France with her son in search of allies. France, however, will not help the queen and refuses to give her arms, {{although}} she <b>does</b> <b>get</b> help from Sir John of Hainault. Edward, both in the play and in history, is nothing like the soldier his father was – it was during his reign that the English army was disastrously defeated at Bannockburn – and is soon outgeneralled. Edward takes refuge in Neath Abbey, but is betrayed by a mower, who emblematically carries a scythe. Both Spencers are executed, and the king himself is taken first to Kenilworth. His brother Edmund, Earl of Kent, after having initially renounced his cause, now tries to help him but realizes too late the power the young Mortimer now has. Arrested for approaching the imprisoned Edward, Edmund is taken to court, where Mortimer, Isabella, and Edward III preside. He is executed by Mortimer, who claims he {{is a threat to}} the throne, despite the pleading of Edward III.|$|E
25|$|The City of Chicago {{is looking}} into a plan for an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half {{the time it takes}} on the City's Blue Line. If an express train <b>does</b> <b>get</b> built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs and coming up with a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized.|$|E

She's only very recently been in a relationship with Romeo, and Charlie is concerned about her moving from one guy to the next too quickly." [...] Casey's brother Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) tries to advise Ruby through her troubles. Although she was not prepared to listen, Darryl gave her a new understanding, a development that is said to [...] "surprise" [...] Ruby. Questioned about Ruby's situation Anderson opined: [...] "He offers the first bit of good advice that she's heard in relation to parenting so, as much as she doesn't want to admit it, he <b>does</b> <b>get</b> through." ...|$|E
500|$|Possessing a {{love for}} Italian culture, Chase decided to make her male protagonist, Dain, a [...] "mongrel English aristocrat" [...] and half-Italian.

She explains, [...] "Having Dain be half-Italian fit so many aspects of his story: his background {{as well as his}} behavior, which <b>does</b> <b>get</b> operatic at times". Chase adds that Dain's difficult childhood stemmed from his parents' inability to accept each other's cultures, which then [...] "warps him and makes him a misfit. In a loving household, he would have grown up with a better self-image, and would have dealt with bullying at school in a different way, and thus would have grown up into someone altogether different from the man Jessica meets in that antique shop".|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, BBC Radio Scotland's head, Jeff Zycinski, {{stated that}} the BBC, and media in general, were complicit in {{undermining}} celebrities, including Winehouse. He said that public interest in the singer's lifestyle did not make her lifestyle newsworthy. Rod McKenzie, editor of the BBC Radio One programme Newsbeat, replied: [...] "If you play [...] music to a certain demographic, those same {{people want to know}} what's happening in her private life. If you don't cover it, you're insulting young licence fee payers." [...] In The Scotsman, British singer and songwriter Lily Allen was quoted to have said – [...] "I know Amy Winehouse very well.

Yes, she <b>does</b> <b>get</b> out of her mind on drugs sometimes, but she is also a very clever, intelligent, witty, funny person who can hold it together. You just don't see that side." ...|$|E

He also added that the high points of Funhouse were the four tracks produced by Max Martin.
