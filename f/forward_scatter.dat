30|$|Dielectric {{nanoparticles}} {{can demonstrate}} a strong <b>forward</b> <b>scattering</b> at visible and near-infrared wavelengths {{due to the}} interaction of optically induced electric and magnetic dipolar resonances. For a spherical nanoparticle, the first Kerker’s condition within dipole approximation can be realized, where backward scattering can reach zero. However, {{for this type of}} dielectric sphere, maximum <b>forward</b> <b>scattering</b> without backward scattering cannot be realized by modulating the refractive index and particle size of this nanoparticle. In this paper, we have demonstrated that a larger directional <b>forward</b> <b>scattering</b> than the traditional spherical nanoparticle can be obtained by using the ellipsoidal nanoparticle, due to the overlapping electric and magnetic dipolar modes. For the oblate ellipsoid with a determined refractive index, there is an optimum shape for generating the suppressed backward scattering along with the enhanced <b>forward</b> <b>scattering</b> at the resonant wavelength, where the electric and magnetic dipolar modes overlap with each other. For the prolate ellipsoid, there also exist the overlapping electric and magnetic dipolar modes at the resonant wavelength of total scattering, which have much higher <b>forward</b> <b>scattering</b> than those for both oblate ellipsoid and sphere, due to the existence of the higher multipolar modes.

50|$|In some configurations, {{bistatic}} radars may {{be designed}} to operate in a fence-like configuration, detecting targets which pass between the transmitter and receiver, with the bistatic angle near 180 degrees. This is a special case of bistatic radar, known as a <b>forward</b> <b>scatter</b> radar, after the mechanism by which the transmitted energy is scattered by the target. In <b>forward</b> <b>scatter,</b> the scattering can be modeled using Babinet's principle and is a potential countermeasure to stealth aircraft as the radar cross section (RCS) is determined solely by the silhouette of the aircraft seen by the transmitter, and is unaffected by stealth coatings or shapings. The RCS in this mode is calculated as σ=4πA²/λ², where A is the silhouette area and λ is the radar wavelength.
