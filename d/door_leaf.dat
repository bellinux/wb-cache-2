25|$|French {{doors are}} derived from an {{original}} French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels {{would be in a}} casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel {{at the bottom of the}} door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each <b>door</b> <b>leaf,</b> and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.|$|E

25|$|The rear {{sanctuary}} wall {{contains the}} glazed cross-shaped window, which has protruding metal fins attached on the interior. Below, the altar {{is located in}} the centre of a raised platform of three steps. The altar has a thick central base that inclines towards the top, clad in dark grey stones. A concrete cantilever angles out from the base to support the altar top, which is made from a terrazzo-like material incorporating pearl shell. Other items of furniture in the sanctuary include candlesticks, pulpit, lectern, and small stools and tables. The candlesticks are free-standing posts with a conical-shaped copper drip ring at the top. The timber pulpit has a protruding timber cross against a white background on the front face and sides that angle out towards the top, which has an angled book holder elevated on a tubular metal stand. The lectern is a simplified version of the pulpit but without the angled sides, and has an overhanging v-shaped top. A cupboard in the western wall of the sanctuary, the aumbry, has images of two saints on the inner face of the <b>door</b> <b>leafs,</b> made visible when opened.|$|R
50|$|The timber {{walls are}} single-skin, {{vertical}} {{tongue and groove}} timber boards, with the wall framing visible in the interior. The western elevation has three timber-framed, double-hung sashes and a single <b>leaf</b> <b>door.</b> There are two similar windows and a door on the eastern elevation.|$|R

25|$|A {{composite}} door is {{a single}} <b>leaf</b> <b>door</b> that can be solid or with glass, and is usually filled with high density foam. In the United Kingdom, {{it is common for}} composite doors to be certified to BS PAS 23/24 and be compliant with , an official UK police initiative.|$|R
2500|$|The locks {{were built}} in stone and sealed with lime. They are closed by two double <b>leaf</b> <b>doors.</b> The doors, {{originally}} timber with the fewest possible metal parts, are subject to severe moisture stress and pressure.

50|$|On the {{northern}} elevation the verandah is enclosed and a small, central, gable-roofed portico (a later addition) shelters the main entry doors. The portico roof is supported on two timber posts {{identical to those}} on the southern elevation. The double entry doors are low-waisted with glass fitted between fine mullions in the upper sections and a three-centred fixed fanlight above the transom. A narrow band of green and red glass forms a border to {{the upper half of}} each <b>door</b> <b>leaf.</b> On each side of the main doors are single banks of timber-framed windows.|$|E
50|$|The {{exhibits}} in {{the ground}} floor include amphoras of the Roman and Byzantine eras found in a shipwreck off Bafra, three Roman-era terracotta and a Byzantine-era bronze sarcophagus, a Hellenistic period relief featuring Dionysus and son, a torso statue of a priest from the Roman era, original marble inscriptions of the Seljuk and ottoman era mosques and madrasas, a wooden <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> with figures from the Late Byzantine period, double-winged wooden doors of Gökmedrese Mosque from the Seljuk era and Mehmed Pasha Mosque from the Ottoman era. There are also carpets, prayer rugs and saddlebags on display, which {{were brought to the}} region by Azerbaijanis who immigrated during the Russo-Turkish War.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} of the panels on the right <b>door</b> of the <b>leaf</b> are “The flight into Egypt”; “The Baptism in the Jordan”; “The entry into Jerusalem”; The three Maries at the Sepulchre”; and “The Resurrection.” In this panel the Saviour is shown emerging from the tomb and while still bound with the grave clothes, the Spirit of Life, {{in the form of}} a Dove, flies to His breast, and overhead the birds sing at the coming of a new Dawn.|$|R
50|$|Meriden Town Hall is a {{historic}} municipal building at 110 Main Street in the Meriden village of Plainfield, New Hampshire. It is a two story wood frame structure, built in 1895. Its main facade is three bays wide, with double <b>leaf</b> <b>doors</b> sheltered by a gable-roof porch. Its principal exterior alterations since construction are {{the addition of the}} front porch in 1901, and the addition of a handicapped access ramp aod door to one of the side window bays in 1995.|$|R
50|$|It is a 1-1/2 story timber-framed structure, {{built in}} the manner of a dogtrot house, with an {{integral}} ell extending one of the piles. It has a side gable roof, and a full-width porch across the front, supported by round columns. The front elevation is symmetrically composed of two pairs of windows flanking two centrally-placed, separate single <b>leaf</b> <b>doors,</b> each leading into a pen behind. The house was built c. 1903-05 by John Aday, a developer who platted this part of Marshall for development.|$|R
5000|$|Both the <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> (the {{swinging}} {{panel of}} the door) and the door frame are required to meet the guidelines of the testing agency which provides the product listing. The door frame includes the fire or smoke seals, door hardware, and the structure that holds the fire door assembly in place. Together, these components form an assembly, typically called a [...] "doorset" [...] which holds a numerical rating, quantified in hours of resistance to a test fire. All {{of the components of}} the fire door assembly must bear a listing agencies label (with the exception of ball-bearing hinges which meet the basic build requirements of ANSI 156.2 and NFPA 80) to ensure the components have been tested to meet the fire rating requirements.|$|E
50|$|The Forum at {{the present}} Meienbergstrasse lane hosted on its eastern side (Rütistrasse) a stone with two {{distinctive}} front pillars. The forum was accessible by a wide staircase and by a double door to the main room. The foundations are rreserved, {{as well as the}} pivots of the <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> and the locking hole. Due to its central location and the front pillars, the building may also interpreted as a temple. The front of the large square was completed by symmetrical lateral walls. To the west of the plant, there was another stone building with columns, maybe uses as a Curia or temple.Public institutions, such as the spas, are suspected at the area of the present cemetery at the St. Ursula church, and a walled temple precinct with two Gallo-Roman temples, a fire altar and two chapels on the northwest of the settlement at the Seewiese area, then the edge of the settlement on Kempratnerbucht. On the exit road (Rütistrasse-Rebacker) towards Vitudurum, a digger fire field with around 50 burials archaeologically was recorded.|$|E
50|$|Whole Garbhagudi is {{elevated}} around 3 {{feet above}} the pradakshina level. On either side of first door of Garbhagudi there is Jaya-Vijaya beautifully carved in natural black stone. Garbhagudi has 3 doors facing east looking at Holy River of Sharavati which flows within 500 mts. Garbhagudi has 3 doors. Its door frame carved from natural stone. Beautifully carved wooden doors fixed over the 3 stone door frames, and are in descending order height width, which is very well planned architecture. Wood used is Shivani for door frame and jack fruit for <b>door</b> <b>leaf.</b> First door of garbhagudi(door of sandya mandap) has Shree Yoga Narasimha on top and Shree Hanuman on left and Shree garuda on right side on door frame. The whole door is matt painted in dark chocolate colour, thus gives feel of an stone or metal. Second door which is for Antarala is covered with pure silver and Shree Astha Lakshi on top. Third door which is door of garbhagriha is also covered with pure silver with Shree Lakshmi-Narayan to top. Artists have shown their best in wooden and silver carving. Oil lamps are placed both sides of garbhagriha door which is very appealing, gives feel of ancient temple.|$|E
50|$|The {{subjects}} of the panels on the right <b>door</b> of the <b>leaf</b> are “The flight into Egypt”; “The Baptism in the Jordan”; “The entry into Jerusalem”; The three Maries at the Sepulchre”; and “The Resurrection.” In this panel the Saviour is shown emerging from the tomb and while still bound with the grave clothes, the Spirit of Life, {{in the form of}} a Dove, flies to His breast, and overhead the birds sing at the coming of a new Dawn.|$|R
25|$|The ancient Greek and Roman {{doors were}} either single doors, double doors, triple doors, sliding doors or folding doors, {{in the last}} case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In Eumachia, is a {{painting}} of a door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at Agrigentum there is a single four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a bas-relief of a temple with double <b>doors,</b> each <b>leaf</b> with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano, in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the Pantheon are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the Lateran Basilica.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} three-part in plan with a -story, white-painted brick central block and two single story weatherboarded wings {{on the north}} and south. The central block is five bays wide beneath a steeply pitched, end gable, slate roof. There are shed-roof dormers on {{the east and west}} sides of the roof, and one {{interior}} brick chimney. Windows are 12/12 sash on the first floor and 8/8 sash in the second-floor dormers. There is a glass-and-aluminum replacement entry from 1953 on the east with a single <b>leaf</b> <b>door</b> beneath a transom.|$|R
50|$|Its {{principal}} (Russell Street) elevation is a symmetrical tripartite {{composition of}} dark red face brickwork dressed with contrasting painted cement Classical details. The central main entry is articulated with rendered architraves and flanking rusticated pilasters that extend the full {{height of the}} building to meet the parapet. The entry double door leaves have been replaced with modern glazed aluminium framed leaves. Above the main entry, a cantilevered concrete balcony with large decorative console brackets and a wrought iron balustrade doubles as an entry awning. Above the balcony, a glazed arch-headed aperture with rendered architrave extends to the underside of a rendered frieze below the parapet. Its detailed glazing pattern includes multi-paned margins (some panes fitted with coloured leadlights), three sashes and a <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> (opening off the stair half landing within). The outer sections of the facade beyond the rusticated pilasters mirror each other. At ground level, walls are rendered and include a centrally placed single door and fanlight flanked by double hung sash windows. Above, smaller highlights align with {{the top of a}} heavy masonry transom. Physical evidence including decorative suspension rod brackets and cover flashings confirms the location of proposed awnings abutting these transoms. Window and fanlight sashes are original, but the door openings have been fitted with modern aluminium framed glazed leaves. Cantilevered balconies at first floor level are decorated to match the central balcony. Above the balconies, walls are finished in face brick with a rendered frieze decorated with widely spaced rosettes. French doors with fanlights are centrally placed and flanked by double hung sashes. Door leaves and upper sashes are multi paned. The elevation is crowned by a stepped rendered parapet decorated with cornices, consoles, and a central pediment.|$|E

Finite element method analysis is performed within the standards for load conditions during the operation. Stress-strain response should be the main factor to comparing results with experiment on real door. Based on acquired knowledge from the original model we can evaluate credibility of mechanical behavior of newly designed model which has lower profil tapered from the original 42 mm to 25, 4 mm. From the results of FEM analysis of the modified profile is evaluated applicability to the real operational state. At the end is quantified material and financial savings achieved by reducing the height of profile...|$|E
40|$|Aim: As {{door handles}} {{represent}} a transmission route for viruses and micro-organisms, a door {{opening and closing}} mechanism should be developed without manual operation. Method: To solve the problem, a device for opening {{the door with the}} help of a foot pedal was built into the <b>door</b> <b>leaf.</b> Results: The design enables mechanical opening of the door with a foot pedal without manual operation. Subsequently, the door closes {{with the help of a}} mechanical locking mechanism. Discussion: The foot-operated door opener constitutes an additional option to the door handle. Together with the equipment of a soft closing mechanism, it is possible to prevent noise emanating from the door latch impinging on the door frame. Using this construction, the door handle as a transmission vector is eliminated. In addition, the transport of goods held with two hands simultaneously is facilitated. Conclusion: With a foot-operated door opener instead of the traditional manual door handle, it is possible to open doors with a foot pedal. This prevents contamination of door handles with pathogens...|$|E
50|$|The {{main entry}} to the {{building}} is from Creek Street by a recently constructed ramp structure that abuts the verandah. A centrally located set of French doors form the main {{entry to the}} school however there are also two single <b>leaf</b> <b>doors</b> located {{either side of the}} main doors providing a secondary entry to the hall and separate entry to the enclosed verandah and area that was once the library. A secondary access to the hall is provided via a timber stair which adjoins the southern enclosed verandah.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} arrangement of rooms demonstrates an early layout. The rectangular core comprises three rooms, each with French doors {{opening to the}} southern (front) verandah. There is no central hallway, but there are single <b>leaf</b> <b>doors</b> opening between these rooms. The central room is the larger, with two pairs of French doors in the southern elevation and another opening into an entrance vestibule on the enclosed northern verandah. French doors also open from the eastern and western rooms to the formerly open side verandahs, which have been enclosed as sunrooms.|$|R
