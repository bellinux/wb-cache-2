Aqueous solutions with polyethyleneglycole (PEG) - 400 of boric acid and sodium perborate were chosen as boron compounds.

40|$|International audiencePredation {{can be one}} of the {{key factors}} that {{determine}} abundance in insect herbivore communities, and drive evolution of body size, and anti-predator traits, including crypsis. Population dynamics and selection pressures will depend on the identity of dominant predators in the system, and these may vary substantially among habitats. Arthropods emerge as chief predators on caterpillars in the understorey of non-montane tropical forest, whereas birds dominate elsewhere. In a tropical forest in Uganda, Africa, we evaluated marks on dummy caterpillars that differed in size, material (clay vs. dough), colourant, and plant species on which dummy caterpillars were exposed. We included live caterpillars to estimate the extent to which studies using artificial caterpillars reflect actual levels of predation. Ants and wasps were the most important <b>damagers</b> of dummy caterpillars, whereas bug and beetle damage was very rare, and no bird or small mammal damage was observed. Daily attack rates did not differ significantly from apparent mortality of live caterpillars (daily mortality =  12. 1 %), but dummy caterpillars made from dough were attacked more frequently (daily attack rate =  18. 4 %) than those from clay (daily attack rate =  6. 9 %). Caterpillars of different colour and size, and caterpillars exposed on different plant species had the same chances to be predated. This is in contrast to results from temperate area studies where birds dominate and are not affected by dummy caterpillar material, but prefer larger caterpillars. Our results are consistent with dominant predators on tropical forest caterpillars being invertebrates that are more chemically than visually oriented, so that: (1) material used for dummy caterpillars is important, (2) background matching is relatively unimportant, and (3) being large may have less of a cost. These patterns in predation might facilitate polyphagy and evolution of large body size in tropical Lepidopter...|$|R

5000|$|A {{borrower}} {{was held}} (in most juristic texts) {{to a standard}} of culpa levis in abstracto - the borrower was liable if his or her conduct fell short of the diligentia (care) of a bonus paterfamilias - a good, respected, head of the family.

In its natural habitat, P. clarkii consumes Carassius auratus, however, whether C. auratus recognizes P. clarkii as a predator is not yet clear. In laboratory experiments, we investigated whether experienced and inexperienced C. auratus recognize P. clarkii as a predatory threat and the specific sensory modality used by C. auratus to respond to chemical and visual stimuli from P. clarkii. In the chemical stimuli experiment, two kinds of chemical stimuli were used, water from a tub containing P. clarkii previously fed with C. auratus (C. auratus diet cues) and water from a tub containing unfed P. clarkii (P. clarkii cues). In the visual experiment, experienced C. auratus decreased activity, but inexperienced C. auratus avoided the predator compartment. When C. auratus diet cues were presented, both experienced and inexperienced C. auratus increased the use of shelter, decreased activity in the initial response phase. Compared with the blank treatment, experienced C. auratus responded to P. clarkii cues by decreasing activity; however, inexperienced C. auratus showed no reduction in activity. C. auratus appears to recognize P. clarkii as a predator both through visual and chemical cues. Further analysis revealed that C. auratus may recognize P. clarkii visually through the disturbances caused by P. clarkii movement and chemically by detecting conspecific alarm cues in the diet of P. clarkii. The results also indicate that experienced C. auratus can recognize P. clarkii by innate chemical cues from P. clarkii, whereas inexperienced C. auratus cannot [Current Zoology 57 (3) : 330 – 339, 2011]...|$|E

There he found an object in the ploughsoil which was subsequently identified as a Viking oval brooch of ninth- or tenth-century date. These are almost always found in pairs, and in a burial context. Peter Adams therefore returned to the site and did indeed find a second brooch. Given the rarity of these in England, this was clearly of national importance, so funding was secured for an evaluation of the findspot, to ascertain whether the brooches really did come from a burial. A grave was located, containing only fragments of skull at the west end, which had clearly been disturbed by recent ploughing, though it was still richly furnished with grave goods. The presence of the oval brooches strongly implied that this was the burial of a high-status woman. Several more artefacts of early medieval date were found in the surrounding ploughsoil by metal detecting during the evaluation. These included fragments of another oval brooch, a key, and part of a sword, suggesting that the grave had been part of a cemetery. Due to the threat of further plough <b>damager</b> an excavation to record this important site was then funded by English Heritage in the summer of 2004, as it was under immediate threat from ploughing.
