5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, and still more to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center <b>Data</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>System</b> (DCDPS).|$|E

25|$|Working {{with the}} Flight Test Center's Technical Director, Paul Bikle, he defined the basic flight test {{techniques}} {{that are still}} used by the Air Force Flight Test Center. Aiming to reduce the increasing length of time and costs required to determine {{the results of the}} Center's flight tests, they standardized all of its data acquisition methods and set up a centralized <b>Data</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>System.</b> This made it possible for test teams to analyze their test data more rapidly, and to publish their Technical Reports more quickly. He also established training and indoctrination procedures for new military and civilian flight test engineers.

500|$|SCD would consist {{primarily}} {{of a single}} autonomous battery centered on a cut-down MAR called TACMAR (TACtical MAR), along with a simplified <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>system</b> known as the Local Data Processor (LDP). This was essentially the DCDP with fewer modules installed, {{reducing the number of}} tracks it could compile and the amount of decluttering it could handle. To further reduce costs, Bell later replaced the cut-down MAR with an upgraded MSR, the [...] "Autonomous MSR". They studied a wide variety of potential deployments, starting with systems like the original Nike-X proposal with no SCDs, to deployments offering complete continental US protection with many SCD modules of various types and sizes. The deployments were arranged so that they could be built in phases, working up to complete coverage.|$|E
