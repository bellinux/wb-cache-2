Information of semantic slots or concepts that correspond to database fields is expected to <b>help</b> <b>enhancing</b> IR, but the semantic analyzer often fails or needs {{a large amount of}} training data. We propose a hybrid model which combines dedicated VSMs for concept slots with a general VSM as a backoff. The model has been evaluated in a book search task and shown to be effective and robust against ASR and SLU errors. Index Terms: spoken language understanding, voice search, vector space mode...|$|E
40|$|Gaussian beams are a {{well-known}} high-frequency wavefield approximation. A more accurate representation {{can be obtained}} by the complex eikonal equation. We propose a constructive algorithm for solving the complex eikonal equation. By re-writing the complex traveltime as background real and imaginary parts and their respective perturbations, we arrive at an update scheme that aims at solving the complex eikonal equation iteratively. The initial prior may come from the Gaussian beam approximation computed by dynamic ray tracing. Proper boundary conditions can ensure correct update directions. The result embraces complete details of the velocity model and therefore can <b>help</b> <b>enhancing</b> accuracy of Gaussianbeam migration and other related applications...|$|E

The detection of pedestrians can <b>help</b> <b>enhancing</b> safety for road users who need longer to cross the road. At the same time, it produces savings in traffic delay. A stereo vision approach is adopted: the dif-ference between two bird’s eye views of the crossing is analyzed to extract objects rising up from the road plane. Background subtraction is applied {{to get rid of}} noise due to small drifts in the calibration and lens distortion. The discrimination between pedestrians and vehicles is per-formed taking into account their direction of movement. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model in}} which agents of different species move over a complex network, are subject to reproduction and compete for resources. The complementary roles of competition and diffusion produce a variety of fixed points, whose stability depends {{on the structure of}} the underlying complex network. The survival and death of species is influenced by the network degree distribution, clustering, degree-degree correlations and community structures. We found that the invasion of all the nodes by just one species is possible only in Erdos-Renyi and regular graphs, while networks with scale [...] free degree distribution, as those observed in real social, biological and technological systems, guarantee the co-existence of different species and therefore <b>help</b> <b>enhancing</b> species diversity.

Firstly, Japanese NGOs {{would be able to}} independently carry out the small-scale aid projects that directly address the needs of local communities in aid recipient countries. These grassroots aid projects could complement the government-supervised large-scale aid projects. Secondly, the Japanese government could utilize NGOs’ staff as an alternative source of information. Finally, effective co-operation between NGOs and the government could <b>help</b> <b>enhancing</b> the transparency of Japan’s foreign aid policy. Under the current system, bureaucrats dominate the policymaking process so that it is difficult for outsiders to access the information on Japan’s ODA program. ...|$|E

30|$|Machine {{learning}} {{tools such}} as ANN has been frequently used to predict air quality and pollution levels using a set of inputs, like pollutant concentrations, meteorological data and the available traffic information (Fontes et al. 2013; Ignacio et al. 2011). Moreover, many research works have been dedicated to implementing of such computationally expensive algorithms and analysis tasks on parallel or distributed computing systems such as Hadoop (Apache.org 2014). The use of such Big data tools can <b>help</b> <b>enhancing</b> the existing information systems and improving their performance (Zhao et al. 2011).

In this article we describe the physics of interacting spin - 1 / 2 fermions in synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields which induce a Rashba spin-orbit interaction on the motion of the fermions. We show that the fermion system can evolve to a Bose-Einstein condensate of a novel boson which we call rashbon. The rashbon-rashbon interaction is shown to be independent of the interaction between the constituent fermions. We also show that spin-orbit coupling can <b>help</b> <b>enhancing</b> superfluid transition temperature of weak superfluids to the order of Fermi temperature. A non-Abelian gauge field, when used in conjunction with another potential, can generate interesting Hamiltonians such as that of a magnetic monopole...|$|E

The survey was based on a questionnaire (CAWI method) forwarded to the 2014 Orange Flag municipalities in the Marche region. The research revealed that municipalities do not take full advantage of the possibilities provided by the award mainly in terms of co-branding and stakeholders’ involvement. Even if they recognize great validity to the programme, the findings raised in this paper suggest a more efficient use of the award. In particular, a better use of co-branding policies and a wider sharing of sustainability issues are suggested...|$|E

40|$|We build a {{macroeconomic}} {{model for}} Switzerland, the Euro Area, and the USA, which drives {{the dynamics of}} several asset classes and the liabilities of a repre-sentative Swiss (defined-contributions) pension fund. This encompassing approach allows us to generate correlations between returns on assets and liabilities. We calibrate the economy using quarterly data between 1985 :Q 1 and 2013 :Q 2. Using a certainty equivalent approach, we show that a liabilities-hedging portfolio outper-forms an assets-only strategy by between 5 and 15 % per year. The main reason for such a large improvement is that the optimal assets-only portfolio is typically long in cash, whereas hedging liabilities require the pension fund to be short in cash. It follows that imposing positivity restrictions {{in the construction of}} the portfolio also results in a large cost, between 4 and 8 % per year. This estimate suggests that al-lowing pension funds to hedge their liabilities through borrowing cash and investing in a diversified bond portfolio would <b>help</b> <b>enhancing</b> global portfolio return...|$|E
