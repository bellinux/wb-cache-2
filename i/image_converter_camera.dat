40|$|Space {{environmental}} conditions are developing {{in a way}} that protection of space vehicles is becoming mandatory. Especially for manned missions space debris constitutes an increasing danger. Design and optimization of debris shields require experimental and numerical simulation techniques. At the Ernst-Mach-Institut, three high-performance two-stage light gas guns, high-speed visualization and measurement devices like <b>image</b> <b>converter</b> <b>cameras,</b> X-ray systems, drum cameras in connection with a high power Cu-vapour pulse laser, as well as dynamic stress monitoring systems are available. This equipment is employed to study penetration and perforation phenomena in bumper shields impacted by hypervelocity projectiles at velocities of up to 10 km/s. Thus, the terminal ballistic effectiveness of Micrometeoroid/Debris shield systems can be evaluated. Within ESA's COLUMBUS Meteoroid Debris Protection System Study (MDPS), optimization experiments have been performed. They resulted in a dual bumper Aluminium baseline shield system. Comparative experiments have beeen performed applying different new bumper material concepts, e. g. Kevlar and Al/Kevlar laminates.

Single irradiation by a high-power CO 2 laser {{on the surface of}} the copper high-voltage electrode produced a luminous plasma plume. This ablation plasma was used for a discharge induction by an ionization channel created by a XeCl laser. It was found that the ablation enhances the trigger and guide effect for induction of a long gap discharge. The guide length was elongated approximately twice. The ablation plasma bead reduced the 50 % sparkover voltage and the sparkover time.

The laser {{was of the}} helical pin electrode configuration with nominal 1000 -Î© resistors at the cathode, and thus operated in the TEMââ mode. The front laser window was a plane germanium mirror with 65 % reflectivity, while the back window was a spherical silicon mirror with a radius of curvature of 10 m and a reflectivity of 99. 4 %. Input energy was supplied by a 0 - 30 KV power supply utilizing a triggered. 03 Î¼F capacitor which provided the pulsing mechanism for the laser. Using a gas mixture of 88 % He, 6 % Nâ, and 6 % COâ, the peak power at 30 KV was approximately 2. 4 MW and the output energy more than. 5 J, effecting an efficiency of almost 4 %.

40|$|The {{insulation}} of {{high voltage}} conductors often employs solid insulators for many applications. In such applications, an unexpected electric flashover may occur along the insulator surface. Under conditions of high vacuum, the flashover voltage across the insulator is observed {{to be lower}} {{compared with that of}} the same electrode separation without an insulator. The reason for such an extreme reduction of flashover voltage is not well understood. Several models based on the secondary electron emission, were proposed to explain the onset of the surface flashover. The starting point and the developing velocity of the surface flashover were determined. An intensified <b>image</b> <b>converter</b> <b>camera</b> was used to observe the initial stage of electrical flashover along the insulator surface parallel to the electric field.

40|$|The X-ray {{emission}} from focused plasmas {{was observed}} with an <b>image</b> <b>converter</b> <b>camera</b> in the streak and framing modes.

The recorded bremsstrahlung emission seemed to be from a metallic plasma of copper released from the anode surface by bombardment from an intense electron beam. The intensity of emission was determined by the density of copper and the density and energy of the electron beam. The main emission recorded occurred several 100 nsec after the focus was over, which implies that the electric fields driving the beam existed for this duration. It is suggested that the fields were created by annihilation of magnetic flux for a time much longer than the focus duration...|$|E

A small scale rig employing a 50 SI test cell with viewing windows, {{as part of a}} high voltage co-axial line, enabled short rise time pulses to be applied to a non-uniform test gap. For the liquid dielectric, changes of refractive index resulting from applied voltage were rendered visible by means of a Schlieren optical system.
