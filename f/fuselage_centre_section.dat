50|$|The Condor was an all-wood glider, seating two in tandem. The wing {{was built}} around two spars and the {{planform}} was unusual {{in that the}} chord of the straight tapered inboard section increased outwards.

The wings joined a raised <b>fuselage</b> <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> and were braced by pairs of parallel lift struts from about one third span {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|With the {{completion}} of the FS-23 Hidalgo and flight testing it was found that some of the expected results were not forthcoming.Through use of the UNIVAC 1107 computer, at the Instituts für Statik und Dynamik ISD, there was found to be no possible improvement of the wing section and arrangement of the FS-23. The students then concentrated on the fuselage of a new aircraft using the wing of the FS-23 extended to 15m span, with drag reduced to a minimum by reducing the wetted area of the fuselage, as a whole, and reducing the sectional area dramatically aft of the wing. The long thin tail boom, constructed with aluminium alloy, was donated by VFW(Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke) at Speyer and attached to the tubular steel <b>fuselage</b> <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> structure.|$|E

40|$|A Blended Wing Body (BWB) {{configuration}} is {{an innovative}} aircraft concept that promises high aerodynamic efficiency compared to conventional aircraft. However, unlike conventional aircraft configurations with circular fuselage cross sections, the major structural design challenge with BWB is the wide non-circular <b>fuselage</b> <b>centre</b> <b>section,</b> {{where it has}} to withstand both internal cabin pressures and wing bending loads. Several solutions have been proposed for the structural design of the BWB centre section, such as Top Surface Panel Plate models, Multi-Bubble model and the Y-Braced Box Fuselage to minimise the weight penalty. However, they contain {{a large number of}} separated compartments which is not particularly suitable for a cargo transport that requires a large and contiguous cargo compartment to carry bulk payload. The aim of this project is to design an efficient structural configuration for an ultra-high capacity military cargo aircraft using a BWB configuration which will be able to carry up to ten M 1 A 2 Abram battle tanks (1, 200, 000 lbs) with a range of 5, 000 NM. The Columned Multi-Bubble (CMB) is analysed and compared with the conventional Multi-Bubble and Flat shell models to verify their structural performance regarding weight and deformation. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been used on CAD generated models to achieve an efficient structural configuration. The paper will introduce the objective of the project and present preliminary structural analysis results...|$|E
50|$|The {{wing of the}} H.34 was {{in three}} parts. The two outer {{sections}} had parallel, straight and unswept {{leading and trailing edges}} and straight, angled tips. They were also cut away at their inner ends, where they met a rectangular, reduced chord <b>centre</b> <b>section,</b> producing a cut-out out over the rear seat. Narrow chord ailerons filled most of the trailing edge. The wings were of mixed construction with pairs of duralumin spars and wooden ribs but the ailerons were all-metal. Pairs of parallel, rearward-leaning struts linked the lower fuselage and the outer wing spars and four vertical struts from the upper <b>fuselage</b> to the <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> formed a cabane.|$|R
2500|$|The Type O was {{a single}} bay biplane with no stagger. Both wings had two wooden spars and were fabric covered.

50|$|The thick wings {{were based}} on a pair of spruce I-section spars with spruce ribs and {{internal}} wire bracing. The inner section and interplane struts were of streamlined steel tube; ailerons were carried on upper and lower wings. The Lympne aircraft were aimed at the private owner, for whom transport and storage might be an important issue, so the Gannet's wings were hinged at the rear spar so they could be folded back along the <b>fuselage.</b> Both wing <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> trailing edges folded to permit the wing-folding; the upper section was also folded up to aid access to the cockpit. The 2 imp. gallon (9.1 litre) fuel tank was in the upper <b>centre</b> <b>section.</b>|$|R

The <b>fuselage</b> and wing <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> were joined by a pair of outward leaning cabane struts on each side. As on the D.III, the lower wing roots were carefully faired into the fuselage. There were ailerons only on the upper wings.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} the aircraft's unorthodox {{aerodynamic}} features, the Javelin had a fairly conventional structure and materials, being mainly composed of an aluminium alloy, with some use of steel edging. The fuselage was composed of four sections, the nose (containing the radar radome), the front <b>fuselage,</b> <b>centre</b> <b>fuselage</b> and rear fuselage; the nose and rear fuselage were removable for servicing and easy replacement. The engines were {{on either side of}} the <b>centre</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section,</b> the internal space in the centre containing the service bay that housed much of the aircraft's electrical, hydraulic, and avionics subsystems. The engine air intakes were placed on the forward fuselage, running directly from beneath the cockpit rearwards into the delta wing. Electricity was provided by a pair of 6,000 watt, 24-volt generators driven by the auxiliary gearbox; inverters provided AC power for equipment such as some flight instruments and the radar.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided with a rounded top, rather similar in construction {{to that of}} the Camel and using many Camel parts. The fin and horn balanced rudder together were almost circular and the tailplane was braced to the fin. The large interplane gap put the upper wing well above the <b>fuselage</b> with the <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> braced to front and rear spars by outward sloping struts from the upper longerons. [...] The pilot's cockpit was under the trailing edge, where there was a cut-out for visibility and the passenger sat in a separate cockpit under the wing. The 90 hp (67 kW) RAF 1a engine drove a four bladed, 9 ft 3 in (2.82 m) diameter propeller and was partly enclosed in a metal cowling, with the cylinder heads protruding as it was air-cooled. There was a simple single axle undercarriage and tail skid.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{construction}} was employed throughout {{the majority of}} the P.1121; using a thick lightweight alloy skin placed on top of tightly spaced frames and stringers, while steel was used for some highly stressed components. The fuselage was split into three major sections; the front fuselage contained the radome, cockpit, radio, and equipment bay, the <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> housed the engine, air intake, belly-mounted air brake, nosewheel, 2-inch rocket launching fixtures, and a total of five nylon bag fuel tanks. The rear fuselage section was occupied by the reheat pipe, final nozzle, the main undercarriage a pair of rear air brakes, and two further bag-type fuel tanks. The P.1121 was furnished with a four-spar wing, covered by a 0.3-inch thick alloy skin, which was similarly shaped to the wing of the preceding Hawker Hunter. The spars were attached to steel booms at the inboard end, which were in turn fixed onto the four main frames of the <b>centre</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section.</b> The structural box of the wing also contained an integral fuel tank, containing up to 420 gallons of fuel in addition to the 1,055 gallons held within the fuselage fuel tanks.
