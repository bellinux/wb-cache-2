The fact that solar collectors of various kinds had been in operation on a substantial scale {{for more than a}} century without providing a breakthrough in energy efficiency brought Georgescu to the conclusion that no Promethean recipe was yet around in the world in his day. Only feasible recipes for solar collectors were available, functioning like what he labelled 'parasites' with regard to the terrestrial inputs of energy for their manufacture and operation — and like any other parasite, these recipes cannot survive their host (the 'host' being the sources of the terrestrial inputs). Georgescu believed that for a worldwide solar-powered economy to be truly energy self-supporting, a Promethean kind of solar collector had yet to be invented. [...] Later, some scholars have argued that the efficiency of solar collectors has increased considerably since Georgescu made these assessments.|$|E

50|$|Crop water {{productivity}} (WP) or water use efficiency (WUE) expressed in kg/m³ is an efficiency term, expressing {{the amount of}} marketable product (e.g. kilograms of grain) {{in relation to the}} amount of <b>input</b> <b>needed</b> to produce that output (cubic meters of water). The water used for crop production is referred to as crop evapotranspiration. This is a combination of water lost by evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration by the plant, occurring simultaneously. Except by modeling, distinguishing between the two processes is difficult. Representative values of WUE for cereals at field level, expressed with evapotranspiration in the denominator, can vary between 0.10 and 4 kg/m3.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to the electric vortex mixer is the [...] "finger vortex" [...] technique in which a vortex is created manually by striking a test tube in a forward and downward motion with one's finger or thumb. This generally takes longer and often results in inadequate suspension, {{although it may be}} suitable in some cases when a vortex mixer is unavailable or the forces involved in vortexing would damage the sample, but this technique is not recommended when caustic substances are involved.

50|$|Digital {{compositing}} is {{a common}} task in image editing in which {{some or all of}} one photo is pasted into another photo. Traditionally this is done by pasting the pixel values from one image to the other. A well-trained artist can make a convincing composite using traditional techniques, but it usually requires time-consuming color correction and mask cutting to make it work. Alternatively, the pasting can be performed in the gradient domain: if the differences between pixels are pasted rather than the actual pixel values, there is sometimes much less user <b>input</b> <b>needed</b> to achieve a clean result. The following example demonstrates the use of gradient domain image processing to seamlessly paste from one image to another.Notice that both the hand and the eye shifted color slightly in the image reconstructed from the modified gradient. This happened because the solver was set to find the entire image. However, it is possible to add constraints so that only the pasted section is solved for, leaving the rest of the image unmodified. It is also worth noting that the gradient pictured above represents the derivative of only one color channel (red), and was rendered with colors representing the strength and direction of the gradient. In practice two grayscale gradient images are found per color channel, one representing the change in x and the other representing the change in y. Each color channel is solved for independently when reconstructing the final image.|$|E
