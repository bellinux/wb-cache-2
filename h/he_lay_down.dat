5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> on the battlefield {{so that she would}} have to step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E

For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many things as happened lately, and within our lifetime, these, I a young man will relate to you, I mean those after death, those after the burial of the martyr, those which happened while he remained {{in the suburbs of}} the city....|$|E
500|$|Merrick's {{death was}} ruled {{accidental}} and the certified {{cause of death}} was asphyxia, caused by the weight of his head as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down.</b> Treves, who performed an autopsy on the body, said that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck. Knowing that Merrick had always slept sitting upright out of necessity, Treves {{came to the conclusion that}} Merrick must have [...] "made the experiment", attempting to sleep lying down [...] "like other people".|$|E

500|$|In case of widows, Swaminarayan {{directed}} {{those who}} could not follow the path of chastity to remarry. For {{those who could}}, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> strict rules which included them being under the control of male members of the family. This may seem regressive, however it gave them [...] "a respected and secure place in the social order" [...] of the time. [...] Swaminarayan restricted widows [...] "to live always under the control of male members of their family and prohibited them from receiving instruction in any science from any man excepting their nearest relations." ...|$|E
500|$|Thorpe {{proved to}} be a lively and witty {{performer}} in the cut and thrust of parliamentary debates, and his presence in the House of Commons was soon noticed. In July 1962, in the wake of some disastrous Conservative by-election performances, Macmillan sacked seven cabinet ministers in what was known as the [...] "Night of the Long Knives". Thorpe's comment—"Greater love hath no man than this, that <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> his friends for his life"—was widely regarded in the press as the most apt verdict on the prime minister. Thorpe raised his political profile with effective attacks on government bureaucracy, and in the October 1964 general election was returned in North Devon with an increased majority. A year later he secured the office of Liberal Party treasurer, a significant step towards his ambition to become the next party leader.|$|E
500|$|Thorpe was a diligent MP, {{active in}} {{promoting}} local issues—a new general hospital, and a link {{road to the}} Exeter-Taunton motorway—and campaigned successfully to save the Barnstaple-to-Exeter railway line from the Beeching axe. On broader questions he {{made no secret of}} his anti-hanging, pro-immigrant, pro-Europe opinions, largely not shared by his constituents. He championed freedom from colonial and minority rule, and was an outspoken opponent of regimes he considered oppressive such as those in South Africa and the short-lived Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. [...] He was also noted for his verve and wit; when in 1962, after a series of by-election disasters, Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet, Thorpe's reported comment, an inversion of the biblical verse John 15:13, was [...] "Greater love hath no man than this, that <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> his friends for his life".|$|E

500|$|There {{was another}} {{significant}} incident {{at the bottom}} of the first climb. This involved Sérgio Paulinho (Tinkoff-Saxo): he collided with a race motorbike, causing significant cuts to his leg. Paulinho first attempted to continue riding; he was then treated by the race doctor, who put staples in his leg. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> on the road for treatment. Although he attempted to continue riding, he was forced to withdraw from the race just before the summit of the climb; he then went to hospital and received seventeen stitches. Paulinho's teammate Peter Sagan had also been hit by a motorbike on stage 8 and the team had issued a statement calling for an apology from the race organisers and measures to prevent such incidents. Following Paulinho's incident, Oleg Tinkov, the team's owner, suggested on Twitter that the team may withdraw from the race; a statement from the team after the stage said, [...] "the team will consider whether it is safe to continue racing under the current arrangements".|$|E
500|$|The WSPU {{were quick}} to {{describe}} her as a martyr, part of a campaign to identify her as such. The Suffragette newspaper marked Davison's death by issuing a copy showing a female angel with raised arms {{standing in front of}} the guard rail of a racecourse. The paper's editorial stated that [...] "Davison has proved that there are in the twentieth century people who are willing to lay down their lives for an ideal". Religious phraseology was used in the issue to describe her act, including [...] "Greater love hath no man than this, that <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> his life for his friends", which Gullickson reports as being repeated several times in subsequent discussions of the events. A year after the Derby, The Suffragette included [...] "The Price of Liberty", an essay by Davison. In it, she had written [...] "To lay down life for friends, that is glorious, selfless, inspiring! But to re-enact the tragedy of Calvary for generations yet unborn, that is the last consummate sacrifice of the Militant".|$|E
500|$|There is a {{story about}} a dragon man from the village of Pečenjevce, eastern Serbia, who saw an ala in a cloud while he was scything. He said to scythemen beside him, [...] "I am going to sleep, and you swing a scythe above me," [...] before <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> and fell asleep. A man who swung the scythe, however, {{inadvertently}} grazed him with the tip of the blade. When the dragon woke up, he told that he had been wounded by the ala he fought with, and lost a lot of blood. A dragon from the village of Bogojevac always kept with him a piece of a scythe blade or a knife. As soon as he perceived the imminent approach of bad weather, he would lie down on the ground and stick the blade above his head. It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died. At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, [...] "How tired I am!" [...] This was thought to refer to the strenuous battle he fought in the clouds.|$|E

25|$|Over {{and above}} these various papers he {{composed}} his great treatise, the Mécanique analytique.

2500|$|The Battle of the Camel {{was fought}} between Ali {{on one side}} and Aisha, Talhah and Zubayr on the other on 10 December 656. During the battle, Marwan ibn al-Hakam, who was {{fighting}} on the same side, accidentally shot Talhah in the thigh. Marwan commented, [...] "After this I will never again seek a killer of Uthman." [...] Talhah hugged his horse and galloped off the battle-field. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> using a stone as a pillow, while the auxiliaries tried to staunch the blood-flow. Whenever they stopped pressing, the bleeding resumed. In the end Talhah said, [...] "Stop it. This is an arrow sent by God." [...] He died of this injury, aged 64.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} {{and the most}} valuable of his works are on botany. Foremost among them are his: Genera Plantarum (1831-1841), in which <b>he</b> <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> {{a new system of}} classification; Grundzüge einer neuen Theorie der Pflanzenerzeugung (Foundations of a new theory of plant breeding; 1838); and Die Medicinalpflanzen der österreichischen Pharmakopöe (Medicinal plants in the Austrian pharmacopoeia; 1842).|$|R

2500|$|The band's unusual {{name was}} {{inspired}} by Cædmon, an Anglo-Saxon cow-herder and Catholic monk who lived during the 7th century. [...] Legend has it that Caedmon was afraid to sing in public {{due to a lack}} of musical talent, and shied away from occasions where he had to sing. [...] After leaving a feast one night because he was too embarrassed to sing, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> in the pasture with the cattle to sleep. An angel appeared to him in a dream, calling him to sing. After refusing, he eventually decided to sing and when he did, he sang beautiful verses that had never been heard before. His songs were in the local vernacular language at a time when all other Christian songs were in Latin. Founding band members Cliff, Danielle, and Aaron decided on the name [...] "Caedmon's Call" [...] after all three heard this story during the same week and thought it was fitting.|$|E
2500|$|One {{technique}} that he innovated was the [...] "strike in reverse" [...] (working without pay), which initiated unauthorized {{public works projects}} for the poor. This earned him his first notoriety in 1956, when he gathered some 150 unemployed men to mend a public road. The police called it obstruction; his helpers walked away; <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> {{on the road and}} was arrested. Skilfully, he drummed up publicity. Famous lawyers such as Piero Calamandrei offered to defend him for free. Famous writers, such as Ignazio Silone, Alberto Moravia, Carlo Levi, among others, protested. The Palermo court acquitted Dolci and his two dozen co-defendants of resisting and insulting the police, but sentenced them to 50 days' imprisonment (time they had already served) and a 20,000 lire (US$32) fine for [...] "having invaded ground that belonged to the government." [...] On his release he resumed the campaign for the dam on the Iato river and work would eventually start in February 1963.|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed and}} size of the {{reshuffle}} was unprecedented in British political history. The sackings were mockingly named after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives, when Adolf Hitler had many Sturmabteilung supporters of Ernst Röhm either executed or arrested. Macmillan was accused of having acted hastily and of being ungrateful in sacking his party's most loyal officials. His reputation of being calm and unflappable in a crisis was badly tarnished, and his ratings in opinion polls fell sharply. His political opponents made capital from this: Liberal MP Jeremy Thorpe, in a humorous twist on a biblical phrase, observed that [...] "Greater love hath no man than this, that <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> his friends for his life." [...] Lloyd was cheered on his next appearance in the House on 17 July, while Macmillan was faced with silence from his own benches, and jeers from the opposition. The opposition tabled a motion of censure against Macmillan, which was debated on 26 July. Macmillan also faced divisions within his own party. Conservative MP Gilbert Longden, employing a similar humorous twist on Rudyard Kipling's [...] "If—", congratulated him on keeping his head, while all around him were losing theirs. Former Prime Minister Anthony Eden and former Minister Nigel Birch also voiced their disapproval. Despite these voices of dissent, the reaction from most Conservative MPs was positive.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a curious}} thing about Englishmen," [...] Horlock reflected, [...] "especially the Englishman {{who has to}} vote. The most eloquent appeals on paper often leave him unmoved.
