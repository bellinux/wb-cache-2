This 16-bit physical header carries actual power and timing advance settings in the uplink and ordered power and timing values in the downlink. The SACCH can also be used for <b>in-call</b> delivery of SMS. It has a payload data rate of 0.2-0.4 kbit/s, depending on the channel with which it is associated. The SACCH uses 4-burst block interleaving and the same multiframe type as its host TCH or SDCCH.|$|E
50|$|Real-time {{charging}} {{came into}} existence to {{serve the needs of}} prepaid mobile phone carriers as they sought to enter market segments where the traditional subscription model was no longer applicable, Pre-paid offers required instant evaluation of both the cost and the ability to pay for a telecommunications service, followed by <b>in-call</b> decrementing of the balance. These real-time attributes began to be demanded for service offers other than pre-paid. For instance, to create a spend limit in a post-paid account the account balance must be continuously monitored to detect when the limit is reached and take the appropriate action e.g. suspend calling or send a warning SMS. Real time charging has been in place within the enterprise market for a number of years, most notably in the hospitality industry where transient guest required real time resolution of charges and payments. Enterprise markets are not centered on subscribers but as components of a broader employee or customer relationship or transaction.|$|E

Typical of such applications are real time streaming protocols which can use different coding rates. The end-systems probe the network with sample traffic to determine congestion, and decide at what rate to enter according to the fate of their “probe ” packets. During the lifetime of a connection, the procedure is repeated to reassess and possibly readjust the rate. We derive analytic models, based on diffusion limits under a natural scaling, to quantify the benefits of <b>in-call</b> probing. We then use simulation to compare the results in a number of scenarios, and show that this simple theory is remarkably accurate in predicting large-scale behaviour. The results also show that a small amount of <b>in-call</b> probing produces significant benefits to the system...|$|E
40|$|Smartphones provide {{large amounts}} of {{personal}} data, functionalities, and apps and make {{a substantial part of}} our daily communication. But during phone calls the phone cannot be used much beyond voice communication and does not offer support for synchronous collaboration. This is owed to the fact that first, despite the availability of alternatives, the phone is typically held at one’s ear; and second that the small mobile screen is less suited to be used with existing collaboration software. This paper presents a novel <b>in-call</b> collaboration system that leverages projector phones as they provide a large display that can be used while holding the phone to the ear to project an interactive interface anytime and anywhere. The system uses a desktop metaphor user interface and provides a private and a shared space, live mirroring of the shared space and user defined access rights to shared content. We evaluated the system in a comparative user study. The results of the user study highlight the general benefits of synchronous <b>in-call</b> collaboration and in particular the advantages of the projected display and our developed concepts. Our findings inform future designers of synchronous remote collaboration software for interactive surfaces. ACM Classification: H. 5. 2 [Information Interfaces an...|$|E

40|$|Issues of {{structural}} constraint and personal agency permeate the discourses of sex workers concerning their everyday practices in sex work, specifically surrounding {{their interactions with}} clients. While it appears fruitful and meaningful to respect and value the agency, experiences, and skills of sex workers, their actions remain in part constrained and contextualized by (material and symbolic) structural forces. Nonetheless, sex workers deploy agentic strategies {{in order to maximize}} their well-being within sex work. This study is based on qualitative interviews with 12 independent adult female sex workers in Ottawa and Toronto, who work in two settings (street and <b>in-call).</b> Different strategies (individual and collective) are identified and discussed, surrounding the sex worker/client interaction. Eight dimensions are specifically examined: makeup of the clientele, solicitation, contractual terms, pricing, location, boundaries, payment and bad dates. Women's reflective capacities as agents are demonstrated through their articulations of the justifications for actions surrounding their working practices...|$|E

40|$|Many {{mobile phones}} {{integrate}} {{services such as}} personal calendars. Given the social nature of the stored data, however, users often need to access such information {{as part of a}} phone conversation. In typical non-headset use, this requires users to interrupt their conversations to look at the screen. We investigate a counter-intuitive solution: to avoid the need for interruption we replace the visual interface with one based on auditory feedback. Surprisingly, this can be done without interfering with the phone conversation. We present blindSight, a prototype application that replaces the traditionally visual <b>in-call</b> menu of a mobile phone. Users interact using the phone keypad, without looking at the screen. BlindSight responds with auditory feedback. This feedback is heard only by the user, not by the person {{on the other end of}} the line. We present the results of two user studies of our prototype. The first study verifies that useful keypress accuracy can be obtained for the phone-at-ear position. The second study compares the blindSight system against a visual baseline condition and finds a preference for blindSight. ACM Classification: H 5. 2 [Information interfaces and presentation]...|$|E

40|$|The 4 G network are {{cellular}} network which provides higher bandwidth and fast speed {{but there are}} few security flaws and thus to protect the users privacy,a very well defined security support is mandatory. The attacker can launch a variety of active and passive attacks. Thus security mechanism is to be defined for call security in 4 G/LTE network. The existing schemes includes both plain-text and cryptographic key exchanges. The cryptographic key exchange schemes can effectively establish the secure communications between the two nodes and protect against the node emulation attacks. In this paper the traditional key exchange models of 4 G/LTE network and hybrid cryptographic key exchange model and the security provided by these are evaluated. The proposed model will protect the 4 G network during the initial call setup phase, periodic time based key exchange to ensure the call security and the seed exchange for the other end integrity check. The proposed model will use a pre-shared key group to ensure the security during the call setup phase and will use the random table based non-predictive key exchange model {{for the purpose of}} <b>in-call</b> security assurance and receiver integrity check by the caller.

40|$|A Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network {{based on}} ATM {{promises}} communication {{at higher rates}} and with greater flexibility than current circuit or packet switched networks. However the objective of carrying bursty and variable rate traffic and maintaining both high utilisations and an acceptable quality of service presents difficult traffic control issues. This thesis attempts {{to deal with these}} problems in a systematic and unified fashion. Understanding and predicting the behaviour of statistically multiplexed traffic is identified as a fundamental concern. A state dependent discrete process (SDDP) is introduced as a means for representing both single sources and aggregated traffic streams. Exact steady state solution techniques are described for queues and multiplexers fed by such processes. Further analysis yields information about the temporal behaviour of these queues and their loss characteristics, and leads to several queueing approximation techniques. Using these solution methods the performance of an ATM multiplexer is investigated. In particular the effects of source traffic parameters on attainable utilisation for a given long term loss constraint are evaluated. Performance is also examined in terms of overload duration and intensity statistics, and in terms of cell delay variation. Peak-to-link ratio and burstiness are identified as key parameters affecting utilisation and resource allocation. Temporal connection characterisitics such as burst length are found to have most impact on overload durations. Drawing on these results the efficacy of preventative control schemes based upon a traffic contract is examined. The design of peak rate enforcers and in particular the trade-off between tolerance of cell delay variation and enforcement accuracy is investigated. The difficulties associated with estimating and enforcing mean rate are examined, and identified as a key weakness in a purely preventative control system. To alleviate these difficulties a range of additional traffic controls are considered. The implementation of real time connection admission based on the zero buffer and virtual bandwidth type methods and the extension of these methods to environments with cell loss priority are discussed. The use of virtual paths for resource management and QOS control are explored. A number of potential resource management strategies are identified and compared on the basis of ideal performance limits and implementation complexity. A priority based scheme is found to give best network utilisation but it would be complex to implement. A three layered scheme based on policed virtual paths is found to be very attractive from an implementation point of view. As a result of this comparison a new hybrid resource management scheme is suggested. Overall the thesis concludes that a traffic control system based on an enforceable traffic contract for peak and average rates can offer guaranteed quality of service (long term cell loss probability) assuming burst scale independence between sources, while obtaining close to optimal statistical gains. However there are two major difficulties with such a scheme: • it is difficult to predict average rate, and • statistical gains are very limited for traffic with a peak-to-link ratio greater than 1 / 10. The first difficulty may be addressed by introducing new traffic controls such as <b>in-call</b> parameter renegotiation, traffic shaping and callpadding, and the second perhaps by intelligent multiplexing which takes advantage of the fact the some traffic may be scheduled rather than relying on its statistical nature...|$|E
