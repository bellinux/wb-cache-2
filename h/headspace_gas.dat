The presence of TMA was variable (12 positives from 104 cultures) and dependent upon both the inoculum source (environmental sample) and enrichment culture conditions. Positives for TMA formation were obtained with variable frequency for {{four of the}} six soils tested and for three types of enrichment culture, designed to encourage growth of nitrate-reducing, methane-producing or fermentative bacteria. The identity of the volatile antimony compound produced {{in each of the three}} types of enrichment culture was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-atomic absorption spectroscopy.

We measured molecular and stable isotope compositions of volatiles bound in the <b>gas</b> hydrates and <b>headspace</b> <b>gases</b> obtained from sediments to clarify how the minor components of hydrocarbons affects to gas hydrate crystals. The hydrate-bound hydrocarbons at Umitaka Spur (southwestern Joetsu Basin) primarily consisted of thermogenic methane, whereas those at Joetsu Knoll (northwestern Joetsu Basin, about 15 km from Umitaka Spur) contained both thermogenic methane and a mixture of thermogenic and microbial methane. The depth concentration profiles of methane, ethane, propane, CO 2, and H 2 S in the sediments from the Joetsu Basin area showed shallow sulfate–methane interface (SMI) and high microbial methane production beneath the SMI depth. Relatively high concentrations of propane and neopentane (2, 2 -dimethylpropane) were detected in the <b>headspace</b> <b>gases</b> of the hydrate-bearing sediment cores obtained at Umitaka Spur and Joetsu Knoll. Propane and neopentane cannot be encaged in the structure I hydrate; therefore, they were probably excluded from the hydrate crystals during the structure I formation process and thus remained in the sediment and/or released from the small amounts of structure II hydrate that can host such large gas molecules. The lower concentrations of ethane and propane in the sediment, high δ 13 C of propane and isobutane, and below-detection normal butane and normal pentane at Umitaka Spur and Joetsu Knoll suggest biodegradation in the sediment layers...|$|R
40|$|The Chemical and Hydrogen Technology Section (CHT) of the Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) has {{conducted}} {{a series of}} gas generation tests in support of the revision of the safety analysis report for packaging (SARP) for the 9975 container, developed at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The Packaging and Transportation Group of SRTC is coordinating the revision to this SARP. A Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan directing this work was issued by CHT in February 1999. Initially, the primary interest in this testing was hydrogen generation. From these ``gas generation tests can be tracked in real-time by measuring the pressure of a sealed container of the materials being studied. Because multiple gas phase reactions are produced in the radiation field of the sample, material pressure measurements do not necessarily define the quantity of H{sub 2 } generated. However, the change in total molecules of gas can be calculated using the ideal gas law from the pressure measurement, known container volume and sample temperature. A measurement of the actual <b>headspace</b> <b>gases</b> must be completed to calculate the H{sub 2 } generation rate for a particular sample. '' As the results from these tests were reviewed, however, questions arose regarding the oxygen in the <b>headspace</b> <b>gases.</b> Specifically, do the data from some tests indicate that oxygen was generated for those tests? And do the data for other tests indicate that the oxygen was depleted for them? A statistical analysis of the oxygen data derived from these tests is provided in this report to help answer these questions...|$|R
5000|$|Highly soluble VOCs, such as MtBE, diethyl ether, and tetrahydrofuran, are {{evidence}} of leachate effects, {{since they are}} too water-soluble to migrate in landfill gas. The presence of highly soluble semi-volatile organic compounds, such as phenols, are also consistent with leachate effects on the sample. Elevated concentrations of dissolved [...] {{have been shown to}} be a symptom of landfill gas effects—this is because not all of the [...] in landfill gas reacts immediately with aquifer minerals, while such reactions are complete in leachate due to the presence of soils as daily cover in the waste. To assess whether VOCs are partitioning into groundwater in a specific location, such as a monitoring well, the <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> and dissolved VOC concentrations can be compared. If the Henry's Law constant multiplied by the water concentration is significantly less than the measured gas concentration, the data are consistent with VOCs partitioning from landfill gas into the groundwater.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Headspace</b> <b>Gas</b> Chromatography uses <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> {{injected}} {{directly onto}} a gas chromatographic column. Chemists often {{use the phrase}} “standard temperature and pressure or STP” to convey that they are working at a temperature of 25 °C and one atmosphere of pressure. There are three states of matter under these conditions: solids, liquids and gases. Although all three are distinct states both solids and gases can dissolve (or disperse) in liquids. The most commonly occurring liquid in the biosphere is water. All components of the atmosphere are capable of dissolving in water to some degree. The bulk of the stable natural components of the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, gaseous water, argon and other trace gases. [...] Materials that exist primarily in the gas phase at STP {{are referred to as}} “volatile." [...] Many natural and man-made (anthropogenic) materials are stable in two states at STP, earning them the title “semi-volatile.” A naturally occurring volatile that is sometimes found in aqueous solution is methane, water itself is semi-volatile. Man-made or anthropogenic chemicals also occur in these classes. Examples of volatile anthropogenic chemicals include the refrigerants chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Semivolatile anthropogenics can exist as mixtures, such as petroleum distillates or as pure chemicals like trichloroethylene (TCE). There is a need to analyze the dissolved gas content of aqueous solutions. Dissolved gases can directly interact with aquatic organisms or can volatilize from solution (the latter described by Henry’s Law). These processes can result in exposure that, depending {{on the nature of the}} dissolved material, can have negative health effects. There is natural occurrence of various dissolved gases in groundwater and can be a measure of health for lakes, streams and rivers. Dissolved gases also occur as a result of human contamination from fuel and chlorinated spill sites. This method can be used to determine if there is natural biodegradation processes occurring in contaminated aquifers. For example, fuel hydrocarbons will break down into methane. Chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene, break down into ethene and chloride. Detecting these compounds can determine if biodegradation processes are occurring and possibly at what rate. [...] Natural gas extracted from the earth also contains many low molecular weight hydrocarbon compounds such as methane, ethane, propane and butane. For example, methane has been found in many water wells in West Virginia.|$|E
50|$|A {{sample of}} water is {{collected}} {{in the field in}} a vial without headspace and capped with a Teflon septum or crimp top to minimize the escape of volatile gases. It is beneficial to store the bottles upside down to further minimize loss of analytes. Before analysis begins, the sample is brought to room temperature and temperature is recorded. In the laboratory, a headspace is created by displacing water with high purity helium. The bottle is then shaken upside down for a minimum of five minutes in order to equilibrate the dissolved gases into the headspace. It’s {{important to note that the}} bottle must be kept upside down for the remainder of analysis if manually injected. A known volume of <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> is then injected onto a gas chromatographic column. An automated process can also be utilized. Individual components (gases) are separated and detected by either a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a flame ionization detector (FID) or an electron capture detector (ECD). Using the known temperature of the sample, the bottle volume, the concentrations of gas in the headspace (as determined by GC), and Henry’s law constant, the concentration of the original water sample is calculated.|$|E

5000|$|A cornelius keg is a {{stainless}} steel cylinder which can hold a maximum of 130 PSI. There are three openings in the keg: a large central hole which, by its design, can only be opened when the keg is not pressurized, and two ports with integral poppet valves which open when a hose with an appropriate fitting is attached to them. The central opening is used for filling and cleaning the keg, and {{is large enough to}} permit reaching inside for hand scrubbing. The two ports are used to dispense the beverage, one for [...] "gas in", and the other for [...] "liquid out". The separate metal lid for the central opening provides a clamp mechanism that closes and seals the lid against the keg with an large rubber O-ring. The lid also provides a pressure relief valve that is typically identified by a circular pull-ring (like a key ring). The relief valve can be manually opened to release the pressure in the keg; {{in the event of an}} unsafe overpressure in the keg, the relief valve automatically opens to avoid the hazard of bursting the cylinder. Two metal tubes are attached to the ports on the inside of the keg. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has a short tube, not reaching the fluid. The [...] "liquid out" [...] port has a long tube (a [...] "dip tube") which reaches to the bottom of the keg. <b>Headspace</b> <b>gas</b> pressure (usually carbon dioxide and sometimes nitrogen forced into the [...] "gas in" [...] port) pushes the drink from the bottom of the keg, up the tube, and then out of the [...] "liquid out" [...] port connected to a tap or other dispensing device.|$|E
40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Hazardous Waste Facility Permit (HWFP) {{limits the}} {{allowable}} emissions of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) from contact handled (CH) transuranic (TRU) waste. The environmental Performance standard within the HWFP, Module IV, Table IV. D. 1, prescribes the allowed VOC emissions from the waste to ensure protection of {{human health and the}} environment. Compliance with the performance standard to ensure control of VOC emissions is based on VOC concentrations and monitoring in the underground. One of the mechanisms used to ensure compliance with the emissions standards is measuring the VOC concentration in the <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> of waste containers prior to disposal. <b>Headspace</b> <b>gas</b> sampling and analysis is the waste characterization activity used to determine the concentration of VOCs in the headspace of waste containers. In addition to being used to demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards of Module IV, Table IV. D. 1, the results of the <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> sampling and analysis are used to confirm the hazardous wastes identified in the acceptable knowledge (AK) process. <b>Headspace</b> <b>gas</b> sampling and analysis has been an ongoing part of the CH TRU waste characterization program and therefore data are now available concerning its use and applicability. The information from approved Waste Stream Profile Forms (WSPFs) and the <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> sampling and analysis results for over 16, 000 containers of CH TRU waste were considered as part of this study. The <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> sampling and analysis results are based on data from the WIPP Waste Information System (WWIS).

The evaluation shows that the reliability of using the results of <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> sampling and analysis to confirm AK information can be grouped by mixed and non-mixed waste streams. In general, for mixed waste streams due to VOCs (i. e., carrying VOC-related hazardous waste numbers), there is no reliable comparison that can be made for the detection of a particular target analyte and its associated hazardous waste number(s) based on the AK information on a compound by compound basis.

These tests were performed to determine what effect elevated temperatures {{would have on the}} neptunium dioxide in comparison to neptunium dioxide tested at ambient temperature. The <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> compositions following storage at elevated temperatures associated with normal conditions of transport (NCT) have been measured. These test results show an increase in hydrogen generation rate at elevated temperature and significant removal of oxygen from the <b>headspace</b> <b>gas.</b> The elevated temperature gas generation tests described in this report involved heating small test vessels containing neptunium dioxide and measuring the <b>headspace</b> <b>gas</b> pressure and composition {{at the end of the}} test period.

40|$|A {{microbial}} {{basis for}} bioreductive generation of phosphine is proposed, which could account {{at least in}} part for the presence of this toxic gas in natural anaerobic environments and in sewage and landfill gases. Phosphine generation under anaerobic growth conditions was dependent upon both the culture inoculum source (animal faeces) and enrichment culture conditions. Phosphine was detected in <b>headspace</b> <b>gases</b> from mixed cultures under conditions promoting fermentative growth of mixed acid and butyric acid bacteria, either in {{the presence or absence of}} methane generation. Monoseptic cultures of certain mixed acid fermenters (Escherichia coli, Salmonella gallinarum, and Salmonella arizonae) and solvent fermenters (Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium acetobutyricum and Clostridium cochliarium) also generated phosphine. Such fermentative bacteria participate in the multi-stage process of methanogenesis in nature.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the coal-bed methane {{potential}} of the Zonguldak basin have indicated that the gases are thermogenic and sourced by the coal-bearing Carboniferous units. In this earlier work, the origin of coal-bed gas was only defined according to the molecular composition of gases and to organic geochemical properties of the respective source rocks, since data on isotopic composition of gases were not available. Furthermore, in the western Black Sea region there also exist other source rocks, which {{may have contributed to}} the coal-bed gas accumulations. The aim of this study is to determine the origin of coal-bed gas and to try a gas-source rock correlation. For this purpose, the molecular and isotopic compositions of 13 <b>headspace</b> <b>gases</b> from coals and adjacent sediments of two wells in the Amasra region have been analyzed. Total organic carbon (TOC) measurements and Rock-Eval pyrolysis were performed in order to characterize the respective source rocks. Coals and sediments are bearing humic type organic matter, which have hydrogen indices (HI) of up to 300 mgHC/gTOC, indicating a certain content of liptinitic material. The stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13) C) of the kerogen vary from - 23. 1 to - 27. 7 parts per thousand. Air-free calculated gases contain hydrocarbons up to C- 5, carbon dioxide (98 %). The stable carbon isotope ratios of methane, ethane and propane are defined as delta(13) C(1) : - 51. 1 to - 48. 3 parts per thousand, delta(13) C(2) : - 37. 9 to - 25. 3 parts per thousand, delta(13) C(3) : - 26. 0 to - 19. 2 parts per thousand, respectively. The deltaD(1) values of methane range from - 190 to - 178 parts per thousand. According to its isotopic composition, methane is a mixture, partly generated bacterially, partly thermogenic. Molecular and isotopic composition of the gases and organic geochemical properties of possible source rocks indicate that the thermogenic gas generation took place in coals and organic rich shales of the Westphalian-A Kozlu formation. The bacterial input can be related to a primary bacterial methane generation during Carboniferous and/or to a recent secondary bacterial methane generation. However, some peculiarities of respective isotope values of <b>headspace</b> <b>gases</b> can also be related to the desorption process, which took place by sampling. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
