40|$|Welcome to Salt Lake City! It is a <b>great</b> {{pleasure}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> {{attend the}} first edition of The International Conference on Image Formation in X-ray Computed Tomography, also nicknamed as The CT meeting. The idea for this meeting came two years ago, from a wish I formulated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a venue where CT scientists could meet together to discuss in depth all aspects that impact the image formation process in CT. These aspects include dose evaluation and dose reduction strategies, non-linearity effects and compensation schemes for these effects, image reconstruction algorithms, spectral decomposition, dynamic effects, geometrical calibration, phase-contrast physics, and image quality assessment. Both medical imaging and non-destructive testing applications are of interest, along with emerging breast cone-beam tomography techniques, and the attractive micro- and nano-CT technology. To allow for in-depth discussion between the attendees, oral presentations have been allocated a significant time. Also, comfortable poster sessions have been planned, and shared meals have been organized in a quiet environment. Such a meeting could not be a success without scientific submissions. I am grateful to all attendees who submitted their work for presentation at this conference. The 4 -page format for abstract submission is demanding, but also a <b>great</b> way <b>to</b> guarantee high quality. Thank you for complying with this format. I was delighted by the quality and merit of the submissions...|$|R
