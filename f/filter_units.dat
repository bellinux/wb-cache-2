40|$|Abstract—In {{multimedia}} stream filtering scenario, there usually exist many filtering {{rules that}} specify the filtering objectives and many <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> that estimate the filtering rules. A filtering rule may connect to several different <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> and a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> may connect to several different filtering rules. An open problem {{in such a}} filtering scenario is how to order the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> in an optimal sequence so as to decrease the filtering cost. Existing methods {{are based on a}} greedy strategy which orders the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> according to three factors of the <b>filtering</b> <b>units,</b> i. e., the selectivity, popularity, and cost. Although all these methods reported good results, there is still one important problem that hasn’t been addressed yet. The selectivity factor is set empirically, which is unable to adaptively adjust with stream passing by. Under these observations, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive ordering framework (AOF) which executes an adaptive ordering strategy. In AOF, all the temporal filtering results are preserved in each sliding window. Accordingly, the selectivity can adjust automatically and thus all the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> can be ordered with respect to the adapted selectivity. Experiments on both synthetic and real life multimedia streams demonstrate that our AOF method outperforms other simple filtering methods.

50|$|The filter is {{assessed}} {{by the size of}} the drum or filter area and its possible output. Typically, the output is in the units of pounds per hour of dry solids per square foot of filter area. The size of the auxiliary parts depends on the area of the filter and the type of usage. Rotary vacuum filters are flexible in handling variety of materials therefore the estimated solids yield from 5 to 200 pounds per hour per square foot. For pre coat discharge, the solid output is approximately 2 to 40 gallons per hour per square foot.5Filtration efficiencies can also be improved in terms dryness of filter cake by significantly preventing filtrate liquid from getting stuck in the filter drum during filtration phase. Usage of multiple filters for example, running 3 <b>filter</b> <b>units</b> instead of 2 units yields a thicker cake hence, producing a clearer filtrate.

Additionally, when less than 20 filters are installed in a room, a fan- powered HEPA, FFU is generally considered to be less expensive than a more conventional ducted supply system. When a microenvironment of clean air is required, FFUs can be used to construct enclosed work spaces, or laminar flow cabinets.
