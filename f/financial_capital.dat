40|$|Unexpected {{changes in}} cash flow {{have started to}} occur more {{frequently}} after the <b>financial</b> crisis. The <b>capital</b> structures of companies have also changed, and financial flexibility as well as flexible asset management have therefore become more important. This thesis aims at presenting <b>financial</b> working <b>capital</b> management, a part of flexible asset management, as a possibility to gain financial flexibility and survive the changes. This thesis operates in the interface of corporate finance, strategic management and management accounting, and it has two main objectives: to examine <b>financial</b> working <b>capital</b> management and to develop measures of <b>financial</b> working <b>capital.</b> The research in this thesis has been conducted using archival research and design science. Qualitative comparative analysis and model building are used to formulate tools and strategies for <b>financial</b> working <b>capital</b> management. The tools are tested with simulations, case studies and statistical analysis. The empirical data is collected from companies listed in the Helsinki Stock Exchange. The results of this thesis indicate that there are several possible <b>financial</b> working <b>capital</b> management strategies. FOCAL matrix is created in the thesis {{to assist in the}} selection of a strategy. The results also imply that profitability can be improved by reducing <b>financial</b> working <b>capital,</b> which creates a need to change the <b>financial</b> working <b>capital</b> management strategy. <b>Financial</b> flow cycle, and its modification, is developed in this thesis to measure <b>financial</b> working <b>capital.</b> <b>Financial</b> working <b>capital</b> as a concept is presented in this thesis with an orientation towards the management view. New dimensions have also been produced to financial management and working capital management, while providing a holistic approach to financial flexibility. <b>Financial</b> working <b>capital</b> management strategies are presented to managers and practical tools are provided for decision-making...|$|R

40|$|We study whether {{capital flows}} affect {{the degree of}} credit crunch faced by a country''s {{manufacturing}} firms during the 2007 - 09 crisis. Examining 3823 firms in 24 emerging countries, {{we find that the}} decline in stock prices was more severe for firms that are intrinsically more dependent on external finance for working capital. The volume of capital flows has no significant effect on the severity of the credit crunch. However, the composition of capital flows matters: pre-crisis exposure to non-FDI capital inflows worsens the credit crunch, while exposure to FDI alleviates the liquidity constraint.

Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs.|$|E

Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with his own eyes.

5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign <b>financial</b> <b>capital,</b> which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international flows of <b>financial</b> <b>capital</b> for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} model of {{contagion}} where countries borrow or lend for consumption smoothing at the market interest rate or a lower IMF rate. Highly indebted countries hit by large negative shocks to output will default. The resulting reduction in loanable funds raises interest rates, increases the vulnerability of other indebted countries, and can generate further rounds of defaults. In this environment the IMF can limit default and internalize the externality generated by contagion through its lending with conditionality. We characterize the IMF''s optimal lending decision in mitigating the loss in world consumption.

However, this relationship has evolved over time. While growing financial integration {{with the rest of}} the world has increased access to foreign private capital, the relationship between foreign capital and domestic investment has weakened, reflecting changes in the composition of inflows, offsetting outflows, and increased foreign-currency reserve requirements. In contrast, better policies have not only brought in more capital but also, especially for foreign direct investment, have tended to strengthen the relationship between foreign capital and domestic investment.
