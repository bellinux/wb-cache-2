Whether the grafting and subsequent reinnervation of the superior colliculus (SC) is possible in distal axotomy in the brain {{is a question of}} clinical relevance. We have deafferented the SC of adult hamsters at its brachium thus axotomizing the retinal ganglion cell axons rostral to its synaptic contact with the SC neurons. After unilateral brachium transection, a short segment of the autologous sciatic nerve was grafted to bridge the lesioned site to the SC (n = 28). As controls the brachium was transected and left ungrafted (n = 12). Functional restoration was examined 3 to 75 weeks later in grafted (n = 16) and control (n = 6) animals by recording visual evoked responses from the collicular cells. Prior to recording the grafts were visually evaluated and categorized into successfully (n = 8) and unsuccessfully (n = 8) grafted groups. To <b>diffuse</b> <b>flash</b> stimuli applied to the contralateral eye, visual evoked field potentials were recorded from all successfully grafted, but not in unsuccessfully grafted (with the exception of one animal) nor control animals. Unitary spike responses to <b>diffuse</b> <b>flash</b> stimuli were recorded exclusively from three successfully grafted animals. Morphological reinnervation was examined in the remaining grafted (n = 12) and control (n = 7) animals by anterogradely labeling the regenerating retinal axons with WGA-HRP. Axons in the grafts and their terminals in the superficial layers of the SC were clearly labeled in 8 of the grafted and none of the controls. From these results we conclude that the brachium of the SC is conducive to axonal regeneration and the peripheral nerve graft is indeed effective in restoring distally axotomized visual pathway in adult mammals. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The VERIS multifocal system was used to record monocular VEP. Standard 2 -ring, 3 -ring, 5 -ring and 7 -ring VERIS pattern stimuli were employed with a cardboard circular aperture used to blank the stimulus monitor to a 9 -cm diameter field. The results for four subjects were recorded. The first order kernel responses showed a significant increase in amplitude with total contour length. In comparison, the amplitudes of the first and second slices of the second order kernel did not increase with contour length.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{leading edge}} of the {{response}} ofLimulus ventral photoreceptors to brief flashes was investigated using a voltage clamp. The {{leading edge of}} responses increases linearly with flash intensity when dim flashes produce less than one photoisomerization per square micron of cell surface. Brighter flashes accelerate the initial portion of the response, resulting in a fourth-power relationship between the magnitude of the response at brief times after the flash and the flash intensity. The onset of this nonlinearity with increasing flash intensity is determined by the local density of photoisomerizations within the receptor. Responses to bright 10 - 15 -iAm-diam spots therefore rise faster than responses to <b>diffuse</b> <b>flashes</b> producing the same number of photoisomerizations within the receptor. Background illumination shortens the response latency and suppresses the initial nonlinearity. These phenomena can be explained by a model of transduction in which light activates two parallel cascades of reactions. Particles released by the first of these cascades open ionic channels, while the second produces an agent that accelerates the rate of production of particles by the first. Injection of the calcium buffer EGTA slows the initial portion of the response to bright flashes and suppresses its nonlinearity, which suggests that the accelerating agent released by the second cascade is calcium...|$|R

Visual responses in the tectum are enhanced; those in the cortex are depressed. Tectal responses that have been nearly abolished by increasing background illumination are partially restored by the conditioning cerebellar train. Auditory brainstem responses (short latency, less than 10 ms, far-field waves I to III, attributed to medullary levels) are depressed; wave IV from the inferior colliculus is relatively enhanced at short intervals and is depressed at longer intervals.

The alerting flash evoked distinct excitatory cell responses and field potentials in the occipital cortex; those two orders of phenomena were broadly {{related to each other}} in temporal terms. By contrast, most cells in the inferotemporal region were inhibited by the flash, although the local evoked field potential had a configuration {{similar to that of the}} occipital potential. In each region, the sample stimuli elicited excitatory unit responses which summed to a unimodal distribution with an initial component roughly corresponding in time course to the local field potential. Although the shortest response latencies were found in occipital cortex, considerable temporal overlap of the sample-related activities in the two cortices was observed. The finding that most inferotemporal cells, unlike occipital cells, treated only the sample with excitatory response indicates that the inferotemporal cortex is selectively attuned to visual detail. However, the largely simultaneous activation of both cortical regions following the onset of the sample suggests that discriminative visual information is processed by hierarchic interactions of the two cortices through their reciprocal connections...|$|R

Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching of cyanoaromatic and ionic sensitizers by arylalkenes demonstrates that singlet quenching occurs predominantly by a static process. <b>Diffuse</b> reflectance <b>flash</b> photolysis studies indicate that quenching of singlet cyanoaromatic sensitizers by trans-anethole and 4 -vinylanisole occurs via {{electron transfer}} and yields relatively long-lived radical cations. Signals due to trapped electrons (Na 43 +) are also observed, suggesting that photoionization of the cyanoaromatic sensitizer occurs in competition with electron transfer quenching of the excited singlet by the alkene. The long lifetimes of the radical cations indicate the utility of the zeolite environment for controlling the energy-wasting back electron transfer step. Photosensitized electron transfer reactions of five alkenes (trans-anethole, 4 -vinylanisole, phenyl vinyl ether, and two indenes), using both ionic and cyanoaromatic sensitizers, lead to predominantly dimeric cyclobutane products as in solution. However, the dimer ratios are substantially different with the cis/syn cyclobutanes formed preferentially in the zeolite reactions, presumably as a result of constraints imposed by the restricted space of the zeolite supercage. In fact the zeolite environment is more important in determining the geometry of the dimeric products than is the method (direct or sensitized photocycloaddition vs radical ion initiation) for their generation.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{inventory of}} the constituent pieces in cerebral cortex is considered essential to understand the principles underlying cortical signal processing. Specifically, the search for pyramidal neuron subtypes is partly motivated by the hypothesis that a subtype-specific division of labor could create a rich substrate for computation. On the other hand, the extreme integration of individual neurons into the collective cortical circuit promotes the hypothesis that cellular individuality represents a smaller computational role {{within the context of}} the larger network. These competing hypotheses raise the important question to what extent the computational function of a neuron is determined by its individual type or by its circuit connections. We created electrophysiological profiles from pyramidal neurons within the sole cellular layer of turtle visual cortex by measuring responses to current injection using whole-cell recordings. A blind clustering algorithm applied to these data revealed the presence of two principle types of pyramidal neurons.

Triplet sensitization with 2 -acetonaphthone gave a photostationary state consisting of 63 % cis and 37 % trans isomers. These numbers are similar to the ones obtained in solution. Thus, the presence of cations and the confined space within the zeolite have very little influence on the overall chemistry during direct and triplet sensitization. However, upon electron transfer sensitization with N-methylacridinium (NMA) as the sensitizer within NaY, isomerization from cis-stilbene radical cation to trans-stilbene occurs and the recombination of radical ions results in triplet stilbene. Prolonged irradiation gave a photostationary state (65 % cis and 35 % trans) similar to triplet sensitization. This behavior is unique to the zeolite and does not take place in solution. Steady state fluorescence measurements showed that the majority of stilbene molecules are close to the N-methylacridinium sensitizer. <b>Diffuse</b> reflectance <b>flash</b> photolysis studies established that independent of the isomer being sensitized only trans radical cation is formed.

Our work in this field has helped to elucidate the mechanism of yellowing of lignin mainly through the use of lignin model compounds such as α-guaiacoxyacetoveratrone (α-GAV) and related compounds. Our studies show that the formation of radicals from the excited singlet state is much more important than what is expected from aromatic ketones, and under certain conditions, the singlet pathway is the only degradative one. The results obtained in studies of crystalline α-GAV show that efficient excited state deactivation pathways can be created by intermolecular interactions, leading to very good photostability of the molecule. Excited state transients detectable in solution are not present in the crystalline form. In contrast, α-(p-methoxyphenoxy) -p-methoxy acetophenone (VII), does produce triplet state absorption on sufficiently long time scale to be detected. This difference is attributed to a different packing structure of crystalline VII which does not allow for efficient excited state deactivation as in the case of α-GAV. Pulse radiolysis studies were carried out on VII, giving us insight into the fragmentation of the ketyl radical derived from this molecule. These results demonstrate that this ketyl radical is extremely short-lived and any strategy involving trapping of these types of radicals in the paper environment will most probably prove to be unsuccessful. The properties of the p-methoxyphenacyl radical (IX) were studied and show some interesting aspects of reactivity (acting as a carbon-centred radical), whereas the spectroscopic properties show a long-wavelength absorption which shows some oxygen-centred radical characteristics. These are supported by molecular modeling calculations. This thesis presents the first use of <b>diffuse</b> reflectance laser <b>flash</b> photolysis to directly monitor photochemically generated transients in living cell suspensions.
