50|$|The first {{commercial}} <b>electric</b> <b>gate</b> systems were hydraulic and designed for reliability {{and ease of}} use. The cost of the hydraulic systems however meant that other companies started producing more affordable electromechanical alternatives. Hydraulic motors are the preferred choice on large and heavy gates as they can generate high levels of torque, electromechanical systems designed for lower usage domestic installations {{because they can be}} produced more cost effectively. A number of larger manufacturers now produce both hydraulic and electromechanical systems providing unbiased choice for customers.|$|E
50|$|Puett's {{gate was}} first used at Exhibition Park in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1939, though the {{management}} of Bay Meadows Racetrack in San Mateo, California claims that their track {{was the first to}} use Puett's gate. By the end of 1940, virtually all major race tracks in the United States used Puett gates. Clay Puett began another company, True Center Gate, in 1958 based in Phoenix, Arizona. True Center and Puett's original company (first known as Puett <b>Electric</b> <b>Gate</b> company, now as United) currently account for most starting gate installations in North America. True Center also has gates in South America, the Caribbean and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

50|$|On April 11 al-Obeidi {{gave her}} first uncensored {{interview}} since March 26, after Lourdes Garcia-Navarro of National Public Radio and an Associated Press reporter {{managed to avoid}} their government minders to interview her. Al-Obeidi repeated many of the details she'd given in previous interviews, and added that the most brutal of her attackers {{was the son of}} a government minister. She also explained how she had escaped. She told NPR that, after the 16-year-old girl held with her untied al-Obeidi's hands and feet, she managed to jump out of a window, covered only in a tablecloth. The compound was surrounded by a wall, and there were two African guards sleeping by the <b>electric</b> <b>gate.</b> She said she grabbed a piece of metal and ran at them, screaming, and they opened the gate for her. After that, she was helped by people in the neighborhood, who put her in a taxi, paid the fare, and told the driver to take her to the Rixos Hotel.|$|E
50|$|As {{retaliation}} continues, the feud spirals out of control, progressing {{with the}} twins breaking into Bryn's property and beheading the Cartwrights' pet poodle. Terry Walsh responds by {{setting fire to}} the Lewis' dog's kennel with their pet inside. However, an adjacent gas bottle explodes, destroying the Lewises' mobile home and killing the twins' family. Clearly upset, the twins make arrangements with the local male voice choir and steal their father's hearse at his funeral. Terry meanwhile, much to Greyo's distress, accuses Fatty's co-workers Dai and Chip of destroying the caravan by placing items {{from the scene of}} the crime in their builder's van. The twins soon come down from the hills where they have been hiding out and go after Bryn, breaking into his house again and tying him up with washing line rigged to his own electric garage door. The twins ask to borrow Bryn's boat to which he agrees, with the hope of the twins letting him go unhurt. The twins disappear leaving Bryn tied up and at the brink of asphyxiation in his own garage. Upon arrival of Lucy later that evening, she attempts to use the <b>electric</b> <b>gate</b> remote from outside while returning home, causing the garage door to lift and subsequently cause the hanging of her husband Bryn. By looking under the door and noticing the hanging, Lucy hysterically runs through the house and finds their daughter floating on a lilo in their indoor swimming pool listening to music through headphones, blissfully unaware of what had gone on.|$|E
5000|$|Hank takes Sanjuro to a pumping station, {{and with}} his help, dispatches the guards and helps Sanjuro get another MCA. Despite Kathryn's insistence that Toshiro and Baku are dead, Sanjuro {{suspects}} that both are alive, and decides to meet Kura at a nightclub called [...] "The Mecca." [...] With two friends of Hank's, he proceeds through the city and reaches a train station, but {{is too late to}} catch the train. Sanjuro then passes through the slums of Maritropa, but an <b>electric</b> <b>gate</b> bars his way, and only a woman whose cat is missing is able to deactivate it. The player can either kill the woman and her husband and open the gate, or do an optional level which depicts Sanjuro's attempts to rescue the cat from some [...] "stragglers" [...] who have been severely affected by working with kato, leading to a humorous exchange between Sanjuro and Kura, and Sanjuro receiving a health powerup as well as the cat's [...] "toy" [...] - a doll of Captain Nathaniel Joseph Claw from Monolith's own platformer Claw, that, when squeezed, says [...] "Magic Claw" [...] (Sanjuro actually gets to keep this item {{for the rest of the}} game). Sanjuro reaches the Mecca too late; Kura has been captured by the CMC, Cronus's relatively weak yet troublesome military authority, but not before she says that Toshiro is Gabriel, and vaguely mentions [...] "Cothineal." [...] Sanjuro reaches the club, and a businessman from Shogo named Ryo Ishikawa agrees to help Sanjuro save Kura in exchange for a favor. Sanjuro reluctantly agrees, and makes his way to the station, before moving crosstown in his MCA, and catching another train to the detention center. At the station, Hank tells him that Cothineal [...] "is the reason the Fallen exist," [...] but says that Kura can elaborate.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to suppress ion backflow in multi-GEM structures is suggested. In this approach, the potential difference applied across the gap between two adjacent GEMs is reversed compared to the standard configuration. In such a gap structure, called <b>Electric</b> <b>Gate,</b> a signal transfer from the first to second GEM is presumably provided by the small residual field still existing at small gate voltages and connecting the holes of the two GEMs. On the other hand, ion backflow between the GEMs {{turned out to be}} substantially reduced. We also consider another configuration, called Photoelectric Gate, in which in addition to the <b>Electric</b> <b>Gate</b> configuration, a CsI photocathode is deposited on the second GEM. In the Photoelectric Gate, ion backflow through the gap is fully suppressed and the signal transfer through the gap is provided by the photoelectric mechanism due to either avalanche scintillations in the first GEM or proportional scintillations in the electroluminescence gap replacing the first GEM. The idea of the <b>Electric</b> <b>Gate</b> might find applications in the field of TPC detectors and gas photomultipliers. The idea of the Photoelectric Gate is more relevant in the field of two-phase avalanche detectors. Comment: 12 pages, 14 figures. Submitted to JINS...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{original}} power controlling driving/reading circuit for Porous Silicon JFET (PSJFET) gas sensors is presented. The PSJFET is {{an integrated}} p-channel JFET with two independent gates: a meso-structured PS layer, {{acting as a}} sensing, floating gate, which modulates the JFET current upon adsorption/desorption of specific analytes, and a high-impedance <b>electric</b> <b>gate,</b> which allows the JFET current tuning independently from analytes in the environment. The circuit exploits {{the independence of the}} sensing and electrical gate terminals to set/control the sensor power-dissipation, which is kept almost constant independently from adsorption/desorption-induced effects, while simultaneously carrying out a current-voltage conversion. For such a purpose, a negative feedback loop is used to modulate the PSJFET <b>electric</b> <b>gate</b> voltage, which becomes the output signal, while keeping constant the source-drain sensor current and, hence, the power dissipation. The proposed approach is validated by performing time-resolved measurements on PSJFET sensors under different NO 2 concentrations (100 ppb, 300 ppb, 500 ppb), at room temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{of energy that}} is locally deposited into two-dimensional electron gases by Joule heating generates transverse voltages across devices with broken symmetry.
