40|$|Evidence {{that medical}} error can cause harm to {{patients}} {{has raised the}} attention of the health care community towards patient safety and influenced how and what medical students learn about it. Patient safety is best taught when students are participating in clinical practice where they actually encounter patients at risk. This type of learning is referred to as workplace learning, a complex system in which various factors influence what is being learned and how. A theory that can highlight potential difficulties in this complex learning system about patient safety is activity theory. Thirty-four final year undergraduate medical students participated in four focus groups about their experiences concerning patient safety. Using activity theory as analytical framework, we performed constant comparative thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts to identify important themes. We found eight general themes relating to two activities: learning to be a doctor and delivering safe patient care. Simultaneous occurrence of these two activities can cause contradictions. Our results illustrate the complexity of learning about patient safety at the workplace. Students <b>encounter</b> <b>contradictions</b> when learning about patient safety, especially during a transitional phase of their training. These contradictions create potential learning opportunities which should be used in education about patient safety. Insight into the complexities of patient safety is essential to improve education in this important area of medicine...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{considers}} {{the implications of}} refusal {{in the context of}} dialectic and depth psychology. What does it mean to refuse? What are the personal and psychological costs of refusal? Marcuse suggested that refusal could lead to greater possibilities for action. The author suggests that those in the field of public administration can participate in the "Great Refusal " by learning to think more dialectically, thus disabling the Western principle of non-contradiction and permitting the simultaneous acceptance of contradictions, in both theory and practice. In this symposium, we have been asked to consider Marcuse's idea of The Great Refusal, and its relevance to the field of public administration. The idea of refusal is one that I have found compelling for some time. Refuse what? What does it mean to refuse? Does refusal make me a negative, cranky, difficult, and contrarian person? Some who know me might already be nodding their heads in affirmation. But that leads me to ask: under what circumstances is refusal an affirmative act? What connotations are created by considering the act of refusal linked with the gender of the one refusing? What subliminal connections are made {{as a result of the}} spelling and pronunciation of the word, which can mean either an act of denial (refuse) or garbage (re/use), depending on the context? In this essay, I would like to consider refusal in the context of dialectic and depth psychology. Our Western "principle of non-contradiction " dictates that contradictions (a and not-a) cannot logically exist simultaneously. Therefore, when we <b>encounter</b> <b>contradictions,</b> we are tempted?indeed, instructed?to resolve them at any cost. I link these two perspectives to the public servant by suggesting that one important critical "refusal " can be learning to "hold" contradictions until their resolution emerges organically...|$|E
40|$|This {{study will}} look at {{what might be the}} causes and {{triggering}} forces that can contribute to the instigation of aggressive behaviours mostly among young people, its expression and manifestation. On a daily basis, we accustomed to turn on our TV for morning news or read a newspaper and learn about an act of violence and aggression towards a follow man or between communities. Aggression has become a natural risk to a level where every area of human condition of existence is characterised by acts of violence, cruelty and destruction. The method that has been used can be referred to the historical method that consists of assembling information through an analysis and reading of different text books and articles. Participation to one’s own culture can be a basic foundation to define humans, but aggression and destructive behaviour can also be considered as part of man inner being. Man can as well lose his unique individual features as part of a group. Being aggressive might mean standing for his own, his beliefs and being forceful, getting on his own way in his dealings and attempting to solve the problems facing him. The individual might appear unfriendly and even prone to hurt others. Since we also <b>encounter</b> <b>contradictions</b> and ambivalence in our daily and social feelings that are built in infancy, not only a social perspective {{can also be used to}} explain aggression but also our wrong assessment and interpretation of the situation or through our interactions with others. As I argue in this thesis, before seeing aggression as an acquired and learned response due to the influence of environmental factors, it is necessary to take into consideration the conception of an innate biological determined instinctual drive. However, some provocation factors must be in place for aggression to manifest itself, repressed feelings also are able to reproduce themselves unconsciously and resurface again into consciousness. This study may not be the final answer to problem of aggression but I believe that it carries with it additional information for educators since it deals with a problem which is of social importance, a problem that has become unstoppable and which affects mainly the youth...|$|E

40|$|Coopetition, the {{strategy}} by which companies cooperate and compete simultaneously in their business relationships, has received increasing attention from scholars and practitioners the last decade. Despite the recognized importance for firms to develop strategies to manage coopetitive relationships, {{the ways in}} which firms cope with strategic dilemmas in coopetition has not been sufficiently researched.   Firms engaging in coopetition may <b>encounter</b> <b>contradictions,</b> paradoxes and tensions that need to be managed in order for the business relationships to be beneficial. This doctoral thesis consists of five individual but related studies with the overarching aim to advance the understanding of firms’ capabilities to balance strategic dilemmas in coopetition. The thesis addresses three research questions.   How do firms balance interaction, roles and expectation in coopetition? How do firms balance power and dependency through portfolios of relationship in coopetition? How do firms balance temporalities in coopetition? All five research papers explore different aspects of {{the ways in which}} companies balance contradicting logics of interactions in coopetition, and how firms manage tensions in the interactions, which is critical for the coopetitive relationships to evolve and be beneficial. Three of the papers examine firms’ capability to adhere to and balance different roles and expectations in coopetition. Firms need to be flexible in their role-playing behavior to act as customers, partners, supplier and competitors in a relationship. These roles come with conflicting role expectations. Firms’ role-playing capability is related to the mindset that is needed in their role performance. Moreover, the thesis investigates how Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) balance power and dependency through portfolios of relationships. These findings are reported in three of the research papers and cover both how SMEs balance asymmetric buyer-supplier relationships by building coopetitive relationships with SME competitors and how small firms build and reconfigure portfolios of relationships to balance their relationship with large competitors. The thesis uncovers how SME are able to sustain independence in and to balance asymmetric coopetitive relationships if they develop alliance portfolio managing capabilities; build legitimacy, enhance agility and create role flexibility. These capabilities are found to be critical for small firms in balancing and navigating among different coopetitive relationships, thereby creating and sustaining business opportunities. Finally, the thesis explores how companies balance temporalities in coopetition. Two of the research papers uncover firms’ capabilities to balance this dilemma. The studies uncover how firms encounter dilemmas to interact on a temporary basis while sustaining important long-term relations in coopetition and how increased temporary relationships combined with long-term relationships can create both dynamics and tensions and how these tensions need to be managed in order to be beneficial. To conclude, this thesis has comprehensively explored firms’ capabilities to balance strategic dilemmas in coopetition through five studies with different theoretical approaches and multiple cases of large and small firms in different industry settings, covering both more stable industries and dynamic and rapidly changing industries...|$|E

Coming out of the wealth of {{material}} of the early Marx, it shows a brilliant young man engaging with and coming up against difficulties with a biblical text (John 15). Careful attention to Marx’s essay shows him struggling with two tensions. The first tension concerns two different models of salvation, either a mediatory one (Roman Catholic) or a dialectical one (Protestant). The essay begins with the former and ends with the latter, although it does not resolve the tension. The second tension is between the formal requirements of catechism and the poetic flights of the biblical text: Marx seeks to answer {{in light of the}} former but is drawn into the very different formal features of the latter.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this thesis was to {{highlight}} different communicative aspects of participation in interpreter-mediated asylum hearings with unaccompanied Russianspeaking children who had applied for asylum in Sweden between 2001 and 2005. Participation in the asylum process is guaranteed to these children by the Swedish Administrative Law and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which are incorporated in the Swedish Aliens Act. The Migration authorities in their work with asylum seeking minors have integrated principles of {{the best interests of}} the child and the principle of respecting the children’s views on matters concerning them. In this thesis, we have studied the conditions of participation in a highly complex, hybrid activity type, where participants face contradictory demands. Hybridity can be traced in communicative dilemmas which are difficult to solve and handle for all the participants involved, including the caseworkers, interpreters and children. The caseworkers are expected to control an interview in which whole of the communicative exchange is rendered by interpreters who influence the progress of the <b>encounter.</b> <b>Contradiction</b> lies in the fact that the caseworkers are expected to treat all asylum seekers equally both as a group and individually, by relating to general legal regulations and at the same time, take into account the interests and individual needs of an individual child. It might be difficult for these caseworkers to stay neutral and meet underage clients whose life stories and experiences, conduct and needs differ considerably from what is usually ascribed to children. Asylum seeking children come to Sweden to stay. Our results have shown that they take an active role in their attempts to lead to a positive outcome in their cases. In this respect, children’s testimonies and the impression they make as informants play a salient role. The communicative tasks faced by the adolescents are, however, difficult to achieve. Previous life conditions, vulnerability, psychosomatic problems, and memory and concentration difficulties may affect their performance. Other factors which might further impede these children from achieving their task is the pragmatic and linguistic deficiency, which they experience in a context where they lack communicative means and are not fully aware of the norms and regulations relevant for the encounter. Despite hese limitations, it seems that these minors try hard to shoulder their role as asylum seekers and informants actively and strategically. One strategy chosen by the children was to disclose information selectively. They tried to avoid answering questions which could reveal their age, origin or the whereabouts of their caregivers and thereby enable authorities to establish their identity and send them back. To compensate for their uncooperativeness in this area, the adolescents tended to provide information which had not been asked for. Our studies have shown that children could have been prevented by both the caseworkers and interpreters from expressing their views and opinions in a free and self-chosen way. In this respect, interpreters’ contributions were salient for what information was forwarded to the caseworkers. In some cases, they changed both the language and the format of the responses provided by the children. Some of the communicative strategies which were initiated by the interpreters could be linked to both their professional skills and to the hybridity and the complexity of the situation. Interpreters had difficulties staying neutral in relation to the children and orient them in the encounters. Age differences between the participants could also have an impact on how the children were treated and the respect and importance attributed to their voices. We have identified sequences where interpreters initiated monolingual exchanges with one of the interlocutors where they actively tried to exclude and discredit the children’s voices, something which often happened with the tacit approval of the caseworkers. Thus, it can be seen that communicative premises which are inherent in the asylum hearings influence the participant statuses of the children and their possibilities to express their asylum claims...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{tells the}} story of the production of socionatures through the development of aquaculture in Laguna Lake. The state introduced lake aquaculture to supplement fisherfolk livelihoods and improve fish production in part to provide nearby Metro Manila with its fish requirements. Half a century of aquaculture in the lake, however, has transformed ecologies, landscapes and livelihoods. Flows of fish to the city <b>encounter</b> socioecological <b>contradictions</b> in lake production and urban consumption. This dissertation examines these transformations and how state policies, livelihood activities and fish demands produce particular socionatures. Using the urban political ecology concept of urban metabolism, the dissertation frames the production of Laguna Lake socionatures as a city-lake dynamic. It employs qualitative and multi-sited ethnographic methods to follow Laguna Lake fish from sites of production to consumption and to identify actors, relations and practices that shape access to these flows of fish. The state embarked on projects aided by scientific institutions and foreign donors to enable aquaculture production through simplification of complex lake socioecological processes. These resulted in capitalist fishpen aquaculture expansion that transformed lake ecologies and village livelihoods. Capitalist aquaculture continues to confront nature?s materiality in water-based production, which provides constraints and opportunities for aquaculture expansion. Village producers, intermediaries and urban consumers also continually work with the materiality of nature to secure livelihood and sustenance benefits from fish as they flow from the lake to the city. However, the distribution of access to fish flows is uneven, with urban-based fishing corporations that own the largest fishpens and fish market brokers deriving the most benefit as a result of their political and economic power. Other commodity chain actors attempt to gain access to these fish flows through formal and illicit strategies. By following the flows of Laguna Lake fish, the dissertation weaves stories of the urban metabolism as producers, traders, consumers, laborers and the state transform and produce lake and urban socionatures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Lower {{labor costs}} and {{realization}} of profits have been key {{components in the}} expansion of the global market. As we continue to witness the prolific liberalization of the global market, it is essential that we remember the importance of human capital. Workers play a paramount role in the realization of continued and sustained global market growth. Paradoxically, sustained growth in the global market is also fueled by the absence of workers’ rights and the resulting reduction of labor costs. Thus, multi-national companies and workers employed by multi-national companies, have <b>encountered</b> a seeming <b>contradiction</b> of workplace realities. From a capitalistic economic perspective, it is necessary for multi-national companies to compete for market share and realize profits. However, in order to promote social harmony and ensure against large-scale social unrest, workers must be given basic rights ensuring economic security and workplace justice. China has enacted the Labor Contract Law to address challenges surrounding these issues. This paper will discuss the efficacy of China’s embracing the rule of law so as to effectively enforce the Labor Contract Law. The paper will also give an overview of the concepts forming the foundation {{of the rule of law}}. Further, the paper will offer a brief comparative analysis of the United States’ use of the rule of law in relation to resolving post-slavery labor issues. Finally, the paper will recommend a model system for use by China in enforcing the Labor Contract Law...|$|R

One of such misconceptions is related to arithmetic of natural numbers, which is extremely important both for science and everyday life. People think their counting is governed {{by the rules of}} the conventional arithmetic and thus other kinds of arithmetics of natural numbers do not exist and cannot exist. However, this popular image of the situation with the natural numbers is wrong. In many situations, people have to utilize and do implicitly utilize rules of counting and operating different from rules and operations in the conventional arithmetic. This is a consequence of the existing diversity in nature and society. To correctly represent this diversity, people have to explicitly employ different arithmetics. To make a distinction, we call the conventional arithmetic by the name Diophantine arithmetic, while other arithmetics are called non-Diophantine. There are two big families of non-Diophantine arithmetics: projective arithmetics and dual arithmetics (Burgin, 1997). In this work, we give an exposition of projective arithmetics, presenting their properties and considering also a more general mathematical structure called a projective prearithmetic. The Diophantine arithmetic is a member of this parametric family: its parameter is equal to the identity function f(x) = x. In conclusion, it is demonstrated how non-Diophantine arithmetics may be utilized beyond mathematics and how they allow one to eliminate inconsistencies and <b>contradictions</b> <b>encountered</b> by other researchers...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, {{the status of the}} archive as well as the state of what we call “documentary” have {{dominated}} discussions in and around photography. Although it is now commonplace to presume the objectifying gesture of documentary photography, the complex question of how, as a working artist/photographer, to approach the archive has not yet been adequately addressed. The purpose of this research is to raise questions about how, after the critique of the documentary image, the artist/photographer addresses, indeed, finds the archive. I am starting with the assumption that the archive is not only a place of storage but also a place of production, where our relation to the past is materialised and where our present writes itself into the future; thus, accordingly, I understand the archive as a place of negotiation and writing. After the problems of the archive have been identified theoretically, the practice in the archive still <b>encounters</b> challenges and <b>contradictions.</b> This project explores those difficulties that remain within the practice in and around the archive, even after the critique has been stated. It is not about simply extending the critique, but finding an archive and the practice with it. I am approaching these questions as a practitioner. As an artist and photographer, I am concerned with two practices in relation to archives: working with existing archives, and making work that will itself be archived. The point raised by those two activities is not to find or create another institutional archive per se, but to develop an archival practice in which the set of problems that the archives produce is in fact part of the process one engages in. Hence the work is a theoretical and practical set of experiments that may never be complete and conclusive...|$|R
