40|$|Gifted {{children}} in Sweden are largely an unidentified group {{in spite of}} their needs for special adaptations in the home and at school to thrive. Without these adaptations, <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> can develop behavioral and social difficulties. Some personality characteristics common in <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> can also mimic symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review investigates the literature on diagnostic procedures and outcomes for <b>gifted</b> <b>children.</b> Nineteen studies and review articles about the diagnosis, performance and outcomes of <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> with and without Asperger’s, ADHD and autism were surveyed. Results showed clinically significant differences between <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> with and without a diagnosis on a variety of outcomes. Gifted children without a diagnosis performed generally better on cognitive measures, had fewer social and behavioral problems and higher functional levels than <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> with a diagnosis. Giftedness could also mask certain areas of dysfunction, increasing the risk of missing a diagnosis. Unexpected findings were that <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> without a diagnosis could have more social difficulties than children with average IQ and that <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> with ADHD could have more difficulties than average IQ children with ADHD.

These results suggested that intellectually <b>gifted</b> <b>children</b> showed faster inhibition when dealing with NoGo stimuli, and this superiority came from the later stages of inhibition, i. e., response evaluation or the success of inhibiting a response, as indexed by the shorter P 3 latency.
