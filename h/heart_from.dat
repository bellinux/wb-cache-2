5|$|Radio Mercury began {{broadcasting}} on 20 October 1984 from Broadfield House in Broadfield. The station, {{now owned}} by Global Radio, broadcasts as <b>Heart</b> <b>from</b> Brighton, with the studios in Kelvin Way in Crawley closed in August 2010. On 1 February 2011, the local Gold transmitter on 1521 AM closed and listeners were advised to retune to 1548 AM (Gold London) or 1323 AM (Gold Sussex). Local BBC radio was provided by BBC Radio Sussex from 1983; this became part of BBC Southern Counties Radio following a merger with BBC Radio Surrey in 1994. From March 2009, BBC Southern Counties Radio became BBC Sussex on 104.5FM & BBC Surrey on 104FM. Due to the positioning of their transmitters, when broadcasting separately both stations cover Crawley stories.|$|E

5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the <b>heart</b> <b>from</b> the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood the heart is able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of fasting on {{recovery}} of function and exogenous glucose metabolism after 15 minutes of total ischemia, we perfused isolated working rat <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fed and fasted animals. Hearts were perfused in a recirculating system with bicarbonate buffer containing glucose (10 mM). Mechanical performance, release of marker proteins for ischemic membrane damage (lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin, citrate synthase), and the concentrations of lactate and glucose in the perfusion medium were measured serially. Tissue metabolites were also measured. Fasting raised the myocardial glycogen content by 25 %. Cardiac performance of perfused <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fed and fasted animals was the same during the preischemic and the post-ischemic period. The time of return of function to preischemic values was significantly less in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fasted rats (2. 3 versus 7. 8 minutes, p< 0. 025). The release of cytosolic and mitochondrial marker proteins was significantly lower in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fasted rats than in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fed rats. Glucose metabolic rates during control and reperfusion were unchanged for <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fasted rats, but decreased for <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fed rats during reperfusion.

Perfusion of <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> obese (fa/fa) animals with medium containing 1 nM- 100 microM-adrenaline for 4 min {{did not significantly}} activate phosphofructokinase, but fully activated glycogen phosphorylase. Activation of phosphofructokinase occurred in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> lean (Fa/?) animals, with half-maximal activation at 10 nM-adrenaline. Binding characteristics of cardiac alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors were comparable between lean and obese animals. Properties of phosphofructokinase from obese and lean hearts were similar. High extracellular Ca 2 + concentration, which activated phosphofructokinase in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> lean animals and phosphorylase in all hearts, failed to activate phosphofructokinase in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> obese rats. The data indicate that the failure of adrenaline to activate phosphofructokinase in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> obese (fa/fa) rats results from a post-receptor defect in the as-yet unidentified Ca 2 +-dependent phosphofructokinase-activating reactions...|$|R
40|$|Postischemic {{recovery}} of contractile function is better in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fasted rats than in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fed rats. In this study, we examined whether feeding-induced inhibition of palmitate oxidation {{at the level}} of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I is involved in the mechanism underlying impaired {{recovery of}} contractile function. <b>Hearts</b> isolated <b>from</b> fasted or fed rats were submitted to no-flow ischemia followed by reperfusion with buffer containing 8 mM glucose and either 0. 4 mM palmitate or 0. 8 mM octanoate. During reperfusion, oxidation of palmitate was higher after fasting than after feeding, whereas oxidation of octanoate was not influenced by the nutritional state. In the presence of palmitate, recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was better in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fasted rats. Substitution of octanoate for palmitate during reperfusion enhanced recovery of left ventricular developed pressure in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> fed rats. However, the chain length of the fatty acid did not influence diastolic contracture. The results suggest that nutritional variation of mitochondrial fatty acid transfer may influence postischemic recovery of contractile function...|$|R
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the <b>heart</b> <b>from</b> {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the <b>heart</b> <b>from</b> the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{protective}} activity of a low concentration of nifedipine (3 x 10 (- 8) M) against global myocardial ischemic injury in isolated perfused <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats (DR) as compared with control rats (CR). Hearts were subjected to 45 -min global ischemia followed by 45 -min reperfusion. During ischemia, the period of time until onset of the ischemic contracture was significantly longer in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> DR than in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> CR (20. 3 +/- 1. 0 and 15. 5 +/- 0. 5 min, p less than 0. 05). The degree of the ischemic contracture was similar in both types of hearts. During reperfusion, a significantly smaller recovery of left ventricular pressure (LVP) was observed as was a tendency for postischemic coronary flow (CF) to be lower in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> DR than in those from CR. After pretreatment with nifedipine, the time of onset of the ischemic contracture was significantly more delayed in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> DR than in those from CR: from 20. 3 +/- 1. 0 to 28. 1 +/- 1. 2 min (p less than 0. 05) and from 15. 5 +/- 0. 6 to 18. 1 +/- 0. 9 min (p less than 0. 05), respectively. In addition, the degree of the ischemic contracture was reduced (45. 3 %) in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> DR but not in those from CR. During reperfusion, the CF was increased only in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> DR. No beneficial effects on functional recovery of LVP were observed in either type of hearts, although recovery tended to be better in diabetic hearts. Nifedipine in a low concentration appears to be more effective against myocardial ischemic injury in diabetes, resulting in an improvement in postischemic CF. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the <b>heart</b> <b>from</b> beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} aging on {{heart rate and}} atnoventncular (AV) {{conduction}} responses to verapamil (0 - 1 00 ng/ml) were studied in Langendorif perfused <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> 1 2 mature (4 - 6 months) and 12 senescent (24 months) male Fischer 344 rats and in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> 1 0 mature and 9 senescent rats after reserpine administration (0. 25 mg/kg/day i. p. for 5 - 7 days).

40|$|Induction of {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (Hsps), Hsp 72 in particular, {{has been associated}} with myocardial protection. Since a decreased Hsp response has been reported to occur with aging, it was of interest to determine if <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> aged animals also demonstrate an altered heat shock response and subsequent myocardial protection. Adult (6 months old) and aged (22 months old) Fischer 344 rats were heat stressed by raising their rectal temperatures to 41 Â°C for 10 min. At selected times following heat stress (0 â€“ 24 h) hearts were examined for heat shock transcription factor trimerization and DNA-binding activity (Hsf 1 activation), Hsp 72 mRNA accumulation, Hsp 72 and Hsf 1 protein content, as well as, protection from ischemia using the Langendorff isolated heart model. Following heat stress, <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> aged animals demonstrated a 47 % reduction in Hsf 1 activation, a reduction in Hsp 72 mRNA and a 35 % reduction in Hsp 72 protein content, compared to <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> adults. Interestingly, myocardial Hsf 1 protein content was similar between aged and adult animals. <b>Hearts</b> <b>from</b> heat stressed adult animals (24 -h prior) demonstrated an enhanced postischemic recovery as indicated by a greater recovery of left ventricular pressure and rate of contraction (P < 0. 05), while <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> heat stressed aged animals failed to demonstrate an enhanced postischemic recovery. These results suggest that <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> aged animals exhibit an impaired ability to produce the protective Hsps and thus, may explain, at least in part, the increased susceptibility of aged hearts to stress...|$|R

40|$|Backgroundâ€”Donor {{brain death}} upregulates {{expression}} of inflammatory mediators in the heart. It is hypothesized that these nonspecific changes trigger and amplify acute rejection in unmodified recipients compared with <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> normal living donors. We examined the inflammatory and immunological consequences of gradual-onset donor brain death on cardiac allografts after transplantation. Methods and Resultsâ€”Functioning <b>hearts</b> were engrafted <b>from</b> normotensive donors after 6 hours of ventilatory support. <b>Hearts</b> <b>from</b> brain-dead rats (Fisher, F 344) were rejected significantly earlier (mean 6 SD, 9. 360. 6 days) by their (Lewis) recipients than <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> living donor controls (11. 660. 7 days, P 50. 03). The inflammatory response of such organs was accelerated, with rapid expression of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules and brisk infiltration of associated leukocyte populations. Upregulation of major histocompatibility class II antigens increased organ immuno-genicity. Acute rejection evolved in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> brain-dead donors more intensely {{and at a}} significantly faster rate than in controls.

In contrast, <b>hearts</b> isolated <b>from</b> rats pretreated with endotoxin 1 hr before isolation or hearts perfused with endotoxin did not have increased catalase activity or decreased injury following ischemia and reperfusion.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} hyper- and hypothyroidism on basal parameters of isolated perfused hearts of rats. In addition the effects of different extracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca 2 +]o), the calcium entry promoter Bay K 8644 and the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine were investigated. Since alterations in alpha-adrenoceptor density could explain the increased sensitivity to methoxamine in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> hypothyroid rats, alpha 1 -adrenoceptor density in the left ventricle was also established. Different time-schedules of exposure to hyper- and hypothyroidism were used to investigate whether the influence of chronic dysthyroid states on alpha 1 -adrenoceptor density is transient and time-dependent. Simultaneously myocardial noradrenaline and adrenaline tissue concentrations were determined, since they might correlate with the observed changes. Hyperthyroidism was induced by feeding rats for 1, 4 and 8 weeks with 5 mg/kg L-thyroxine (T 4) -containing rat chow. Hypothyroid rats were obtained by adding 0. 05 % propylthiouracil (PTU) to the drinking water during 1, 4 and 8 weeks. For the functional experiments animals were treated during 4 weeks, to mimic the clinical situation of a chronic endocrine disease. Langendorff <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> hyperthyroid <b>hearts</b> showed an increased maximally developed relaxation velocity, whereas Langendorff <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> hypothyroid rats showed an increased left ventricular pressure (LVP). We observed an increased maximal inotropic response to [Ca 2 +]o in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> both hyperthyroid and hypothyroid rats, indicating that both dysthyroid states interfere with the handling of calcium ions by the contractile apparatus. Unchanged responses to Bay K 8644 in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> hyperthyroid and depressed responses in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> hypothyroid rats suggest that the involvement of L-type calcium channels is rather unlikely. Furthermore, the reflex increase in coronary flow in response to enhanced contractile force appeared to fail in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> hypothyroid rats. Sensitivity of the response to methoxamine was increased in <b>hearts</b> <b>from</b> hypothyroid rats, which {{was accompanied by a}} {{decrease in the number of}} myocardial alpha 1 -adrenoceptors. Both T 4 and PTU treatment resulted in a non-transient decrease of alpha 1 -adrenoceptor density in left ventricular tissue. Furthermore, hypothyroidism increased the percentage of alpha 1 A-binding sites, whereas in hyperthyroidism the distribution of the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes was not affected. Myocardial tissue concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline were unchanged in hyperthyroid rats and decreased in hypothyroid rats.

25|$|Among Galen's major {{contributions}} to medicine was {{his work on}} the circulatory system. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between venous (dark) and arterial (bright) blood.

Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the <b>heart,</b> <b>from</b> where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the rete mirabile in the carotid sinus.
