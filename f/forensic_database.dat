40|$|The {{increasing}} {{usage of}} databases {{in the storage}} of critical and sensitive information in many organizations {{has led to an}} increase in the rate at which databases are exploited in computer crimes. Databases are often manipulated to facilitate crimes and as such are usually of interest during many investigations as useful information relevant to the investigation can be found therein. A branch of digital forensics that deals with the identification, preservation, analysis and presentation of digital evidence from databases is known as <b>database</b> <b>forensics.</b> Despite the large amount of information that can be retrieved from databases and the amount of research that has been done on various aspects of databases, database security and digital forensics in general, very little has been done on <b>database</b> <b>forensics.</b> <b>Databases</b> have also been excluded from traditional digital investigations until very recently. This {{can be attributed to the}} inherent complexities of databases and the lack of knowledge on how the information contained in the database can be retrieved, especially in cases where such information have been modified or existed in the past. This thesis addresses one major part of the challenges in <b>database</b> <b>forensics,</b> which is the reconstruction of the information stored in the database at some earlier time. The dimensions involved in a <b>database</b> <b>forensics</b> analysis problem are identified and the thesis focuses on one of these dimensions. Concepts such as the relational algebra log and the inverse relational algebra are introduced as tools in the definition of a theoretical framework that can be used for <b>database</b> <b>forensics.</b> The thesis provides an algorithm for database reconstruction and outlines the correctness proof of the algorithm. Various techniques for a complete regeneration of deleted or lost data during a <b>database</b> <b>forensics</b> analysis are also described. Due to the importance of having adequate logs in order to use the algorithm, specifications of an ideal log configuration for an effective reconstruction process are given, putting into consideration the various dimensions of the <b>database</b> <b>forensics</b> problem space. Throughout the thesis, practical situations that illustrate the application of the algorithms and techniques described are given. The thesis provides a scientific approach that can be used for handling <b>database</b> <b>forensics</b> analysis practice and research, particularly in the aspect of reconstructing the data in a database.

40|$|The {{creation}} {{and expansion of}} <b>forensic</b> DNA <b>databases</b> might involve potential threats {{to the protection of}} a range of human rights. At the same time, such databases have social benefits. Based on data collected through an online questionnaire applied to 628 individuals in Portugal, this paper aims to analyze the citizensâ€™ willingness to donate voluntarily a sample for profiling and inclusion in the National <b>Forensic</b> DNA <b>Database</b> and the views underpinning such a decision. Nearly one-quarter of the respondents would indicate â€˜noâ€™, and this negative response increased significantly with age and education. The overriding willingness to accept the inclusion of the individual genetic profile indicates an acknowledgement of the investigative potential of forensic DNA technologies and a relegation of civil liberties and human rights to the background, owing to the perceived benefits of protecting both society and the individual from crime. This rationale is mostly expressed by the idea that all citizens should contribute to the expansion of the National <b>Forensic</b> DNA <b>Database</b> for reasons that range from the more abstract assumption that donating a sample for profiling would be helpful in fighting crime to the more concrete suggestion that everyone (criminals and non-criminals) should be in the database. The concerns with the risks of accepting the donation of a sample for genetic profiling and inclusion in the National <b>Forensic</b> DNA <b>Database</b> are mostly related to lack of control and insufficient or unclear regulations concerning safeguarding individualsâ€™ data and supervising the access and uses of genetic data. By providing an empirically-grounded understanding of the attitudes regarding willingness to donate voluntary a sample for profiling and inclusion in a National <b>Forensic</b> DNA <b>Database,</b> this study also considers the citizensâ€™ perceived benefits and risks of operating <b>forensic</b> DNA <b>databases.</b> These collective views might be useful for the formation of international common ethical standards for the development and governance of DNA databases in a framework in which the citizensâ€™ perspectives are taken into consideration...|$|R

While the institutional and political discourses maintain that the restricted use and application of DNA profiles within the national <b>forensic</b> <b>database</b> protects individualsâ€™ rights, the prisoners claim that police misuse of such technologies potentially makes it difficult to escape from surveillance and acts as a mean of reinforcing the stigma of delinquency. The prisoners also argue that additional intensive and extensive use of surveillance devices might be more protective of their own individual rights and might possibly increase potential for exoneration.

40|$|The <b>forensic</b> <b>database</b> of England and Wales is {{the largest}} in the world with {{profiles}} from over 3 million people. Samples can be taken without consent, not only from convicted criminals, but, also from all those arrested on suspicion of a recordable offence even if they are not subsequently charged. There has been little public debate on the database, in contrast to other applications of genetic technology, and, in particular, a lack of discussion on the inclusion of children despite the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the debate around childrenâ€™s consent. The paper begins by briefly introducing the significance of the inclusion of children on the England and Wales National DNA database (NDNAD) in the context of current law. Next there is a report of the findings of a small focus group study carried out with children aged 10 - 12 and one of their parents, who were contacted through their schools. The study explored issues related to the inclusion of children on the NDNAD, including childrenâ€™s responsibility and independence, and gathered responses to real life case studies about the taking of DNA samples from children.

40|$|SummarySurnames are {{cultural}} {{markers of}} shared ancestry within human populations. The Y chromosome, like many surnames, is paternally inherited, so men sharing surnames {{might be expected}} to share similar Y chromosomes as a signature of coancestry. Such a relationship could be used to connect branches of family trees [1], to validate population genetic studies based on isonymy [2], and to predict surname from crime-scene samples in forensics [3]. However, the link may be weak or absent due to multiple independent founders for many names, adoptions, name changes and nonpaternities, and mutation of Y haplotypes. Here, rather than focusing on a single name [4], we take a general approach by seeking evidence for a link in a sample of 150 randomly ascertained pairs of males who each share a British surname. We show that sharing a surname significantly elevates the probability of sharing a Y-chromosomal haplotype and that this probability increases as surname frequency decreases. Within our sample, we estimate that up to 24 % of pairs share recent ancestry and that a large surname-based <b>forensic</b> <b>database</b> might contribute to the intelligence-led investigation of up to âˆ¼ 70 rapes and murders per year in the UK. This approach would be applicable to any society that uses patrilineal surnames of reasonable time-depth...|$|E
30|$|To {{demonstrate}} that JFA or i-vector techniques are ineffective for databases {{with a low}} number of speakers, in preliminary experiments, we attempted JFA and i-vector techniques based on [31] using the JFA cookbook ([URL] developed by Ondrej Glembek at Brno University of Technology on our 60 female speaker <b>forensic</b> <b>database.</b> Out of the 60 speakers available, the background database was allocated 20 speakers, development and test databases were each allocated 10 speakers and the remaining 20 speakers were allocated for training the inter-speaker variability models associated with JFA or i-vector techniques. FVC results obtained were substantially poorer compared with FVC results from a GMM-UBM system {{based on the same}} 60 female speaker database, based on the same database allocation for background, development and test databases as the JFA or i-vector techniques. Other database arrangements were also investigated such as increasing the number of speakers assigned to train the inter-speaker variability models by the additional 20 speakers using the same 20 speakers from background database, and hence increasing the total number of speakers used for training the inter-speaker variability models to 40 speakers; however, results from JFA showed similar substantially poorer FVC results compared with results from the GMM-UBM system. This therefore implies that JFA or i-vector techniques will not perform well in FVC given that the inter-speaker variability models were based on such a low number of speakers.|$|E

40|$|In {{forensic}} science, {{the number}} of image databases is growing rapidly. For this reason, {{it is necessary to}} have a proper procedure for searching in these images databases based on content. The use of image databases results in more solved crimes; furthermore, statistical information can be obtained for forensic identification. This thesis investigates the applicability of image-matching algorithms in <b>forensic</b> image <b>database</b> retrieval. From the experiments described in this thesis with the databases of toolmarks, cartridge cases, shoe marks and drugs tablets, it appeared that a reproducible image acquisition method should be used. Further, a pre-processing step is necessary for filtering the relevant regions of the image for the comparison. From the study in this thesis, is concluded that there is no single system to treat all image databases. For each database a different approach is necessary, depending on the marks that are used for the comparison. In order to control the use of these databases, methods are needed that predict the performance on larger databases. Representative test sets should be available for evaluating the performance of matching algorithms in the <b>forensic</b> <b>databases.</b> The performance of matching on a specific types of marks depends also on future developments in products that cause these marks. For instance, if firearms are used where the breech face marks are hardly visible or if the breech face marks are not characteristic anymore, this will reduce the results of using the cartridge case <b>database.</b> <b>Forensic</b> scientists often give a conclusion based on experience, not on statistics. The <b>forensic</b> <b>databases</b> could provide a reliability measure on the uniqueness of certain identifying characteristics., which results in usefulness in the interpretation of the evidence. For the shoe mark and drug tablet systems the identifying characteristics are often small irregularities. They are not visible in the low resolution images that have been used in our research. For the shoe mark and drug tablet systems, higher resolution images are necessary to obtain the characteristics. The cartridge case system and the tool mark system have these identifying characteristics available. More research on statistical measures from <b>forensic</b> image <b>databases</b> is desirable. The results of using the databases can not only result in data for court, but also for operational activities. By using the new investigative power due to fast treatment of image database, it is possible to derive information on the operational activities. Examples are new waves of drugs on the market and extensions of the traffic of those drugs, or the use of a specific kind of firearm in a group of criminals. In order to optimize information retrieval from the various databases, a data searching strategy should be developed that combines the information in the multiple databases. This is a way to alleviate the problem that often only partial profiles are found {{at the scene of the}} crime. In some cases, e. g. weak evidence from a shoe mark could be combined with weak evidence from a fingerprint which results in stronger evidence...|$|R
