25|$|High-fructose {{corn syrup}} (HFCS) (also called glucose-fructose, <b>isoglucose</b> and glucose-fructose syrup) is a {{sweetener}} made from corn starch {{that has been}} processed by glucose isomerase to convert some of its glucose into fructose. HFCS was first marketed in the early 1970s by the Clinton Corn Processing Company, together with the Japanese Agency of Industrial Science and Technology where the enzyme was discovered in 1965.|$|E
50|$|Commercially, if {{the syrup}} has a {{dextrose}} equivalency (DE) above 30, the product {{has to be}} hydrolyzed and converted to a high-fructose syrup, much like high-fructose corn syrup, or <b>isoglucose</b> syrup in the EU.|$|E
50|$|In the European Union (EU), HFCS, {{known as}} <b>isoglucose</b> in sugar regime, {{is subject to}} a {{production}} quota. In 2005, this quota was set at 303,000 tons; in comparison, the EU produced an average of 18.6 million tons of sugar annually between 1999 and 2001.|$|E

40|$|This report {{compares the}} production, market and trade {{outcomes}} of two alternative policy scenarios, namely expiry of EU sugar quotas in 2015 / 16 and {{extension of the}} current sugar quota scheme. All other EU policy measures pertaining to the sugar sector, and to agriculture more generally, are assumed the same in both scenarios. The year of comparison is 2020. The CAPRI model {{was used for the}} simulations. The report begins with a description of beet and sugar production within the EU, and outlines the policies applied in the sugar sector within the EU’s Common Agricultural policy. This is followed by a description of the workings of the EU market for sugar. A theoretical model is used to summarise the main functional relationships in the EU sugar market and related markets, and the EU’s trade in sugar, from which a number of theory-based predictions about the impacts of quota expiry are derived. There is then a very brief overview of the CAPRI model and the way it has been used in this study. <b>Isoglucose</b> quotas will expire along with sugar quotas, and there is much speculation about the extent of potential competitive substitution between the two sweeteners, which has until now been neutralised by the quota arrangements. Sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain greater insight into this issue. Two additional quota-expiry scenarios were run, in which <b>isoglucose</b> was assumed to take a 10 % and a 20 % share of the sweetener market at the expense of sugar. The main findings are: •	production of sugar beet and white sugar increases by around 4 %,. •	there is little net impact on the production of cereals, •	total ethanol production hardly changes, but the importance of sugar as an ethanol feedstock declines by a few percentage points, •	raw sugar imports from high-cost third countries decline very substantially, but those from the low-cost producer Brazil decrease only slightly, •	EU sugar exports fall, •	EU human consumption of sugar increases only marginally, despite a fall of 15 - 16 % in beet prices for sugar for internal human consumption, •	there is a very small positive welfare change, although income accruing to sugar beet producers falls by over 17 %,JRC.

40|$|We {{assess the}} impact of a {{potential}} TTIP bilateral free trade agreement on the EU and US bio-economies (feedstock, biofuels, by-products, and related competing crops) and major trade partners in these markets. The analysis develops a multi-market model that incorporates bilateral trade flows (US to EU, EU to US, and similarly with third countries) and is calibrated to OECD-FAO baseline for 2013 - 2022 to account for recent policy decisions. The major policy reforms from a TTIP involve tariff and TRQ liberalization and their direct contractionary impact on US sugar supply, EU biofuel production, and indirect negative effect on US HFCS production. EU sugar and <b>isoglucose</b> productions expand along with US ethanol and biodiesel and oilseed crushing. EU sugar would flow to the US, US biofuels and vegetable oil to the EU. We further quantify nontariff measures (NTM) affecting these trade flows between the EU and the US. EU oilseed production contracts, and EU crushing expands with improving crushing margins following reduced NTM frictions. Our analysis reveals limited net welfare gains with most net benefits reaped by Brazil and not the two trading partners of the TTIP...|$|E
