50|$|The {{effect of}} this is to cause {{symptoms}} in more than one part of the body, often symmetrically on left and right sides. As for any neuropathy, the chief symptoms include motor symptoms such as weakness or clumsiness of movement; and sensory symptoms such as unusual or unpleasant sensations such as tingling or burning; reduced ability to feel sensations such as texture or temperature, and impaired balance when standing or walking. In many polyneuropathies, these symptoms occur first and most severely in the feet. Autonomic symptoms also may occur, such as <b>dizziness</b> <b>on</b> <b>standing</b> up, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty controlling urination.|$|E

The incidence of <b>dizziness</b> <b>on</b> <b>standing</b> was similar in both groups (9 %). Thus postural hypotension is no more common in women who have received epidural analgesia than in others. All patients should be helped out of bed after delivery, and any patient who experiences dizziness should have her blood pressure measured until the dizziness disappears...|$|E

We present {{a case where}} a diagnosis of advanced HIV led to many other diagnoses but more importantly life-threatening multivariant Castleman’s disease which is rare and was successfully treated. This case {{highlights the importance of}} questioning and challenging investigations when it does not fit with the clinical picture. Multidisciplinary teams are crucial and always seek expert advice if unsure. The much-quoted adage of “many symptoms and signs will fit one diagnosis ” also bodes well in this case. 1. Lesson A 43 -year-old Caucasian German Salesman was referred to our outpatient clinic from the Haematologists in July 2009. He was under their care for anaemia and had lost 10 kg of weight in 6 months. He also had increasing shortness of breath on exertion with a cough productive of yellow phlegm, increasing lethargy, <b>dizziness</b> <b>on</b> <b>standing,</b> and numbness in both hands.

40|$|We {{assessed}} hemodynamic responses {{induced by}} orthostatic and mental stressors, using passive head up tilt (HUT) and mental arithmetic (MA), respectively. The 15 healthy males underwent three protocols: (1) HUT alone, (2) MA in supine position and (3) MA+HUT, with sessions randomized and ≥ 2 weeks apart. In relation to baseline, HUT increased heart rate (HR) (+ 20. 4 ± 7. 1  bpm; p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p < 0. 001) decreased. Mental challenge during orthostatic challenge elicited greater increases in heart rate, despite similar reductions in stroke volume {{such as those}} during orthostatic stress alone. Overall, cardiac output decreases were less with combinations of mental and orthostatic challenges in comparison to orthostasis alone. This would suggest that carefully chosen mental stressors might affect orthostatic responses of people on standing up. Therefore, additional mental loading could be a useful countermeasure to alleviate the orthostatic responses of persons, particularly in those with histories of <b>dizziness</b> <b>on</b> <b>standing</b> up or on return to earth from the spaceflight environment of microgravity...|$|E
40|$|At orthostatic {{vasovagal syncope}} {{there appears to}} be a sudden decline of {{sympathetic}} activity. As mental challenge activates the sympathetic system, we hypothesized that doing mental arithmetic in volunteers driven to the end point of their cardiovascular stability may delay the onset of orthostatic syncope. We investigated this in healthy male subjects. Each subject underwent a head up tilt (HUT) + graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) up to presyncope session (control) to determine the orthostatic tolerance time, OTT (Time from HUT commencement to development of presyncopal symptoms/signs). Once the tolerance time was known, a randomized crossover protocol was used: either 1) Repeat HUT + LBNP to ensure reproducibility of repeated run or 2) HUT + LBNP run but with added mental challenge (2 min before the expected presyncope time). Test protocols were separated by 2 weeks. Our studies on five male test subjects indicate that mental challenge improves orthostatic tolerance significantly. Additional mental loading could be a useful countermeasure to alleviate the orthostatic responses of persons, particularly in those with histories of <b>dizziness</b> <b>on</b> <b>standing</b> up, or to alleviate hypotension that frequently occurs during hemodialysis or on return to earth from the spaceflight environment of microgravity...|$|E

Subjects were divided into three groups according to UW and DP values. Descriptive statistics and comparisons between groups were performed, considering a significance level of 5 % in all analyses. Results Patients groups had 20. 9 % men, and 79. 1 % women. There was no significant difference between groups for the scores obtained in the Brazilian DHI. There was, however, a statistically significant difference in the redistribution of individuals according to the UWand DP values. Conclusion There was no relationship between VT results and the impact of dizziness in the quality of life.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between dietary fiber intake and the state of health, except for the effect of fiber intake on constipation, particularly in children. In this study we investigated the cross-sectional associations between dietary fiber intake and homeostasis in 60 males and 25 females 15 - 16 years of age. A physical examination was conducted, and assessment of a subject's state of homeostasis, including subjective symptoms, was self-reported. The dietary intake was estimated using a self-administered food frequency questionnaire. The subjects were classified in two groups according to their median dietary fiber intake to analyze the associations between dietary fiber intake and a state of homeostasis. A significant association was observed between a low level of dietary fiber intake and the symptom of <b>dizziness</b> <b>on</b> <b>standing</b> up. On the other hand, the group with a higher intake of water（ p＜ 0. 041 ） or grains（ p＜ 0. 009 ） had a significantly lower incidence of constipation than did those with lower intakes of water or grains. In addition, significantly negative correlations were observed between the dietary fiber intake per 1, 000 kcal and body weight（ r＝- 0. 29, p＜ 0. 01 ）, BMI（ r＝- 0. 22, p＜ 0. 05 ） and waist circumference （r＝- 0. 23, p＜ 0. 05 ）, respectively.
