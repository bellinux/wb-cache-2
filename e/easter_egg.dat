5|$|Adventure was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game <b>Easter</b> <b>egg,</b> a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's <b>Easter</b> <b>egg</b> became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E

5|$|Adventure {{received}} mostly positive reviews at {{the time}} of its release and has continued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used as the basis for the 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the Swordquest games. The <b>Easter</b> <b>egg</b> concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, an Apple II {{software}} cracker {{team found}} an <b>Easter</b> <b>egg</b> {{hidden by the}} game's creator 33 years prior. Cook had hidden a secret congratulations screen in the game for players who entered a specific keyboard key combination at a specific time and solved the resulting series of substitution ciphered clues. Cook congratulated the cracker team on Twitter. The crackers found the secret while working to preserve the game for the Internet Archive by removing its digital copyright protections. One of the crackers said that while most 1980s games could be cracked by automation, Gumball protections, coded by Roland Gustafsson, were exceptional.|$|E
5|$|Operation Osterei (<b>Easter</b> <b>Egg)</b> {{began on}} 12 April 1944 {{with the goal}} of {{clearing}} the Majevica mountain, which was held by elements of the 3rd Corps led by General Kosta Nađ. The 27th Regiment quickly captured Janja and drove through Donja Trnova to reach the Ugljevik coal mines, an important economic objective for the German war machine. Following fighting which continued into the evening of 13 April, the 27th Regiment reported Partisan casualties of 106 dead, 45 captured and two deserters along with large amounts of weapons and ammunition. The regiment also seized a huge amount of medical supplies from aid stations in the area of Donja Trnova.|$|E
5|$|Adventure {{was named}} after Colossal Cave Adventure. Robinett began {{designing}} the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978. Robinett was aware early on that memory use {{was going to be}} critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 bytes (4 KB) on the cartridge ROM, and 128 bytes for program variables in the 2600's RAM; in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of kilobytes of memory. The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's <b>Easter</b> <b>egg),</b> with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California Berkeley, with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.|$|E

As such, for Christians, the <b>Easter</b> <b>egg</b> is a symbol of the empty tomb. The oldest tradition is to use dyed chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute decorated chocolate, or plastic eggs filled with candy such as jellybeans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} graduation thesis deals with Easter holidays, customs and traditions. It focuses mainly on the history and development of <b>Easter</b> <b>eggs</b> {{and especially in the}} Jindřichův Hradec region. It describes the techniques and tools that are used to decorate <b>Easter</b> <b>eggs.</b> It documents the <b>Easter</b> <b>eggs</b> patterns typical for this region and introduces some creators. In the practical part of the graduation thesis the author created, based on previous documentation and consultation with the creators of <b>Easter</b> <b>eggs,</b> samplers of own motives. The first sampler is based on the so-called "blatské straky" patterns and builds on some of the traditional patterns of the region. The second one is inspired by nature and it is the artistic stylization of flowers and leaves. Both samplers are for inspiration for creative work in creative clubs or school environment. Also they should help to maintain the traditional Easter customs...|$|R
