5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} are required for good health, there <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if they are actually beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidant(s) are needed from the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake. Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{criticism}} of Eddy <b>is</b> <b>considerable.</b> She {{is portrayed as}} greedy, uneducated and deceitful, someone who regularly revised her life story and was interested only in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention or avoid punishment, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed a habit of appearing to be seriously ill only to recover quickly.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} chelicerates {{from the early}} arthropods have been debated for decades. Although there <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> agreement about the relationships between most chelicerate sub-groups, {{the inclusion of the}} Pycnogonida in this taxon has recently been questioned (see below), and the exact position of scorpions is still controversial, though they were long considered the most primitive (basal) of the arachnids.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} widely {{recognised}} subspecies of the Egyptian vulture, although there <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> gradation due to movement and intermixing of the populations. The nominate subspecies, N. p. percnopterus, {{has the largest}} range, occurring in southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and the north-west of India. Populations breeding in the temperate zone migrate south during winter. It has a dark grey bill.|$|E

5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> {{uncertainty}} about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective. Psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self-harm {{and as a result}} self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems. Many people who self-harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used. There is tentative evidence for the medication flupentixol; however, greater study is required before it can be recommended.|$|E
5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E

The archeological {{significance}} of the site <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> as the majority of slave quarters in the Southern United States were not built with quality materials, and most quarters were destroyed after emancipation.

5|$|In the Middle Ages, the Strand {{became the}} {{principal}} route between the separate settlements of the City of London (the civil and commercial centre) and the royal Palace of Westminster (the national political centre). In the archaeological record, there <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> evidence of occupation {{to the north}} of Aldwych, but much along the former foreshore has been covered by rubble from the demolition of the Tudor Somerset Place, a former royal residence, to create a large platform for the building of the first Somerset House, in the 17th century. The landmark Eleanor's Cross was built in the 13th century at the western end of the Strand at Charing Cross by Edward I commemorating his wife Eleanor of Castile. It was demolished in 1647 by the request of Parliament during the First English Civil War, but reconstructed in 1865.|$|E
5|$|Insects possess {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax {{and one or two}} pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems. There <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.|$|E

5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} MAR {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E

Among enthusiasts, there <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as homebrewing, using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.|$|E

There <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
