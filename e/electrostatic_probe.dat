The theory was constructed by considering both random and directed motion simultaneous with dynamic coupling of the flow properties and of the electric field of the probe. This direct approach yielded a theory that is more general than static plasma theories modified to account for flow.

40|$|This {{communication}} {{reports the}} generation of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>probe</b> using chemical modification of methionine side chains. The alkylation of methionine by iodoacetamide was achieved {{in a set of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso- 1 -cytochrome c mutants, introducing the nontitratable, nondelocalized positive charge of a carboxyamidomethylmethionine sulfonium (CAMMS) ion at five surface and one buried site in the protein. Changes in redox potential and its variation with temperature were used to calculate microscopic effective dielectric constants operating between the probe and the heme iron.

40|$|Jet Electrochemical Machining (Jet-ECM) is a {{manufacturing}} technique that applies a free electrolyte jet {{to generate the}} desired shapes [1]. Since {{the principle of the}} technique is the same as other techniques of Electrochemical Machining where the material removal takes place based on the anodic dissolution of workpiece, the working distance, which is the distance between nozzle’s front surface and the workpiece surface, is one important parameter of the process. The working distance affects the current density and consequently the geometry removal. The control of the working distance can be done based on the data gathered before and during machining by surface measurement [2]. This measurement usually is done by using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>probing</b> to detect a limited amount of points of the initial workpiece surface. Since <b>electrostatic</b> <b>probing</b> is comparatively slow, laser triangulation represents an alternative technique to detect a larger amount of points before machining within significantly shorter time [3]. In addition to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>probing</b> and laser triangulation, the actual working distance can be measured during the machining process to realize constant working distance. This can be done by detecting electrical signals like the actual total current. This method can be combined with pre-machining measurement by laser triangulation in order to ensure the prevention of any collision between the nozzle and the workpiece. In this study, on-machine metrology techniques for measuring the working gap as well as current measurements will be compared. Besides, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these techniques will be systematized. In further studies, the possibility of combining the techniques will be investigated to enhance Jet-ECM with more accurate measurement techniques...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of laser photodetachment (LPD) {{technique}} has been developed for the measurement of electron sheath thickness around an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>probe</b> and for the measurement {{of the length of}} collection region of photodetached electrons (PDE). When a thickness of the sheath formed around an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>probe</b> is thicker than about 0. 1 mm, modification of the temporal evolution of the LPD signal is observed. By making use of the modification, we evaluated sheath thickness around a cylindrical probe in the existence of the magnetic field of 15 mT. It was found that the thickness of electron sheath along the magnetic field was comparable to the calculated plane-parallel Child-Langmuir sheath thickness when the probe-bias voltage was high. Furthermore, by inserting a small screening object in the laser beam channel, we can measure the sheath thickness from the modification of LPD signal. From the variation of the signal intensity as scanning the screening object perpendicular to the laser beam channel, we can observe the collection region of photodetached electrons, because this procedure changes the relative displacement between shadow and the probe electrode.
