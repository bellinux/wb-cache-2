In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand).|$|E

She was then assigned as guard ship at Hull until 1890. After reconstruction she became guard ship at Pembroke Dock until 1895, then at Gibraltar between 1895 and 1902, then relieved Hotspur as guard ship at Bermuda until her sale in 1907.|$|E

5|$|Aroma {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> odour or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling Lactarius helvus, or the similar quabalactone III in Lactarius rubidus which causes a maple syrup-like odour in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate {{from the blue}} Lactarius indigo or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow Russula flavida. Some Russula species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called russupteridines that are {{not found in the}} milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.|$|E
5|$|In early 1948, Nick Shoemaker, Wiescamp's senior {{stallion}} and Skipper W's sire, {{died in a}} freak accident {{while in}} his paddock, by slipping on some ice and breaking his neck against a fence.

During his entire career, Skipper W never was bred to any mare that was not owned by Wiescamp. Wiescamp {{wanted to make sure that}} the mares that he bred his stallions to were the best possible matches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> stallion.

5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to be just, the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E
