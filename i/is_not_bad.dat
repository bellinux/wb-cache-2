25|$|In {{contrary}} to her fearful demeanor, Bella, according to Edward in Midnight Sun, has {{no sense of}} fear when she finds out Edward is a vampire. Instead of running away, as she should have, she decides to ask lots of questions with extreme curiosity. This makes Edward believe that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> luck that follows her around, but that she has no sense of self-preservation. Bella isn't very rational nor sensible as she lacks common sense and street intelligence.|$|E
500|$|The scandal grew after Joey de Leon, one of {{the hosts}} of Eat Bulaga!—a rival variety show {{broadcast}} by GMA Network, began making comments about the incident - ending an edition of his Manila Bulletin entertainment column about the incident with the statement, [...] "Teasing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad.</b> [...] Cheating is ... on TV." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Schumacher {{admitted}} to having mixed feelings after the race, having been in second position until the race's last laps. The Mercedes driver stated: [...] "I would obviously have loved to finish there [...] and be on the podium again. But {{even if it did}} not work out in the very end, we can be happy about the result and the big fight we put in." [...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Webb revealed that the video was a sequel of the music video [...] "Ocean Avenue"; [...] "The 'Holly' video expands {{on some of the}} elements of the 'Ocean Avenue' clip. There are references to it, particularly some scenes involving a suitcase. It refers to that world, and I liked the idea of paralleling the band's experiences {{over the past two years}} with some of the things [...] Ryan [...] is going through in this video." [...] Webb went on to add that the reason Key is sprinting through Los Angeles, once again, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> guys that are after him, it is his [...] "own personal demons". Webb concluded that before filming began for the video, he had wanted to learn the experience that Key and bassist Peter Mosely were going through in New York, as they moved there to begin working on Lights and Sounds, and about the things they saw while they were there.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson {{had formed}} a close {{relationship}} with Morrison, personally and politically, before and during their wartime ministerial association. She thought that he, rather than the sedate Attlee, should be leading the Labour Party, and had promoted his leadership credentials in 1935 and 1939. In 1945, Morrison [...] informed Attlee that he intended to seek the leadership [...] "in the interests of party unity". In the general election held in July 1945 Labour won a landslide victory, with 393 seats against the Conservatives' 213. This did not prevent Wilkinson and others from continuing to press for a change of leader, but Attlee forestalled further action by quickly accepting the king's invitation to form a government. He showed no resentment towards either Morrison or Wilkinson; the former was appointed Lord President of the Council and deputy prime minister, while Wilkinson was made Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet. Emmanuel Shinwell, who became Minister of Fuel and Power, later commented that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> tactics to make one's enemies one's servants".|$|E

500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad.</b> We must work very hard now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{have given}} {{suggestions}} as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a [...] "psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else." [...] Kirzinger {{goes on to}} say that Jason is a [...] "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, [...] "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values." [...] Todd Farmer, writer for Jason X, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to what he will do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> enough to hurt animals. Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives, stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.|$|E
500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad,</b> is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} Credere e conoscere, {{published}} {{shortly before his}} death, Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the former Archbishop of Milan, set out his disagreement with opposition by Catholics to homosexual civil unions: [...] "I disagree with the positions {{of those in the}} Church, that take issue with civil unions ... It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad,</b> instead of casual sex between men, that two people have a certain stability". He said that the [...] "state could recognize them". Although he stated his belief that [...] "the homosexual couple, as such, can never be totally equated to a marriage", he also said that he could understand (although not necessarily approve of) gay pride parades when they support the need for self-affirmation.|$|E

2500|$|Karma {{is a word}} which {{literally}} means [...] "action" [...] and is seen as {{a natural}} law of the universe which manifests as cause and effect. In the Buddhist conception, Karma is a certain type of moral action which has moral consequences on the actor. The core of karma is the mental intention, and hence the Buddha stated [...] ‘It is intention (cetana), O monks, that I call karma; having willed one acts through body, speech, or mind’ (AN 6.63). Therefore, accidentally hurting someone <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> Karma, but having hurtful thoughts is. Buddhist ethics sees these patterns of motives and actions as conditioning future actions and circumstances - the fruit (Phala) of one's present actions, including the condition and place of the actor's future life circumstances (though these can also be influenced by other random factors). One's past actions are said to mold one's consciousness and to leave seeds (Bīja) which later ripen in the next life. The goal of Buddhist practice is generally to break the cycle, though one can also work for rebirth in a better condition through good deeds.|$|E
2500|$|After {{writing and}} {{thinking}} about the harlequinade for half a century, and like some of Gilbert's earlier works, The Fairy's Dilemma [...] "sets pantomime fantasy alongside modern everyday life... a harlequinade parodied and subverted." [...] As The Observer noted in their opening night review of the piece, Gilbert turns inside out, as no other dramatist could do as well, conventional Christmas pantomimes, [...] "with their good fairies and wicked demons supernaturally influencing the destinies of unnatural lovers.... Mr. Gilbert makes the goodness of the Fairy Rosebud as perfunctory as the wickedness of the Demon Alcohol; and it is she who, {{with a view to}} her own professional advancement, invents for the Demon the malignant plot". Further, in a parody of the melodramatic conventions of the Victorian era, the bad baronet <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad,</b> the innocent damsel is not innocent, and the stern judge delights in entertaining his court. When the judge turns into Pantaloon, he exclaims, [...] "it's not as great a change as I should have supposed!" [...] As with Gilbert's typical comedies, the joke [...] "depends for much of its point upon the grave unconsciousness of its interpreters".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2016, the YouTube channel Every Frame a Painting, which {{analyzes}} {{films and}} the filmmaking process, posted a video essay discussing {{the music of}} the MCU. The video also highlights the lack of memorability for general audience members compared to franchises such as Star Wars and James Bond, and proposes several reasons for why this is: the tendency for the music to be background noise, or to be [...] "hidden" [...] behind other sounds such as voiceovers; how it closely reflects the events on screen, and so does not stand out or surprise the audience; and how it is often similar to other music, which the video blames on the temp process and filmmakers editing the film to the temp music before bringing in the composer, or asking composers to imitate the temp tracks. Saying that the music <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>bad,</b> just [...] "bland and inoffensive", the video states that Marvel could improve their music by simply taking more risks with it, like putting more emphasis on the music without any other sound effects, or mismatching it with the visuals—for example, playing [...] "emotional" [...] music during an otherwise [...] "humorous" [...] scene to give more impact to the underlying feelings of the characters rather than their surface actions.|$|E
