5|$|On 6 July 1819, the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, her hydrogen-filled balloon {{caught fire}} and Blanchard, {{entangled}} in the surrounding net, <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death. She {{was reported to be}} unusually nervous before starting this ascent.|$|E
5|$|A lifelong smoker, Montalban {{developed}} lung cancer, {{causing her}} death on 11 January 1982. The role of sorting out her financial affairs <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> friend, Pat Arthy, who discovered that despite her {{emphasis on the}} magical attainment of material wealth, she owned no property and that her estate was worth less than £10,000. The copyright of her writings <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> daughter, Rosanna, who entrusted {{the running of the}} OMS to two of Montalban's initiates, married couple Jo Sheridan and Alfred Douglas, who were authorised as the exclusive publishers of her correspondence course. Sheridan – whose real name was Patricia Douglas – opened an alternative therapy centre in Islington, North London, in the 1980s, before retiring to Rye, East Sussex in 2002, where she continued running the OMS correspondence course until her death in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Alizon Device, whose {{encounter}} with John Law had triggered {{the events leading}} up to the trials, was charged with causing harm by witchcraft. Uniquely among the accused, Alizon was confronted in court by her alleged victim, John Law. She seems to have genuinely believed in her own guilt; when Law was brought into court Alizon <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees in tears and confessed. She was found guilty.|$|E
60|$|Old Betty {{was proof}} even against this temptation, and <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> {{adjusting}} <b>her</b> black bonnet and shawl.|$|R
60|$|A man obeyed, and Heliodore's {{beautiful}} black hair, which I {{would not}} suffer <b>her</b> <b>to</b> cut, <b>fell</b> tumbling <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees.|$|R
60|$|After that I <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> asking <b>her</b> {{if she was}} not lonely up {{here among}} all these savage people and without any companions of her own age.|$|R
5|$|Ballooning was a risky {{business}} for the pioneers. Blanchard lost consciousness on a few occasions, endured freezing temperatures and almost drowned when her balloon crashed in a marsh. In 1819, {{she became the first}} woman to be killed in an aviation accident when, during an exhibition in the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, she launched fireworks that ignited the gas in her balloon. Her craft crashed on the roof of a house and she <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death. She is commonly referred to as Madame Blanchard and is also known by many combinations of her maiden and married names, including Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Sophie Armant and Madeleine-Sophie Armant Blanchard.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection. Following the trial, Lhermitte {{was not able to}} pay for the trial costs, so under Belgian law it <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> now ex-husband to pick up the bill. This conformed to the Law of Belgium, with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature of the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> feet, and a child's to its knees. The tunics {{of poor people}} and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Grant {{got up and}} <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> work at <b>her</b> {{dishes with}} a {{brighter}} face.|$|R
50|$|The king {{asked his}} mother what a fitting {{punishment}} {{would be for}} such an evil crime, and she prescribed being torn apart by twelve horses, and so she <b>fell</b> victim <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own punishment.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is such an}} {{inquisitive}} {{little body}} she is always poking that mite of a nose into everything; and as Paul Pry did not suit, the boys <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> calling <b>her</b> Pokey. Not a pretty name, but very expressive." ...|$|R
5|$|Varlyn Stroud is a convict. His {{original}} biography gives {{insight into}} his criminal past and names Stroud's sister Clara {{as his first}} murder. When Clara was nine years old, Stroud deliberately upset a Ferris wheel car so Clara <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death. Stroud's second murder was his grandfather three years later, which he covered as a hunting accident. Having possibly committed over a dozen contract-killings, Stroud was never convicted of murder, yet still {{spent most of his}} life in prison on a variety of charges. Stroud's story arc in the series begins in season 2 when he hears Brother Justin's radio sermon. Made Brother Justin's apostle in a subliminal message, Stroud escapes prison to find and bring Henry Scudder to Brother Justin. Stroud first tracks Scudder's old life and later follows the route of the carnival. With Ben's unintentional aid, Stroud finally finds the man he is looking for. After delivering Scudder to Brother Justin, Stroud becomes his security manager, which significantly hinders the carnival's aim to kill Brother Justin.|$|E
25|$|The {{exposed and}} {{technical}} {{nature of the}} usual climbing route that is usually climbed unroped {{has resulted in a}} number of fatalities; most recently on 23 March 2016 when a bushwalker <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death.|$|E
25|$|In June 1995, a 24-year-old model, Caroline Byrne, <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{death at}} The Gap. Due to the notoriety of the area, police did not {{initially}} suspect foul play. However, in 2008, her then-boyfriend {{was convicted of}} pushing her over the edge. He was later acquitted of murder in February 2012.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Anne, Anne!' {{he burst}} out as, racked between honour and desire, he {{snatched}} up her hand. The next moment it <b>fell</b> heavily <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lap. He had absolutely relinquished it half-way to his lips.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> {{smoothing}} <b>her</b> gloves again; {{they were}} long, loose gloves {{on which she}} could freely expend herself. Soon, however, she looked up, and then, [...] "Ah, Ralph, you give me no help!" [...] she cried abruptly and passionately.|$|R
60|$|The fingers {{which he}} {{released}} <b>fell</b> nervelessly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side. She {{stood looking at}} him as if confronted with a sudden nightmare. It was as if this new-found life were being slowly drained from her veins.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the past}} several years, INAH, which manages the site, has been closing monuments to public access. While {{visitors}} can walk around them, {{they can no longer}} climb them or go inside their chambers. The most recent was El Castillo, which was closed after a San Diego, California, woman <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death in 2006.|$|E
25|$|On 7 May 2015, ethnic Kurds rioted {{following}} the unexplained death on 4 May 2015 of Farinaz Khosravani, a Kurdish hotel chambermaid. Khosravani <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death from a fourth-floor {{window of the}} Tara, the hotel where she worked. Anger mounted following reports that Khosravani died attempting to escape an Iranian official who was threatening to rape her. The rioters reportedly {{set fire to the}} hotel where Khosravani worked.|$|E
25|$|Ross Castle, a mock ruin of {{a castle}} built in 1863 by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, {{was named after}} Ernest Ross, {{secretary}} of the railway company. Its height was the highest point on the cliffs. After a period of closure, the castle was renovated, re-opening in June 2008 to the public. Possibilities of a further closure have been raised after a woman <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death on 9 January 2009.|$|E
60|$|So kind, so {{very kind}} was she to them all, that when, {{after an hour}} of merry play, she took <b>her</b> brother in <b>to</b> bed, the three who {{remained}} <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> praising <b>her</b> enthusiastically as they put things to rights before taking leave.|$|R
60|$|Finally {{they both}} grew silent, {{and in a}} little while there came a snore from Mrs. Kemp; <b>her</b> head <b>fell</b> forward <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chest; Liza tumbled from <b>her</b> chair on <b>to</b> the bed, and {{sprawling}} across it fell asleep.|$|R
50|$|Grace dies in Goat island {{because she}} was twirled and <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> hit <b>her</b> head on a rock. Louisa dreams of what would Grace would have been like, {{claiming}} that it lightens her spirit. Franklin Fiske still tries to court Louisa, but Louisa knows she won't get married.|$|R
25|$|On June 9, 1991, 32-year-old Candy Taylor of Toledo, Ohio, <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{death from}} Flight Commander, an Intamin Flight Trainer, located at Kings Island. Investigators {{determined}} that a design flaw in the seat divider could allow a rider to slide into an unoccupied seat and become free from the restraint. A coroner's report later revealed that the victim had a blood-alcohol level of 0.30 which may have also contributed. Speculation suggests the rider lost consciousness during the ride and slid out from the restraints.|$|E
500|$|On July 19, 2013, a 52-year-old woman <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death {{while riding}} New Texas Giant. A park {{official}} {{released a statement}} saying, [...] "We are committed to determining {{the cause of this}} tragic accident and will utilize every resource throughout this process ... When we have new information to provide, we will do so." [...] The ride was closed indefinitely pending further investigation. The park completed its investigation stating on September 10, 2013, that mechanical failure was not to blame. The ride reopened on September 14, 2013, with all three trains featuring a re-designed restraint bar, pads, and seat belts. The incident resulted in the introduction of seat belts as a precaution on other roller coasters throughout the Six Flags chain.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{was born}} in Springfield, Massachusetts to an Irish {{immigrant}} family. Growing up in that state, she left school around the age of 14 to help support both her widowed mother and her siblings. Likely starting work in the local textile mills, she gained clerical training at night school before working as a clerk in Worcester for eighteen years. [...] In 1904, O'Reilly gained a position at the Mint Bureau, resulting in a move to Washington, D.C. [...] She rose rapidly in the bureau's hierarchy [...] an unusual feat for a woman at that time [...] and was frequently called upon {{to testify before the}} United States Congress. As many of the Mint's directors were political appointees who had little knowledge or interest in the bureau's operations, the task of running the institution often <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> In 1924 she was officially appointed Assistant Director.|$|E
60|$|She gave a lurch, {{and nearly}} <b>fell.</b> <b>To</b> save <b>her</b> the man {{put his arm}} round her waist. She clasped him round the neck, and {{together}} they spun round two or three times; while {{at the very moment}} a piano-organ at the opposite corner struck up a waltz.|$|R
25|$|In 1989, a 13-year-old girl {{stood up}} and <b>fell</b> 35 feet <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death. She was {{pronounced}} dead at the scene.|$|R
60|$|Again I <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> chafing <b>her</b> {{hands and}} <b>to</b> moving <b>her</b> arms {{up and down}} and about until she could thrash them herself. Then I {{compelled}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stand up, and though she would have fallen had I not supported her, I forced <b>her</b> <b>to</b> walk back and forth the several steps between the thwart and the stern-sheets, and finally to spring up and down.|$|R
500|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were mostly positive, with Walton of The Moving Picture News stating, [...] " [...] variant of Enoch Arden, with a newspaperman interjected. The resurrected {{undesirable}} husband is cleverly eliminated. The coincidences are too miraculous to suit a plain newspaperman." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror agreed in premise that {{the plot of the}} film had been done before, but stated, [...] "...the Thanhouser people have done it fairly well and added a few details which, while not quite logical, give it some new interest." [...] The Moving Picture World offered a neutral summary of the plot, but concluded that the film [...] "is a graphic illustration of conditions which might arise almost any time, and develops an interestingly dramatic story as it proceeds." [...] One local review of the film called it [...] "splendid", but either by typographical error or for reasons unknown, gives a different story of the plot and even stating that the wife <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death by accident when attempting to see her.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé first {{performed}} [...] "1+1" [...] live on American Idol on May 25, 2011. Wearing {{a purple}} gown, she sang the song surrounded by smoke and red lighting, declaring, [...] "This {{is my favorite}} song". Towards {{the end of the}} performance, she <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knees and shook the hands of audience members. The performance earned her a standing ovation from the judges and members of the crowd. A writer from The Huffington Post called it [...] "an epic, emotionally-charged performance" [...] and praised the fact that Beyoncé [...] "channel every particle of the room's energy into her lung-bursting calls and cries." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard magazine noted, [...] "The sheer force of the ballad literally brought [...] to her knees during the performance." [...] Shortly after Beyoncé's performance on American Idol, a video that surfaced online received considerable coverage from music critics. It became an instant viral video as soon as it hit the web. The clip was filmed using a camera phone and it shows Beyoncé rehearsing [...] "1+1" [...] backstage at American Idol with no microphone and simple keyboard accompaniment. The video was filmed by Beyoncé'ss husband, Jay-Z. In an introduction to the video on his Life + Times website he wrote: [...] "Sometimes you need perspective. You've been right in front of greatness so often that you need to step back and see it again for the first time." [...] In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number eight on their list of Beyoncé's ten best videos, writing that she sounds [...] "perfect". While reviewing 4, Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal complimented the video, writing: ...|$|E
500|$|The Octagon House (1799 New York Avenue NW) is {{reported}} to be the most haunted home in D.C. It was built in 1801 by Colonel John Tayloe III. The Tayloes were a greatly distinguished Virginia family: His grandfather, Colonel John Tayloe (d. 1747), {{was a member of the}} King's Council in Virginia and owner of more than [...] of land (a huge estate at the time), and his father, Colonel John Tayloe II, built the historic Mount Airy manor house in 1758 and was also a member of the King's Council. John Tayloe III was a close friend of George Washington's, and Washington convinced Tayloe to build a winter home in the new city of Washington. There is some evidence that the walled back yard of The Octagon itself may have served as a slave market, and it is well-established that the rear of the building housed the Tayloe family's slaves. The Tayloe family was exceptionally well-connected, and their home was an important one in the city. After the burning of the White House in the War of 1812, President James and Dolley Madison lived there from September 1814 to October 1815, and Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent (which ended the war) there in February 1815. Apparitions and the presence of otherworldly forces have been seen and felt in many places at The Octagon, including on the spiral staircase, the second floor landing, the third floor landing, the third floor bedroom, and the garden area in the rear. Among the eyewitnesses have been members of the public, and curators and other employees hired by the museum which owns the house. Two of Colonel Tayloe's daughters are said to haunt The Octagon. The first allegedly died before the War of 1812. Colonel Tayloe and his daughter quarreled on the second floor landing over the girl's relationship with a British officer stationed in the city. When the daughter turned in anger to go down the stairs, she fell down the stairs (or over the railing; stories differ) and died. Her specter is allegedly seen crumpled at the bottom of the steps or on the stairs near the second floor landing, and sometimes exhibits itself as the light of a candle moving up the staircase. The other death, stories claim, occurred in 1817 or shortly thereafter. Another of Colonel Tayloe's daughters eloped with a young man, incurring her father's wrath. When she returned home to reconcile with her father, they argued on the third-floor landing. This daughter, too, <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> death down the stairs (or over the railing), and her shade is alleged to haunt the third floor landing and stairs between the second and third floors.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny Assingham sharply laughed, then irrepressibly <b>fell</b> back <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{constant}} position. [...] "You're splendid--perfectly splendid."
