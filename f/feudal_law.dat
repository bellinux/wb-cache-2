5|$|Over {{the century}} that followed, Norman <b>feudal</b> <b>law</b> {{gradually}} replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law {{so that by}} the late 13th century the Norman-Irish had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the Magna Carta (the Great Charter of Ireland), substituting Dublin for London and Irish Church for Church of England, was published in 1216 and the Parliament of Ireland was founded in 1297.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} {{widespread}} attempts to codify {{and comment on}} the Scottish legal system. The first substantive account of Scottish law was the Practicks of Bishop John Sinclair (d. 1566), senator of the College of Justice. This was followed by James Balfour's (c. 1525–83) Practicks, who with Sir John Skene of Curriehill (c. 1543–1617), was a major figure in the move to codification. Skene produced an edition of the Acts of Parliament and a legal dictionary, De Verborum Significatione and edited Regiam Maisestatem, {{a history of the}} Scottish law, which attributed much of its creation to David I. Thomas Craig of Riccarton (c. 1538–1608) produced two large works, Jus Feudale, which examined <b>feudal</b> <b>law,</b> and De Unione Regnorum Britanniae, which explored the possibilities of unifying the English and Scottish legal systems. Often seen as the beginning of modern Scottish legal study is James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair's (1619–95) The Institutions of the Law of Scotland (1681).|$|E

His Kingdom, since regained, passed to Strongbow (Richard de Clare), contrary to Irish custom. Strongbow had married Aoife (or Eva), Diarmait's daughter, in 1170.

25|$|For {{the fiscal}} year 1625/1626 the overall {{revenues}} of the convent amounted to Mark 3,014 Shilling1 and Pfennig10, its expenses were Mk 3,118:14:7. For 1626/1627 the corresponding numbers were 3,498.14.7 and 3,617.11.10. By {{the end of the}} 17th century the convent's revenues divided into Mk 2,671.28.4 of fix and Mk 1,854.25.3 of variable receipts. The farmers in Himmelpforten were all subject to serjeanty to the convent and had to pay a lease for the land, which they tilled. All of the convent's estates (Meierhöfe) leased under <b>feudal</b> <b>law</b> were heritable under the principle of ultimogeniture (Minorat). Originally most dues were in kind, later they were monetised, and even partially collected by third parties such as publicans, sometimes being the collective of tax-payers themselves, such as the tithing farmers of Isensee, Twielenfleth, Uthwege, Großenwörden, , Kehdingen or Altes Land, who thus economised their charges.|$|E

The power of the Black Douglas overshadowed the crown under the weak rule of Robert III.

Rothesay was already contracted to marry Elizabeth Dunbar, daughter of George I, Earl of March, who had paid a large sum for the honour. March, alienated from his allegiance by this breach of faith on the king's part, now joined the English forces.|$|E

25|$|Thirlage was the <b>feudal</b> <b>law</b> {{by which}} the laird could force all those farmers living on his lands to bring their grain to his mill to be ground. Additionally they had to carry out repairs on the mill, {{maintain}} the lade and weir, as well as conveying new millstones to the site. The Thirlage Law was repealed in 1779 and after this many mills fell out of use as competition and unsubsidised running costs took their toll. This may explain why {{no sign of the}} mill is visible on Thomson's 1828 map, Aitken's 1829 map, or the 1858 OS map. Other mills, such as Dalgarven Mill near Kilwinning, survived almost to the present day through a mixture of luck, a reliable water supply and investment at the right time. Dalgarven Mill is now a museum. The last unrestored working mill in Ayrshire was Coldstream near Beith which last worked in 1979; the last traditional Ayrshire miller being Andrew Smith.|$|E
500|$|Cardiff Castle was a motte-and-bailey design. The old Roman walls had {{collapsed}} and the Normans used their remains {{as the basis}} for the outer castle perimeter, digging a defensive trench and throwing up a [...] high bank of earth over the Roman fortifications. The Normans further divided the castle with an internal wall to form an inner and an outer bailey. In the north-west corner of the castle a wooden keep was constructed on top of a [...] tall earth motte, surrounded by a [...] wide moat. The motte was the largest built in Wales. The overall area of the castle was around the inner bailey was around [...] in area. Mills were essential to local communities during this period, and the castle mill was located outside the west side of the castle, fed by the River Taff; under local <b>feudal</b> <b>law,</b> the residents of Cardiff were required to use this mill to grind their own grain.|$|E

He later observed that many protests were sparked by an oft-reprinted sermon of Boston minister Jonathan Mayhew, invoking Romans 13 to justify insurrection. In 1766, a town meeting of Braintree elected John Adams as a selectman. [...] Adams strongly supported the right of all Americans to jury trials. Adams protested the 1765 passage of the Stamp Act, which gave jurisdiction to British Vice Admiralty Courts, rather than common law courts. [...] Many colonists, including Adams, believed these courts, which operated without a jury, were corrupt and unfair.|$|E

50|$|The Italians decreed {{miscegenation}} to be illegal. Racial separation, including residential segregation, was enforced {{as thoroughly}} {{as possible and}} the Italians showed favouritism to non-Christian {{groups such as the}} Oromos, the Somalis and other Muslims (many of whom had supported the Italian invasion). In an attempt to isolate the dominant Amhara rulers of Ethiopia, who supported Haile Selassie I, the Italians granted the Oromos, the Somalis and other Muslims autonomy and rights. The Italians also definitively abolished slavery and abrogated <b>feudal</b> <b>laws</b> previously upheld by the Amharas.|$|R
60|$|Nor {{could she}} resist {{the belief that}} the feeling of the rich towards the poor was not that {{sentiment}} of unmingled hate and scorn which she associated with Norman conquerors and <b>feudal</b> <b>laws.</b> She would ascribe rather the want of sympathy that unquestionably exists between Wealth and Work in England, to mutual ignorance between the classes which possess these two great elements of national prosperity; and though the source of that ignorance was to be sought in antecedent circumstances of violence and oppression, the consequences perhaps had outlived the causes, as customs survive opinions.|$|R
500|$|Bohemond's lands were {{to include}} St Simeon and the coast, {{the towns of}} Baghras and Artah, and the Latin {{possessions}} in the Jebel as-Summaq. Latakia and Cilicia, however, were to revert to direct Byzantine rule. As Thomas Asbridge points out, {{much of what the}} Emperor granted to Bohemond (including Aleppo itself) was still in Muslim hands (e.g. neither Bohemond nor Alexios controlled Edessa, although at the time Tancred was regent there as well as in Antioch), which contradicts Lilie's assessment that Bohemond did well out of the Treaty. René Grousset calls the Treaty a [...] "Diktat", but Jean Richard underscores that the rules of <b>feudal</b> <b>law</b> to which Bohemond had to submit [...] "were in no way humiliating." [...] According to John W. Birkenmeier, the Treaty marked the point at which Alexios had developed a new army, and new tactical doctrines with which to use it, {{but it was not a}} Byzantine political success; [...] "it traded Bohemond's freedom for a titular overlordship of Southern Italy that could never be effective, and for an occupation of Antioch that could never be carried out." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{as many as}} 83 {{people living}} in the castle at any one time, the castle {{played a major role in}} the {{surrounding}} economy during the period. Large amounts of food and drink were purchased to support the household – over twelve months in 1385-6, for example, over £1,000 was spent, including the purchase of [...] of ale and 70,321 loaves of bread. By the 14th century the castle was purchasing goods from across western Europe, with wine being imported from France, venison from parks as far away as Northamptonshire and spices from the Far East through London-based merchants. The castle purchased some goods, such as salt, through the annual Stourbridge Fair at nearby Cambridge, then one of the biggest economic events in Europe. Some of this expenditure was supported by the demesne manor attached to the castle, which comprised [...] of land and 5,000 days of serf labour under <b>feudal</b> <b>law.</b> A vineyard was created at the castle in the late 12th century, and a bakery and a horse mill were built in the castle by the 14th century. Surrounding manors also fed in resources to the castle; in twelve months between 1275–6, £434 was received by the castle from the wider region.|$|E
2500|$|Lombard law, as {{developed}} by the Italian jurists, {{was by far the}} most sophisticated of the early Germanic systems, and some (e.g. Frederic William Maitland) have seen striking similarities between it and early English law. [...] It remained living law, subject to modifications, both in the Kingdom of the Lombards that became the Carolingian Kingdom of Italy and in the Duchy of Benevento that became the Kingdom of Naples and continued {{to play a role in}} the latter as late as the 18th century. [...] The Libri Feudorum, explaining the distinctive Lombard version of feudalism, were frequently printed together with the Corpus Juris Civilis and were considered the academic standard for <b>feudal</b> <b>law,</b> influencing other countries including Scotland.|$|E

This might be considered an unusual practice in England, but it was more common in Scotland and in Western feudal tradition. Because of this, Dervorguilla bequeathed lands in Galloway to her descendants, the Balliol and the Comyns. Dervorguilla's son John of Scotland was briefly a King of Scots too, known as Toom Tabard (Scots: 'puppet king' literally [...] "empty coat").|$|R

By the 18th century the county still represented about half {{the territory of the}} entire canton. They divided the county into six administrative regions and appointed a Landvogt who ruled the entire county from Kyburg Castle. Under the Landvogt there were six Untervogten who administered the six regions. The position of Landvogt became a springboard to becoming a member of the city council or the mayor of Zürich. Beginning in 1535 the Landvogt was appointed by the council for a period of six years.|$|R
2500|$|Venice did {{not appear}} in the Peloponnese until 1206 or 1207, when a fleet took the Messenian {{peninsula}} with the two forts of Modon and Coron from Champlitte's men. In late 1208, Champlitte left the Peloponnese to take up his inheritance in Burgundy, and Villehardouin succeeded him as ruler of the new Frankish state, adroitly exploiting <b>feudal</b> <b>law</b> to avoid Champlitte's nephew from taking up the title instead. In May 1209, Geoffrey of Villehardouin participated in the Parliament of Ravennika, convened by the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders. It was probably there—and likely through the Emperor's mediation—that negotiations began to reach a settlement reconciling Villehardouin's de facto [...] possession of the Peloponnese and the Venetian claims, which led to the signing of a treaty at the island of Sapienza, off Modon, in June.|$|E
