40|$|Populations {{of social}} mammals are {{characterized}} by several demographic features that may increase the magnitude of genetic drift relative to other evolutionary forces. In particular, polygynous mating and socially mediated constraints on gene flow have been proposed to foster random genetic differentiation among social groups, thereby accelerating rates of evolutionary change. To evaluate this hypothesized link between sociality and genetic <b>sub-</b> <b>division,</b> I examined results of published studies of mammalian populations in which genetic structuring was assessed {{at the level of}} social groups. Population genetic data from a taxonomically diverse array of social mammals revealed low to moderately high levels of genetic differentiation among social groups (FsT = 0. 006 - 0. 227), coupled with consistently high levels of within-group heterozygosity indicated by negative Fis-values. Relatively higher levels of genetic structuring were observed in populations in which sampling effects associated with polygynous mating were reinforced by female philopatry. The degree of genetic subdivision observed in several taxa, most notably black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus), indicated that social organization can have a profound impact on population genetic structure. However, in most cases, social barriers to gene flow are likely insufficient to promote the degree of genetic subdivision and inbreeding envisioned by models of rapid drift-induced speciation. It appears that social mammals generally {{are characterized by}} a dynamic non-equilibrium mode of population structure in which local demes are characterized simultaneously by small variance effective sizes and large inbreeding effective sizes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use geo-coded, {{individual}} level register data on four European countries to compute comparative measures of segregation that {{are independent of}} existing geographical <b>sub-</b> <b>divisions.</b> The focus is on non-European migrants, and using aggregates for egocentric neighbourhoods with different population counts, small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale segregation patterns are assessed. At the smallest scale level, corresponding to neighbourhoods with 200 persons, patterns of over- and under-representation are strikingly similar. At larger scale levels, Belgium stands out as having relatively strong over- and under-representation. More than 55 % of the Belgian population lives in large-scale neighbourhoods with moderate under- or over- representation of non-European migrants. In the other countries, the corresponding figures are between 30 % and 40 %. Possible explanations for this pattern are differences in housing policies and refugee placement policies. Sweden has the largest and Denmark the smallest non-European migrant population, in relative terms. Thus, in both migrant-dense and native-born dense areas, Swedish neighbourhoods have a higher concentration, and Denmark a lower concentration of non- European migrants than the other countries. For large-scale, migrant-dense neighbourhoods, however, levels of concentration are similar in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

Initially work centred on the enrichment, isolation and enumeration of the chemoorganotrophic species Ancalomicrobium,Caulobacter and IIyphomicrobium from freshwater sources which varied in eutrophication levels. Induction and repression of the multiappendaged form of an Ancalomicrobium isolate, induced by environmental stimuli, was indicated. Additionally the morphological diversity of IIyphomicrobium found to be expressed in response to carbon source variation (methanol to methylamine) brings into doubt the validity of generic classification {{on the grounds of}} morphology. Of the appendaged photoorganotrophic (Athiorhodaceae) species isolated, the growth, and reproduction of a Rhodomicrobium species was studied in detail.

40|$|Introduction Over {{the period}} 2002 to 2010, Statistics New Zealand {{carried out a}} {{longitudinal}} survey known as the Survey of Family, Income and Employment (SoFIE). Some eight waves of data were collected. Every second wave (2003 / 2004, 2005 / 2006, 2007 / 2008, and 2009 / 2010), respondents were asked questions about their wealth holdings. In 2007 Statistics New Zealand published a paper by Jit Cheung, Wealth Disparities in New Zealand, {{based on data from}} wave 2. That paper provided an overview of net worth disparity, giving information by mean and by median, and other distribution information including the Gini coefficient and other percentile-based information. Results were also analysed by age, by major ethnic group, by family type, and also by gender, personal income decile, and region. This preliminary paper is the initial part of a project to use data from those waves. The project has two principal purposes: 	 	To update the Cheung 2007 paper to include data from waves 4, 6 and 8 of SoFIE; and in addition to extend the format of the results reported by Cheung based on wave 2 of SoFIE to include information as {{to the extent to which}} survey respondents in specified wealth <b>sub-</b> <b>divisions</b> moved between such sub-divisions over the course of the survey. 	 	 	To demonstrate the richness of the information gathered by SoFIE and to encourage further exploration of the survey’s wealth data. 	 In view of interest already expressed in the project, this preliminary paper provides updates to the main tables provided in the 2007 Cheung paper, using data from all four waves. As a departure from the usual approach for IGPS working papers, little interpretation of results is given; this will be contained in the final paper. Researchers are invited to take the results provided in this preliminary paper as a starting point for discussion of policy issues pertaining to the distribution of wealth, and to make their own in-depth investigations to illuminate the disparate processes of wealth accumulation. The authors welcome feedback as to particular areas of analysis suggested by the data in this paper. The final paper will include the longitudinal analysis mentioned above. This will be based on the data for the surviving respondents in wave 8, and analyse movement between quintiles in their net wealth holdings over the survey period, according to their wave 8 ethnicity, family type, age group, income quintile, gender and region. We plan to include some simple analysis of those who dropped out between waves, to the extent this is feasible. Finally, please note that the results presented here for wave 2 differ a little from the original results as the result of changes made to SoFIE population weightings after 2007. Also, the separate analysis in the 2007 paper of the position of individuals with negative net worth has not been repeated; we took the view that to be useful, this had to be done in more depth than was possible in the 2007 paper format...|$|R
40|$|Clouds of CO 2 ice {{particles}} {{have been}} observed in the Martian mesosphere. These clouds {{are believed to be}} formed through heterogeneous nucleation of CO 2 on nanometer-sized meteoric smoke particles (MSPs) or upward propagated Martian dust particles (MDPs). Large uncertainties still exist in parameterizing the microphysical formation process of these clouds as key physicochemical parameters are not well known. We present measurements on the nucleation and growth of CO 2 <b>ice</b> on <b>sub-</b> 4 [*]nm radius iron oxide and silica particles representing MSPs at conditions close to the mesosphere of Mars. For both particle materials we determine the desorption energy of CO 2 to be ΔFdes[*]=[*](18. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 2) kJ mol− 1 corresponding to ΔFdes[*]=[*](0. 192 [*]±[*] 0. 002) eV and obtain m[*]=[*] 0. 78 [*]± 0. 02 for the contact parameter that governs heterogeneous nucleation by analyzing the measurements using classical heterogeneous nucleation theory. We did not find any temperature dependence for the contact parameter in the temperature range examined (64 [*]K to 73 [*]K). By applying these values for MSPs in the Martian mesosphere, we derive characteristic temperatures for the onset of CO 2 ice nucleation, which are 8 – 18 [*]K below the CO 2 frost point temperature, depending on particle size. This is in line with the occurrence of highly supersaturated conditions extending to 20 [*]K below frost point temperature without the observation of clouds. Moreover, the sticking coefficient of CO 2 on solid CO 2 was determined to be near unity. We further argue that the same parameters can be applied to CO 2 nucleation on upward propagated MDPs...|$|R
40|$|Antarctic coastal sea ice often {{grows in}} water {{that has been}} {{supercooled}} by interaction with an ice shelf. In these situations, ice crystals can form at depth, rise and deposit under the sea-ice cover to form a porous layer that eventually consolidates near {{the base of the}} existing sea ice. The least consolidated portion is called the sub-ice platelet layer. Congelation growth eventually causes the <b>sub-</b> <b>ice</b> platelet layer to become frozen into the sea-ice cover as incorporated platelet ice. In this study, we simulate these processes in three dimensions using Voronoi dynamics to govern crystal growth kinetics. Platelet deposition, in situ growth and incorporation into the sea-ice cover are integrated into the model. Heat and mass transfer are controlled by diffusion. We extract and compare spatial–temporal distributions of porosity, salinity, temperature and crystallographic c-axes with observations from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The model captures the crystallographic structure of incorporated platelet ice as well as the topology of the sub-ice platelet layer. The solid fraction, which has previously been poorly constrained, is simulated to be ~ 0. 22, in good agreement with an earlier estimate of 0. 25 ± 0. 06. This property of the sub-ice platelet layer is important for biological processes, and for the freeboard–thickness relationship around Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|Development and {{application}} of 16 S rRNA-targeted gene probes for the identification of biotechnologically used Lactobacillus-strains of the L. acidophilus- and L. casei-group Due to numerous desirable metabolic properties lactobacilli have long been used as starter cultures in food production, as feed additives in animal nutrition, and as therapeutic agents in the pharmaceutical industry. Members of the L. acidophilus- and the L. casei-group are increasingly applicated as probiotics in food, thus requiring reliable and fast identification. The classical microbiological methods for identification of microorganisms to the species-level are usually tedious and sometimes provide ambiguous results due to varying strain forms within a species. In particular, the differentiation within the L. (= Lactobacillus) acidophilus-group, e. g. between L. crispatus and L. gasseri resp. between L. johnsonii and L. acidophilus may be difficult. In the L. casei-group modifications in the taxonomic classification of species have caused considerable confusion. Therefore, the intention {{of this study was}} the development of gene probes for the species L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, and L. johnsonii (L. acidophilus-group), and for L. zeae, L. paracasei, and L. rhamnosus (L. casei-group), which are commonly used as probiotics. Furthermore, the significance of gene probes was to be evaluated in comparison to other molecular methods. For this purpose the databases and computer programs of the NCBI/GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information) as well as the RDP (Ribosomal Database Project) of the Michigan State University, USA, which can both be accessed via internet, were utilized. The synthesis of the L. gasseri-probe was performed with the PCR-technique after partial sequence analysis of the 16 S rRNA-gene of a L. gasseri-reference strain (ATCC 19992 / DSM 20077). For the validation of the probes a total of 85 type- and reference strains out of the L. acidophilus- and the L. casei-group (type- / reference strains, isolates from dairy products, pharmaceutical preparations, and clinical material) as well as comparatively seven strains from other Lactobacillus-species and two Weissella-species were included. With regard to their classification, all tested strains were previously subjected to classical phenotypical testing. The molecular-based testing was performed by dot blot-hybridization. The hybridization results demonstrated that gene probes can be applied for species-specific identification of biotechnologically used lactobacilli of these two groups. All tested strains belonging to the species L. acidophilus sensu stricto were exclusively detected with the L. acidophilus-probe. Cross-reactions occurred with the phylogenetically closely related species L. gasseri and L. johnsonii, i. e. some strains reacted additionally with another probe, which was not intended for the identification of the respective species. Thus, the L. gasseri-probe also detected the L. johnsonii-strains. Differentiation between these two species was possible by addtionally applying the L. johnsonii-probe, which only hybridized with the L. johnsonii-strains. The type strain of L. casei (ATCC 393 T) reacted with the L. paracasei-probe {{as well as with the}} L. zeae-specific probe. Three additional strains, which were declared as members of L. casei, hybridized solely with the L. paracasei-probe as well as three L. paracasei-reference strains and one additional collection strain, which was declared as belonging to L. paracasei. This induced a (<b>sub-)</b> <b>division</b> of the L. casei-strains into two subgroups (L. casei I resp. II). These findings support a present proposal for the solution of the taxonomic problems within the L. casei-group, e. g. that the current L. casei-type strain is to be assigned to L. zeae, whereas other L. casei-strains (including strain ATCC 334 suggested as the neo-type strain of L. casei by several authors) may be grouped with L. paracasei. Two gradations with respect to the hybridization reactions also appeared among strains phenotypically identified as L. rhamnosus. Approximately half of these strains (12) reacted only with the L. rhamnosus-probe, the other half (10) however reacted simultaneously with the L. paracasei-probe. All but one of the latter strains where of clinical origin. Due to these cross-reactions the assignment into the subgroups L. rhamnosus I resp. II was carried out. The L. rhamnosus-probe can nevertheless be regarded as species-specific. A special case was represented by a clinical strain phenotypically identified as L. rhamnosus, which reacted solely with the L. paracasei-probe. In other investigations, this strain was also identified as L. casei / paracasei by means of RAPD-PCR. Cross-reactions with other species out of the L. acidophilus-group (L. crispatus, L. amylovorus, L. gallinarum) as well as with other representatives of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus and Weissella) did not occur. The comparison of the hybridization results with those obtained in previously performed investigations with other molecular methods with the same strains, confirms the significance of gene probes for the classification of strains. The delimitation of L. gasseri from L. crispatus proves difficult with phenotypic methods. Both species belong to the autochthonous microflora and have special relevance in the context of their use as probiotics. Due to this fact, the application of additional gene probes is required. Although the synthesis and verification of a L. crispatus-probe was not feasible in the scope of these investigations, a comparison of L. gasseri and L. crispatus type strain-sequences retrieved by a BLAST-analysis (NCBI/GenBank) displayed two nucleotide segments, which could achieve a differentiation with the methodology used in this study. Regarding the required work load, the hybridization-technique indicated advantages in comparison to other molecular-based methods, e. g. RAPD-PCR-technique. An unfavourable aspect of the technique applied hitherto was the fact that the dot blot procedure could be used only after having cultured the strains. Faster identification can be expected by the reverse dot blot-hybridization technique, where cultivation of strains prior to hybridization is not necessary and amplification of the target genes with specific primers requires hybridization periods of only 2 - 4 hours. The hybridization technique is thus suitable for the reliable identification of some biotechnologically relevant Lactobacillus-species. Further probes, in particular for the species L. crispatus and L. casei/paracasei must be developed and validated. The applicability of these methods in the routine is still pending. However, on the basis of the results with collection strains originating from commercial products, the suitability for routine application can be expected...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityAlthough {{the name}} is over {{three and a half}} centuries old, Cape Cod has no {{definite}} boundaries. Not being a governmental <b>sub-</b> <b>division,</b> it has no official limits. Practically everyone living in southeastern Massachusetts claims to be living on the Cape, and the farther east he lives, the farther east he thinks the boundary should be. For {{the purposes of this study}} an area comprising the fifteen townships of Barnstable County, the fourteen townships of southern Plymouth County, and Gosnold township (the Elizabeth Islands) in Dukes County, was selected. Only their internal interrelationships were considered, since the boundary line would have to be drawn somewhere within this region. Two possible definitions of the term "cape" were found, one limited to the very tip of the peninsula; the other covering the whole of it, and similar definitions of "Cape Cod" were encountered. The works of authors and authorities were searched for their definitions of the Cape. From this it developed that prior to the building of the Cape Cod Canal, most authors considered the Cape to begin at the Plymouth-Barnstable County line. After the Canal was built, they selected that as the boundary. The search of many maps and atlases, old and new, domestic and foreign, showed that until quite recently cartographers had almost unanimously placed the name "Cape Cod" at the very tip of the land, indicating that the name applied only to the end and not to the entire peninsula. Only lately have a few cartographers started to place the name beside the entire peninsula. The entire region is glaciated, and the peninsula owes its existence primarily to moraines. A recessional moraine running east and west, with an outwash plain to the south of it, forms the broader western part of the peninsula, while an interlobate moraine running north and south forms the eastern "arm". Parallel to this, another interlobate moraine on the mainland completes the pattern of a large flat U with Cape Cod Bay in the middle of it. The ice-block pitted outwash plain is found adjacent to both western and central moraines, but not to the eastern. The tip of the peninsula is composed entirely of wave and wind deposited sand. The soils of the region are so intermixed that no one soil is peculiar to any part of the region. The soil groupings are so distributed as to cut across most of the commonly accepted boundaries. The entire regions enjoys a maritime climate with a long growing season, but, owing to the rise in the inland topography it becomes cooler, and the growing season shorter toward the west. A particular scrub oak and pine vegetation peculiar to Cape Cod offers a good criterion for identifying the region, but blends in gradually with similar vegetation around it, so offers no definite boundary line. Prior to 1620 there were no permanent settlements in this area, and although many claims were made, none were sustained. Bartholomew Gosnold gave the cape its name in 1602, although Captain John Smith tried unsuccessfully to change it to Cape James. The Kings of England granted large and extensive tracts of territory to the colonial companies, much of which were never effectively occupied by them. The settlers of the "Old" Plymouth Colony settled the Cape region, working out from Plymouth not by a steady progression, but by establishing far-flung isolated villages, and only later settling the areas in between. Towns were named for the English towns from which the original settlers had come, or for some prominent personage, or because of their location and nature of their landscape. The names indicate that most of the early settlers came from the south of England, particularly the southwest. Only two tows have Indian names, although natural features are much more likely to have them except on the outer arm of the peninsula which was little frequented by the red men. All the local political units in this region are townships, there being no cities. The region does, however, contain parts of three counties. Counties in New England do not have the functions that they do in other parts of the country, but are important in that they are used by many governmental agencies and functions in breaking up the state into administrative and operational districts. A number of state government functions use the counties in this way, giving a measure of official recognition to the county line as the boundary of the area. By far the most popular boundary with the general public is the Cape Cod Canal, although it has been in operation only forty years. The popular acceptance of it in such a short time is probably due to the very concreteness of it. The Canal is the only readily-identifiable linear feature in its immediate area other than roads and railways, which are too common to be used as boundaries. A study of the distribution and ethnic composition of the population showed that most of the people lived on or near the coast, and that he population decreased toward the east. A preponderance of the larger tows on the southern coast of the peninsula was noted. Unfortunately no data on the Portuguese population was available. There are fewer foreign-born residents on the outer arm of the peninsula than farther westward. Economically, the peninsula is dependent largely upon the tourist trade. Cranberries are the chief agricultural crop, but it must be noted that Plymouth County produces far more cranberries than the Cape and largely controls the industry. Fishing has declined in importance until Provincetown alone retains it as an industry. Transportation into the region is funneled onto the peninsula via the two automobile bridges and the railroad bridge over the Canal. Newspapers aree largely local, as are much of the utilities and service. From this study emerge four separate boundaries of "Cape Cod", each with evidence to support its claim: the beginning of the sand s pit at Provincetown; the Canal; the county boundary; and the peninsula plus the towns of Marion and Wareham across Buzzards Bay. Since this boundary is sub-regional rather than political, we can expect no clean-cut and binding official decision on the matter...|$|R
