5|$|Traveling across Filgaia, {{the heroes}} {{make their way}} to the long-abandoned Guardian Temple to gain the {{alliance}} of the mystical guardians who maintain the forces of nature across the planet. There they are tested individually. After each of them fails their personal tests of character, the Guardians reluctantly agree to aid them. The Guardians tell Rudy and his companions that the demons <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> revive their leader, and have only to lift the seal on her cocoon-like prison by destroying the three scattered statues that lie across Filgaia. Utilizing ancient Elw technology in the form of teleportation devices, the group travels the world to stop the Quarter Knights from destroying the statues, but they fail in each attempt. The consequent resurrection of Mother occurs, yet the demons are informed by their leader that it is her intention to eradicate Filgaia rather than subjugate it and tells her followers that their own deaths will follow soon after.|$|E
2500|$|Although Blake {{was yet to}} {{formulate}} his mythological system, several preliminary elements of that system are present in microcosm in Tiriel. According to Peter Ackroyd, [...] "the elements of Blake's unique mythology <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> emerge. It is the primeval world of Bryant and of Stukeley, which he had glimpsed within engravings of stones and broken pillars." [...] Elements of his later mythology are thus manifested throughout the poem.|$|E

2500|$|Title VI, or the [...] "Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010", {{introduces}} the so-called [...] "Volcker Rule" [...] after former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker by amending the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. With {{the aim of}} {{reducing the amount of}} speculative investments on large firms' balance sheets, it limits banking entities to owning no more in a hedge fund or private equity fund than 3% of the total ownership interest. The total of all of the banking entity's interests in hedge funds or private equity funds cannot exceed 3% of the Tier 1 capital of the banking entity. Furthermore, no bank that has a direct or indirect relationship with a hedge fund or private equity fund, [...] "may enter into a transaction with the fund, or with any other hedge fund or private equity fund that is controlled by such fund" [...] without disclosing {{the full extent of the}} relationship to the regulating entity, and assuring that there is no conflict of interest. [...] "Banking entity" [...] includes an insured depository institution, any company controlling an insured depository institution and such a company's affiliates and subsidiaries, and must comply with the Act within two years of its passing, although it may apply for time extensions. In response to the Volcker Rule and in anticipation of its ultimate impact, a number of commercial banks and investment banks operating as bank holding companies <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> downsize or dispose of their proprietary trading desks.|$|E

As you walk down the lanes you are conscious of the rich, silent forces of nature working all around you. The wet earth smells fruitful and luscious. Green shoots are peeping out everywhere.

Buds in the hedges, lambs beneath them--everywhere the work of reproduction going forward! ...|$|E

[41] ``Notwithstanding the egotistic turn {{given to}} the public mind by the merchant-production of our century, the Communist {{tendency}} is continually reasserting itself {{and trying to make}} its way into public life. The penny bridge disappears before the public bridge; and the turnpike road before the free road. The same spirit pervades thousands of other institutions. Museums, free libraries, and free public schools; parks and pleasure grounds; paved and lighted streets, free for everybody's use; water supplied to private dwellings, with a growing tendency towards disregarding the exact amount of it used by the individual, tramways and railways which <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> introduce the season ticket or the uniform tax, and will surely go much further on this line when they are no longer private property: all these are tokens showing in what direction further progress is to be expected.''--Kropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism.'' ...|$|E
60|$|Every naturalist, who {{believes}} in the principle of evolution, will grant that the two main divisions of the Simiadæ, namely the Catarhine and Platyrhine monkeys, with their sub-groups, have all proceeded from some one extremely ancient progenitor. The early descendants of this progenitor, before they had diverged to any considerable extent from each other, would still have formed a single natural group; {{but some of the}} species or incipient genera would <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> indicate by their diverging characters the future distinctive marks of the Catarhine and Platyrhine divisions. Hence the members of this supposed ancient group would not have been so uniform in their dentition or in the structure of their nostrils, as are the existing Catarhine monkeys in one way and the Platyrhines in another way, but would have resembled in this respect the allied Lemuridæ which differ greatly from each other in the form of their muzzles,[268] and to an extraordinary degree in their dentition.|$|E

I can fancy he winces with a twinge of sympathetic understanding at my manifest inferiority. Indeed, I come, trailing clouds of earthly confusion and weakness; I bear upon me all the defects of my world. He wears, I see, that white tunic with the purple band that I <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> consider the proper Utopian clothing for grave men, and his face is clean shaven.

The country round here is comparatively uninhabited, and but {{a small portion of}} it tilled, so great was the number carried off by Hyder. Next time they will take to the hills at once, and I believe that many have already stored up grain in hiding places there. This time it may be hoped that a few weeks, or months at most, may see Tippoo driven back, and for that time the peasants can manage to exist in the hills. No doubt the richer sort, who have large flocks of goats, and many cattle, will, as soon as danger threatens, drive them down to Madras, where they are sure to fetch good prices {{for the use of the}} army.|$|E
6000|$|Although I am fully {{convinced}} of {{the truth of the}} views given in this volume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as the [...] "plan of creation," [...] "unity of design," [...] &c., and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory. A few naturalists, endowed with much flexibility of mind, and who <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> doubt on the immutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. Whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction; for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.|$|E
