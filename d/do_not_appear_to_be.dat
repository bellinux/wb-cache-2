5|$|In the White Sea {{region of}} Russia, all three {{assemblage}} types {{have been found}} in close proximity. This, and the faunas' considerable temporal overlap, makes it unlikely that they represent evolutionary stages or temporally distinct communities. Since they are globally distributed – described on all continents except Antarctica – geographical boundaries <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a factor; the same fossils are found at all palaeolatitudes (the latitude where the fossil was created, accounting for continental drift) and in separate sedimentary basins.|$|E

Each of the gastralia in Dinocephalosaurus is composed of three elements instead of four as in Tanystropheus; they differ in that Dinocephalosaurus only has one element on the midline, while Tanystropheus has two elements that combine to form a midline bar.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia.

Particular species recorded on P.levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons. Weighing 1700mg (0.60oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds. The flowers of P.levis are self-incompatible—that is, {{they are unable to}} fertilise themselves and require outcrossing to another plant.|$|E

5|$|Extremely {{sensitive}} to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, Banksia coccinea is an indicator species {{for the presence}} of the disease. There is no known means of eradicating dieback. Much of the Stirling Range National Park is infested, though Fitzgerald River National Park has been largely spared. Applying phosphite to infested areas has been shown to reduce the mortality rates to around 50%. B. coccinea has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of phosphite, with some patchy necrosis of leaves, but the plant's uptake of the compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species. Unusually, the symptoms <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proportional to exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh {{more than twice as much}} as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta.

5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{and other}} coleoid {{cephalopods}} {{are capable of}} greater RNA editing (which involves changes to the nucleic acid sequence of the primary transcript of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come {{as the cost of}} slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA editing <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present in more basal cephalopods or other molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes {{shows some}} {{similarities}} to X.cauticinalis. They share the amber-coloured hair towards {{the base of}} the stem and both grow on soil, as opposed to directly onto wood. Further, X.cauticinalis can display caulocystidia of the same distinctive shape as those of X.setulipes (though these are mixed with the other shapes more typical of the genus). X.cauticinalis mushrooms are typically of a different colour; for instance, the area {{at the top of the}} stem is paler than the rest, compared to the entirely dark stem of X.setulipes. Furthermore, X.cauticinalis has a very bitter taste. X.setulipes shares with X.brunneola its dark colouration and some microscopic traits. However, the two clearly differ in the shape of both the cheilocystidia and the pileocystidia, the width of the spores (the spores of X.brunneola measure between 2 and 3μm in width) and the fact it is found specifically in softwood woodland. Furthermore, the two <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closely related.|$|E
