Bran, who enjoys climbing the walls of Winterfell, climbs an abandoned tower where he stumbles on Queen Cersei and Jaime having sex. To keep the incestuous relationship a secret, Jaime shoves Bran out of the high window.|$|E

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience.

25|$|Notwithstanding {{the hand}} over {{of control of}} the game at the elite level across Australia to the Commission, the NSWRL did retain {{responsibility}} for both {{the administration of the}} New South Wales rugby league team in State of Origin series, as well as day-to-day management of the state-based New South Wales Cup second-tier premiership, as well as junior representative competitions and divisional leagues throughout NSW and the ACT.

25|$|A {{strategy}} for addressing this {{problem has been}} suggested; {{the idea is to}} study the boundary amplitude, namely a path integral over a finite space-time region, seen {{as a function of the}} boundary value of the field. In conventional quantum field theory, this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory; it <b>does</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> quantum gravity as well, but in a fully background–independent manner. A generally covariant definition of -point functions can then be based on the idea that the distance between physical points –arguments of the -point function is determined by the state of the gravitational field on the boundary of the spacetime region considered.|$|E
25|$|Rantel {{frequently}} features {{guests on}} his program, coordinating a weekly simulcast with British talkSport host Mike Mendoza (despite {{the fact that}} Mendoza has compared homosexuality to pedophilia) and often conversing with conservative author Ann Coulter. When Coulter appears, she usually <b>does</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> the first segment of the evening program. Democratic strategist Bob Mulholland, Republican strategist Michael Wissot, public-relations guru , and columnists John Leboutillier, Gustavo Arellano and Bruce Bialosky often appear on the program; former California governors Jerry Brown, Gray Davis, and Pete Wilson have made occasional appearances. Despite the numerous appearances of conservatives such as Ann Coulter, the program often features guests with very different opinions than the host. In addition, many guests are authors or leaders of a particular organization.|$|E

Growth kinetics of nonproteolytic C. botulinum type B in cooked mushrooms, cauliflower, and potatoes were determined at 16, 10, 8, and 5 degrees C. Growth and toxin production occurred in cooked cauliflower and mushrooms at all temperatures and in potatoes at 16 and 8 degrees C. The C. botulinum neurotoxin was detected within 3 to 5 days at 16 degrees C, 11 to 13 days at 10 degrees C, 10 to 34 days at 8 degrees C, and 17 to 20 days at 5 degrees C...|$|R

The spirit that returns <b>does</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> the form of a Guardian Ori. One's Guardian Ori, which is represented and contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spirit and energy of one's previous blood relative, but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through a myriad of lifetimes. This is {{not to be confused with}} one’s spiritual Ori, which contains personal destiny, but instead refers to the coming back to The Marketplace of one's personal blood Ori through one's new life and experiences.|$|E
25|$|The preludes {{are quite}} varied {{in style and}} structure, and are {{therefore}} hard to categorize, as no two praeludia are alike. The texture of Buxtehude’s praeludia {{can be described as}} either free or fugal. They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants. Structure-wise, there usually is an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this basic scheme is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude’s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, <b>does</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> a new, changed way. A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with five-voice structure in which two of the voices are taken by the pedal).|$|E

[...] When plots were kept, their more lurid elements were eliminated; Vilnoff, the villain in The Sinister Sign-Post, was changed from a criminal who compulsively sculpts miniature models of his own hands to a car thief without such eccentricities, and another villain, Pedro Vincenzo, who branded his victims no longer <b>does</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> the revised version of The Mark on the Door (1934, rev. 1967).|$|E
