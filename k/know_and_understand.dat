25|$|With the {{exception}} of theoretical agronomy, research in agronomy, more {{than in any other}} field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, soil characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>understand</b> production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.|$|E

2500|$|BPO pantomimes are {{generally}} seen more {{in young children}} (3–5 years old) and those with brain damage. There are many theories as to why BPO may be prevalent in these populations. This includes disruptions in the conceptual or temporal-spatial stages {{in the process of}} learned gestures, an impairment of conveying hand-posture of tool use, and a poor representation of an external objects. IO pantomimes are seen as much more complex than BPO pantomimes because they must have a strong mental representation of the object to be used and understood.

Snow and recently cast as [...] "government information control" [...] in the fishery context) and the lack of a code of ethics appropriate to (at least) scientists whose findings are relevant to conservation and public resource management. A proper code of ethics would acknowledge the obligations of all to conservation, the right of the public to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>understand</b> scientific findings, the obligation of scientists to communicate vital issues with the public, and would not acknowledge the right of bureaucrats to impede that dialogue. To be effective, such ethical issues need to be included in science curricula.|$|E

2500|$|Lynch {{was working}} for the {{building}} and establishment of seven buildings, in which 8,000 salaried people would practice advanced meditation techniques, [...] "pumping peace for the world". He estimates the cost at US$7 billion. As of December 2005, he had spent US$400,000 of personal money, and raised US$1 million in donations. In December 2006, the New York Times reported that he continued to have that goal. Lynch's book, Catching the Big Fish (Tarcher/Penguin 2006), discusses the impact of the Transcendental Meditation technique on his creative process. Lynch attended the funeral of the Maharishi in India in 2008. He told a reporter, [...] "In life, he revolutionised the lives of millions of people.... In 20, 50, 500 years there will be millions of people who will <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>understand</b> what the Maharishi has done."

2500|$|In this novel, {{published}} by Arbor House/William Morrow in 1988, a man dying of AIDS is {{taken in by}} his cousin, a rancher in the Colorado mountains. Award-winning author Nancy Kress writes [...] "Michael Bishop has pulled off a rare and amazing feat. [...] Unicorn Mountain successfully weaves such traditional fantasy elements as unicorns and Indian lore together with the all-too-contemporary..." [...] Orson Scott Card writes [...] "The triumph of this, Bishop's most artistically whole and successful novel to date, is that {{he set out to}} do something that is nearly impossible in fiction: He wrote a novel about constructing a tribe...To do it, he had to bring us to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>understand</b> and care about more created characters than most writers produce in a career." [...] John Clute's assessment emphasizes another theme of the work: [...] "Michael Bishop, whose voice is like a shout {{from the bottom of the}} well of the enormous South, and whose heart is on his sleeve, [...] in Unicorn Mountain to generate a moving tale out of ecological disaster here and in another world, AIDS, the death of cultures, the death of species, and the slow sea-changing of America into themeparks." [...] The novel would go on to win the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and was shortlisted for the 1989 Locus Award.|$|E
2500|$|After {{losing her}} friend Danielle Jones, Stacey began acting strangely in May 2009, and the {{character}} has {{to come to terms}} with the prospect that, like her mother, she also suffers from bipolar disorder. The storyline was developed as of the BBC's Headroom campaign, which aims to encourage people to look after their mental wellbeing. Series Consultant Simon Ashdown had been developing the storyline for about a year. To accurately reflect the issue, EastEnders worked closely with various charities such as Mind and MDF The BiPolar Organisation, medical practitioners and bipolar sufferers when researching the storyline. The story was moulded around what Stacey would do in that situation and what the research led the team to believe was the most truthful way events would develop. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that the initial buildup of the storyline was an extension of how the character has always been, [...] "a character of highs and lows, of great passions and dark moods," [...] but these highs and lows would become more contrasted, and viewers would realise that Stacey's mood is more complex than just being upset over her losses, adding, [...] "It's the beginning of us getting to really <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>understand</b> who Stacey is and what makes her behave the way she does." [...] Turner hoped that she could do the storyline justice, saying that she believed it was great that EastEnders continued to raise awareness of the issue.|$|E
2500|$|The Secular Franciscans commit {{themselves}} to live the Gospel according to Franciscan spirituality in their secular condition. The Secular Franciscan must personally and assiduously study the Gospel and Sacred Scripture to foster love for {{the word of the}} Gospel and help the brothers and sisters to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>understand</b> it as it is proclaimed by the Church {{with the assistance of the}} Spirit. Secular Franciscans, called in earlier times [...] "the brothers and sisters of penance", propose to live in the spirit of continual conversion. Some means to cultivate this characteristic of the Franciscan vocation, individually and in fraternity, are: listening to and celebrating the Word of God; review of life; spiritual retreats; the help of a spiritual adviser, and penitential celebrations. Secular Franciscans should pledge themselves to live the spirit of the Beatitudes and, in a special way, the spirit of poverty. Evangelical poverty demonstrates confidence in the Father, affects interior freedom, and disposes them to promote a more just distribution of wealth. They must provide for their own families and serve society by means of their work and material goods, have a particular manner of living evangelical poverty. To understand and achieve it requires a strong personal commitment and the stimulation of the fraternity in prayer and dialogue, communal review of life, and attentiveness to the instructions of the Church, and the demands of society. They pledge themselves to reduce their own personal needs so as to be better able to share spiritual and material goods with their brothers and sisters, especially those most in need. They should give thanks to God for the goods they have received, using them as good stewards and not as owners. They should take a firm position against consumerism and against ideologies and practices which prefer riches over human and religious values and which permit the exploitation of the human person. They should love and practice purity of heart, the source of true fraternity.|$|E
