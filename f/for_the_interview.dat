5|$|They {{held their}} first London gigs {{in support of}} the EP, under the advice of George and The Pooh Sticks lead singer Huw Williams. After warm up gigs in Cardiff and Birmingham, the London {{performance}} took place at the Samuel Beckett pub in Stoke Newington on 13 November 1993 alongside Anrehfn and Margi Clarke. Further Welsh radio and television appearances followed, as did an interview for NME. When George arrived <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> Matthews asked if he'd be interested in becoming the band's manager. He politely declined, saying that he didn't have the experience. On the 19 and 20 February 1994, the band's follow-up EP, Hooked was recorded in Llandwrog, Gwynedd, and produced by Ken Nelson who they had met on Radio Wales. A performance was set up at the Falcon the Splash Club in London where several music executives were to be present. The band drove down from Cardiff in a Ford Transit with their equipment and then spent the afternoon drinking. Just prior to going out on stage, they began taking cocaine, the result of which was a terrible performance later lamented by Roberts. The trip became a sobering experience, as they made no money from it and were only paid £50 for a gig at Kingston University a day later. Matthews later recalled that they'd needed to borrow money from a fan to pay the toll on the Severn Bridge {{on the way back to}} Cardiff.|$|E

However, the main objective of the thesis was to develop a business plan for XYZ hand car wash. A conceptual framework was pre-pared through that all the research was undertaken. That framework included busi-ness idea, PESTEL analysis, Porter’s five factors analysis, competitor’s analysis, SWOT analysis, empirical research and business plan. The idea of hand car wash came into author’s mind as the prices of car wash were very high and customers felt dissatisfaction. Moreover, qualitative research method-ology was chosen <b>for</b> <b>the</b> research.

25|$|Right {{after the}} trial, Percy Hoskins, chief crime {{reporter}} for the Daily Express, whisked Adams off to a safehouse in Westgate-on-Sea, where {{he spent the next}} two weeks recounting his life story. Hoskins had befriended Adams during the trial and was the only major journalist to doubt his guilt. Adams was paid £10,000 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> though he never spent the proceeds – the notes were found in a bank vault after his death, untouched. Adams then successfully sued several newspapers for libel. He returned to Eastbourne, where he continued to practise privately despite the common belief in the town that he had murdered people. This belief was not shared by his friends and patients in general. One exception was Sir Roland Gwynne, who distanced himself from Adams after the trial.|$|E
25|$|Roebuck {{was born}} in the village of Oddington, outside Oxford, on 6 March 1956, the son of two schoolteachers and one of six children; he {{attended}} Millfield School where his mother was a mathematics teacher and his father an economics teacher. The headmaster, Jack Meyer, a former Somerset CCC Captain, had offered his parents employment at the school so that they could afford the fees. Meyer was an unconventional headmaster who wanted to encourage cricket talent. On entering Meyer's office <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> for admission, Roebuck found an orange flying through the air towards him; he caught it, and in his book It Never Rains speculated whether he would have got into Millfield if he had dropped it. He later studied law at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge, graduating with first class honours in 1977. However he never practised law, finding it too confining.|$|E

When the woman did not show up <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a Yeoman (F) first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar as a typist, so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross, where she was stationed in Paris. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signed, and she cared for war refugees; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, [...] "helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later".|$|E
