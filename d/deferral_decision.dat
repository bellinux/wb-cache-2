40|$|A {{series of}} 7 {{experiments}} {{found that people}} defer important decisions more than unimportant decisions, {{and that this is}} independent of choice set composition. This finding persists even when deferral does not provide more flexibility (Experiment 2), when deferral has potential disadvantages (Experiment 3), and when deferral has no material benefits and is financially costly (Experiment 4). The effect of importance on deferral was independent of potential choice conflict (Experiment 5 & 6). The only exception was a situation in which one alternative was clearly domina nt; here decision importance did not affect the likelihood of deferral (Experiment 7). These results suggest that people use decision importance as a cue for deferral: more important decisions should take more time and effort.

40|$|When {{faced with}} a choice, people can {{normally}} select no option, i. e., defer choice. Previous research has investigated when and why individuals defer choice, but has almost never looked at these questions when groups of people make choices. Separate reasons predict that groups may be equally likely, more likely, or less likely than individuals to defer choice. We re-analyzed some previously published data and conducted a new experiment to address this question. We found that small groups of people tended to defer choice more often than their members would. Assuming that the groups used a plurality rule but gave additional weight to individual preferences to defer choice allowed the groups' responses to be predicted quite well. We discuss several possible explanations of these findings. group decision making, choice <b>deferral,</b> <b>decision</b> avoidance, decision delay. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor a few years, {{a series}} of {{traditionally}} tropical mosquito-borne diseases, such as chikungunya fever and dengue, have posed challenges to national public health authorities in the European region. Other diseases have re-emerged, e. g. malaria in Greece, or spread to other countries, e. g. West Nile fever. These diseases are reportable within the European Union (EU), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control collects information in various ways to provide EU member states with topical assessments of disease threats, risks and trends for prompt and appropriate public health action. Using disease-specific expert networks, the European Surveillance System (TESSy) collects standardized comparable information on all statutory communicable diseases in a database. In addition, the event-based surveillance aims to detect potential public health threats early, and to allow timely response and support to blood <b>deferral</b> <b>decisions</b> for pathogens that can be transmitted through blood donation. Laboratory capacity for early detection is implemented through external quality assessments. Other activities include the development of guidelines for the surveillance of mosquito vectors, {{and the production of}} regularly updated maps on the currently known occurrence of mosquito vector species...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDecision {{makers are}} often unable {{to choose between}} the options that they are offered. In these {{settings}} they typically defer their decision, that is, delay the decision to a later point in time or avoid the decision altogether. In this paper, we outline eight behavioral findings regarding the causes and consequences of choice deferral that cognitive theories of decision making should be able to capture. We show that these findings can be accounted for by a deferral-based time limit applied to existing sequential sampling models of preferential choice. Our approach to modeling deferral as a time limit in a sequential sampling model also makes a number of novel predictions regarding the interactions between choice probabilities, <b>deferral</b> probabilities, and <b>decision</b> times, and we confirm these predictions in an experiment. Choice deferral is a key feature of everyday decision making, and our paper illustrates how established theoretical approaches can be used to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this important behavioral phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the contribution of}} deconstruction to democratic theory. It critically considers {{the usefulness of the}} conceptual distinction between “politics” and “the political” as a means of interpreting deconstruction’s relation to political questions. In particular, it critically engages with the inflection of deconstructive themes in the theory of radical democracy (RD) developed by Laclau and Mouffe. It is argued that this approach ontologizes the politics/political distinction, and elides together two distinct senses of otherness. This is registered in the prevalence of spatial tropes in this approach. The spatialization of key issues in political theory leads to a diminished sensitivity to the variegated temporalities through which solidarity and conflict, unity and multiplicity are negotiated. This is discussed with reference to the concept of articulation. By reducing temporality to a metaphysics of contingency, RD converges with a voluntaristic decisionism in its account of hegemony and political authority. The paper proceeds to a critical consideration of the interpretation of “undecidability” in RD, and of the elective affinity between this approach and the fascist critique of liberal democracy associated with Carl Schmitt. This discussion sets the scene for an alternative reading of the political significance of the theme of undecidability in Derrida’s thought. This reading focuses on the problem of negotiating two equally compelling forms of responsibility, the urgent responsibility to act in the world, and the patient responsibility to acknowledge otherness. By discussing the complex temporising associated with the theme of undecidability in deconstruction, the paper argues for a reassessment of the normative value of the concept of representation as it has developed in modern democratic theory. It develops an understanding of undecidability that points beyond the undeconstructed decisionism shared by both Schmitt and RD towards an account of the opening of public spaces of deliberation, <b>deferral,</b> and <b>decision.</b> More broadly, the paper is concerned with the moral limits of a prevalent spatialized interpretation of key themes in the poststructuralist canon, including difference, alterity, and otherness...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} phase of {{software}} development, the designer must make many fundamental design decisions concerning {{the architecture of}} the system. Incorrect decisions are relatively easy and inexpensive to fix if caught during the design process, but the difficulty and cost rise significantly if problems are not found until after coding begins. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to find incorrect design decisions during the design phase. To reduce the cost of expensive corrections, {{it would be useful to}} have the ability to defer some design decisions as long as possible, even into the coding stage. Failing that, tool support for automating design changes would give more freedom to revisit and change these decisions when needed. This paper shows how a designpattern-based programming system based on generative design patterns can support the <b>deferral</b> of design <b>decisions</b> where possible, and automate changes where necessary. A generative design pattern is a parameterized pattern form that is capable of generating code for different versions of the underlying design pattern. We demonstrate these ideas in the context of a parallel application written with the CO 2 P 3 S pattern-based parallel programming system. We show that CO 2 P 3 S can defer the choice of execution architecture (shared-memory or distributed-memory), and can automate several changes to the application structure that would normally be daunting to tackl...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{workflows}} spanning {{from the}} design {{to the production}} of buildings and small installations have received significant recent attention in architectural research [1]. The structuring of these workflows is important for facilitating design collaboration. The successful delivery of &# 039;non-standard&# 039; projects, with free-form geometries and novel fabrication material can be particularly dependent on such workflow. This paper reports on the workflow developed for the FabPod, an acoustic enclosure for meetings which could be located in an open knowledge work environment. For this project, a broad &# 039;design system&# 039; was developed covering the project workflow from early stage design to completion of a fabricated prototype. This was implemented in order to defer design decisions, providing improved opportunities for testing detailed material and fabrication aspects of the project. It also facilitated collaboration between experts in different aspects of parametric workflow and in &# 039;tuning&# 039; acoustic performance. A by-product of this approach is the possibility of using the system as the basis of further iterations and to consider the possibilities of developing the prototype into a product. A <b>deferral</b> of design <b>decisions</b> is a key strategy for mass-customisation. The system displays a number of characteristics and capabilities required for mass-customisation suggesting that a resulting product might hold value in its ability to be customised.

We then consider the workflow in relation to key capabilities for mass-customisatio...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary This Defence White Paper {{explains}} how the Government is investing in Australia’s defence capabilities to strengthen Australia’s {{security in the}} more complex strategic environment Australia will face in the years ahead. The Government’s policy is to align Australia’s defence strategy with capabilities and resourcing, grow our international defence partnerships to support shared security interests and invest in the partnership with Australian defence industry to develop innovative technologies and deliver essential capabilities. Because decisions about our defence capabilities taken now will determine our capacity to manage {{the challenges of the}} future, it is important that defence decision making and planning take a clear long-term view. This Defence White Paper looks out to 2035 to identify where and what sorts of security challenges are likely to arise and what capabilities Defence – the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Department of Defence – will need to meet them. While Australia has effective defence capabilities to draw on to meet current security challenges, significant under-investment in Defence in the past and the <b>deferral</b> of <b>decisions</b> about future major capabilities need to be fixed. Defence’s capability plans have become disconnected from defence strategy and resources, delaying important investments in Australia’s future security and frustrating Australian defence industry. In April 2014, the Government announced that it would deliver a new Defence White Paper to align Defence’s strategy, capability and resources. This Defence White Paper is based on a comprehensive review of Australia’s strategic environment, including the changes underway in the Indo-Pacific region, encompassing the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and across the world and the implications of these changes for Australia and for Defence. This includes an assessment of the different challenges created by the complex dynamics between states and the ongoing threat posed by non-state actors, including terrorists that seek to launch attacks internationally, regionally and within Australia. A fully-costed Force Structure Review underpins the Defence White Paper. The Force Structure Review assessed Defence’s future capability needs and developed the force structure required to achieve Australia’s defence objectives. An Expert Panel supported the development of the Defence White Paper together with a comprehensive consultation process which incorporated input from across Government, Australian defence industry, the Australian public, the United States, New Zealand and our other international partners. The Defence White Paper sets out in three sections the elements of the Government’s defence policy in response to this comprehensive analysis and consideration: Strategy, Capability, and Resources...|$|R
40|$|Around the world, as a {{consequence}} of the contamination of the blood supply by HIV and Hepatitis C and B in the early 1980 s, public and private blood banks have required blood donors to complete a donor health assessment questionnaire to identify various risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases including, for men, the act of having sex with a male partner. In this latter case the policy provides for a permanent or temporary ban on donation. This deferral policy, which aimed to protect recipients of blood and blood products, in recent years has been subject to criticism in so far as this exclusion seems to be an unfair discrimination against gay men on the basis of sexual orientation. At present, despite new technologies and recent testing procedures that allow the identification of contaminated blood, donor selection is still based on group characteristics (such as the MSM group: “men who have sex with men”). After having analysed the two core judgments in the western legal tradition regarding the MSM <b>deferral</b> policy—namely: the <b>decision</b> of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in the case Canadian Blood Services v. Kyle Freeman and the decision of the European Court of Justice in the case Geoffrey Léger v. Ministre des Affaires sociales, de la Santé et des Droits des femmes —, the essay enquires into what can be viewed as a reasonable response to the issue of discrimination. In particular, the Author looks at two main subjects: 1) the adoption in at least two European countries (Italy and Spain) of a different approach based on an individualised donor assessment; 2) the proportionality of group refusal taking into account the negative stereotypes about gay men and, in particular, the association of homosexuality with AIDS...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{accounting}} choice {{relating to}} the timing of adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in New Zealand i. e., the choice to voluntarily early adopt IFRS or to defer adoption of IFRS until it became mandatory. Results for 40 early adopters are measured against those of a control group of 40 late adopters. The study includes {{an examination of the}} impact of IFRS on financial information (IFRS differences), as well as analyses of qualitative information obtained from discretionary narratives in annual reports, questionnaires and interviews. Significant IFRS differences are found for most financial statement elements and ratios for both early and late adopters. However, when IFRS differences for early adopters are compared to those for late adopters, the difference-in-differences are not found to be significant. Hence, IFRS differences result in incentives which may influence adoption timing, but these incentives are not significantly different for early and late adopters. Content analysis of discretionary narratives in annual reports reveals significant differences for all four of the measures used to assess the extent of disclosures, with early adopters providing typically twice as much disclosure as late adopters. Further analysis {{relating to the}} nature of disclosures reveals three major themes: ‘informing of importance’, ‘potency’ and ‘evaluative’. For the first two of these themes, significant differences are found and early adoption persists as a significant explanatory variable, after controlling for other incentives for voluntary disclosure, such as firm size, auditor and industry. ‘Evaluative’ disclosures are made by relatively few firms; are predominantly negative regarding IFRS adoption and no significant differences between early and late adopters are found for this theme. Disclosure findings reflect that early adopters attach a higher level of importance to IFRS adoption than late adopters. Survey data reveals significant differences for one of six measures of costs of IFRS as well as for a constructed ‘overall benefits’ score and three of nine individual benefits assessed. Also, three further themes emerge from content analysis of responses regarding motivations for adoption timing, namely ‘activity’, ‘manageability’ and ‘accounting choice’. Overall, the findings triangulate to suggest that ‘accounting choice’ has less explanatory power, with regard to adoption timing decisions, than ‘other factors’ which are unrelated to the impact of IFRS on accounting information. Examples of such ‘other factors’ include the level of importance which firms attach to IFRS adoption; evaluations of the consequences of IFRS (predominantly neutral or negative) and perceptions as to the manageability of IFRS adoption (unexpected factors influence <b>deferral).</b> Adoption timing <b>decisions</b> of both early and late adopters are found to be predominantly ‘dynamic’ (proactive) rather than ‘static’ (passive) activity...|$|R
