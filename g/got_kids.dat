500|$|Nitin Ganatra {{who plays}} Masood Ahmed {{explains}} to Digital Spy Masood's reactions when he discovers that Yusef has taken Kamil away. [...] "Masood goes crazy over this!" [...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>kids</b> myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

2500|$|The antagonists Grendel and Grendel's {{mother are}} portrayed by Crispin Glover and Angelina Jolie, respectively. Glover had {{previously}} worked with Zemeckis in Back to the Future, when he portrayed George McFly. Zemeckis had found Glover tiresome on set, {{because of his}} {{lack of understanding of}} shooting a film, but realized this would not be a problem as on a motion capture film he could choose his angles later. Glover's dialogue was entirely in Old English. Jolie had wanted to work with Zemeckis, and had read the poem years before but could not remember it well until she read the script and was able to recall basic themes. The actress recounted her first impression of her character's appearance by saying [...] "...I was told I {{was going to be a}} lizard. Then I was brought into a room with Bob, and a bunch of pictures and examples, and he showed me this picture of a woman half painted gold, and then a lizard.
