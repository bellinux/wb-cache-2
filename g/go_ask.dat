25|$|When Aelony {{arrived at}} the University of Minnesota, he met some of the few {{students}} of color and discovered {{that only a small}} number were from the local communities, since most local blacks chose to attend black colleges and universities in the South. He also found that other minority students were having trouble obtaining local housing and employment in Minneapolis. Aelony worked with a group of students to help find housing for Persian students. This population had difficulty securing housing because it was rumored that they rubbed their skin with olive oil, which ruined the bedding. If the minority students were told an apartment complex was full, white students would <b>go</b> <b>ask</b> for a room there to test the fairness of the renters. The students would then talk to the renters, who were often embarrassed and would agree to rent to the minority students.|$|E

The Rolling Stones wanted him to replace Mick Taylor and when Jimi Hendrix was asked how it felt to be the world's greatest guitarist, he is reported to have said: ‘I don't know, <b>go</b> <b>ask</b> Rory Gallagher’" [...] (but this may be a variant of an urban legend [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|S. E. Hinton's The Outsiders (1967) and Paul Zindel's The Pigman (1968) are problem novels written {{specifically}} for teenagers. However, Sheila Egoff notes in Thursday's Child: Trends and Patterns in Contemporary Children's Literature that the Newbery Award winning novel It's Like This, Cat (1964) by Emily Cheney Neville may have established [...] "the problem novel formula." [...] <b>Go</b> <b>Ask</b> Alice (1971) {{is an early}} example of the subgenre and is often considered {{an example of the}} negative aspects of the form (Although the author is [...] "Anonymous", it is largely or wholly the work of its purported editor, Beatrice Sparks). A more recent example is Adam Rapp's The Buffalo Tree, 1997.|$|E

2500|$|When writing <b>Go</b> <b>Ask</b> Malice, author Robert Joseph Levy {{encountered}} {{a number of}} issues to negotiate in writing a back-story for Faith. One of these was retaining the mystery of the character; Levy explains many aspects of Faith's background, such as her delinquency and promiscuity, are supposed to be assumed by the viewers of the show, and he didn't want to spell everything out by writing a [...] "case study" [...] of her. In order to do something non-traditional, Levy chose to tell the story in a diary format, watching many episodes of the television series to get a hold on the natural cadence of her voice. He reveals he looked to Faith herself in order to overcome his fear of writing such a popular character, [...] "She's not hesitant and in a lot of ways, I took a lot of inspiration from the character itself in terms of creative process — to really go for it and be strong in my choices".|$|E

Griffith appeared again as a villain in Savages (1974), a television film {{based on the novel}} Deathwatch (1972) by Robb White. Griffith received his only Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie for his role as the father of a murder victim in the television film Murder in Texas (1981) and won further acclaim for his role as a homicidal villain in the television film Murder in Coweta County (1983), co-starring music legend Johnny Cash as the sheriff. He also proved to be a good character actor and {{appeared in}} several television miniseries, including the television version of From Here to Eternity (1979), [...] (1979), Centennial (1978), and the Watergate scandal-inspired [...] (1977), playing a former president loosely based on Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E
