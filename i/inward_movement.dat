500|$|ASL has a rich {{system of}} verbal inflection. This {{involves}} both grammatical aspect—how {{the action of}} verbs flows in time—and agreement marking. Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic, circular movement, while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so {{that it has a}} stationary hand position. Verbs may agree with both the subject and the object, and are marked for number and reciprocity. Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with <b>inward</b> <b>movement</b> of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT, articulated by having two L-shaped hands [...] "shooting" [...] at each other.|$|E

40|$|Singing {{involves}} distinct respiratory kinematics (i. e. {{movements of}} rib cage and abdomen) to quiet breathing because of different {{demands on the}} respiratory system. Professional classical singers often advocate for the advantages of an active control of the abdomen on singing performance. This is presumed to prevent shortening of the diaphragm, elevate the rib cage, and thus promote efficient generation of subglottal pressure during phonation. However, few studies have investigated these patterns quantitatively and inter-subject variability has hindered the identification of stereotypical patterns of respiratory kinematics. Here, seven professional classical singers and four untrained individuals were assessed during quiet breathing, and when singing both a standard song {{and a piece of}} choice. Several parameters were extracted from respiratory kinematics and airflow, and principal component analysis was used to identify typical patterns of respiratory kinematics. No group differences were observed during quiet breathing. During singing, both groups adapted to rhythmical constraints with decreased time of inspiration and increased peak airflow. In contrast to untrained individuals, classical singers used greater percentage of abdominal contribution to lung volume during singing and greater asynchrony between movements of rib cage and abdomen. Classical singers substantially altered the coordination of rib cage and abdomen during singing from that used for quiet breathing. Despite variations between participants, principal component analysis revealed consistent pre-phonatory <b>inward</b> <b>movements</b> of the abdominal wall during singing. This contrasted with untrained individuals, who demonstrated synchronous respiratory movements during all tasks. The <b>inward</b> abdominal <b>movements</b> observed in classical singers elevates intra-abdominal pressure and may increase the length and the pressure-generating capacity of rib cage expiratory muscles for potential improvements in voice quality...|$|R

The Quakers, esteeming persecution as a divine call to the post of danger, laid claim to a holy courage unknown to the Puritans themselves, who had shunned the cross by providing for the peaceable exercise of their religion in a distant wilderness. Though it was the singular fact that every nation of the earth rejected the wandering enthusiasts who practised peace toward all men, the place of greatest uneasiness and peril, and therefore in their eyes the most eligible, was the province of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E

As the plants gain most of their nutriment by this means, their roots are very poorly developed; and they often grow in places where hardly any other plant except mosses can exist. The glands have the power of absorption, besides that of secretion. They are extremely sensitive to various stimulants, namely repeated touches, the pressure of minute particles, the absorption of animal matter and of various fluids, heat, and galvanic action. A tentacle with a bit of raw meat on the gland has been seen to begin bending in 10 s., to be strongly incurved in 5 m., and to reach the centre of the leaf in half an hour. The blade of the leaf often becomes so much inflected that it forms a cup, enclosing any object placed on it.|$|E

Mesostoma spermatocyte kinetochores execute oscillatory movements to {{and away from}} the spindle pole for 1 - 2 h, so we could trap kinetochores multiple times in the same spermatocyte. The trap was focused to a single point using a 63 × oil immersion objective. Trap powers of 15 - 23 mW caused kinetochore oscillations to stop or decrease. Kinetochore oscillations resumed when the trap was released. In crane-fly spermatocytes trap powers of 56 - 85 mW stopped or slowed poleward chromosome movement. In PtK 2 ce lls 8 -mW trap power stopped the spindle pole from moving toward the equator. Forces in the traps were calculated using the equation F = Q′P/c, where P is the laser power and c is the speed of light. Use of appropriate Q′ coefficients gave the forces for stopping pole movements as 0. 3 - 2. 3 pN and for stopping chromosome movements in Mesostoma spermatocytes and crane-fly spermatocytes as 2 - 3 and 6 - 10 pN, respectively.

40|$|AbstractIntraflagellar {{transport}} (IFT) [1, 2] is a motility {{in which}} particles composed {{of at least}} 17 polypeptides [3 – 5] move underneath the flagellar membrane [1, 2]. Anterograde (outward) and retrograde (<b>inward)</b> <b>movements</b> of these IFT particles are mediated by FLA 10 kinesin-II [2, 3] and cytoplasmic dynein DHC 1 b [6 – 8], respectively. Mutations affecting IFT particle polypeptides [9] or motors result in the inability to assemble flagella [2, 6 – 8, 10 – 12]. IFT particles and the motors moving them are located principally around the basal bodies {{as well as in}} the flagella [3, 7, 13, 14]. Here, we clone the cDNA encoding one of the IFT particle proteins, IFT 52, and show by immunofluorescence that while some IFT 52 is in the flagella, the majority is found in two horseshoe-shaped rings around the basal bodies. Immunoelectron microscopy indicates that IFT 52 is associated with the periphery of the transitional fibers, which extend from the distal portion of the basal body to the cell membrane and demarcate the entrance to the flagellar compartment [15 – 18]. This localization suggests that the transitional fibers form a docking complex for the IFT particles destined for the flagellum. Finally, the flagellaless mutant bld 1 completely lacks IFT 52 due to a deletion in the gene encoding IFT 52 [19]...|$|R

A study was made of the effects of anions upon cation movements in these and other mammalian red eeUs. Iodide was found to inhibit markedly (> 50 %) Na <b>inward</b> <b>movements</b> in cat and dog but not in the other erythrocytes. An increase (15 - 30 %) in K uptake in the presence of iodide was noted in all the mammalian cells studied. The majority of mammalian erythrocytes investigated maintain appreciable gradients of both K and Na between their interiors and the bathing plasma (Bernstein, 1954). Increasing evidence indicates that these gradients are maintained at the expense of metabolic energy, usually through the hydrolysis of ATP by a membrane-associated ATPase which is activated by Na and K but inhibited by ouabain (Dunham and Glynn, 1961; Tosteson et al., 1960). It is thus of considerable importance that a mammalian red cell has been found to deviate from this usual pattern. The cat erythrocyte maintains only slight gradients of K and Na (Hegnauer and Robinson, 1936); it also appears to possess no membrane ATPase which is activated by Na and K and inhibited by ouabain (Chan et al., 1964; Greeff et al., 1964). The transport properties of such an unusual cell are of considerable interest. This paper is concerned with the transport of 24 Na and 4 ~K across the cat erythrocyte membrane...|$|R
