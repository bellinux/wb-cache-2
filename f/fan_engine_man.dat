40|$|The {{proposed}} ducted <b>fan</b> <b>engine</b> {{has prompted}} {{the need for}} increasingly lightweight and efficient noise control devices. Exploratory tests at the NASA Langley Research Center were conducted to evaluate three piezoelectric specimens as possible control transducers: a Polyvinylidene Flouride (PVDF) piezofilm sample and two composite samples of Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) rods embedded in fiberglass. The tests measured the acoustic output efficiency and evaluated the noise control characteristics when interacting with a primary sound source.

2500|$|The HS.141 {{design was}} a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted swept wing with a quarter-chord sweepback of 28degrees. The design featured two wing-mounted [...] "cruise" [...] engines and 16 lift <b>fan</b> <b>engines</b> mounted in sponsons {{either side of}} the fuselage (eight per side). The engines under main consideration were the Rolls-Royce RB.220 turbofan for forward propulsion and the Rolls-Royce RB.202, a high bypass ratio lift <b>fan</b> <b>engine</b> using technology developed for the Rolls-Royce RB.162 lift jet. Both engines were themselves design studies by Rolls-Royce and it was feared that there would be delays in their development due to the company's problems at the time. One new engine type also considered for main propulsion was the 'SNECMA M.56', which became the CFM International CFM56. Variations using fewer lift <b>fan</b> <b>engines</b> for STOL operations only were also studied as it was realised that the engines could account for 15% of the total weight of the aircraft and 35% of the final cost.|$|R

40|$|Predictions of the {{prevalence}} of annoyance associated with aircraft noise exposure are heavily influenced by field studies conducted in urban airport neighborhoods. Flyovers heard in such relatively high ambient noise environments are composed in large part of high absolute level, broadband noise. In contrast, noise exposure created en route by aircraft powered by unducted <b>fan</b> <b>engines</b> {{is expected to be}} relatively low in level, but to contain prominent low frequency tonal energy. These tones will be readily audible in rural and other low ambient noise environments. The annoyance of noise intrusions of low absolute level {{has been shown to be}} closely related to their audibility. Thus, one way to predict the annoyance of en route noise generated by unducted <b>fan</b> <b>engines</b> is to estimate its audibility relative to that of conventionally powered aircraft in different ambient noise environments. This may be accomplished by computing the audibility of spectra produced by an aircraft powered by unducted <b>fan</b> <b>engines</b> and comparing predicted probabilities of annoyance for them with those of conventionally powered transport aircraft...|$|R
