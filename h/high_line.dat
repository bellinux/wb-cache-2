5|$|Friends of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the <b>High</b> <b>Line.</b> Unlike the first two phases of the <b>High</b> <b>Line,</b> which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2014, a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} for the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> was held, {{followed by the}} opening of the third section of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> Park on September 21, and a procession down the <b>High</b> <b>Line.</b> The third phase, costing US$76 million, is divided into two parts. The first part, costing US$75 million, which opened on September 21, is {{from the end of the}} existing Phase 2 of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> to the line's terminus at 34th Street west of 11th Avenue. The second part, the spur, was going to contain such amenities as a bowl-shaped theater but has changed and will provide more room to install ambitious artworks curated by the public art program. It will also be integrated with 10 Hudson Yards, which has already been built over the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> Spur. The spur will include a plinth when it opens in 2018.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the <b>High</b> <b>Line,</b> there have been several proposals for museums along its path. The Dia Art Foundation considered, but rejected, a proposal to build a museum at the Gansevoort Street terminus. On that site, the Whitney Museum has built a new home for its collection of American art. The building was designed by Renzo Piano and opened on May 1, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Friends of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> {{maintains}} an office on Washington Street, near the park's southern end. The organization has 80 full-time year-round employees and roughly 150 full-time employees {{during the summer}} season. It has been run by president and co-founder Josh David after former Executive Director Jenny Gersten stepped down in 2014. Previously, fellow co-founder Robert Hammond served as executive director until stepping down in February 2013. Friends of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> also has a 38-member board of directors consisting of many New York City businesspeople and philanthropists, including Amanda Burden of Bloomberg Associates, Jane Lauder of Estée Lauder Companies, Jon Stryker of the Arcus Foundation, and Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Then, the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> passes {{under the}} Chelsea Market, a food hall, at 15th Street. A spur {{connecting}} the viaduct to the National Biscuit Company building splits off at 16th Street; this spur is {{closed to the}} public. The Tenth Avenue Square, an amphitheater located on the viaduct, is at 17th Street, where the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> crosses over Tenth Avenue from southeast to northwest. At 23rd Street, there is the 23rd Street Lawn, a lawn where visitors can rest. Then, between 25th and 26th Streets, a ramp takes visitors above the viaduct, with a scenic overlook facing east at 26th Street. The Philip Falcone and Lisa Maria Falcone flyover, as it is called, is named after two major donors to the park; this ramp was based on plans for a Phase 1 flyover that was never built.|$|E
5|$|At the Gansevoort Street end, {{which runs}} north-south, the stub end over Gansevoort Street is named the Tiffany and Co.

At 14th Street, the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> is split into two sides of different elevations; the Diller-Von Furstenberg Water Feature, opened in 2010, is featured on the lower side, and a sundeck on the upper side.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the nonprofit}} {{organization}} Friends of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> {{was formed by}} Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the neighborhood that the line ran through. They advocated for the line's preservation and reuse as public open space, {{so that it would}} become an elevated park or greenway, similar to the Promenade Plantée in Paris. The organization was initially formed as a small community group to advocate for the High Line’s preservation and transformation {{at a time when the}} historic structure was under the threat of demolition during Rudy Giuliani’s second mayoral term.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} that only 7,000 daily riders entered the station between September 13–22, 2015, drastically below the MTA's projected ridership of 32,000 passengers upon the station's opening. This was attributed to incompleteness of developments in the area, {{as well as an}} unopened entrance to the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> park, which is nearby. In late October 2015, AM New York found that the average daily ridership was even lower, at only 5,900 passengers per day, except for during the 2015 New York Comic Con on October 8–11, when average daily ridership reached 18,300 daily riders. The station's official ridership between September 13 and December 31, 2015, was 692,165, making it the 392nd busiest station in the city out of 422 total stations. Ridership at the station increased in 2016 with 2,691,851 riders, making it the 189th busiest station in the city out of 422 total stations.|$|E

5|$|The <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> viaduct, then {{a portion}} of the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line, opened to trains in 1934. It {{originally}} ran from 34th Street to St. John's Park Terminal at Spring Street, and was designed to go through the center of blocks rather than over the avenue. It connected directly to factories and warehouses, allowing trains to load and unload their cargo inside buildings. Milk, meat, produce, and raw and manufactured goods could be transported and unloaded without disturbing traffic on the streets. This also reduced the load for the Bell Laboratories Building (which has housed the Westbeth Artists Community since 1970), {{as well as for the}} former Nabisco plant in the Chelsea Market building, which were served from protected sidings within the structures.|$|E
5|$|What Maisie Knew {{was filmed}} in New York for 35 days over seven {{weeks in the}} summer of 2011. It was shot on 35 mm film using an Arri camera. Filming took place in mainly Lower Manhattan, and scenes at the beach house were shot on Long Island. One scene {{featuring}} Maisie and Lincoln taking a day trip together was shot on the <b>High</b> <b>Line.</b> A scene in which Susanna performs at a concert was filmed at Webster Hall using a pre-recorded vocal track, a backing band and a small audience. According to McGehee and Siegel, a significant challenge during filming was the limited time with which they were able to work with Aprile each day due to her early bedtime. While shooting one of the film's final scenes wherein Susanna arrives at the beach house at night to pick up Maisie, Aprile fell asleep and could not be woken up; the shoot had to be postponed until two weeks later.|$|E
25|$|Along {{the line}} of the Hudson River Railroad, the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> was built in 1934 in New York City as an {{elevated}} bypass to street running trackage on Tenth Ave. The elevated section has since been abandoned, and the tunnel north of 36th St, opened in 1937, is used only by Amtrak trains to New York Penn Station (all other trains use the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad to reach the Harlem Line). A surviving section of the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> in the Chelsea section of Manhattan recently opened as a linear park, the <b>High</b> <b>Line</b> Park.|$|E
