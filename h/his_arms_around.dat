The match ended when America's Most Wanted performed their finishing maneuver the Death Sentence, which saw Storm wrap <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> Hoyt and squeeze tightly while Harris jumped off the top turnbuckle and performed a legdrop across his neck and head. America's Most Wanted followed by covering Hoyt to retain the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa. Jason confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where the old man has erased all of Jason's files from the computer. The old man tells Jason that the success of their research made time travel possible, but also plunged the world into chaos. Jason lunges at the old man, choking him. Wrapping <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his younger self, the old man bursts into flames, and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> Blythe {{in an attempt to}} hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

25|$|Work on the jet-powered {{propeller}} proved {{frustrating for}} Wittgenstein, who {{had very little}} experience working with machinery. Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that “when things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around,</b> stomp about, and swear volubly in German.” According to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing {{on the design of}} the propeller — a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.|$|E
25|$|Like many Allied leaders, Wilson {{believed}} {{after the}} {{victory at the}} Marne {{that the war was}} as good as won. He told Joffre's staff officer General Henri Mathias Berthelot (13 September) that the Allies would be in Elsenborn on the German-Belgian frontier in four weeks (Berthelot thought three). Wilson also helped to persuade Joffre (late September) to allow the BEF to redeploy further {{to the left of the}} Allied line. When French, Murray and Wilson arrived to confer with Foch (then commanding the French Armies in that sector) in early October 1914, Foch greeted Sir John with a handshake but threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> Wilson’s neck and kissed him on both cheeks.|$|E

As Smith stood up to confront Collins, Nate Robinson pulled [...] Smith away, and then began pushing and shouting at him. David Lee tried to hold Smith back, but Smith broke free and charged into Robinson, causing both players {{to fall into the}} photographers and front row courtside seats, before they were quickly separated by teammates.|$|E

500|$|Mia Farrow, who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her. She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
500|$|She was {{particularly}} affectionate towards the latter because it {{allowed her to}} appear on camera with her two children, {{and said it was}} her favorite. Certain elements of Rand's characterization were developed by Whitney and Shatner; Whitney would go to Shatner's side when their characters were put in danger – in response, Shatner would put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her, such as in [...] "Balance of Terror". The character was written out of the episode [...] "Dagger of the Mind", which Whitney attributed to the romantic liaison that Kirk has with the female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots. This was because the script had Kirk and the female lead sleep with each other. Although Whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from the episode, she understood why. Part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase the duties of the Captain's Yeoman on screen. In order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet, Roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over-the-shoulder strap which she could use as an electronic camera. He also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls. This was part of the development process that {{led to the creation of}} the tricorder.|$|E

Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that {{sent him to the}} ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E
2500|$|We {{approached}} the fortress. [...] At {{the head of}} a group of officers we saw a captain with a long white beard, who was flourishing his cane and dancing an impromptu jig. [...] The first man he met in the relief column was a bugler. [...] He threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him. [...] Then he embraced the second bugler. [...] The band tried to keep its dignity, but to no avail. [...] He then abandoned the buglers and fell on the neck of the first drummer. [...] For a moment the drum stood between him and the object of his affections, but eventually he managed to plant two loud kisses on the drummer’s cheeks. [...] Then he made for the general-in-chief. [...] There was a sudden hush, as when an orchestra falls silent {{at the end of a}} dance. [...] He recovered himself, solemnly clicked his heels, and saluted General Brière de l’Isle. [...] We recognised Captain de Borelli.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a drunken}} revelry, some of Curly Bill's friends were firing pistols {{into the air}} on October 27, 1880, [...] in a dark vacant lot between Toughnut and Allen Streets, near where the Birdcage Theater now stands. Tombstone's Town Marshal Fred White {{attempted}} to disarm Brocius and grabbed his weapon by the barrel. The gun discharged, striking White in the groin. Wyatt Earp had borrowed Fred Dodge's pistol and he pistol-whipped Brocius. At the preliminary hearing for Brocius afterward, Wyatt testified {{that he had heard}} White say: [...] "I am an officer; give me your pistol.” When he got close, he saw Brocius remove his pistol from his scabbard and White grab it by the barrel. He said he put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> Brocius from behind to see if he had any other weapons, and White [...] "gave a quick jerk and the pistol went off." [...] White fell to the ground, wounded. When the pistol discharged, Wyatt buffaloed Brocius and arrested him. Brocius complained, [...] "What have I done? I have not done anything to be arrested for.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{continued}} {{absence of}} {{news from the}} expedition against Fort Caroline greatly concerned the Spaniards at St. Augustine. San Vicente, one of the captains who had remained behind, prophesied that Menéndez would never come back, and that the entire party would be killed. This impression was confirmed by the return of a hundred men made desperate by the hardships of the march, who brought with them their version {{of the difficulty of}} the attempt. On the afternoon of Monday, the 24th, just after the successful rescue of the French frigate, the settlers saw a man coming towards them, shouting {{at the top of his}} lungs. The chaplain went out to meet him, and the man threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him, crying, [...] "Victory, victory! the harbor of the French is ours!" [...] On reaching St. Augustine, Menéndez at once armed two boats to send to the mouth of the St. Johns after Jacques Ribault, to prevent his reuniting with his father or returning to France with the news of the Spanish attack; but, learning that Jacques had already sailed, he abandoned his plan and dispatched a single vessel with supplies to Fort San Mateo.|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, March 20, 2010, {{during the}} NASCAR [...] "Saturday Night Showdown", where retired NASCAR drivers drove in a 35-lap race for charity, a terrifying crash {{involving}} Larry Pearson and Charlie Glotzbach {{ended up in}} a near-tragedy. The race was put under immediate red flag. Pearson spun out in turn 2, and as his car was sliding down the track, Glotzbach exited turn 2 and rammed into the driver's door of Pearson's car. As Glotzbach climbed out of his car and went to the infield care center, Pearson was unconscious in his car while rescue workers sawed off the roof of the car to get him out. After they got Pearson out, he regained consciousness, as reported by his brothers who talked to him. They also reported that Larry was able to move <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around.</b> Pearson was air lifted to a nearby hospital. Later, Glotzbach was driven to the same hospital. Before the race started back up, NASCAR legend David Pearson (Larry's father), who was also racing that day, withdrew from the race and went down to the hospital to see his son.|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however.

As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{service was}} {{conducted}} by the elderly and infirm Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who would be dead {{before the end of}} the year. He steadfastly refused to delegate any part of his duties and had to be supported throughout by two other bishops. Because of his failing eyesight, the text of the service had to be printed in gigantic type onto rolls of paper called [...] "prompt scrolls"; they are preserved in the Lambeth Palace Library. Archbishop Temple provided most of the upsets in an otherwise splendid ceremony; he was unable to rise after kneeling to pay homage and had to be helped up by the King and several bishops, he placed the crown back-to-front on the King's head, and when a colleague enquired after his well being, he was told to [...] "go away!" [...] in a loud voice that was plainly heard by the congregation. The King also deviated from the order of service; when the Prince of Wales touched the Crown and kissed his father's left cheek in the traditional gesture of homage, the King rose to his feet and threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his son's neck in an unusual display of affection. Because he was still convalescing, Edward had been crowned with the Imperial State Crown instead of the intended St Edward's Crown which is heavier. Alexandra was crowned immediately after her husband by William Dalrymple Maclagan, Archbishop of York. She was crowned with a new crown containing the Koh-i-Noor diamond.|$|E
2500|$|... "Two new and valuable, though but passing acquaintances {{were made}} by Beethoven this year, however - with Domenico Dragonetti, the {{greatest}} contrabassist known to history, and Johann Baptist Cramer, {{one of the greatest}} pianists. Dragonetti was not more remarkable for his astounding execution than for the deep, genuine musical feeling which elevated and ennobled it. He was now - in the spring of 1799, so far as the means are at hand of determining the time - returning to London from a visit to his native city, Venice, and his route took him to Vienna, where he remained several weeks. Beethoven and he soon met and they were mutually pleased with each other. Many years afterwards Dragonetti related the following anecdote to Samuel Appleby, Esq., of Brighton, England: [...] "Beethoven had been told that his new friend could execute violoncello music upon his huge instrument and one morning, when Dragonetti called at his room, he expressed the desire to hear a sonata. The contrabass was sent for, and the Sonata, n°2, of Op.5, was selected. Beethoven played his part, with his eyes immovably fixed upon his companion, and, in the finale, where the arpeggios occur, was so delighted and excited that at the close he sprang up and threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> both player and instrument". The unlucky contrabassists of orchestras had frequent occasions during the next few years to know that this new revelation of the powers and possibilities of their instrument to Beethoven was not forgotten."

2500|$|In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle {{declared}} that [...] "Oklahoma! really is different – beautifully different. With {{the songs that}} Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oklahoma! {{seems to me to}} be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber's Show Boat". New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that [...] "Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet , is actually the biggest hit of the show. The [...] "Out of My Dreams" [...] and [...] "All Er Nuthin'" [...] dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world." [...] In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that [...] "Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical," [...] as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. [...] "It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B." [...] Lorenz Hart himself [...] "pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi's restaurant and threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear.
