5|$|When {{it reaches}} the pouch, the {{underdeveloped}} joey suckles the teat {{of one of the}} four mammary glands while the others recede. The joey remains attached to the teat for 100–125 days, after which it ceases its attachment but remains in the pouch and continues to suckle, but more intermittently. The joey begins to leave the pouch and eat grass at around 200 <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is more developed. It still suckles, more forcefully but less regularly. By 250 days, the joey no longer needs the pouch, and it is fully weaned at around 300–350 days. The tammar wallaby has been observed to engage in alloparental care, in which an adult may adopt another's young. Male tammars may live for around 11 years, while females live for 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Malgudi is a fictional, semi-urban town in {{southern}} India, conjured by Narayan. He created {{the town in}} September 1930, on Vijayadashami, an auspicious day to start new efforts and thus chosen for him by his grandmother. As he mentioned in a later interview to his biographers Susan and N. Ram, in his mind, he first saw a railway station, and slowly the name Malgudi came to him. The town was created with an impeccable historical record, dating to the Ramayana <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was noted that Lord Rama passed through; it was {{also said that the}} Buddha visited the town during his travels. While Narayan never provided strict physical constraints for the town, he allowed it to form shape with events in the various stories, becoming a reference point for the future. Dr James M. Fennelly, a scholar of Narayan's works, created a map of Malgudi based on the fictional descriptors of the town from the many books and stories.|$|E

25|$|The defunct Bradford Dukes {{speedway}} team raced at Odsal. Speedway {{was staged}} at Greenfields Stadium in the pioneer <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> {{was known as}} the Autodrome in the early 1960s. Odsal opened its doors in 1945 and continued in the late 1950s. It entered a team in the 1960 Provincial League then fell dormant until the 1970s when it re-opened. The track staged a Speedway World Final. The speedway team rode under a number of names—probably the longest running was Bradford Northern—in common with the Rugby League team. This was changed to Bradford Barons—emulating the more successful Halifax Dukes. Eventually the Halifax team was brought to Bradford under the name Bradford Dukes.|$|E
25|$|In sheer numbers, {{they are}} {{reputed to be}} one of the most {{abundant}} of all macroscopic animals, with estimates of 100,000 individuals per square meter of ground, essentially everywhere on Earth where soil and related habitats (moss cushions, fallen wood, grass tufts, ant and termite nests) occur. Only nematodes, crustaceans, and mites are likely to have global populations of similar magnitude, and each of those groups except mites is more inclusive: though taxonomic rank cannot be used for absolute comparisons, it is notable that nematodes are a phylum and crustaceans a subphylum. Most springtails are small and difficult to see by casual observation, but one springtail, the so-called snow flea (Hypogastrura nivicola), is readily observed on warm winter <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is active and its dark color contrasts sharply with a background of snow.|$|E

25|$|Squamish {{is a minor}} {{deepwater}} port. It was {{the original}} southern terminus of the BCR in the <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was the Pacific Great Eastern, and had a busy ferry terminal where travellers would disembark from ferries and steamers bringing them in from Vancouver harbour. In the 1960s what was then called the Squamish Highway was finally pushed through from Vancouver. This made the former steamer service unnecessary. Once a thriving forestry town, with recent cutbacks in logging along with the closure and dismantling of a major sawmill in 2004, Squamish has become a tourist destination and a commuter community for workers in nearby Whistler and Vancouver. The recent closure of the Woodfibre pulp mill in 2006 signals {{an end to the}} resource based economy here. Squamish is a world centre for rock climbing, with the 1500' bulk of the Stawamus Chief, a huge rock formation always busy with climbers, along with other formations overlooking downtown and the head of Howe Sound. In addition,the strong winds and flat waters at the upper end of Howe Sound have made Squamish a mecca for windsurfers, kite boarders and keelboat sailors.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "speed campaign" [...] (MR: sokto-jon) {{calls for}} rapid {{production}} of films. According to Kim Jong-il, by producing films {{as fast as}} possible, the overall revolutionary process is expedited. The origins of the speed campaign are in the shooting of The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man in just 40 <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was anticipated to take a full year. The practice was carried out after publication of On the Art of the Cinema, too. For instance, the eight-part film series Unsung Heroes (1979–1981) was produced by following the speed campaign principle. Each film took just 45 days to produce. Subsequently speed campaigns {{have been carried out}} not only in art, but also economic matters. It was thought of as equally important with Kim Il-sung's Chollima Movement, and remains an influential concept associated with Kim Jong-il's leadership.|$|E

500|$|Pelé {{was born}} on 23 October 1940, in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American {{inventor}} Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the [...] "i" [...] and call him [...] "Edson", {{but there was a}} mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as [...] "Edison", not [...] "Edson", as he is called. He was originally nicknamed [...] "Dico" [...] by his family. He received the nickname [...] "Pelé" [...] during his school <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pelé stated {{he had no idea what}} the name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bilé, and that it is Hebrew for [...] "miracle" [...] (פֶּ֫לֶא), the word has no known meaning in Portuguese.|$|E
500|$|The 28th was {{described}} in the official history of Australia's involvement in the Korean War as [...] "the most nationally diverse" [...] brigade in the 1stCommonwealth Division, consisting of Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand units, yet also [...] "an outstandingly well-knit formation". After operating {{on the eastern side}} of the Jamestown Line from April, the 28th was transferred westward to relieve the 29th Brigade at the Hook, the Commonwealth Division's most vulnerable position, on 9–10July. At 6:15pm on 23July, Wilton informed his battalion chiefs that an armistice was ready to be signed, and to keep patrols to the minimum level necessary for the line's security. The brigade's last action took place over the next three <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> used artillery, mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire to repulse a heavy assault by Chinese troops, inflicting as many as 3,000 casualties. Wilton later recalled the [...] "terrible and gruesome sight" [...] of no-man's land [...] "literally carpeted with dead bodies". He was present for the armistice ceremony at Panmunjom on 27July. Having succeeded in maintaining his command's discipline and morale during a potentially problematic time at the end of the conflict and the beginning of peace, he handed over the 28th to Brigadier Ian Murdoch on 19February 1954. For his service in Korea, Wilton was raised to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 10June 1954. [...] He was also awarded the US Legion of Merit for his [...] "outstanding leadership and initiative"; the decoration was gazetted on 1May 1956.|$|E
500|$|Some of the University of Bristol's {{buildings}} date to its pre-charter <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was University College Bristol. These {{buildings were}} designed by Charles Hansom, the younger brother of Joseph Hansom, Joseph being {{the inventor of the}} Hansom Cab. These buildings suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. George Oatley added to them a tower in memory of Albert Fry which can still be seen on University Road. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building which it was hoped would be a symbol of academic permanence for the university and a memorial to the chief benefactor of the university, Henry Overton Wills. It was requested to the architect George Oatley that the building be built to last at least 400 years but the site purchased, at the top of Park Street suffered from an awkward slope and a desirability to link the building with the Museum and Art Gallery situated adjacent to the plot. The architecture critic Roger Gill has stated that the building is [...] "remarkable in size" [...] but noted that the [...] "ambience of a medieval University was strangely lacking". He goes on to criticise the building as a [...] "sham" [...] and a [...] "folly". The armorials on the Founder's Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. The Tyndalls Park Estate and Royal Fort House were also purchased from the trustees of the Tyndall family allowing the university to expand. Many Departments in the Faculty of Arts are housed in large Victorian houses which have been converted for teaching.|$|E
