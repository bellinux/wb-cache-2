We have developed concepts and a prototype for group recommendations for hedonic products in leisure contexts. In this workshop {{we would like to}} <b>discuss</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>ways</b> of applying experiences and results to work settings. 1 Social Media at Work Social media as a term summarises concepts and systems that allow users and companies to interact with each other, exchange information, and present themselves [Kaplan & Haenleina 2010]. Important characteristics are the use of Web 2. 0 technologies as underlying platform (i. e., HTML and asynchronous Java Script) as well as active participation of the users (i. e., User Generated Content). Typically Social Media in workplace settings are used either for company-internal systems to exchange information only accessible for employees, or for publicly accessible support and marketing systems to foster contact to customers. Group recommender systems are an example of social media in leisure settings...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The year 1980 marks a {{distinctive}} change and exciting renewal {{in the general}} development of post-war Icelandic fiction. An obsessive preoccupation with rural nostalgia and urban malaise gradually gives way to a decidedly anti-realist fiction which celebrates the wonders of everyday day life in the city. The term magical realism is often used in this context, and indeed, {{there can be little}} doubt that the Icelandic translation of Gabriel GarciaMarquez’sOneHundred Years of Solitude in 1978 constituted an important influence onwriters during this period. One contemporary Icelandic authorwhohasmade striking use ofmagical realist strategies to dislodge the current impulses ofmodernity in Icelandic culture and disrupt imposed ways of perceiving reality is Vigdís Grímsdóttir. The aim of this article is to <b>discuss</b> the <b>innovative</b> <b>ways</b> in which Vigdís has used Icelandic story-telling and folklore traditions, preserved andpasseddownmostly bywomen, to reaffirm, from a female perspective, a localised cultural imagination within a contemporary globalised Icelandic urban context. RÉSUMÉ: L’année 1980 marque un changement net et un renouveau excitant dan...|$|R
40|$|In {{times of}} an {{increasing}} demand of microdata for scientific research, {{there is a}} need to <b>discuss</b> new and <b>innovative</b> <b>ways</b> which ease the access for researchers in the European Union. Most of the Member States already offer access to their national data; the access via a safe centre to the Community Statistics still has to be expanded. To improve the data infrastructure there are several aims in the EU. The goal of the ESSnet-Project “DECENTRALISED ACCESS TO EU-MICRODATA SETS ” was to give a recommendation to set up a network of national safe centres to ease the access to the European Community Statistics based on the legal, technical and administrative feasibility. The paper will describe the framework, the objectives and the results of the project. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{guidance}} paper goes {{above and beyond}} what donors can learn [...] or already have learned [...] {{from a handful of}} excellent guides developed by the philanthropic community since Hurricane Katrina. Much of this literature on "disaster philanthropy" has been directed at the most effective ways for donors and their agents to deliver assistance during unfolding crises and the immediate aftermath, and how donors and their agents can help provide food, water, clothing, shelter, sanitation, health care and self-governance for masses of displaced and traumatized people. Here, we <b>discuss</b> <b>innovative</b> and under-appreciated <b>ways</b> that donors can help American communities recover and rebuild resiliently from disasters. The goal is to give donors a fresh perspective on supporting local efforts not only to rebuild from disasters already sustained, but also to prepare to recover from potential disasters. In both cases, there are opportunities for donors to directly fund, or pool and leverage funds for a variety of recovery and rebuilding activities, programs and services...|$|R
40|$|Eco-cultural {{tourism is}} {{presented}} {{here as a}} concept in which ecological and cultural aspects of a landscape are combined to create a site for tourists. It is proposed {{as a way for}} communities with otherwise marginal cultural or ecological resources to develop. Sustainability and participation are both crucial for the longterm future of this form of tourism. Case studies from the Federsee in Germany and the Lac de Chalain in France <b>discuss</b> the <b>innovative</b> <b>ways</b> in which cultural tourism (in the form of open-air museums) can be combined with eco-tourism to conform to every principle of sustainability. A key element to the success of eco-cultural tourism is local control in the planning, development and maintenance of these sites. This is discussed particularly {{in the context of a}} third site, the Saimaa Lakes in Finland, where there is a nuanced complexity involved in the ways local people view their environment and ecologists regulate it. The potential of eco-cultural tourism as a tool for empowerment and development at the Saimaa Lakes is highlighted. Eco-cultural tourism also provides ways for the practice of archaeology and anthropology to mix and to articulate with wider society, although it may also pit the two disciplines against each another. Eco-cultural tourism reflects present-day practice, but also acts as a model for how cultural and eco-tourism could be employed by local people to build an empowered, sustainable future in similar settings elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Este texto analisa a relação das crianças com os mortos, e o risco de sua própria morte, para os Mebengokré-Xikrin, grupo indígena do Norte do Brasil falante de uma língua jê. Desenvolve-se o tema a partir da análise da fabricação do corpo e da pessoa e da relação com os mortos, com especial atenção às crianças. Assim, a formação da pessoa e a relação das crianças com o cosmos e os mortos - seu risco de serem capturadas pelos espíritos dos mortos, sua adoção post mortem, sua ornamentação corporal, o luto, os cuidados com o corpo e as interações sociais - são discutidas, permitindo que se entenda de modo inovador a concepção mebengokré-xikrin de infância e de sua condição de existência no mundo. This article {{analyses}} {{the relations}} among children, {{the dead and}} death, and the eventuality of a child's own death, to the Mebengokre-Xikrin, an indigenous population living in North of Brazil and speaker of a Gê language. These themes are developed on analyzing the fabrication of the body, {{the formation of the}} self and the person, and the relations with the dead, giving special attention to children. Thus, the formation of the self and children's relations to the cosmos and the dead - their eventuality of being captured by spirits of the dead, their being adopted in the after-life, their mourning, their bodily adornment and painting, how they are cared in life preventing death, their bodies and social interactions - are analyzed in order to <b>discuss</b> in a <b>innovative</b> <b>way</b> mebengokré-xikrin notions of childhood...|$|R
