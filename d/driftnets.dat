5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh <b>driftnets,</b> and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5â€“7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, <b>driftnets,</b> trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E
25|$|While gillweed nets are a {{principal}} concern, {{other types of}} nets also pose a problem: trawl nets, purse seines, beach seines, longline gear, and <b>driftnets.</b> <b>Driftnets</b> are known for high rates of bycatch and they affect all cetaceans and other marine species. They are fatal for small toothed whales (Odontocetes) and sperm whales, {{as well as other}} marine mammals and fish such as sharks, sea birds and sea turtles. Many fisheries routinely use <b>driftnets</b> exceeding the EU size limit of 2.5km/boat. This illegal drift-netting is a major issue, especially in important feeding and breeding grounds for cetaceans.|$|E

50|$|High Seas <b>Driftnet</b> Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992 is United States {{declaration}} citing an {{observance of}} the United Nationsinternational <b>driftnet</b> fishery conservation program to restrict large scale <b>driftnet</b> fishing in high seas or international waters. The Act of Congress acknowledges the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions imposing a global moratorium on all high seas <b>driftnet</b> fishing by December 31, 1992. In accordance with Title 16 section 1857, the United States federal law 102-582 proclaims the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act prohibits {{the application of}} large scale <b>driftnet</b> fishing within an exclusive economic zone of any sovereign state and the United States.|$|R
25|$|Drift nets {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net haulers are usually {{used to set}} and haul <b>driftnets,</b> with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, large-scale, high-seas <b>driftnet</b> fishing has sparked intense debate and {{political}} conflict in many oceanic regions. In the Pacific Ocean the <b>driftnet</b> controversy first emerged in the North Pacific transition zone and subarctic frontal zone, where <b>driftnet</b> vessels from Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan pursue their target species of neon flying squid. Other North Pacific <b>driftnet</b> fleets from Japan and Taiwan target stocks of tunas and billfishes. Both types of <b>driftnet</b> fishing incidentally kill valued non-target species of marine life, including fish, mammals, birds, and turtles. In response to public concerns about <b>driftnet</b> fishing, government scientists began early on to assemble available information and consider what new data were required to assess impacts on North Pacific marine resources and the broader pelagic ecosystem. Accordingly, a workshop was convened at the NMFS Honolulu Laboratory in May 1988 to review current information on the biology, oceanography, and fisheries of the North Pacific transition zone and subarctic frontal zone. The workshop participants, from the United States and Canada, also developed a strategic plan to guide NMFS in developing a program of <b>driftnet</b> fishery research and impact assessment. This volume contains a selection of scientific review papers presented at the 1988 Honolulu workshop. The papers represent part of the small kernel of information available then, prior {{to the expansion of}} cooperative international scientific programs. Subsequent <b>driftnet</b> fishery monitoring and research by the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan have added much new data. Nevertheless, this collection of papers provides a historical perspective and contains useful information not readily available elsewhere. (PDF file contains 118 pages. ...|$|R
