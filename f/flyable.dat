5|$|Hangar 2 is {{a double}} Type T2 hangar, erected in the 1970s. It {{occupies}} {{the site of a}} T2 hangar erected in the 1950s. It accommodates the <b>flyable</b> aircraft of Duxford's private aviation companies, such as The Fighter Collection, and allows visitors to see aircraft undergoing maintenance or restoration.|$|E
5|$|The Ho Chi Minh Campaign {{commenced}} on March 9, 1975 and by mid-March the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) {{had withdrawn}} from the Central Highlands. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force 6th Air Force Division had been given only 48 hours to evacuate its aircraft and personnel from Pleiku Air Base leaving 64 aircraft intact, including 36 aircraft in <b>flyable</b> storage, and no attempt were made to put those aircraft into commission. On March 27 with South Vietnamese forces of I Corps facing imminent defeat, Republic of Vietnam Air Force Brigadier-General Nguyen Duc Khanh, commander of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force 1st Air Force Division, was ordered to evacuate all <b>flyable</b> aircraft from Huế and Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} services, the Congolese Air Force is {{not capable of}} {{carrying}} out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently <b>flyable</b> or capable of being restored to service and {{it is unclear whether}} the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E
5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Boeing, General Dynamics and North American Rockwell in January 1970. In June 1970, North American Rockwell's design was selected and {{was awarded a}} development contract. The original program called for two test airframes, five <b>flyable</b> aircraft, and 40 engines. This was cut in 1971 to one ground and three flight test aircraft. The company {{changed its name to}} Rockwell International and named its aircraft division North American Aircraft Operations in 1973. A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Plans called for 240 B-1As to be built, with initial operational capability set for 1979.|$|E
5|$|The Akutan Zero, {{also known}} as Koga's Zero and the Aleutian Zero, was a type 0 model 21 Mitsubishi A6M Zero Japanese fighter {{aircraft}} that crash-landed on Akutan Island, Alaska Territory, during World War II. It was found intact by the Americans in July 1942 {{and became the first}} <b>flyable</b> Zero acquired by the United States during the war. It was repaired and flown by American test pilots. As a result of information gained from these tests, American tacticians were able to devise ways to defeat the Zero, which was the Imperial Japanese Navy's primary fighter plane throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Other {{operators}} {{used the}} Comet either through leasing arrangements or through second-hand acquisitions. BOAC's Comet 4s were leased out to Air Ceylon, Air India, AREA Ecuador, Central African Airways, and Qantas Empire Airways; after 1965 they {{were sold to}} AREA Ecuador, Dan-Air, Mexicana, Malaysian Airways, and the Ministry of Defence. BEA's Comet 4Bs were chartered by Cyprus Airways, Malta Airways, and Transportes Aéreos Portugueses. Channel Airways obtained five Comet 4Bs from BEA in 1970 for inclusive tour charters. Dan-Air bought all of the surviving <b>flyable</b> Comet 4s from the late 1960s into the 1970s; some were for spares reclamation but most were operated on the carrier's inclusive tour charters; a total of 48 Comets of all marks were acquired by the airline.|$|E
5|$|While {{fighting}} raged {{inside the}} district, all <b>flyable</b> aircraft from the 118th Aviation Company flew out from Biên Hòa to Phước Vinh, {{a small town}} about 30 kilometres from Đồng Xoài. From Phước Vinh the first contingent of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was airlifted into the battlefield. At around 8am, the UH-1 formations of the 118th Aviation Company descend on the landing zone near the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation, about 4 kilometres north of Đồng Xoài; they immediately began to receive fire from bunkers and foxholes surrounding the area. The South Vietnamese command believed the landing zone near Thuận Lợi would be ideal to land their troops, because it was distant enough that the Viet Cong would not find and engage them immediately. However, the Viet Cong had anticipated the South Vietnamese would land troops in the area, and had prepared for an ambush. As a result, after U.S. helicopters had departed from the landing zone, soldiers of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment immediately turned their attention on the South Vietnamese. Within 15 minutes {{the main body of}} the ARVN 1st Battalion was completely destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Jackson {{is an avid}} {{aviation}} enthusiast {{and owns}} a collection of over 40 <b>flyable</b> World War I-era warbirds housed at Hood Aerodrome near Masterton, and a Gulfstream G650 in Wellington.|$|E
25|$|The numbers {{below in}} {{italicized}} brackets indicate {{the number of}} FEAF aircraft in the inventory actually <b>flyable</b> on 8 December. If no figure is listed, the number of usable aircraft is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The oldest <b>flyable</b> {{aircraft}} {{in the world as}} of 2011, a Humber-built Bleriot XI from 1909 owned by the Shuttleworth Collection in the UK, still uses the very early form registration G-AANG.|$|E
25|$|The {{last of the}} 2d Air Division {{abandoned}} the airfield with the remaining <b>flyable</b> airplanes, leaving four A C-119s which had flown in from Da Nang and two A-37s to the North Vietnamese.|$|E
25|$|The film uses Computer-generated imagery to {{replicate}} the scenes of bombing runs and dogfights, given the limitation of having a tiny number of zero fighters being in a <b>flyable</b> condition having survived till the present day.|$|E
25|$|Military {{use of the}} An-10 {{was fairly}} {{extensive}} with 45 An-10TS built for the VTA, 16 flown exclusively by military units and the remaining 38 loaned to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, {{as well as the}} <b>flyable</b> aircraft remaining after withdrawal from Aeroflot service.|$|E
25|$|The F-102 left U.S. {{service in}} 1976, while the last QF-102A / PQM-102B drone was {{expended}} in 1986. No F-102s remain in <b>flyable</b> condition today, although many {{can be seen}} at museums or as permanent static displays as gate guardians at Air Force and Air National Guard installations.|$|E
25|$|Jane's World Air Forces 2007 {{states that}} the Air Force {{operates}} between 9 and 22 Mil Mi-24/35s attack helicopters, and a single Mi-26. The condition of the DRC's aircraft which are not currently in service is generally so poor that they cannot be repaired and returned to <b>flyable</b> status.|$|E
25|$|A {{contract}} for three MC-1 gliders, (two <b>flyable</b> {{and one for}} static testing), {{was given to the}} Airborne and General aircraft company, which had been formed by Bowlus and Criz. This company soon transformed into the General Airborne Transport company which built the full sized MC-1 gliders with the military designation XCG-16.|$|E
25|$|One Buchón, {{which had}} taxied in The Battle of Britain, flew in the 1988 LWT miniseries Piece of Cake, {{and was one}} of three <b>flyable</b> HA-1112s used to depict Bf 109s in the 1990 film Memphis Belle. The Piece of Cake Buchón also {{appeared}} in the 1991 ITV television miniseries A Perfect Hero.|$|E
25|$|Five <b>flyable</b> B-17s were {{secured by}} {{producer}} Elmo Williams {{for use in}} the filming of the 1970 motion picture Tora! Tora! Tora!. During filming, one B-17 suffered a malfunction in its landing gear, forcing it to land on one wheel. Williams ordered a camera crew to film the landing and incorporated the footage into the film's script.|$|E
25|$|By 2003, Iraq's {{air power}} {{numbered}} an estimated 180 combat aircraft, of which {{only about half}} were <b>flyable.</b> In late 2002, a Yugoslav weapons company provided servicing for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s, violating UN sanctions. An aviation institute in Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, supplied the engines and spare parts. These however, were too late to improve the condition of Iraq's air force.|$|E
25|$|BuNo 143221 – {{on display}} at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida. The {{aircraft}} was acquired in <b>flyable</b> condition in 1973 from Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) at NAS Glynco, Georgia pending the closure of NAS Glynco and the squadron's relocation to NAS Pensacola. It is currently {{on display at}} the Sherman Field flight line annex of the museum.|$|E
25|$|In September 1995 {{in southwestern}} Washington State, a low–flying LongRanger was downed by a metal arrow {{launched}} by an irate deer hunter. The arrow pierced a rotor blade, bending the blade. The arrow shaft tore the tailfin and boom {{as it was}} being chopped up by the spinning rotor. The helicopter was still <b>flyable,</b> but the pilot made a precautionary landing to assess the damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{rarity of}} <b>flyable</b> Zeros {{accounts}} {{for the use of}} single-seat North American T-6 Texans, with heavily modified fuselages and painted in Japanese markings, as substitutes for Zeros in the films Tora! Tora! Tora!, The Final Countdown, and many other television and film depictions of the aircraft, such as Baa Baa Black Sheep (renamed Black Sheep Squadron). One Model 52 was used during the production of Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, a German company, Flug Werk GmbH, began {{manufacturing}} new Fw 190 {{models as}} reproductions. By 2012 almost 20 had been produced, most <b>flyable,</b> a few as static display models, with airworthy examples usually powered by Chinese-manufactured Shvetsov ASh-82 twin-row, 14-cylinder radial powerplants, {{which have a}} displacement of 41.2 litres, close to the BMW 801's 41.8 litres, with the same engine cylinder arrangement and number of cylinders.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, {{following}} {{the eruption of}} Mount St. Helens, a 36 TAS C-130 crew provided communications support during the search for survivors. One week after St. Helen's first eruption, a second one occurred. All of the base's <b>flyable</b> aircraft were evacuated following reports that ash was drifting northwest toward McChord. In 1988 McChord became involved in combating devastating Yellowstone National Park forest fires, carrying troops from Fort Lewis to the fire areas.|$|E

25|$|There {{was some}} {{evidence}} {{that one of the}} right elevator power control units may have suffered a malfunction, and the Egyptian investigation mentioned this as a likely cause of the crash. While noting that the damage did indeed exist, the NTSB countered that it was more than likely caused by the crash rather than existing beforehand, and furthermore it was not enough to cause the crash, as the 767 is designed to remain <b>flyable</b> even with two PCUs failed.|$|E
25|$|The DRC's single Mil Mi-26 'Halo' {{was shown}} as a photo in Air Forces Monthly (AFM)'s July 2007 issue without obvious rust and {{appearing}} {{to be in good}} condition which was taken on April 12, 2007, at Lubumbashi. It was delivered in 2005. AFM says that a second Mi-26 prepared for the DRC has been stored with Skytech at Liège Airport, Belgium since at least June 2002. As of 2015 the table below displays aircraft presently in <b>flyable</b> condition.|$|E
25|$|Pumas, Bell 205s, 206s and 212s {{from the}} 209th were also deployed, however, FAM's {{helicopter}} assets were scarce and the Mexican Army {{had to rely}} on almost every other government agency's helicopters for general support tasks. Almost any <b>flyable</b> aircraft from the National Attorney's Office (PGR) was also deployed, including Bell 206s and 212s, as well as the Navy's recently acquired Mi-8MTV-1s. Eventually the Army deployed some 70,000 ground troops and air support proved to be insufficient; hence the decision was taken to considerably expand the FAM's helicopter fleet.|$|E
25|$|Replica – F.1 {{on display}} at the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge, Surrey. It was built in 1977 by Viv Bellamy at Lands End, as a <b>flyable</b> {{reproduction}} for Leisure Sport Ltd. Painted to represent B7270 of 209 Squadron, RAF, the machine which Captain Roy Brown flew when officially credited with shooting down Baron Manfred von Richthofen, it has a Clerget rotary engine of 1916 and was registered as G-BFCZ until 2003. First displayed at the museum in January 1988 for Sir Thomas Sopwith’s 100th birthday celebrations, it was purchased by the museum later that year.|$|E
25|$|Up to 1982, the Lightnings {{were mainly}} {{operated}} by 2 and 6 Squadron RSAF (although {{a few were}} also used by 13 Squadron RSAF), but when 6 Squadron re-equipped with the F-15 Eagle then all the remaining aircraft were operated by 2 Squadron at Tabuk. In 1985 {{as part of the}} agreement to sell the Panavia Tornado to the RSAF, the 22 <b>flyable</b> Lightnings were traded in to British Aerospace and returned to Warton in January 1986. While BAe offered the ex-Saudi Lightnings to Austria and Nigeria, no sales were made, and the aircraft were eventually disposed of to museums.|$|E
25|$|By June 1939, Power Jets {{could barely}} {{afford to keep}} the lights on when yet another visit was made by Air Ministry personnel. This time Whittle was able to run the W.U. at high power for 20minutes without any difficulty. One {{of the members of}} the team was the Director of Scientific Research, David Randall Pye, who walked out of the {{demonstration}} utterly convinced of the importance of the project. The Ministry agreed to buy the W.U. and then loan it back to them, injecting cash, and placed an order for a <b>flyable</b> version of the engine.|$|E
