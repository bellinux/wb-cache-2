Plasma forms an impassable wall that no unit can cross, and is generated by Meteors. Once a Meteor is destroyed, any Plasma in contact with it disappears, allowing units to pass. Plasma that is not in contact with a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E

The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably <b>impedes.</b> Secret discussions also prevent the public from being informed about controversial issues that may have arisen in the course of implementing new laws, especially those which may affect the rights of minorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in that society that occasionally allows for female-specific human rights abuses. At the same time, if talented women footballers do emerge, many choose to go abroad to maximize playing opportunities. A lack of funding <b>impedes</b> regional {{development of}} women's football {{as most of the}} funding for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as breaks in the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that <b>impedes</b> the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E

5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and {{moisture}} in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that <b>impedes</b> further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E
5|$|Krell's Klingon battlecruiser and two Birds of Prey {{arrive in}} orbit and Krell orders the ships {{to destroy the}} colony. Enterprise {{attempts}} to intervene but is engaged by the Birds of Prey. Columbia arrives and joins combat with the two Birds of Prey, while Enterprise <b>impedes</b> the battlecruiser. Meanwhile, Phlox infects a restrained Archer, as he needs human antibodies for the cure. Antaak then transports a canister of the virus onto the battlecruiser which infects the crew, including Krell. Needing the cure from Phlox, Krell stands down the attack and the Klingon High Council soon agrees to distribute the cure throughout the Empire. Tucker then agrees to remain onboard temporarily to assist with repairs.|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that <b>impedes</b> the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{explains the}} variation in estimated trade effects of technical barriers to trade broadly defined, using available estimates from the empirical international trade literature, and accounting for data sampling and methodology differences. Agriculture and food industries {{tend to be more}} <b>impeded</b> by these barriers than other sectors. SPS regulations on agricultural and food trade flows from developing exporters to high-income importers tend to <b>impede</b> trade. Not controlling for “multilateral resistance” barriers increase the likelihood to overstate the trade <b>impeding</b> effect of technical measures and not accounting for their potential endogeneity with trade does the opposite. Studies using direct maximum residue limits tend to find more trade <b>impeding</b> effects than other measures and clearer policy implications. Other technical measures proxies tend to muddle results and increase the likelihood of inconclusive results and few policy implications...|$|R

When people only fantasize about a positive future or only ruminate about <b>impeding</b> reality, no necessity to act is experienced and expectations fail to be activated and used. In two experiments with different paradigms (a salience procedure and a reinterpretation procedure) and distinct fantasy themes (getting to know an attractive stranger and successfully combining work and family life), participants mentally contrasted a positive future with <b>impeding</b> reality, fantasized about a positive future, or ruminated about <b>impeding</b> reality. Expectations of success guided behavioral commitment towards fantasy realization only when a positive future was mentally contrasted with <b>impeding</b> reality. The findings have implications {{for the emergence of}} goals and the recent realism versus optimism debate.

5|$|Though {{at first}} Silver stalks Sonic and <b>impedes</b> his {{attempts}} to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is {{not the cause of}} his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to erase the past for his own evil purposes. Throughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles succeeds, but Sonic, Shadow, and Silver use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their super forms and defeat Solaris.|$|E

40|$|Two {{small groups}} of steroids in the estrane series—here {{designated}} as <b>impeded</b> estrogens,—represent a class of compounds which differ from the majority of estrogenic substances in exerting certain unusual influences on growth of the uterus. The induction of these effects previously {{was considered to be}} peculiar to estriol. The unusual growth properties common to <b>impeded</b> estrogens are twofold: (a) after the threshold dosage required to initiate growth has been reached, the slope of the curve of increment of uterine weight in response to increased steroid dosage is very gradual rather than steep; (b) these compounds possess the ability to inhibit to a limited extent the uterine growth induced by estrone administered concurrently. The partial inhibition of estrone-induced growth of the uterus is confined to a critical dosage of the <b>impeded</b> estrogen and is overcome by increased dosage of the inhibitor. Estrone-induced growth of the vagina is not inhibited by <b>impeded</b> estrogens. Furthermore the simultaneous administration of <b>impeded</b> estrogens and testosterone does not lessen the amount of uterine growth evoked by the latter. The <b>impeded</b> estrogens so far encountered are 3 -hydroxyestratriene derivatives possessing either a ketone group at position 6 or a hydroxyl group at position 16. Oxygenated functions at these positions in phenolic estrogens have special significance in the excitation and restraint of uterine growth unshared by similar groups at certain other sites of the estrane molecule...|$|R
