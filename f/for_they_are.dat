5|$|Meyerbeer's large choral 'tableaux' {{also made}} a major {{contribution}} to the overall dramatic effect; the composer particularly sought opportunities to write such large-scale crowd scenes, and preferred libretti which offered such possibilities. Crosten writes: 'These massive developed sections are the chief glory of the Meyerbeerian opera, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not only big in volume but big in their structural design'.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of the Protestants, the Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in a different manner and with a different emphasis from the Catholic tradition. While statues of the Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.|$|E
25|$|The {{names with}} {{meanings}} known for certain are Hiril 'lady' and Meleth 'love', <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the only {{names of the}} Haladin that were given in Sindarin. Haleth's name presumably also means 'lady', but in the tongue of the Folk (the grave of Haleth, daughter of Haldad, is called both Ladybarrow and Tûr Haretha).

25|$|Cold cured or cold pour dentures, {{also known}} as {{temporary}} dentures, do not look very natural, are not very durable, tend to be highly porous and are only used as a temporary expedient until a more permanent solution is found. These types of dentures are inferior and tend to cost much less due to their quick production time (usually minutes) and low cost materials. It is not suggested that a patient wear a cold cured denture {{for a long period}} of time, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> prone to cracks and can break rather easily.|$|E
25|$|Parents play a {{vital part}} in a child’s early life, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{the first group of}} people that a child meets and learns from. The {{information}} that surrounds a child at home becomes reinforcements for desired behaviors of a male or female. Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a child is born most parents have already engaged in gender stereotypic expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these parent-child interactions have long lasting influence on how a child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.|$|E

[...] In June 2002, shortly after the Israeli government launched Operation Defensive Shield, Nasrallah gave a speech in which he defended and praised suicide bombings of Israeli targets by members of Palestinian groups for [...] "creating a deterrence and equalizing fear."

Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some {{of my friends are}} gone, and some of my friends are sleeping– sleeping the churchyard sleep– the hour of evening is sad– it was once my study hour– my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{two girls}} gaze out wistfully {{from beneath the}} outstretched arms of Mrs. Mason. The hats that the {{children}} wear are drawn {{in such a way}} that they form halos around their heads, a touch Blake also uses in Songs of Innocence and of Experience to indicate the innate and divine visionary capacity of the child (see for example [...] "The Ecchoing Green" [...] and [...] "The Little oy Found"). The children’s eyes are open – they are looking at what a fine morning it is and longing to take part in it. They cannot participate, however, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> under the suffocating influence of Mrs. Mason. In contrast to the children’s halo-like hats Mrs. Mason wears a large cumbrous bonnet. Her eyes are downcast to such an extent that they appear to be shut. Blake often draws Urizen's eyes in this way to signify the blindness of his rational and materialist ‘Single vision.’ See for example plates 1, 9 and 22 of The Book of Urizen and plate 11 of For Children: The Gates of Paradise where Urizenic 'Aged Ignorance,’ wearing large spectacles, blindly clips the wings of a child thus preventing its imaginative flight in the morning sunrise. Ironically then, Mrs. Mason is the only individual in the illustration who is not seeing what a fine morning it is. She looks down at the hard factual earth, ignoring the infinite and holy life around her. (emphasis Mitchell's) ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{not certain}} on what day the Russians began {{shelling}} the fort. Based on reports by Apraksin to Peter and on Peter the Great's journal, Russian artillery opened fire on 1 April. However, Apraksin reported to the czar that he [...] "began bombarding Viborg and the castle on 30 March, and {{on the first day}} 130 bombs were planted, and 90 on the second." [...] Furthermore, Aleksander Myshlayevsky published a [...] "List of how many shots were fired from mortars and cannon at Viborg from 21 March to 9 April, and how many of them hit the city." [...] There, it claims that shelling began on 29 March, when 150 mortar shots and 60 cannon shots were fired. It continues, saying that during the next three days only the mortars were used, firing 100 shots per day. In total, during the first period of the siege, the attackers fired 2,975 shots from mortars and 1,531 from cannon, and the Swedes fired 399 mortar shots and 7,464 cannon shots; thus the Swedish fire outweighed the Russian fire. On 5 April, Apraksin noted that [...] "our cannon are doing little to help us, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> rather small and light; when we begin firing, the opponent shoots one out of ten." [...] However, the mortars inflicted great damage upon Vyborg and the fort, forcing citizens to find cover in cellars. Despite this, soldiers had to remain positioned on the mounds, and suffered heavy casualties.|$|E
500|$|In 632, {{at the end}} of {{the tenth}} year after {{migration}} to Medina, Muhammad completed his first true Islamic pilgrimage, setting precedence for the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as Hajj. [...] On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah Muhammad delivered his Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, he said a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to [...] "be good to women, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear my words ..." [...] He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: [...] "Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" [...] (Quran [...] ). According to Shia tafsir, it refers to the appointment of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the pond of Khumm as Muhammad's successor, this occurring a few days later when Muslims were returning from Mecca to Medina.|$|E
