5|$|Although the Inaccessible Island rail {{may have}} been <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tristan Islanders who visited the island {{annually}} to hunt seals, the species {{first came to the}} attention of scientists during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876. When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson learned of the species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to collect a specimen, much to his regret.|$|E

5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (<b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Mesolithic people settled {{in the region of}} York between 8000 and 7000BC, although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area was occupied by a tribe <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romans as the Brigantes. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but, later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman Ninth Legion was sent north of the Humber into Brigantian territory.|$|E
5|$|Arnhem {{restored}} much of Model's self-confidence, {{which had}} been shaken by the experience of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the Hürtgen Forest and Aachen. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of his units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking {{full advantage of the}} fortifications of the Westwall, <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies as the Siegfried Line.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} types Asian and African megafauna, the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Europeans in its range. The rhinos being easy targets, this was as severe a contributor to its decline as was poaching for its horns. Such was the toll of big-game hunting {{that by the time}} the rhino's plight was made <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world, only the Javan and the (then unknown) Vietnamese populations remained.|$|E

Around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby Knoll and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them back into a defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter-attack. Scrubby Knoll, <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Turks as Kemalyeri (Kemal's Place), now became the site of the Turkish headquarters for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E
