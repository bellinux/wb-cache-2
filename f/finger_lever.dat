50|$|On woodwind {{instruments}} {{such as a}} flute or saxophone, {{keys are}} <b>finger</b> operated <b>levers</b> used to open or close tone holes, thereby shortening or lengthening the resonating tube of the instrument. The keys on the keyboard of a pipe organ also open and close various valves, but the air flow is driven mechanically rather than lung powered, and the flow of air is directed through different pipes tuned for each note. The keys of an accordion direct the air flow from a manually operated bellows across various tuned vibrating reeds.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1894CSBL (2011) caliber [...]357 Magnum, {{was to come}} in {{stainless}} with a big-loop <b>finger</b> <b>lever,</b> 16.25-inch barrel, pistol-grip laminated stock, and a one-piece XS {{scope mount}} with folding 'ghost ring' aperture sight. However, shortly after announcing its release, Marlin suspended production indefinitely. None have been shipped as of June 2012.|$|E

The thumb acts as the fulcrum while the other 4 fingers can apply mechanical forces to the stick.|$|E

I made a {{sweeping}} blow {{in the dark}} at them with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had simply to fight against their persistent <b>fingers</b> for my <b>levers,</b> {{and at the same}} time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock's skull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last scramble.|$|R
60|$|There was a minute's pause perhaps. The Psychologist {{seemed about}} to speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his <b>finger</b> towards the <b>lever.</b> 'No,' he said suddenly. 'Lend me your hand.' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's hand in his own {{and told him to}} put out his forefinger. So that it was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am {{absolutely}} certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.|$|R
5000|$|... "This {{provides}} a drive which is automatic in variation of ratio within limits, easily set by a <b>finger</b> and thumb <b>lever</b> {{on the top}} of the steering wheel. The actual transmission is through steel rollers which transmit the drive between curved steel races, the ratio being altered by rocking the rollers to different driving positions to engage with differing diameters of the driving and driven races. There are no gears—except for reverse—and a wide variation in ratios is available automatically. The driving rollers are rocked or precessed to give varying ratios by hydraulic means and the driver by his little lever can modify the performance as road conditions require. Subject to the control setting, the automatic functioning ensures a constant engine speed whatever the tractive resistance met with on the road, the transmission varying its ratio to balance the resistance as it increases or decreases. The engine speed by creating oil pressure in the hydraulic control system, tends to precess the rollers to give a high ratio drive. This is counterbalanced by the reaction of the tractive resistance, which tends to give a low ratio precession. A valve worked by the movement of the forward and reverse lever which engages the drive —in the ordinary way and is centrally placed like the ordinary speed lever—releases the pressure in the hydraulic control unit when the lever is in its neutral and reverse positions, so that the drive is always at low ratio for starting from rest or reversing.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{followed}} by the Model 1888 which was a top-eject action like the 1881 with several improvements, most important was the incorporation of a locking lug locking the breech. It was chambered in the WCF (Winchester centerfire) family of cartridges originally developed for the Winchester 1873 rifle: [...]44 WCF, [...]38 WCF, and [...]32 WCF (also known as the [...]44/40, [...]38/40, and [...]32/20). The Model 1889 that followed was the first lever-action rifle to have a solid top with side ejection of spent cartridges. This model was chambered for the same cartridges as the 1888. Design improvements to the Model 1889, such as a one-piece trigger and a two-piece firing pin to prevent the rifle from firing unless the <b>finger</b> <b>lever</b> was fully closed or if the locking lug were missing, resulted in the Model 1894. Additionally, the <b>finger</b> <b>lever</b> lock of the Model 1889 was eliminated on the Model 1894 and replaced by a latch built into the lever itself. This model was chambered in the same calibers with the addition of the [...]25/20 and later [...]218 Bee.|$|E

40|$|Purpose For the {{application}} of less invasive robotic neurosurgery to the resection of deep-seated tumors, a prototype system of a force-detecting gripper with a flexible micromanipulator and force feedback to the operating unit will be developed. Methods Gripping force applied on the gripper is detected by strain gauges attached to the gripper clip. The signal is transmitted to the amplifier by wires running through the inner tube of the manipulator. Proportional force is applied on the <b>finger</b> <b>lever</b> of the operating unit by the surgeon using a bilateral control program. A pulling force experienced by the gripper is also detected at the gripper clip. The signal for the pulling force is transmitted in a manner identical to that mentioned previously, and the proportional torque is applied on the touching roller of the <b>finger</b> <b>lever</b> of the operating unit. The surgeon can feel the gripping force as {{the resistance of the}} operating force of the finger and can feel the pulling force as the friction at the finger surface. Results A basic operation test showed that both the gripping force and pulling force were clearly detected in the gripping of soft material and that the operator could feel the gripping force and pulling force at the <b>finger</b> <b>lever</b> of the operating unit. Conclusions A prototype of the force feedback in the microgripping manipulator system has been developed. The system will be useful for removing deep-seated brain tumors in future master-slave-type robotic neurosurgery. © 2013 CARS...|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} the hand causes the {{disruption}} of organ function, this problem later emerged prosthetic {{as a tool for}} replacement of missing body parts. Basically prosthetic hand has two function: as cosmetics and as a functional tool. The most important functional aspects of prosthetic hand is the ease of operation that {{can be seen from the}} magnitude of tensile force required by prosthetic hand while doing the a movement. The mechanism of motion system that is widely used by prosthetic hand is a cross cable system and cross bar system. Cross cable system using cable to connect components that act as link knuckles on hand, when the withdrawal event of the cable happenend, the cable will be tightened and the movement of the fingers may occur. Cross bar systems uses bar (rigid link) as a puller, so when withdrawal event of the rope at the end of the lever happened, the bar that connects the components with a <b>finger</b> <b>lever</b> puller will push or pull bar so that the finger will open or close. Prosthetic design significantly influence the magnitude of the dynamic tensile strength that makes it necessary to make an experiments to compare the design of motion mechanisms of cross able systems and cross bar system, and evaluate the influence on the magnitude of the dynamic tensile force at the time of movement, so it can represent the natural movement of normal human fingers...|$|E
