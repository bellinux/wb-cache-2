5|$|When Lieutenant General Krueger's Sixth United States Army {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} Australia in February 1943, the administrative functions {{were taken from}} USASOS and given to a new headquarters, United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), under MacArthur's command. This had the same name as MacArthur's old headquarters in the Philippines, but its function was <b>different.</b> <b>This</b> left USASOS with logistical responsibilities only. The new arrangement was awkward, and required considerable adjustment before it functioned properly. In September 1943, Marshall was replaced by Brigadier General James L. Frink.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Natasha blames Andrew for the crash. She learns Ed has a {{fractured}} collarbone and sits with {{him until he}} wakes up. When he does, Natasha kisses him. They begin dating, but Natasha worries {{that they do not}} have much in common. Natasha helps organise a ball for the university and takes an immediate dislike to Ed's vintage suit. She spills coffee on it and then lends Ed a nicer one that she found. Ed realises what she has done and they fight. After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too different. When Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul. Andrew initially blames Natasha for causing the fit when Paul takes Charlie's away from him. She then helps him to convince Paul to change his mind. Natasha and Andrew begin dating again in secret. They later decide to tell everyone and Summer reveals that she already knew and does not mind. Natasha later finds an old email from Andrew proclaiming his love for Summer and she begins to worry about her relationship with him. However, Andrew reassures her that he loves her and their relationship is <b>different</b> <b>this</b> time around. Natasha asks Andrew to take a month of celibacy, but they end up breaking it early. Natasha quits university and tells Andrew that she is leaving Erinsborough to travel around Europe. She asks Andrew to come with her and he agrees. They leave the following day with Paul's blessing.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} production {{involved a}} story {{that took place in}} the distant future. In this story, a crew of explorers in a spaceship visit an abandoned planet, discovering signs of an extraterrestrial civilization that left behind technological artifacts. The explorers initially assume that the occupants of the planet had died off, seeing no sign of them, but as the story progresses, the player was meant to discover something very <b>different.</b> <b>This</b> premise is similar to the finished game's story, but contains clear differences.|$|E

25|$|Several Deputies and {{high-ranking}} {{civil servants}} {{were of the}} opinion that Luxembourg could retain a measure of autonomy under the military administration, as had occurred in World War I, and attempts were made to come to some sort of arrangement with Germany. However, it was soon made clear by the authorities in Berlin that Luxembourg's fate would be very <b>different</b> <b>this</b> time. The Nazis considered the Luxembourgish people as just another Germanic ethnic group and the Grand Duchy a German territory. The military authorities had to leave Luxembourg by 31 July 1940, {{to be replaced by a}} civil administration under Gustav Simon.|$|E

Michigan's athletic director, Dave Brandon, felt a rematch would be {{an excellent way to}} gain attention for Michigan football and said [...] "The networks were fighting over who gets to televise that game." [...] Jerry Moore said that [...] "To have the University of Michigan invite us back is the ultimate compliment for us as a program and a university. We're grateful for the opportunity to have a new generation of players experience a gameday at the Big House and to test themselves against college football's all-time winningest program." [...] Appalachian State played their first year of football in the FBS in 2014 and joined the Sun Belt Conference as full members. The rematch was much <b>different</b> <b>this</b> time around, with Michigan beating Appalachian State 52–14; Appalachian State never held a lead in the game.|$|E

500|$|Quran [...] {{was part}} of the debate between medieval Muslim theologians and Muslims {{philosophers}} over the issue of the inviolability of heavenly bodies. The philosophers held that nature was composed of four fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, and water. These philosophers however held that the composition of heavenly bodies were <b>different.</b> <b>This</b> belief was based on the observation that the motion of heavenly bodies, unlike that of terrestrial bodies, was circular and without any beginnings or ends. This appearance of eternity in the heavenly bodies, led the philosophers to conclude that the heavens were inviolable. Theologians on the other hand proposed their own conception of the terrestrial matter: the nature was composed of uniform atoms that were re-created at every instant by God (the latter idea was added to defend God's omnipotence against the encroachment of the independent secondary causes). According to this conception, the heavenly bodies were essentially the same as the terrestrial bodies, and thus could be pierced.|$|E

500|$|Following Olivier's {{success in}} Shakespearean stage productions, {{he made his}} first foray into Shakespeare on film in 1936, as Orlando in As You Like It, {{directed}} by Paul Czinner, [...] "a charming if lightweight production", according to Michael Brooke of the British Film Institute's (BFI's) Screenonline. The following year Olivier appeared alongside Vivien Leigh in the historical drama Fire Over England. He had first met Leigh briefly at the Savoy Grill and then again when she visited him during the run of Romeo and Juliet, probably early in 1936, and the two had begun an affair sometime that year. Of the relationship, Olivier later said that [...] "I couldn't help myself with Vivien. No man could. I hated myself for cheating on Jill, but then I had cheated before, but this was something <b>different.</b> <b>This</b> wasn't just out of lust. This was love that I really didn't ask for but was drawn into." [...] While his relationship with Leigh continued he conducted an affair with the actress Ann Todd, and possibly had a brief affair with the actor Henry Ainley, according to the biographer Michael Munn.|$|E
500|$|However, {{before the}} filming of the video, the band was still {{finishing}} the album and when the time to shoot the video came, Lee didn't conceive an idea about how it should look like. As she felt the song was different for the band, Lee knew that they didn't want to [...] "go the classic, sort of fantastic, epic [...]" [...] Lee asked her sister Carrie to help her around {{the concept of the}} video. Her sister said that they should film the video for the song in New York and Lee agreed with her idea, [...] "She just started saying things that were right on. She was like, 'This should be in New York. You guys need to do something <b>different,</b> <b>this</b> song feels different.' And she started talking about running across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it being where I live, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.'" [...] However, the final shot of the video filmed at Coney Island was Lee's own idea. The shot represented the band coming back in the world and [...] "heading into the unknown, coming into a new world".|$|E
500|$|The artwork for {{the cover}} and liner note booklet of Axe to Fall was {{designed}} and created by Jacob Bannon. The booklet features a different piece of artwork for each song on the album. Bannon tried to create images that [...] "encapsulated some of the emotion of each song" [...] in contrast to more literal imagery, such as avoiding an axe literally falling for the song [...] "Axe to Fall." [...] He also experimented with a technique where a single image would be repeated within a frame, but the copies would be distressed or slightly <b>different.</b> <b>This</b> {{could be seen in}} the cover art where a single image of a woman's profile was broken down within the repetition, and some of the copies showed the woman's teeth through her cheek. Bannon stated that {{for the cover}} art, he [...] "just wanted to have something that felt timeless and sort of embodied the whole emotional gamut of the record, something that was explosive and powerful but also something that felt poetic and soft at the same time. It could look violent and beautiful at the same time." ...|$|E

500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s. However, he abandoned the project because the story was considered too [...] "small." [...] When they were approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best to update the story [...] "for a modern audience", soon discovering [...] "that the problem with having a prison character ... is that they don't have anyone to talk to." [...] Howard explained that because Rapunzel is incapable of having a decent conversation with Mother Gothel, the isolated, incarcerated heroine [...] "needed someone to relate to." [...] Unwilling to default to using the traditional [...] "boring, ordinary side-kick," [...] Greno and Howard created Pascal, conceiving the character as a chameleon because Rapunzel is, according to Greno, [...] "a rough-and-tumble girl." [...] Howard explained that [...] "we wanted to do ... something fresh, something <b>different.</b> <b>This</b> girl, she's not a dainty, precious girl ... So what would she have? ... She's going to have a lizard." [...] Additionally, Howard believed that a reptile would compliment Rapunzel's personality best, describing the character as [...] "a quirky pet for a quirky young woman." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Xindi" [...] {{was seen}} as a new pilot by {{executive}} producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise {{that was going to be}} a little bit <b>different</b> <b>this</b> year, so we had to think of it in those terms." [...] They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well. He called it a [...] "big episode" [...] as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine. However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of [...]|$|E
500|$|Furlan {{is said to}} {{have asked}} for her {{character}} to be written out of the series because {{she did not want to}} travel to Hawaii to film her scenes, although she later called this an untrue rumor. [...] The producers decided for Rousseau to be shot, with the possibility of her returning in season five. [...] Co-show runners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Cuse originally intended for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four, however as a result of the Writer's Strike, this did not come to pass. When asked whether Rousseau would have a flashback in season five, Lindelof said that Rousseau's story would [...] "definitively" [...] be revealed, but that [...] "to use the word flashback would be disingenuous". Cuse revealed that they were trying to steer away from the word flashback and were [...] "embracing a whole new word". He explained that [...] "there will still [...] be flashbacks and flash-forwards on the show, but we're going to do something <b>different</b> <b>this</b> year. We're going to mix it up." [...] Instead of using flashbacks and flashforwards like in previous seasons, stories of the fifth season will play out both on and off the island stories in different points in time. The writers were supposedly scheduling an appearance by Furlan for the fifth season, but Furlan did not end up making an appearance. [...] However, she returns in the form of Rousseau's [...] "sideways" [...] counterpart (who never crashed on the Island, lost Alex or went insane) in the sixth season.|$|E
