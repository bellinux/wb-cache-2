We studied their behaviour in China using native Apis cerana and introduced A. mellifera colonies. When the wasps are hawking, A. cerana recruits threefold more guard bees to stave off predation than A. mellifera. The former also utilises wing shimmering as a visual pattern disruption mechanism, which is not shown by A. mellifera. A. cerana foragers halve the time of normal flight needed to dart into the nest entrance, while A. mellifera actually slows down <b>in</b> sashaying <b>flight</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> V. velutina preferentially hawks A. mellifera foragers when both A. mellifera and A. cerana occur in the same apiary.

The wasps were taking A. mellifera foragers at a frequency eightfold greater than A. cerana foragers. The final hawking success rates of the wasps were about three times higher for A. mellifera foragers than for A. cerana. The relative success of native A. cerana over European A. mellifera in thwarting predation by the wasp V. velutina is interpreted {{as the result of}} co-evolution between the Asian wasp and honeybee, respectively. ...|$|R

In order to incorporate uncertainties <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> conditions, <b>manoeuvres,</b> shape and material properties, efficient uncertainty quantification is desired. This thesis aims at developing efficient multi-fidelity algorithms for fluid-structure interaction and uncertainty quantification. Space-mapping is a multi-fidelity technique {{that can be applied}} in order to accelerate strongly coupled partitioned fluid-structure interaction. Gradient-Enhanced Kriging is a response surface technique {{that can be used for}} uncertainty quantification. Aggressive Space-Mapping is applied to three academic fluid-structure interaction problems of increasing complexity. For most test cases considered the estimated and observed speedup with respect to the Quasi-Newton algorithm is larger than 1. The influence of the timestep size on the speedup is large compared to other parameters. In case of compressible flows the speedup can rise to 1. 5 for large time-steps. In case of incompressible flows higher speedups can be expected due to strong coupling of the fluid-structure interaction. Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK) is applied to two academic uncertainty quantification problems of increasing complexity. The observed speedup of GEK with respect to Kriging increases with the number of dimensions of the design-space. When the gradients are computed with the adjoint method the theoretical speedup is S = (1 +d) / 2, where d is the number of dimensions. The observed speedup and theoretical speedup are only close if the derivative noise, variation of the sampling plan and the variation of the target accuracies are taken into account.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} insect flight control have been {{statistical}} in approach, simply correlating wing kinematics with body kinematics or force production. Kinematics and forces are linked by Newtonian mechanics, so adopting a dynamics-based approach is necessary {{if we are}} to place the study of insect flight on its proper physical footing. Here we develop semi-empirical models of the longitudinal flight dynamics of desert locusts Schistocerca gregaria. We use instantaneous force-moment measurements from individual locusts to parametrize the nonlinear rigid body equations of motion. Since the instantaneous forces are approximately periodic, we represent them using Fourier series, which are embedded in the equations of motion to give a nonlinear time-periodic (NLTP) model. This is a proper mathematical generalization of an earlier linear-time invariant (LTI) model of locust flight dynamics, developed using previously published time-averaged versions of the instantaneous force recordings. We perform various numerical simulations, within the fitted range of the model, and across the range of body angles used by free-flying locusts, to explore the likely behaviour of the locusts upon release from the tether. Solutions of the NLTP models are compared with solutions of the nonlinear time-invariant (NLTI) models to which they reduce when the periodic terms are dropped. Both sets of models are unstable and therefore fail to explain locust flight stability fully. Nevertheless, whereas the measured forces include statistically significant harmonic content up to about the eighth harmonic, the simulated flight trajectories display no harmonic content above the fundamental forcing frequency. Hence, manoeuvre control in locusts will not directly reflect subtle changes in the higher harmonics of the wing beat, but must operate on a coarser time-scale. A state-space analysis of the NLTP models reveals orbital trajectories that are impossible to capture in the LTI and NLTI models, and inspires the hypothesis that asymptotic orbital stability is the proper definition of stability <b>in</b> flapping <b>flight.</b> <b>Manoeuvre</b> control on the scale of more than one wing beat would then consist in exciting transients from one asymptotically stable orbit to another. We summarize these hypotheses by proposing a limit-cycle analogy for flapping flight control and suggest experiments for verification of the limit-cycle control analogy hypothesis...|$|R

30|$|Compared {{with those}} {{detectors}} in white Gaussian noise, detecting range-spread targets in nonstationary clutter environments {{is more complicated}} and has recently received much more attentions [6 – 15]. Those methods mainly focus upon steady range-spread targets, such as air targets <b>in</b> steady <b>flight</b> or slow ship target in sea clutter. Complex HRRPs of steady range-spread targets can be modeled well {{and in this case}} coherent detectors outperform non-coherent ones. When target returns are assumed to be without range walking across cells during integration, the complex HRRPs to be integrated share an amplitude function along range cells, and the target returns of all the range cells share a Doppler shifts. The GLRT-based detectors developed in [6, 7] can effectively detect targets in homogenous clutter environments. In [8, 9], the order statistical sum of the generalized likelihood ratios at all the range cells of the detection window was recently developed for steady range-spread target detection in non-Gaussian clutter. The target return model available in [6 – 9] is unsuitable for range-spread targets <b>in</b> high-speed <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>flight,</b> whose complex HRRPs exhibit much more complicated change. The return model with both range and Doppler spreads can describe targets with rotation but without range walking across cells during integration [10 – 12]. Under this model, the GLRT-based detectors suffer from additional performance loss, because the rotation incurs different Doppler shifts in the individual cells and too many model parameters need to be estimated from the received data corrupted by strong clutter. Also, the spatially adaptive methods [13 – 15] were proposed for radars using antenna arrays to detect range-spread targets.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to compute and optimize feasible three dimensional (3 D) flight trajectories using aspects of Human Decision Making (HDM) strategies, for fixed wing Unmanned Aircraft (UA) operating in low altitude environments in the presence of real time planning deadlines. The underlying trajectory generation strategy involves the application of Manoeuvre Automaton (MA) theory to create sets of candidate <b>flight</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> which implicitly incorporate platform dynamic constraints. Feasible trajectories are formed through the concatenation of predefined <b>flight</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> <b>in</b> an optimized manner. During typical UAS operations, multiple objectives may exist, therefore the use of multi-objective optimization can potentially allow for convergence to a solution which better reflects overall mission requirements and HDM preferences. A GUI interface was developed to allow for knowledge capture from a human expert during simulated mission scenarios. The expert decision data captured is converted into value functions and corresponding criteria weightings using UTilite Additive (UTA) theory. The inclusion of preferences elicited from HDM decision data within an Automated Decision System (ADS) allows for the generation of trajectories which more closely represent the candidate HDM{'}s decision strategies. A novel Computationally Adaptive Trajectory Decision optimization System (CATDS) has been developed and implemented in simulation to dynamically manage, calculate and schedule system execution parameters to ensure that the trajectory solution search can generate a feasible solution, if one exists, within a given length of time. The inclusion of the CATDS potentially increases overall mission efficiency and may allow for the implementation of the system on different UAS platforms with varying onboard computational capabilities.
