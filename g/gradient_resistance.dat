40|$|AbstractAn artery {{reconstruction}} {{in upper}} extremities is rare performed {{compared to the}} artery reconstruction in lower extremities. Primary vascular repair was performed in many cases. As to alleviate vascular occlusion, an interposition vein graft or venous bypass grafting were applied. However, one or more the internal diameters of applied vein graft are blocked or severely norrowed due to the kinking failure on saphenous vein graft. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the blood flow influence on vein graft with kinking failure. The 3 -D computational fluid dynamic method was employed to determine velocity, pressure <b>gradient,</b> <b>resistance</b> of blood flow and wall shear stress on the kinked vein graft. We expect that velocity, pressure <b>gradient,</b> <b>resistance</b> of blood flow and wall shear stress on kinked vein graft to behave non-hydraulically compared to an ideal straight graft. Futhermore, a longitudinal impedence modulus (ZL) is expected to be insufficient due to kinking failure on vein graft. © 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|According to Dooge (1986) intermediate-scale {{catchments}} are {{systems of}} organized complexity, being too organized and yet {{too small to}} be characterized on a statistical/ conceptual basis, but too large and too heterogeneous to be characterized in a deterministic manner. A key requirement for building structurally adequate models precisely for this intermediate scale is {{a better understanding of how}} different forms of spatial organization affect storage and release of water and energy. Here, we propose that a combination of the concept of hydrological response units (HRUs) and thermodynamics offers several helpful and partly novel perspectives for gaining this improved understanding. Our key idea is to define functional similarity based on similarity of the terrestrial controls of <b>gradients</b> and <b>resistance</b> terms controlling the land surface energy balance, rainfall runoff transformation, and groundwater storage and release. This might imply that functional similarity with respect to these specific forms of water release emerges at different scales, namely the small field scale, the hillslope, and the catchment scale. We thus propose three different types of “functional units” – specialized HRUs, so to speak – which behave similarly with respect to one specific form of water release and with a characteristic extent equal to one of those three scale levels. We furthermore discuss an experimental strategy based on exemplary learning and replicate experiments to identify and delineate these functional units, and as a promising strategy for characterizing the interplay and organization of water and energy fluxes across scales. We believe the thermodynamic perspective to be well suited to unmask equifinality as inherent in the equations governing water, momentum, and energy fluxes: this is because several combinations of <b>gradients</b> and <b>resistance</b> terms yield the same mass or energy flux and the terrestrial controls of <b>gradients</b> and <b>resistance</b> terms are largely independent. We propose that structurally adequate models at this scale should consequently disentangle driving <b>gradients</b> and <b>resistance</b> terms, because this optionally equifinality to be partly reduced by including available observations, e. g., on driving gradients. Most importantly, the thermodynamic perspective yields an energy-centered perspective on rainfall-runoff transformation and evapotranspiration, including fundamental limits for energy fluxes associated with these processes. This might additionally reduce equifinality and opens up opportunities for testing thermodynamic optimality principles within independent predictions of rainfall-runoff or land surface energy exchange. This is pivotal to finding out whether or not spatial organization in catchments is in accordance with a fundamental organizing principle...|$|R

Graphene exhibits a high electrical conductivity (in-plane) that is necessary for a high ZT; however, this effect is countered by its impressive thermal conductivity.

40|$|Phasic {{changes in}} intramyocardial tension during the cardiac cycle {{interrupt}} coronary blood flow (CBF) so {{that most of}} the nutrient flow to the ventricular myocardium occurs in ventricular diastole. Rapid changes in mean arterial pressure cause transient changes in CBF before autoregulatory factors return flow toward previous levels. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVo 2) appears to be the major determinant of CBF and the factors determining MVo 2 (mainly developed tension and contractile state) are, therefore, major determinants of CBF. The direct effects of autonomic excitation on CBF appear relatively minor, however; the vagus, sympathetic nerves and adrenal medullary hormones profoundly alter CBF indirectly through changes in MVo 2. In the eschaemic heart with atheromatous occlusion of large vessels there is a reduced capacity for autoregulation, and nutrient flow is more dependent on pressure gradient. Hypertension and valvular disorders are often associated with raised MVo 2 but associated abnormalities in pressure <b>gradient</b> and <b>resistance</b> to flow often hinder the supply of CBF needed to meet high demands...|$|R

The electrical, structural (crystallinity and morphology), and chemical properties of the deposited films were investigated using Hall, four point probe, x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron recoil detection (ERD), Rutherford backscattering (RBS), and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), respectively. We found that the working pressure {{plays an important role}} in controlling the sheet resistance Rs and roughness development during film growth. At 1. 5 mbar the AZO films are highly conductive (Rs 4 % of the film thickness), however, they are characterized by a large sheet <b>resistance</b> <b>gradient</b> with increasing film thickness. By decreasing the pressure from 1. 5 to 0. 38 mbar, the gradient is significantly reduced and the films become smoother, but the sheet resistance increases (Rs 100 / for a film thickness of 1000 nm). The sheet <b>resistance</b> <b>gradient</b> and the surface roughness development correlate with the grain size evolution, as determined from the AFM and SEM analyses, indicating the transition from pyramid-like at 1. 5 mbar to pillar-like growth mode at 0. 38 mbar. The change in plasma chemistry/growth precursors caused by the variation in pressure leads to different concentration and activation efficiency of Al dopant in the zinc oxide films. On the basis of the experimental evidence, a valid route for further improving the conductivity of the AZO film is found, i. e., increasing the grain size at the initial stage of film growth...|$|R

Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas protegens were exposed kanamycin, tetracycline or ciprofloxacin at 1 / 10 the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in a serial streaking experiment over 40 passages. Significant changes in rep-PCR fingerprints were noted in both species when exposed to sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations.

Experimental lines also displayed variant colony morphologies.

Recent studies show that resistance levels can be high also in wildlife, but it is unknown to what extent resistance levels in nature conform to the patterns observed in human-associated bacteria.

Results: Overall, 31. 5 % of the gull E. coli isolates were resistant to ≥ 1 antibiotic, but with considerable variation between countries: highest levels of isolates resistant to ≥ 1 antibiotic were observed in Spain (61. 2 %) and lowest levels in Denmark (8. 3 %).
