5000|$|... ==Background and history== The 'Dead Drops' {{project was}} {{conceived}} by Berlin-based conceptual artist Aram Bartholl, {{a member of}} New York's Fat lab art and technology collective. The first USB dead <b>drop</b> <b>network</b> of five devices was started by Bartholl in October 2010 in Brooklyn, New York City. The name comes from the dead drop method of espionage communication. An unrelated system called [...] "deadSwap," [...] in which participants use an SMS gateway to coordinate passing USB memory sticks on to one another, was begun in Germany in 2009.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) depends on many factors. One {{of the factors}} is routing protocol and the {{performance of}} routing protocol in given scenario depends on the value of parameters used in. The combinations of such values are very large. Therefore, we have used Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) technique to find optimal value of parameters for Ad-hoc On Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) in given real scenario. The Experimental results show drastic improvements in Average End-to-End delay (90. 50 % <b>drop),</b> <b>Network</b> Routing Load (41. 68 % drop) and Packet Delivery Ratio (0. 39 % rise) using value of parameters obtained through TLBO...|$|E

40|$|The {{included}} postprint manuscript {{includes an}} errata page concerning the published {{version of the}} article. The public support in photovoltaic (PV) technologies and increasing markets have resulted in extensive applications of grid-connected PV, in particular in the consumer side and electricity distribution grid. In this paper, {{the effects of a}} high level of grid connected PV in the middle voltage distribution network have been analyzed. The emphasis is put on static phenomena, including voltage <b>drop,</b> <b>network</b> losses and grid benefits. A multi-purpose modeling tool is used for PV analysis in Lisbon and Helsinki climates. All network types studied can handle PV without problems with an amount of PV equaling at least up to the load (1 kW(p) /household). The comb-type network showed the best performance. The PV is unable to shave the domestic load peak in the early evening hours but through orientating the PV panels both to east and west, the noon peak from PV can be reduced by 30 %. PV integration reduces network losses positively up to a 1 kW(p) /hh (100 % of annual domestic load) level. For 2 kW(p) /hh all but the comb-type networks demonstrate clear over-voltage situations and the annual network losses are much higher than without PV. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} network connectivity has prompted {{the study of}} computer-based control methodologies that are implemented centrally or distributively using existing network infrastructure as the communications backbone. Recent work has looked at the stability of networked control systems (i. e., control systems in which feedback loops are closed through networks) and focused on performance guarantees under networked induced delays and varying data packet rates. In this work, we extend these ideas in a probabilistic setting by modeling a packet <b>dropping</b> <b>network</b> as an erasure channel and by developing bounded variance stabilization schemes...|$|R

The practice of <b>dropping</b> <b>networked</b> shows had been in operation for other programmes since November 2008 when STV announced it would opt out of programmes they claimed were not performing well in their broadcast region, including Sharpe's Peril, Al Murray's Happy Hour, Moving Wallpaper, Benidorm and The Alan Titchmarsh Show. ITV's coverage of the FA Cup was also dropped.|$|R
5000|$|Screen {{is often}} used when a network {{connection}} to the terminal is unreliable, as a <b>dropped</b> <b>network</b> connection typically terminates all programs the user was running (child processes of the login session), due to the session ending and sending a [...] "hangup" [...] signal (SIGHUP) to all the child processes. Running the applications under screen means that the session does not terminate - only the now-defunct terminal gets detached - so applications don't even know the terminal has detached, and allows the user to reattach the session later and continue working from where they left off.|$|R

The most-cited causes of frustrating experiences were error messages, <b>dropped</b> <b>network</b> connections, long download times, and hard-to-find features. The time lost due to frustrating experiences ranged from 47 % to 53 % of time spent on a computer, depending on the location and study method.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{wormhole}} attack discovery in mobile wireless ad hoc networks. Two separate approaches to wormhole attack discovery are developed in this thesis. One approach [...] based on protocol-breaking [...] allows detection of wormholes that disrupt <b>network</b> operations by <b>dropping</b> <b>network</b> packets. Another [...] a novel frequency-based analysis of periodic network messages [...] detects wormholes {{that do not}} drop traffic. The developed wormhole attack discovery techniques are local, do not rely on specialized hardware or clock synchronization, and do not require modification to existing ad hoc network routing protocols. In addition, tools that are necessary for ad hoc network attack research are created. Network traffic analyzer modules applicable to ad hoc network research are developed and tested. Also, a realistic implementation of a wormhole attack in the NS- 2 network simulator is created...|$|R
