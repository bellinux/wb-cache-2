At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Walls</b> of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho to put him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Walls</b> of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, {{the underlying cause}} of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
