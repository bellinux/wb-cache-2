Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead <b>in</b> <b>toys</b> made for pets.

A few stones have knobs that could have been used to lever them into position; after which they were generally sanded away, with a few overlooked.|$|E
25|$|With Congresswoman Nita Lowey, Schumer {{has been}} working to ban the {{chemical}} bisphenol A, or BPA, often found in baby bottles and plastic children's food containers.

25|$|Research on {{the repercussions}} of gender <b>in</b> <b>toys</b> {{suggests}} that play {{should be encouraged to}} be more gender neutral in order to work towards a desegregation of the genders. Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills. In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children. Even as this debate is evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.|$|E

500|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was first}} {{released}} on 5 March 2001 in North America.

2500|$|A {{milestone}} {{for research}} on gender {{is the use of}} meta-analysis, which provides a way to assess patterns in a systematic way, which is especially relevant for a topic such as gender, which can be difficult to quantify. Nature and nurture have historically been analyzed when looking at gender in play, as well as reinforcement by peers and parents of typical gender roles and consequently, gender play. Toy companies have often promoted the segregation by gender <b>in</b> <b>toys</b> because it enables them to customize the same toy for each gender, which ultimately doubles their revenue. For example, Legos added more colors to certain sets of toys in the 1990s, including colors commonly attributed to girls such as lavender.|$|E
