5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically different, with strong English Tudor Renaissance <b>features</b> <b>on</b> the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic <b>features</b> <b>on</b> the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic <b>features</b> <b>on</b> Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest <b>features</b> <b>on</b> Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E
