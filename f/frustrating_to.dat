5|$|Dungeon Siege was {{the first}} title by Gas Powered Games, which was founded by in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 {{real-time}} strategy game Total Annihilation. Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor {{wanted to create a}} different type of game, and after trying several concepts they decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. Taylor also served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the lead story and dialogue writer. The music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on Total Annihilation. Gas Powered Games concentrated on making a role-playing game that was stripped of the typical genre elements they found slow or <b>frustrating,</b> <b>to</b> keep the player focused on the action. Development took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two; completing the game within even four years required the team to work 12- to 14-hour days and weekends for most of the time.|$|E
25|$|Normally, sainthood causes {{take many}} years to {{progress}} to canonization; the exceptions to these cases (causes of martyrs, who only need one miracle for sainthood; or where the Pope has granted a waiver to start the process sooner after death) are {{quite apart from the}} norm. Nevertheless, the potential for a long delay was very <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> many in the area and beyond who had helped and funded his cause, and to his other supporters.|$|E
25|$|Cassette {{playback}} {{suffered from}} some flaws <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> both professionals and home recording enthusiasts. Tape speed could vary between devices, resulting in pitch {{that was too}} low or too high. Speed often was calibrated at the factory, {{and could not be}} changed by users. The slow tape speed increased tape hiss and noise, and in practice delivered higher values of wow and flutter. Different tape formulation and noise reduction schemes artificially boosted or cut high frequencies and inadvertently elevated noise levels. Noise reduction also adds some artifacts to the sound, which a trained ear can hear sometimes quite easily.|$|E
50|$|Consideration {{should be}} given to ensure that IA devices and {{different}} software packages communicate with each other so that information is not lost or re-entry is not required by the user. Users do not always know or care what software is being used or which database is being accessed and do not understand why they must enter the same information again. For example, once the date has been entered, the user will be <b>frustrated</b> <b>to</b> be prompted to enter it again during the same session. Taking this further, the user may be <b>frustrated</b> <b>to</b> have to enter a date since there is a calendar function on the IA being used.|$|R
50|$|Another {{practice}} {{run with}} Picasso takes place, but Saige is too <b>frustrated</b> <b>to</b> continue, and {{worries that the}} fiesta {{is going to be}} a disaster. Her parents and Gabi watched her. Gabi leaves, because Saige said she wished things were the same as last year.|$|R
50|$|Juan Pablo Montoya was <b>frustrated</b> <b>to</b> {{have lost}} {{points for the}} second race running due to a {{disqualification}} beyond his control. However, {{he said that the}} pace of the car was positive and allowed Williams to push on {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|R
25|$|Baltic mythology {{has also}} {{received}} {{a great deal of}} scholarly attention, but has so far remained <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> researchers because the sources are so comparatively late. Nonetheless, Latvian folk songs are seen as a major source of information in the process of reconstructing Proto-Indo-European myth. Despite the popularity of Greek mythology in western culture, Greek mythology is generally seen as having little importance in comparative mythology due to the heavy influence of Pre-Greek and Near Eastern cultures, which overwhelms what little Indo-European material can be extracted from it. Consequently, Greek mythology received minimal scholarly attention until the mid 2000s.|$|E
25|$|The Machines were a {{professional}} wrestling stable that {{performed in the}} World Wrestling Federation in 1986 and 1987. The team consisted of well-known WWF wrestlers working under masks which strongly resembled that worn by Super Strong Machine (Japanese wrestler Junji Hirata) in New Japan Pro Wrestling at the time; leader André the Giant had faced Hirata and two other Strong Machines during tours of NJPW in 1984, getting {{the idea for the}} masks. The gimmick was very much tongue-in-cheek, as the identities of the masked men were obvious to the fans but <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> heels when they were unable to prove them. The Machines was the last tag team Capt. Lou Albano managed in the WWF until he returned in 1994 to manage The Headshrinkers.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{was pleased}} with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her {{creation}} was safe {{in the hands of}} the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman's departure was particularly <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera Generations in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman's departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to Soap Opera Digest that she felt it was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired Jill Larson. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.|$|E

25|$|The Dukes of Hazzard was {{consistently}} among the top-rated television series (at one point, ranking {{second only to}} Dallas, which immediately followed the show on CBS' Friday night schedule). With that success came huge profits in merchandising, with {{a wide array of}} Dukes of Hazzard toys and products being licensed and becoming big sellers. However, {{over the course of the}} show's fourth season, series stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider became increasingly concerned about a contract dispute over their salaries and merchandising royalties owed to them over the high sales of Dukes products. Neither were being paid what was owed to them and this became very <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> the duo. As a result, in the spring of 1982, as filming was due to begin on the fifth season, Wopat and Schneider did not report to the set in protest over the matter. Catherine Bach also considered walking out due to similar concerns, but Wopat and Schneider convinced her to stay, insisting that if she left then there may not be a show to come back to, and that settling the issue was up to them.|$|E

[...] "It was <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> hear fans say, 'Get a walk!'" [...] Youkilis said. [...] "I'll take a walk—a walk's as good as a hit—but don't you want me to hit a home run or something?" ...|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Wild Arms {{comes from}} its myriad puzzles and minigames that {{resemble}} {{those found in}} an action games, described as being [...] "extremely action oriented, which may be <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> RPG fans who don't have the quickest of reflexes". The game was also compared to the RPG Final Fantasy VII, released five months later, which in turn led to Wild Arms being designated as a game that would [...] "suppress your appetite for Final Fantasy VII". [...] GameSpot additionally declared that Wild Arms graphics, though impressive, were not the industry standard at the time, remarking: [...] "Although it's no Final Fantasy VII, Wild Arms looks great." ...|$|E

500|$|Alonso was {{regarded}} as a quiet and friendly person by his former teammates at Liverpool. He is married to Nagore Aranburu and the couple have three children: Jontxu, Ane and Emma. Alonso stayed in Merseyside to be at her side while she gave birth, later saying, [...] "It was a little <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> miss the match against Inter but I have to be with my family at times like these." [...] His decision to place his family ahead of a Champions League tie caused much friction with former manager Rafael Benítez. On 30 March 2010, they had their second child, a girl named Ane Alonso Aranburu. Their third child and second daughter, Emma Alonso Aranburu, was born on 2 December 2013.|$|E
500|$|As Lear explains, Potter titled The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden {{and sent}} it to publishers, but [...] "her {{manuscript}} was returned... including Frederick Warne & Co.... who nearly a decade earlier had shown some interest in her artwork. Some publishers wanted a shorter book, others a longer one. But most wanted coloured illustrations which by 1900 were both popular and affordable". [...] The several rejections were <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> Potter, who knew exactly how her book should look (she had adopted the format and style of Helen Bannerman's Little Black Sambo) [...] "and how much it should cost". She decided to publish the book herself, and on 16 December 1901 the first 250 copies of her privately printed The Tale of Peter Rabbit were [...] "ready for distribution to family and friends".|$|E
500|$|Mika's {{return to}} the lineup of Street Fighter V was praised by Jason Shreiser of Kotaku, who wrote that [...] "She looks fun to play—check out those wrestling moves — {{but this is an}} odd choice given Mika’s lack of pedigree. Cool throwback, though!" [...] However, after the game's released, her {{gameplay}} has subsequently been criticized for being [...] "cheap". At Eurogamer, Wesley Yin-Poole labelled Mika as SFVs [...] "most hated character", writing [...] "I've seen people criticise R. Mika players for doing nothing but going for this Passion Rope Throw over and over again until it lands. Some within the fighting game community believe this move, as well as the [...] "vortex" [...] style, is not a [...] "high skill" [...] strategy", and as a result Mika has been labelled [...] "cheap" [...] and a [...] "troll character" [...] that is <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> play against.|$|E
50|$|As {{organizations}} {{cope with}} this challenging environment, {{a new generation of}} employees is increasingly <b>frustrated</b> <b>to</b> find that the tools in their workplace lag behind what they are accustomed to in the consumer world.

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the film was mixed but mostly positive, in Denmark, including praise for Madsen's direction, the performances of Lindhardt, Mikkelsen, Stengade and Mygind; opinions were divided about the portrayal of the main characters. The film [...] "has shocked Danish audiences" [...] for its portrayal of the protagonists as non-heroic, and has been criticised by historians. Berlingskes Ebbe Iversen commented {{that it can be}} both good and bad to have morally ambiguous characters as it can be seen as [...] "an artistic force" [...] to have [...] "authentic protagonists psychology", {{but it can also be}} <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> have their motives portrayed as [...] "enigmatic". The critic stated it did not make it a bad film, instead [...] "its subtle, not uncritical portrayal of the resistance seems sober and serious, the style is worked out to the smallest detail, and in its outer form the film is the type of work that you unkindly call conventional and more kindly describe as classic." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{writer for}} The Star-Ledger, said Michael acted so [...] "nakedly selfish and unfeeling" [...] {{that it made}} the episode unpleasant to watch: [...] "If last week's 'Blood Drive' gave us Michael at his most human and sympathetic, then 'Golden Ticket' showed how a human Michael {{could also be a}} monster." [...] However, Sepinwall said he did think the subplot involving Kevin receiving romantic advice was funny and sweet: [...] "Brian Baumgartner's just been aces the last two weeks, and if it hadn't been for this story, I might have found 'Golden Ticket' unbearable." [...] Dan Hopper of VH1's Best Week Ever strongly criticized the episode and the behavior of the characters: [...] "Why was every single character on last night’s Willy Wonka episode acting like a complete idiot? Not 'idiot' {{in the sense that the}} characters are always dumb and goofy in an amusing way, but 'idiot' as in 'none of these human beings would ever act this way and this is really <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> watch? ...|$|E

And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations.

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the first season of Orange is the New Black, Doggett {{received}} some criticism from different media. Writing for The American Conservative, B. D. McClay claimed that Doggett was a poor and inaccurate representation of American Christians; [...] "Pennsatucky is such an aggressively terrible character" [...] and [...] "her faith is neither well-understood nor well-drawn". Laura Leonard of Christianity Today, supports Clay's view and goes further to say [...] "it was <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> see this one painful narrative represent Christian faith on OITNB, a show that masters other aspects of the melting pot so well", speaking about Doggett's background story and conflict with Chapman. Two critics for The A.V. Club also gave negative reviews of Doggett; Todd VanDerWerff says that [...] "Pennsatucky never really comes together as a character {{in the same way as}} some of the others on the show" [...] and Myles McNutt opted to criticize the storyline of the final episode of the first season specifically, saying that it [...] " [...] her like a cartoon villain instead of a real character". Betsy Leondar-Wright accused the series' creators of classism and said that Doggett was an [...] "outrageous Redneck stereotype".|$|E
500|$|Although Halos overall {{reception}} {{was largely}} positive, the game received criticism for its level design. GameSpy commented, [...] "you'll trudge through countless hallways and control rooms that all look exactly the same, fighting identical-looking groups of enemies {{over and over}} and over...it is simply <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> see a game with such groundbreaking sequences too often degenerate [...] this kind of mindless, repetitive action." [...] Similarly, an article on Game Studies.org remarked, [...] "In {{the latter part of the}} game, the scenarios rely on repetition and quantity rather than innovativeness and quality." [...] Eurogamer concluded, [...] "Halo is very much a game of two halves. The first half is fast, exciting, beautifully designed and constantly full of surprises. The second half is festooned with gobsmacking plot twists and great cinematics but let down by repetitive paint by numbers level design." [...] Halo was released prior to the launch of Xbox Live, and the lack of both online multiplayer and bots to simulate human players was criticised by GameSpy; in 2003 GameSpy included Halo in a list of [...] "Top 25 Most Overrated Games of All Time." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerning the game's playability, the Japanese {{release was}} judged [...] "impossible to play" [...] by GameSpot and IGN, which both felt the Western {{versions}} were an improvement, {{even though the}} game was still [...] "far more sensitive than it ought to be". Still, Game Revolution found the car default settings unbalanced and hard to re-adjust properly, and criticized the game's inconsistent AI, like Allgame and IGN. Famitsu reported long load times and a high difficulty level, noting that the game was aimed more toward fans of sim racing than fans of arcade-style gameplay, due {{to the difficulty of}} steering. Game Informer and GameZone echoed Famitsus review, stating that the load times quickly become a [...] "game-ending nightmare", and calling the game's handling [...] "touchy", [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "revolutionary", but acknowledging that most players would simply find it too challenging and <b>frustrating</b> <b>to</b> be fun. While Game Informer alleged that [...] "there is a masterpiece for driving simulator buffs buried in here", Allgame was much more negative, stating that the cars [...] "seem overly light on their tires" [...] and that it [...] "feels like you're driving on ice".|$|E
