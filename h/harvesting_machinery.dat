Despite focused attempts to reduce this capacity in recent years in different jurisdictions, it has continued to expand. This chapter uses a case study of changes in Norwegian fisheries to help explain why this has happened. The article supports the replacement of the rational actor approach that is currently hegemonic within fisheries management by a relational approach to the analysis of capture capacity expansion. A relational approach offers new insights into the ways political, economic, and technological forces continue to fuel capacity expansion within fishing.

The cost of olives hand picking is estimated to be about two-thirds of the total gross return of olive production. Therefore, various types of olive <b>harvesting</b> <b>machineries</b> were developed in the world. Guilan Province of Iran {{is one of the}} leading regions for olives production in Iran. At the present time, almost all olives produced in Guilan province of Iran are manually harvested. Review of the reports showed that no research was performed to study the factors affecting the development of mechanized olive picking in Guilan Province, Iran. Due to the complexity of using the olive <b>harvest</b> <b>machineries,</b> identifying the factors affecting of their application is essential. Therefore, a Delphi study were conducted to identify and analysis the drivers and barriers for mechanized olive harvest in Guilan province, Iran. Materials and Methods This research was conducted using the Delphi technique in Guilan Province, Northern Iran. Delphi technique is a structured process to gather and classify the knowledge of a group of experts. Through consultation with professors and researchers in related institutions, 22 experts from the subsidiary offices of agricultural organization of Guilan Province were selected for the study. In the first round of the study, the participants were asked to answer to two open questions about the driving factors and barriers of mechanical olive harvest in Guilan Province. Nineteen items were found as driving factors and seventeen as barriers for developing the mechanical olive harvesting in Guilan Province. In the second phase of the study, the respondents were asked to answer to the all items written in the form of a five-level Likert scale, and finally, experts of panel were asked to answer to the top 10 items of driving factors and barriers in percent form.
