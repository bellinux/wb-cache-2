A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said that they did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened to the original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E

A Queensland based trainer of a similar black Labrador explosive detection dog stated that it was {{probably due to the}} breed's excellent character that Sarbi had most likely been looked after by locals while missing, ensuring her survival. Misha Schubert the political correspondent for The Age jokingly questioned the official account that Sarbi's whereabouts while she was missing would never be known, suggesting she had been undercover on a secret mission, or that she had been captured by the Taliban as a prisoner of war, or had simply preferred to remain Absent Without Leave (AWOL).|$|E

500|$|Copper prices {{began to}} rise in 1973, {{to such an extent}} that the {{intrinsic}} value of the coin approached a cent, and citizens began to hoard cents, hoping to realize a profit. [...] The Mint decided to switch to an aluminum cent. [...] Over a million and a half such pieces were struck in the second half of 1973, though they were dated 1974. [...] At congressional hearings, representatives of the vending machine industry testified that aluminum cents would jam their equipment, and the Mint backed away from its proposal. [...] Mint director Mary Brooks sought the return of samples which had been distributed to members of Congress, but 14 remained missing, with the recipients affecting not to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> become of them. [...] One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Numismatic Collection; another was reportedly found by a US Capitol Police Officer. [...] Experiments were also conducted with bronze-clad steel cents. [...] Slated for disposal, when a bag of them tore open before going into a smelter a few were kept by the workers. [...] They are also considered to be illegally held government property. [...] Recognizing that a change from the current copper composition was still inevitable, Congress passed Public Law 93-441 on October 11, 1974, declaring [...] "henever in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury such action is necessary to assure an adequate supply of coins to meet the national needs, he may prescribe such composition of copper and zinc in the alloy of the one-cent piece as he may deem appropriate." ...|$|E
500|$|Tolkien {{had been}} writing The Lord of the Rings {{for several years}} when Saruman came into {{existence}} as the solution to a long-unresolved plot development, and his role and characteristics continued {{to emerge in the}} course of writing. Tolkien started work on the book in late 1937, but was initially unsure of how the story would develop. Unlike some of the other characters in the book, Saruman had not appeared in Tolkien's 1937 novel, The Hobbit, or in his then-unpublished Quenta Silmarillion and related mythology, which date back to 1917. When he wrote of Gandalf’s failure to meet Frodo, Tolkien did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> caused it and later said: [...] "Most disquieting of all, Saruman had never been revealed to me, and I was as concerned as Frodo at Gandalf's failure to appear." [...] Tolkien's son, Christopher, has said that {{the early stages of the}} creation of The Lord of the Rings proceeded in a series of waves, and that having produced the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien rewrote the tale from the start three times. Saruman first appeared during a fourth phase of writing in a rough narrative outline dated August 1940. Intended to account for Gandalf's absence, it describes how a wizard titled [...] "Saramond the White" [...] or [...] "Saramund the Grey", who has fallen under the influence of Sauron, lures Gandalf to his stronghold and traps him. The full story of Saruman's betrayal was later added to the existing chapters.|$|E

2500|$|Considered for the Speakership in 1959, Touche {{lost out}} to Harry Hylton-Foster but was {{promoted}} to being Chairman of Ways and Means.

Touche accepted a motion for the adjournment of the House moved by a Government whip and the House adjourned, but the next day a motion of censure was put down.

2500|$|MacKay {{entered the}} first ballot of the PC {{leadership}} convention held on May 31, 2003 with roughly 41% {{of the delegates}} supporting him. [...] However, on the second ballot, MacKay's support dropped to 39%. On the third ballot, MacKay's support reached 45% but many of his supporters were convinced that he had hit his popular peak. Some analysts noted that the eliminated third-place challenger David Orchard drew his 25% bulk of delegate supporters largely from the Western prairie provinces. Orchard was prepared to speak with either MacKay or Prentice {{to determine if a}} deal could be reached over {{some of the issues that}} he raised during the leadership campaign. [...] As the results of the third ballot were called, MacKay's campaign manager, PC Senator Noël Kinsella, hastily arranged a backroom meeting between MacKay, Orchard, and their campaign advisors. During the meeting, MacKay reached a deal with his rival, and Orchard emerged from the room urging his delegates to support MacKay. Press officials immediately demanded to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> inspired Orchard's surprise move. Orchard repeatedly referred to a [...] "gentleman's agreement" [...] made between himself and MacKay that had led to his qualified support.|$|E

2500|$|These events {{known as}} the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad {{impression}} of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred. [...] However, protests such as these helped to make an impression upon the industrial heads. [...] It made them start {{to realize that they}} were going to have to make changes for the workers or suffer the consequences. [...] The Haymarket Riots were one of the things that set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives. [...] Working to reform the eight-hour day paid off eventually and continues on today. [...] This showed the people in charge that laborers were no longer willing to be treated so inhumanely and that they would do what needed to be done in order to change what they wanted. [...] Because of this push for the eight-hour day, doors were open for reform of other unfair treatments of laborers. [...] It helped to work towards a more just labor system in general. [...] Young Jay Fox had been a part of this at the age of sixteen; he had helped in a cause to make a difference. [...] Not only this but he was able to leave behind writings that let future generations <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened in his account of the event “I Was At Haymarket.” [...] Through this piece of writing he showed what was going on at the time, what people decided to do about the unfair treatment, and the injustice of the authorities handling the situation.|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{incident}} {{of the year}} was at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Senna outqualified Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the race before crashing on lap 67. Instead of returning to the pit lane, Senna went back to his apartment and did not contact the team until he walked into the pit garage as they were packing up later that night. As the television cameras had not captured his crash, team boss Ron Dennis did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> caused his DNF until then, though Prost speculated that judging from the tyre marks, it appeared as though Senna had clipped the inside barrier at Portiers, which pitched him into the outside guard rail. At the 1988 Portuguese Grand Prix, Prost made a slightly faster start than Senna, but the Brazilian dived into the first corner ahead. Prost responded and went to pass Senna {{at the end of the}} first lap. Senna swerved to block Prost, forcing the Frenchman to nearly run into the pit wall at [...] Prost kept his foot down and soon edged Senna into the first corner and started pulling away. Though Prost was angered by Senna's manoeuvre, the Brazilian got away with a warning from the FIA. At the postrace team debrief, Prost voiced his anger at the move which prompted Senna to apologize to Prost for the incident. Ultimately, the pair won 15 of 16 races in the McLaren MP4/4 in 1988 with Senna coming out on top, winning his first Formula One world championship title by taking eight wins to Prost's seven. Prost scored more points over the season, but had to drop three second places as only the 11 best scores counted.|$|E
