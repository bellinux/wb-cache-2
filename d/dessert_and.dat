5|$|On {{that date}} 48 bombers, under secret {{orders from the}} president, crossed into Cambodian {{airspace}} and delivered their payloads in Operation Breakfast. During the next 14 months this operation was followed by Lunch, Snack, Dinner, <b>Dessert,</b> <b>and</b> Supper as American bombers flew 3,630 sorties and expended 100,000 tons of ordnance on the Base Areas in {{what came to be}} called Operation Menu. During this time frame, the entire program was held as a closely guarded secret from Congress, the American people, and amazingly, from the Air Force itself.|$|E
5|$|In French medieval cuisine, banquets {{were common}} among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but {{served in a}} style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was {{generally}} eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, {{and it was not}} until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern <b>dessert,</b> <b>and</b> typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E

50|$|The Industrial Revolution in America <b>and</b> Europe caused <b>desserts</b> (<b>and</b> food in general) to be mass-produced, processed, preserved, canned, and packaged.

Many countries have <b>desserts</b> <b>and</b> foods distinctive to their nations or region.|$|R

It is also eaten on its own as a sweet.|$|E

25|$|Crêpes and galettes are the {{two most}} iconic Breton dishes. The crêpes, made and served with butter, are eaten for <b>dessert</b> <b>and</b> the galettes are usually salty and made with buckwheat. They {{traditionally}} replaced bread as basic food and they can be served with cheese, sausages, bacon, mushrooms or eggs. They can be accompanied by Breton buttermilk called lait ribot. Brittany also has a dish similar to the pot-au-feu known as the kig ha farz, which consists of stewed pork or beef with buckwheat dumplings.|$|E
25|$|Bánh đúc is a cake {{made from}} non-glutinous rice flour (although corn flour {{is also used}} in {{northern}} Vietnam). In the north it is typically garnished with savory ingredients such as ground pork, tôm chấy (grilled ground shrimp), fried onions, sesame seeds, salt, peanuts, lime juice, and soy sauce or fish sauce. In the south, it is served as a <b>dessert,</b> <b>and</b> {{takes the form of}} gelatinous blocks that are often colored green by the addition of Pandanus amaryllifolius leaf extract. It is cooked by boiling the ingredients and allowing them to cool, solidifying into a jelly-like sheetphoto that is then cut into blocks.|$|E
25|$|Korean temple cuisine {{originated}} in Buddhist temples of Korea. Since Buddhism was introduced into Korea, Buddhist traditions have strongly influenced Korean cuisine, as well. During the Silla period (57 BCE– 935 CE), chalbap (찰밥, {{a bowl of}} cooked glutinous rice) yakgwa (a fried <b>dessert)</b> <b>and</b> yumilgwa (a fried and puffed rice snack) were served for Buddhist altars and have been developed into types of hangwa, Korean traditional confectionery. During the Goryeo Dynasty, sangchu ssam (wraps made with lettuce), yaksik, and yakgwa were developed, and since spread to China and other countries. Since the Joseon Dynasty, Buddhist cuisine {{has been established in}} Korea according to regions and temples.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the wine}} renaissance of the 1960s, {{the quality of}} California's <b>dessert</b> <b>and</b> {{fortified}} wines have been dramatically improved. Beringer {{was one of the}} first to create a botrytized wine from Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. Though unlike in Sauternes, Beringer's wine was made of grapes regularly harvested and then introduced at the winery to Botrytis cinerea spores created in a laboratory. Since then California winemakers in places like the Anderson Valley AVA have found vineyards where this noble rot can occur naturally on the grapes. The Anderson and Alexander Valley AVAs have also developed a reputation for their Late Harvest wines made from Riesling. Several French and Italian style Muscat wines are produced throughout California and are known for their intense aromatics and balanced acidity. The port-style wines in California are often made from the traditional Portuguese wine grapes like Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão and Tinta Roriz. Some uniquely Californian styles are also made from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.|$|E
500|$|McGee's work in {{particular}} {{led him to}} question traditional cooking techniques and approaches which resulted in combinations which may at first appear unusual. Blumenthal incorporates psychology {{and the perception of}} diners into his dishes, explaining, [...] "For example, eat sardine on toast sorbet for the first time, confusion will reign as the brain will be trying to tell the palate to expect a <b>dessert</b> <b>and</b> you will therefore be tasting more sweetness than actually exists."

500|$|The {{consumption}} of large and sumptuous meals {{was an important}} part of social life. Some were elaborately planned, others the result of unexpected guests.

In the eighteenth century service was service à la française, where all the dishes were impressively [...] displayed on tables at the same time, until the advent of service à la russe in the nineteenth century, when they were served sequentially. Alcohol in various forms and toasts were {{an important part of}} formal dining and until the Regency era <b>dessert</b> <b>and</b> drinks were often taken in a separate dessert room.|$|E
500|$|Ellen {{goes out}} to dinner with her old friend Richard, a {{reporter}} who is in town to cover a story. His producer, Susan, joins them for <b>dessert</b> <b>and</b> she and Ellen hit it off. Ellen goes back to Richard's hotel room. He comes on to her and, uncomfortable, Ellen leaves. She runs into Susan in the hall and returns with her to her room. They continue to enjoy each other's company until Susan tells Ellen that she's gay and that she thought Ellen might be too. Ellen denies it and suggests that Susan is trying to [...] "recruit" [...] her. Susan sarcastically says that she'll have to call [...] "national headquarters" [...] and let them know Ellen got away. ("Damn, just one more and I would have gotten that toaster oven.") An agitated Ellen leaves Susan's room and returns to Richard's room, determined to have sex with him to prove to herself she is not gay.|$|E

[...] Once sober, Marge reminds Homer of {{his promise to}} spend one Saturday a month with the children. Much to Homer's chagrin, Bart traded his turn to choose with Lisa for her <b>dessert,</b> <b>and</b> Lisa suggests that the family go to the traveling Smithsonian Institution exhibit. Homer attempts to punish Bart for giving his turn to Lisa by forbidding him to have any dessert, but this backfires when Bart makes another deal to give his turn to Lisa in exchange for her dessert again, much to Homer's discomfort. They arrive at the exhibit, which is sponsored by a cell phone company called OmniTouch, has Abraham Lincoln's hat, Fonzie's jacket, Archie Bunker's chair, and the Bill of Rights, which is ruined when Homer reads it with chocolate-covered hands. In an attempt to lick it clean he licks off the section that forbids cruel and unusual punishment. Homer is unable to pay the $10,000 repair bill and so Omnitouch installs a cellular transmitter {{on the roof of}} his house, with the control equipment in Lisa's room. [...] Lisa moves in with Bart, but she is overwhelmed when Bart has made up rules and noises distract her from her homework.|$|E

2500|$|Up {{until the}} late 1980s, the Californian wine {{industry}} was dominated by the Bordeaux varietals and Chardonnay. Sales began to drop as wine drinkers grew bored with the familiarity of these wines. Groups of winemakers like Rhône Rangers and {{a new wave of}} Italian winemakers dubbed [...] "Cal-Ital" [...] reinvigorated the industry with new wine styles made from different varieties like Syrah, Viognier, Sangiovese and Pinot grigio. The Santa Cruz-based Bonny Doon Vineyard {{was one of the first}} wineries to promote these grape varieties in California actively. The large variety of wine grapes also encourages a large variety of wines. California produces wines made in nearly every single known wine style including sparkling, <b>dessert</b> <b>and</b> fortified wines. In the early 21st century, vintners have begun reviving heirloom grape varieties, such as Trousseau gris and Valdiguié.|$|E
