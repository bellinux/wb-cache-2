50|$|Starch always {{leaves the}} printed cloth {{somewhat}} harsh in feeling (unless modified carboxymethylated starches are used), but very dark colours can be obtained. Gum Senegal, gum arabic or modified guar gum thickening yield clearer and more even tints than does starch, suitable for lighter colours but less suited for very dark colours. (The gums apparently prevent the colours from combining fully with the fibers.) A printing stock solution {{is mostly a}} combination of modified starch and <b>gum</b> <b>stock</b> solutions.|$|E
30|$|All the {{solutions}} were prepared in Milli-Q water. 0.5  %(w/v) of homogeneous <b>gum</b> <b>stock</b> solution was prepared {{by adding a}} calculated quantity of gum kondagogu powder into the reagent bottle containing milli-q water and stirring the same for 1  h at room temperature. 1  mL of 1  mM chloroauric acid solution and 3  mL of gum kondagogu solution were mixed in a boiling tube. This mixture was kept in an autoclave at 15 psi pressure and 120  °C for 10  min. The resulting solution was red colored, indicating the formation of AuNPs. The solution of synthesized gold nanoparticles was centrifuged at high speed. The pellet and supernatant liquid were separated. The pellet was again dispersed in double-distilled water.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} devices which grip cylindrical structures and more particularly to a device which has three arcuate gripping members having frictional surfaces for gripping and compressing a bi-stem. The bi-stem gripping apparatus is constructed having {{a pair of}} side gripping members, and an intermediate gripping member disposed between them. Sheets of a <b>gum</b> <b>stock</b> silicone rubber with frictional gripping surfaces are bonded to the inner region of the gripping members and provide frictional engagement between the bi-stem and the apparatus. A latch secures the gripping apparatus to a bi-stem, and removable handles are attached, allowing an astronaut to pull the bi-stem from its cassette. A tethering ring {{on the outside of}} the gripping apparatus provides a convenient point to which a lanyard may be attached...|$|E
50|$|In 1980, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (WDR) {{decided that}} the in-state {{activities}} of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in selling and supplying retailers with chewing gum exceeded limits defined by Congress in 1961 that exempted foreign corporations from franchise and income taxes in a state {{as long as their}} activities were limited to soliciting customers. Wrigley, based in Chicago, neither owned nor leased any real property in the state. Its employees were limited to a regional sales manager, who worked out of his house, and district sales representatives who dealt directly with retailers. The company provided the representatives with cars and reimbursed some of their expenses. Nevertheless, WDR believed that since the sales reps also stored gum and personally resupplied retailers, including replacement of stale <b>gum</b> <b>stocks</b> at no cost, the company did more than just solicit customers in Wisconsin.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{found that}} Wrigley’s {{activities}} in Wisconsin exceeded {{the provisions of}} the state code and allowed the imposition of the tax. The Court ruled that the replacement of stale <b>gum,</b> [...] "agency <b>stock</b> checks", and maintenance of inventory for those purposes were not protected, and the Court sided with the Wisconsin Department of Revenue.|$|R
30|$|Silver nitrate (AgNO 3) (E. Merck, Mumbai, India) of {{analytical}} reagent grade {{was used for}} the synthesis. “Gum ghatti” grade- 1 was purchased from Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd., Hyderabad, India. All the solutions were prepared in ultra pure water. Gum ghatti was powdered in a Prestige high-speed mechanical blender (Bengaluru, India) and sieved to obtain a mean particle size of 38 μm. Then, 0.5 % (w/v) of homogenous <b>gum</b> <b>stock</b> solution was prepared by adding this powder to reagent bottle containing ultra pure water and stirring overnight at room temperature. Then this solution was centrifuged to remove the insoluble materials and the supernatant was used for all the experiments. The protein concentration in the gum solution was quantified by Lowry’s method using a Bangalore GeneiTM protein estimation kit, Cat No 105560 (Bengaluru, India). The silver nanoparticles were synthesized by autoclaving the silver nitrate solutions containing various concentrations of gum ghatti at 121 °C and 103 kPa of pressure for different durations of time, under dark conditions. The effect of concentration of gum and reaction time on nanoparticle synthesis was studied.|$|E
30|$|A 0.5  % (weight/volume (w/v)) {{homogeneous}} <b>gum</b> <b>stock</b> {{solution was}} prepared by dissolving 0.5  g of GT in 100  mL of deionized water and stirring overnight at room temperature. The solution was then centrifuged at 6000  rpm for 10  min to separate out any undissolved matter, and the supernatant {{is used for}} the experiments to be carried out in the study. A 0.5  % (w/v) solution of AgNO 3 is prepared by dissolving 0.5  g of analytical grade AgNO 3 in 100  mL of deionized water. Then, 5  mL of gum extract was mixed with 5  mL of AgNO 3 solution in a boiling tube, and this mixture was subjected to ultra sonication at 45  °C temperature for a 45 -min reaction time (Firdhouse et al. 2012). The conversion of the colorless reaction mixture to the characteristic clear yellow color indicates the formation of AgNPs. A series of samples were prepared by varying the concentration of AgNO 3 (0.1 to 0.5  %) while keeping the concentration of GT (0.5  %) constant. Likewise, the second set of samples were prepared by varying the concentration of GT (0.1 to 0.5  %), keeping the concentration of AgNO 3 constant (0.5  %) at the same sonication conditions as mentioned earlier (45  °C for 45  min).|$|E
