5|$|Although {{encompassing}} diverse mainstream and underground styles, {{the music}} of the NWOBHM is best remembered <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} Shaman King, Takei, {{an assistant}} of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, exchanged {{ideas about the}} series with the other assistants. As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. <b>For</b> <b>drawing,</b> he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E

5|$|Jean Keene (October 20, 1923 – January 13, 2009), {{also known}} as the Eagle Lady, was a former rodeo trick rider who became the subject of {{national}} attention due to her feeding of wild bald eagles on the Homer Spit in Homer, Alaska. Although she had many supporters for the feedings, she was also criticized <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> a large population of eagles to the area. After her death, the city of Homer passed a law prohibiting the feeding of predatory birds.|$|E

The text lists types of aromatic woods, such as sandalwood and their qualities. The text describes the art of painting as three types — Viddha (representational), Aviddha (sketch, outline) and Bhava (narrative).

5|$|The Kungas of pre-Akkadian Nagar {{were used}} <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> the {{carriages}} of kings before the domestication of the horse, and a royal procession included up to fifty animals. The kungas of Nagar were in great {{demand in the}} Eblaite empire; they cost two kilos of silver, fifty times {{the price of a}} donkey, and were imported regularly by the monarchs of Ebla to be used as transport animals and gifts for allied cities. The horse was known in the region during the third millennium BC, but was not used as a draught animal before c. 18th century BC.|$|E

5|$|The Quantock Hills were {{designated}} as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1956, {{the first such}} designation in England under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Notice of the intention to create the AONB under The Quantock Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (Designation) Order, 1956 {{was published in the}} London Gazette on 7 February 1956. Since responsibility for the Quantock AONB is shared between the County Council and three District Councils The Quantock Hills Joint Advisory Committee was set up in 1973 and is responsible <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> up management plans for the Quantocks.|$|E
5|$|Gillom {{fought in}} the European Theatre of World War II and participated in the Battle of the Bulge {{near the end of}} the war. He was {{discharged}} after three years of service, having earned three Bronze Star Medals. By that time, Brown had become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Brown wanted Gillom on the team, but changed his approach after signing fullback Marion Motley in 1946. Motley, a black star who played in high school for Massillon rival Canton, joined the Browns from the University of Nevada, Reno, where former Canton coach Jim Aiken was head coach. As compensation <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> Motley away, Brown arranged for Gillom to go to Nevada for the 1946 season. Gillom led the nation in punting at Nevada that year, but left the school in December because of poor grades.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, the French army {{ceased to}} use the Mérens <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> {{artillery}} in the mountains, and this corresponded {{to the beginning of}} the decline of the breed. The population fell dramatically during the second half of the 20th century, due to the modernization and mechanization of transport and agriculture. In 1950 in Senegal, the Mérens was used in attempts to create a horse tougher than the native M'Bayar, but the breeding program was not enough to significantly increase the Mérens population. The use of the Mérens in agriculture continued into the 1970s, and like many French draft breeds, it was also bred for slaughter to produce horse meat. The mountains of Ariege acted as a sanctuary, preventing the Mérens, as well as other breeds such as Gascon cattle and Tarasconnaise sheep, from disappearing completely. By the early 1970s, however, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|Of the 24 Asian-American awardees, 21 {{earned the}} Medal while serving with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team or its {{component}} unit, the 100th Infantry Battalion, making the 442nd the most decorated regiment-sized {{unit of the}} war. Only two Asian-American officers received the Medal of Honor during World War II: Captain Francis B. Wai who received it <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> enemy fire to himself to reveal their positions and Second Lieutenant Daniel Inouye who received his medal for destroying two machine gun nests and continuing to fight after being wounded. Inouye became the first U.S. Representative for Hawaii and the first Japanese American congressman; he served as one of Hawaii's U.S. Senators from 1963 continuously {{until his death in}} 2012.|$|E

5|$|The Excellency {{over the}} Masses (also {{known as the}} Minister over the Masses) shared the same censorial and {{advisory}} roles as the other two Excellencies, the Excellency of Works and Grand Commandant. Like his previous counterpart, the Chancellor, {{he must have been}} responsible <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> up the annual budget, although contemporary sources fail to mention this point. Aside from the court conference, the Great Conference of leading officials across the empire was conducted by his ministry. The Chancellor's bureaus were also retained by the Excellency over the Masses, and were nearly identical to that of the new Eastern-Han Grand Commandant's bureaus. He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister Coachman, Minister of Justice, and Minister Herald.|$|E
5|$|The Kangchu system {{facilitated}} {{the growth of}} the gambier and pepper plantations and developed Johor's and Singapore's economies in the 19th century. The development of Johor's inland towns were attributed to the efforts by the various Kangchu, who were responsible <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> the settlement plan for the coolies living within the plantation they were working on, from which new towns were formed. The Chinese immigrant population in Johor and Singapore grew in size during this period; Riau also experienced a similar growth during the 18th century. As a result of mass immigration by the Chinese into Johor, the Chinese quickly outnumbered the Malays in the state, although many Chinese coolies relocated to Singapore or other parts of Malaya as the gambier and pepper industry declined in the 20th century. Several towns and other places in Johor and Singapore, built upon sites of former gambier and pepper plantations, are named after former features of the Kangchu system, and are largely populated by ethnic Chinese.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E

5|$|After {{dropping}} out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash. His sister's boyfriend encouraged him {{to apply for a}} job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna's talent <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio, which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Despite a lack of formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For the first several years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier to empathize with an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{potential}} of the young boy, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for James's early education, which in the Victorian era was largely the job of the woman of the house. At eight he could recite long passages of Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already very detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. James's education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life. His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a sixteen-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man John hired to instruct his son, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward. John dismissed the tutor in November 1841 and, after considerable thought, sent James to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy. He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.|$|E
