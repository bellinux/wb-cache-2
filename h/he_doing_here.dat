6000|$|... "Chauvelin!" [...] cried Tony, {{suddenly}} roused {{from the}} dull apathy of his immeasurable grief, at {{sound of that}} name which recalled so many exciting adventures, such mad, wild, hair-breadth escapes. [...] "Chauvelin! What {{in the world is}} <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> in England?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the worst}} of them all is that Allen," [...] he growled. [...] "Your {{particular}} friend--eh? You have let {{in a lot of}} these Englishmen into this part. You ought never to have been allowed to settle here. Never. What's <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> now?" ...|$|E
60|$|DOYLE [returning]. Where {{the devil}} {{did you pick}} up that seedy swindler? What was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> [He goes {{up to the table}} where the plans are, and makes a note on one of them, {{referring}} to his pocket book as he does so].|$|E
60|$|LARRY [glancing at Nora]. He {{will take}} more than that from me before <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's possible, but I don't {{know what}} <b>he's</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here,</b> and we'll follow up the gutter until we're {{abreast of the}} wreck. The fog will come down thick before we reach her." ...|$|R
50|$|The film is {{a remake}} of Laurel and Hardy's final silent film Angora Love, made in 1929. Charlie Hall played a tenant in the original; he plays the {{landlord}} in the remake. Harry Bernard also played the policeman in Angora Love as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But {{what was}} <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> She put the candle on the table, and taking her head between her hands {{sat down to}} think. The {{explanation}} of the thing came to her with a rush. It was with this Mr. Y. that Percy {{had gone to the}} Kneipe. A mistake had been made. Mr. Y. had been brought back to Percy's address. Percy at this very moment-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what's <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> in Cottonwoods? This place isn't notorious {{enough for}} such a man. Sterling and the villages north, where there's {{universal}} gun-packing and fights every day--where there are more men like him, {{it seems to me}} they would attract him most. We're only a wild, lonely border settlement. It's only recently that the rustlers have made killings here. Nor have there been saloons till lately, nor the drifting in of outcasts. Has not this gun-man some special mission here?" ...|$|E
60|$|I looked up. At {{the first}} glance I did not {{recognise}} the speaker; but then as I cleared my mind I {{saw it was}} Ercole Piacentini. What was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> Then I remembered that {{it was on the}} road to Forli. I supposed he had received orders to leave Castello and {{was on his way to}} his old haunts. However, I did not want to speak to him; I bent down, and again clasped my head in my hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's him. What <b>he's</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> I don't know. He {{disappeared}} {{quite a while}} back, and I haven't {{seen him}} since. Nor want. Tonight up he turns again like a bad ha'penny. I'd {{like to know what}} he's after. No good, if you ask me.' ...|$|R
60|$|A throne for {{judgment}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>here</b> erect, Virtue to cherish, folly to detect; Statutes and laws, unto {{this house}} he gave, To teach who to condemn, and who to save: By things thus wholesome taught is every brother To fear his God, and to love one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuming that Jimmy Crocker {{would accept}} an {{invitation}} {{to come over to}} America, what sort of work could <b>he</b> <b>do</b> <b>here?</b> <b>He</b> couldn't get his place on the Chronicle back again after dropping out for all these years and making a public pest of himself all that while. And outside of newspaper work what is he fit for?" ...|$|R
60|$|What was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> In the {{few months}} of their married life {{he had never been}} home before at this hour. The lumber-room {{contained}} among other things the disjecta membra of his old mining life and experience. He may have wanted something. There was an old bag which she remembered he said contained some of his mother's dresses. Yet it was so odd that he should go there now. Any other time but this. A terrible superstitious dread--a dread that any other time she would have laughed to scorn, began to creep over her. Hark! he was moving. She stopped breathing.|$|E
6000|$|But, {{even as he}} gazed, the {{appearance}} of another figure in the landscape beyond the house proved the reality of his vision, and as suddenly distracted him from all else. For it was the apparition of a man on horseback approaching the house from the upland; and even at that distance he recognized its well-known outlines. It was Calvert! Calvert the traitor! Calvert, the man whom he had long suspected as being the secret lover and destined husband of Cicely Preston! Calvert, who had deceived him with his calm equanimity and his affected preference for Maggie, to conceal his deliberate understanding with Cicely. What was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> Was he a double traitor, and now trying to deceive HER--as he had him? And Maggie here! This sudden return--this preconcerted meeting. It was infamy! ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} {{of this in}} {{her face as she}} descended and joined him. He thought that face handsome, well-bred, and refined. But this {{breeding}} and refinement seemed to him--in his ignorance of the world, possibly--as only a graceful concealment of a self of which he knew nothing; and he was not surprised to find that her pretty gray eyes, now no longer hidden by her veil, really told him no more than her lips. He was a little afraid of her, and now that she had lost her naive enthusiasm he was conscious of a vague remorsefulness for his interrupted work in the forest. What was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> He who had avoided the cruel, selfish world of wealth and pleasure,--a world that this woman represented,--the world that had stood apart from him in the one dream of his life--and had let Loo die! His quickly responsive face darkened.|$|E
60|$|Then, nobody quite {{remembered what}} <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>Here</b> {{and there a}} man {{struggled}} with a plunging horse {{in the darkness of}} the wood, and one or two blundered into each other and fell against the trunks as they ran on foot. They were dazed with cold, and the snow, that seemed to cut their cheeks, was in their eyes.|$|R
60|$|Secondly.--We must see, {{as well as}} we can surmise it {{from the}} facts we know of, what <b>he</b> has <b>done</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} he was on deck, and after a hearty shaking of hands, Stanley asked what <b>he</b> was <b>doing</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
60|$|What was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> {{and what}} was the meaning of all this? He had come simply to fulfill a duty to his past, and please a {{helpless}} and misunderstood old acquaintance. He had performed that duty. But he had incidentally learned a certain fact that might be important to this friend, and clearly his duty was simply to go back and report it. He would gain nothing more in the way of corroboration of it by staying now, if further corroboration were required. Colonel Pendleton had already been uselessly and absurdly perplexed about the possible discovery of the girl's parentage, and its effect upon her fortunes and herself. She had just settled that of her own accord, and, without committing herself or others, had suggested a really sensible plan by which all trouble would be avoided in future. That was the common-sense way of looking at it. He would lay the plan before the colonel, have him judge of its expediency and its ethics--and even the question whether she already knew the real truth, or was self-deceived. That done, he would return to his own affairs in Sacramento. There was nothing difficult in this, or that need worry him, only he could have done it just as well an hour ago.|$|E
6000|$|He {{came back}} to life with a sharp {{tingling}} of his whole frame as if pierced with a thousand needles. He knew he was being rubbed, and in his attempts to throw his torturers aside, he saw faintly {{by the light of}} a flickering fire that they were Chinamen, and he was lying {{on the floor of a}} rude hut. With his first movements they ceased, and, wrapping him like a mummy in warm blankets, dragged him out of the heap of loose snow with which they had been rubbing him, toward the fire that glowed upon the large adobe hearth. The stinging pain was succeeded by a warm glow; a pleasant languor, which made even thought a burden, came over him, and yet his perceptions were keenly alive to his surroundings. He heard the Chinamen mutter something and then depart, leaving him alone. But presently he was aware of another figure that had entered, and was now sitting with its back to him at a rude table, roughly extemporized from a packing-box, apparently engaged in writing. It was a small Chinaman, evidently the one he had chased! The events of the past few hours--his mission, his intentions, and every incident of the pursuit--flashed back upon him. Where was he? What was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> Had Trixit escaped him? ...|$|E
6000|$|In one respect, however, if in one only, the {{arrangement}} had been unfortunate. Archdeacon Hare, both by natural tendency {{and by his}} position as a Churchman, had been led, in editing a Work not free from ecclesiastical heresies, and especially in writing a Life very full of such, to dwell with preponderating emphasis on {{that part of his}} subject; by no means extenuating the fact, nor yet passing lightly over it (which a layman could have done) as needing no extenuation; but carefully searching into it, with the view of excusing and explaining it; dwelling on it, presenting all the documents of it, and as it were spreading it over the whole field of his delineation; as if religious heterodoxy had been the grand fact of Sterling's life, which even to the Archdeacon's mind it could by no means seem to be. Hinc illae lachrymae. For the Religious Newspapers, and Periodical Heresy-hunters, getting very lively in those years, were prompt to seize the cue; and have prosecuted and perhaps still prosecute it, in their sad way, to all lengths and breadths. John Sterling's character and writings, which had little business to be spoken of in any Church-court, have hereby been carried thither as if for an exclusive trial; and the mournfulest set of pleadings, out of which nothing but a misjudgment can be formed, prevail there ever since. The noble Sterling, a radiant child of the empyrean, clad in bright auroral hues in the memory of all that knew him,--what is <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> in inquisitorial sanbenito, with nothing but ghastly spectralities prowling round him, and inarticulately screeching and gibbering what they call their judgment on him! ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing for AllMusic critic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{wrote of}} the album [...] "Ferry has never felt quite so {{comfortable}} as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>here,</b> and if {{that may not be}} exactly what all listeners are looking for when they listen to his work, this is the quality that will make Dylanesque a small understated gem for certain segments of his die-hard fans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fear not, gallant leader," [...] said Edward Walcott, who {{had already}} {{discovered}} the objects of the doctor's terror. [...] "They are men of peace, as we shall shortly see. The foremost is somewhere near your own years, and rides like a grave, substantial citizen,--though what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>here,</b> I know not. Behind come two servants, men likewise of sober age and pacific appearance." ...|$|R
60|$|Let him {{who sees}} this stage take heed Unto {{his heart and}} tongue; Lest if <b>he</b> <b>do</b> not, <b>here</b> <b>he</b> speed, As some have long agone.|$|R
5000|$|For {{many years}} the {{soldier in the}} most {{well-known}} of the photographs was identified as Edward Regan. The daughter of Alphonse Joseph Arsenault has claimed that her father is that GI. Another soldier, Huston Riley, has been put forward by historian Lowell Getz. Riley himself remembers meeting a photographer who helped {{him out of the}} water: [...] "I was surprised to see him there. I saw the press badge and I thought, 'What the hell is <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> He helped me {{out of the water and}} then he took off down the beach for some more photos." ...|$|E
5000|$|First-time screenwriter Lou Holtz, Jr. had {{the idea}} for The Cable Guy {{while working as a}} {{prosecutor}} in Los Angeles, declaring that he once saw a cable company employee in the hallway of his mother's apartment and started thinking, [...] "What's <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> so late?" [...] The screenplay became the subject of a bidding war, won by Columbia Pictures at a price of $1 million. The role of the Cable Guy was originally written for Chris Farley, who turned it down due to scheduling difficulties. Jim Carrey joined the production, receiving a then-record $20 million to star. Following Carrey's signing, Columbia hired Judd Apatow to produce. The studio rebuffed Apatow's interest in directing, but accepted his suggestion to invite Ben Stiller, star of his eponymous show on which Apatow had worked.|$|E
5000|$|Damon Knight {{wrote of}} the novel:Revolution...has always been a {{favorite}} theme in science fiction. It's romantic, it's reliable, and -- as a rule -- it's as phony as a Martian princess.Who but Heinlein ever pointed out, as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>here</b> in detail, that a modern revolution is big business? And who but Heinlein would have seen that fraternal organizations, for thirty years the butt of highbrow American humor, would make the perfect nucleus for an American underground against tyranny? ...|$|R
50|$|In late 1323 {{or early}} 1324 Eckhart left Strasbourg for the Dominican house at Cologne. It {{is not clear}} exactly what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>here,</b> though part of his time may have been spent {{teaching}} at the prestigious Studium in the city. Eckhart also continued to preach, addressing his sermons {{during a time of}} disarray among the clergy and monastic orders, rapid growth of numerous pious lay groups, and the Inquisition's continuing concerns over heretical movements throughout Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Los Angeles Times critic Peter Rainer {{also gave}} a {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "a crude rehashing {{of the high}} points of the first film" [...] and singling out director Hill, who he said [...] "surely recognizes the hollowness of what <b>he's</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here.</b> <b>He</b> tries to ram through the muddled exposition as quickly as possible; essentially, the film is wall-to-wall mayhem, with more shots of hurled bodies shattering windows than I've ever seen in a movie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{him that}} sees this stage take heed [...] Unto {{his heart and}} tongue; [...] Lest, if <b>he</b> <b>do</b> not, <b>here</b> <b>he</b> speed [...] As some have, long agone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be d----d if <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> Look <b>here,</b> sir. Between you and {{me there}} can be a bargain, and nothing but a bargain. I will pay the £5000,--on certain conditions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right, sir," [...] said Henry, to {{the officer}} in command. [...] "That is my cousin, who left Oswego with General Prideaux's command. I don't know what <b>he</b> is <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> though." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY influence? With your FATHER? Well, I'm dashed. Sanguine sort of Johnny, if <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> Well, <b>here's</b> what <b>he</b> says. Of course, I {{remember}} jolly old Parker now--great pal of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if Bones plagues him anyhow - Squeaking and all {{the rest}} of it, As <b>he</b> was <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> just now - I prophesy there'll be a row, And Tibbs will have the best of it!" ...|$|R
