50|$|Eventually, {{a dental}} company named Ormco started {{developing}} lingual brackets {{in conjunction with}} Dr. Kurz. After working on several prototypes of brackets initially, the company also faced same problems: Irritation caused to the tongue and high bracket failure rate. Then, an inclined plane {{was added to the}} lingual brackets and the company saw lower failure rates. This plane allowed the shearing forces to convert into compressive forces. After the development of the inclined plane, Kurz filed for a patent in 1976. The first brackets to be produced were in 1979 by Ormco. Kurz eventually started working with the orthodontic company Ormco to develop his next 7 generations of the lingual bracket. Initial patients were seen at private practice of Kurz where the brackets were directly bonded, as compared to <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> with majority of the lingual braces. Eventually, Dr. Kurz lectured to many orthodontists around US and showed his cases to the other clinicians. In the early 1980s, the interest with lingual braces started to gather steam as other companies such as Unitek, Forestadent started to develop their own groups to study these appliances.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Current {{studies have}} {{compared}} <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> with direct placement of orthodontic brackets; {{many of these}} have shown that <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> is generally a more accurate technique. However, the reproducibility of an <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> setup by an orthodontist {{has yet to be}} described in the literature. Using cone-beam computed tomography and computer-assisted modeling software, we evaluated the consistency of orthodontists in placing orthodontic brackets at different times. Methods: Five orthodontists with experience in <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> were selected to place brackets on 10 different casts at 3 time periods (n 5 30 per orthodontist). Each participant completed an initial <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> setup on each cast; subsequent bracket placements were completed twice at monthly intervals for comparison with the initial setup. The casts were scanned using an iCAT cone-beam computed tomography scanner (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, Pa) and imported into Geomagic Studio software (Geomagic, Research Triangle Park, NC) for superimposition and analysis. The scans for each time period were superimposed on the initial setup in the imaging software, and differences between bracket positions were calculated. For each superimposition, the measurements recorded were the greatest discrepancies between individual brackets as well as the mean discrepancies and standard deviations between all brackets on each cast. Results: Single-factor and repeated-measure analysis of variance showed no statistically significant differences between time points of each orthodontist, or among the orthodontists for the parameters measured. The mean discrepancy was 0. 1 mm for each 10 -bracket <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> setup.

40|$|Introduction: A {{critical}} issue and concern {{that has been}} documented in dentistry is the complexity of bonding to dentin, a fact that {{has been referred to}} as a less reliable technique due to the intrinsic characteristics of the dentin substrate. Effectiveness on dentin bonding is a clinical important approach for <b>indirect</b> <b>bonded</b> restorations in order to achieve a good adhesion that can surpass the test of time. Long-term clinical trials have shown that <b>indirect</b> <b>bonded</b> restorations have an increased risk of failure when using dentin as the major substrate. Consequently, an effort should be made to improve techniques and materials utilized in dentin bonding to make restorations more predictable and durable. Among these efforts, Immediate Dentin Sealing (IDS) a concept introduced in the late nineties-had demonstrated outstanding in vitro outcomes when tested on dentin in the field of adhesive dentistry. Even though there is moderate evidence in support of the utilization of IDS over the conventional (DDS) approach, few studies have really emphasized on the correct utilization of IDS on <b>indirect</b> <b>bonded</b> restorations. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate and compare the microtensile bond strength of coronal dentin following the application of two different techniques (IDS versus conventional) and two different dentin bonding systems (4 th and 5 th generation), when using <b>indirect</b> <b>bonded</b> restorations. Methods: After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, extracted sound human third molars were collected. Occlusal dentinal area was used for testing. Specimens were divided into 4 groups (n= 20). Group 1 : IDS using a 4 th generation dentin bonding system (DBS); Group 2 : IDS using a 5 th generation DBS; Group 3 : Conventional (DDS) using a 4 th generation DBS; and Group 4 : DDS using a 5 th generation DBS. All specimens were restored using a light-cure indirect micro ceramic/composite restorative material and stored on moist environment for 24 hours before testing. Each tooth was sectioned perpendicular to the bonding interface 1 x 1 x 10 mm beams. Specimens were subjected to microtensile bond strength test (μTBS). Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA comparing technique and bonding system. Results: For bonding techniques, the conventional technique exhibited lower strength than IDS, this difference being statistically significant (p = 0. 0100). When bonding systems were compared 4 th generation (Optibond FL) and 5 th generation (Optibond Solo Plus), the higher mean was found with the 5 th generation which was statistically significant (p = 0. 0121). In the conventional group when 4 th generation and 5 th generation are compared, the bond strength in the 5 th generation was higher with this difference being statistically significant (p = 0. 0024). In the IDS group, the bond strength was higher again in the 5 th generation, however this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 18). The results of two-way ANOVA for bonding system and technique, and interaction showed significant main effect for technique (p = 0. 007) and dentin bonding system (p = 0. 010). No significant interaction effect was found for dentin bonding system by technique (p = 0. 797). Conclusions: The immediate dentin sealing IDS performed better than the conventional. The 5 th generation bonding system performed better than the 4 th generation bonding system. Restorative approach or technique immediate dentin sealing IDS versus conventional will increase significantly the bond strength of the dentin to indirect composite restorations of the tested adhesive systems...|$|R

Background: Recent literature {{has suggested that}} <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> results in more accurate bracket placement. However, this more ideal positioning is of no use to the orthodontist unless the indirect bracket set-up is transferred accurately to the patient's dentition. This study aims to investigate the positional integrity of the <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> transfer method of two commercially available tray types. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients {{were randomly assigned to}} either a transparent tray light-cure or an opaque tray chemical-cure <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> system. A total of 129 teeth were analyzed for the transparent tray group and 99 teeth for the opaque tray group. An intraoral scanner was used to generate three-dimension. stl models of each indirect set-up ("pre-transfer"� model) and each corresponding in-vivo bracketed patient arch ("post-transfer"� model). A comparison software was used to superimpose these models based on a surface best-fit algorithm. Bracket position differences were measured in three translational and three rotational planes of space to the nearest 1 �m. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the pre- and post-transfer bracket position, to detect any directional patterns of error, and to compare the transparent and opaque tray systems. Results: The <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> transfer was found to be accurate for the data as a whole and for each tray type individually (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Objectives: To analyse the {{key factors}} of the {{restoration}} in the posterior endodontically treated teeth, through a literature review and clinical cases presentation. To {{focus on the}} clinical advantages of the adhesive indirect restorations, describing the basic principles for long-term success. Materials and methods: The biomechanical changes due to the root canal therapy {{and the degree of}} healthy dental tissue lost because of pathology and iatrogenic factors are the critical points leading the clinician to the restorative treatment planning. The full crown is considered by the literature as the gold standard and is indicated in case of teeth heavily weakened by dental caries, fractures or previous conservative-prosthetic preparations. The improvement of the adhesion and the composite materials, with mechanical properties close to those of dental tissues, offers to the clinician the option of a conservative restoration, able to seal, reinforce and protect the tooth and to delay the execution of a full crown, with the subsequent sacrifice of dental tissue. Although in the presence of small-sized cavity, direct bonded restoration is considered an effective short and medium-term restoration, cuspal coverage with indirect restoration is the treatment of choice in case of mesio-occlusal-distal cavities. Adhesive overlays preserve coronal structure, avoid contamination of the root canal system, reinforce residual dental tissues, guarantee optimal form, function, aesthetics and offer ergonomic and economic undoubted clinical advantages. Results and conclusions: Direct adhesive restorations, <b>indirect</b> <b>bonded</b> restorations and traditional full crown are three therapeutic options for the single posterior endodontically treated teeth.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of Lingual Orthodontics over Labial Orthodontics are many.

Background: <b>Indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> of orthodontic brackets {{has been viewed}} {{as a method of}} achieving greater accuracy and effectiveness in orthodontic treatment. Although the concept of <b>indirect</b> <b>bonding</b> has been widely studied, the accuracy of the transfer between the indirect stone model-set of the brackets to the patient's dentition has not been investigated in a clinical setting. The goal of the present study is to elicit the frequency, directional bias, and magnitude of bracket positioning errors due to this transfer. Methods: A total of 163 brackets were initially placed on indirect stone model set-ups and scanned using a cone-beam computed tomography system to capture 3 -D bracket positioning data. These brackets were then transferred to the patient's dentition and later scanned using CBCT to capture the final 3 -D bracket positioning on the teeth. Virtual models of the teeth and attached brackets were constructed from the scanned data. Initial and final pairs of models were digitally superimposed. Differences in bracket positioning were measured using customized software. One-tailed t-tests were used to compare measurement data with the pre-determined acceptable ranges of +/- 0. 5 mm linearly and 2. 0 degrees angularly for differences in each of 6 dimensions studied. Results: The indirect transfer of brackets resulted in accurate positioning (&alpha = 0. 05, P < 0. 0001).
