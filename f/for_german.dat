5|$|Kaiser Friedrich III-class battleships were a {{class of}} pre–World War I, pre-dreadnought battleships of the German Kaiserliche Marine. The class {{was made up of}} five ships, all of which were named <b>for</b> <b>German</b> emperors. The Kaiser Friedrich III class saw the {{introduction}} of the traditional armament layout <b>for</b> <b>German</b> battleships—four large-caliber guns, but of comparatively smaller caliber compared to contemporary battleships, in two gun turrets—prior to the advent of the dreadnought type of battleship in the early 1900s. They also standardized the use of three screws for battleships.|$|E

5|$|After a {{few weeks}} {{assigned}} to Western Approaches Command, the 1st DF {{was assigned to the}} Nore Command at Harwich, although some of the ships were transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, where they were tasked for escort and patrol duty. Gipsy was sunk on 21 November after she struck a mine, as did Grenville on 19 January 1940. Unlike the 1st DF, the Second was transferred to Force K in Freetown in West Africa, to help search <b>for</b> <b>German</b> commerce raiders.

5|$|After {{the work}} was completed, Lacroma {{underwent}} sea trials beginning on 9 July 1906. She was thereafter assigned to her role as the yacht for the Marinekommandant, at that time Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli. The ship saw no significant service during World War I. In 1915, Lacroma was completely disarmed and thereafter used as a barracks ship <b>for</b> <b>German</b> U-boat crews in Pola starting in 1916. After Austria-Hungary's defeat in November 1918, was {{handed over to the}} new Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1918. In the postwar division of war prizes, the ship was awarded to Italy, where she was broken up in 1920.|$|E

Too slow to follow Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock's cruisers, she missed the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, where Cradock was defeated. Moored at Port Stanley as a defensive battery, she fired the first shots of the Battle of the Falklands in December, which led Spee to break off the attack before being chased down and destroyed by Admiral Doveton Sturdee's battlecruisers.|$|E
