We found that approach A was not suited for quantitative analysis of total ceftiofur concentration or for effectively detecting off-label use of ceftiofur.

Approach C showed adequate quantitative results but, in contrast to approach B, it is applicable to a range of cephalosporin antibiotics. Therefore, it is applicable as a broad quantitative screening of cephalosporin compounds in poultry tissue samples to indicate off-label use of cephalosporins in poultry breeding.

40|$|International audienceThe use of {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics in veterinary {{practice is}} likely {{to play an important}} role in the development of ß-lactam resistant bacteria. To detect off-label cephalosporin antibiotic usage an analytical method is needed that, besides the native compound, also detects active metabolites thereof. In this paper the applicability of three approaches for the quantitative analysis of ceftiofur using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry is assesed, viz. (A) the analysis of ceftiofur, <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> and/or <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> cystein disulfide, (B) the derivatization of ceftiofur metabolites to <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> acetamide and (C) the chemical hydrolysis using ammonia in order to produce a marker compound for ceftiofur.

Approach B resulted in adequate quantitative results, but is considered to be a single compound method because it depends on the cleavage of a thioester group which is present in only a limited number of cephalosporin antibiotics. Approach C showed adequate quantitative results as well. In contrast to approach B, this approach is applicable to a range of cephalosporin antibiotics and therefore applicable as a broad quantitative screening of cephalosporin compounds in poultry tissue samples to indicate off-label use of cephalosporins in poultry breeding.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for the confirmatory and quantitative analysis of 30 β-lactam antibiotic residues in bovine muscle. The method includes 12 penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, mecillinam, methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, penicillin G, penicillin V, piperacillin, ticarcillin), 12 cephalosporins (cefacetrile, cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefalonium, cefazolin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefquinome, cefuroxime, desacetyl cephapirin, <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> cysteine disulfide, <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> dimer), five carbapenems (biapenem, doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem) and faropenem. Samples were extracted using a simple solvent extraction with acetonitrile:water (80 : 20, v/v) and C 18 dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) clean-up, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) detection. Chromatography was performed on a reversed phase CSH C 18 column, using a binary gradient separation comprising of 0. 01 % formic acid and 0. 2 mM ammonium acetate in water (mobile phase A) and 0. 01 % formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionisation mode (ESI(+)). Validation was performed following the 2002 / 657 /EC guidelines. Trueness ranged between 69 % and 143 % and precision ranged between 2. 0 % and 29. 9 % under within-laboratory reproducibility conditions. The developed method uses minimal sample preparation and 30 test samples can be analysed by a single analyst in a single day. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first method for carbapenems in foodstuff that does not require derivatisation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identity}} metabolites and transformation products (TPs) in chicken muscle from amoxicillin (AMX), cephapirin (PIR) and ceftiofur (TIO), which are antibiotics of the β-lactam family. Liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) mass spectrometry was utilized due to its high resolution, high mass accuracy and MS/MS capacity for elemental composition determination and structural elucidation. Amoxicilloic acid (AMA) and amoxicillin diketopiperazine (DKP) were found as transformation products from AMX. Desacetylcephapirin (DAC) was detected as a metabolite of PIR. <b>Desfuroylceftiofur</b> (DFC) and its conjugated compound with cysteine (DFC-S-Cys) were detected as a result of TIO in contact with chicken muscle tissue. The metabolites and transformation products were also monitored during the in vivo AMX treatment and slaughtering period. It was found that two days were enough to eliminate AMX and associated metabolites/transformation products after the end of administration...|$|E
40|$|A simple, rapid, rugged, sensitive, and {{specific}} method for the confirmation and quantitation of 10 β-lactam antibiotics in fortified and incurred bovine kidney tissue has been developed. The method uses a simple solvent extraction, dispersive solid-phase extraction (dispersive- SPE) cleanup, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) for confirmation and quantitation. Dispersive-SPE greatly simplifies and accelerates sample cleanup and improves overall recoveries compared with conventional SPE cleanup. The β-lactam antibiotics tested were as follows: deacetylcephapirin (an antimicrobial metabolite of cephapirin), amoxicillin, <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> cysteine disulfide (DCCD, an antimicrobial metabolite of ceftiofur), ampicillin, cefazolin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cloxacillin, naficillin, and dicloxacillin. Average recoveries of fortified samples were 70 % or better for all β-lactams except DCCD, which {{had an average}} recovery of 58 %. The LC/MS/MS method was able to demonstrate quantitative recoveries at established tolerance levels and provide confirmatory data for unambiguous analyte identification. The method was also tested on 30 incurred bovine kidney samples obtained from the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, which had previously tested the samples using the approved semiquantitative microbial assay. The results from the quantitative LC/MS/MS analysis were in general agreement with the microbial assay for 23 samples although the LC/MS/MS method was superior in that it could specifically identify which β-lactam was present and quantitate its concentration, whereas the microbial assay could only identify the type of β-lactam present and report a concentration {{with respect to the}} microbial inhibition of a penicillin G standard. In addition, for 6 of the 23 samples, LC/MS/ MS analysis detected a penicillin and a cephalosporin β-lactam, whereas the microbial assay detected only a penicillin β-lactam. For samples that do not fall into the “general agreement” category, the most serious discrepancy involves two samples where the LC/MS/MS method detected a violative level of a cephalosporin β-lactam (deacetylcephapirin) in the first sample and a possibly violative level of <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> in the second, whereas the microbial assay identified the two samples as having only violative levels of a penicillin β-lactam...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our research}} {{on the degradation of}} ceftiofur and cephapirin at physiological temperatures in kidney extract and in alkaline and acidic solution, conditions that regularly occur during sample preparation. Degradation products were identified using LC¿ToF/MS, NMR and microbiological techniques. Additionally kinetics of the degradation processes were studied. A slight instability of cephapirin and <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> was observed at elevated temperatures. Ceftiofur and cephapirin degraded immediately and completely in an alkaline environment, resulting in inactive degradation products. Ceftiofur and cephapirin also degraded immediately and completely in kidney extract resulting in both formerly reported metabolites as well as not previously reported products. Our research shows that conditions often occurring during the analysis of ceftiofur or cephapirin result in rapid degradation of both compounds. From this it is concluded that underestimation of the determined amounts of ceftiofur and cephapirin is likely to occur. Therefore, a new approach is needed for the analysis of both compounds newly identified degradation product...|$|E
40|$|Placentitis is {{a common}} cause of {{pregnancy}} loss in the mare. Effective treatments for placentitis remain elusive. Ceftiofur sodium is effective against the most common pathogens causing placentitis, including Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. However, {{little is known about}} the pharmacokinetics of the drug in pregnant mares or whether or not the drug penetrates the fetal placental barrier. Eight pregnant pony mares were treated with ceftiofur sodium (Naxcel®) (4. 4 mg/kg, IM, q 24 h) for at least 4 days prior to induction of parturition. Mares were monitored daily for signs of onset of parturition and mammary secretions were tested daily for calcium concentrations using a commercial test. Parturition was induced using oxytocin (5 IU) administered at 25 minute intervals until the onset of parturition. Allantoic fluid, amniotic fluid and pre-suckle colostrum samples were collected. Plasma samples were collected at 2 hours post drug administration in the mare, and at birth (time point 0) and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after delivery from mares and foals. Plasma samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography to detect concentrations of ceftiofur and its active metabolite, <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> acetamide (DCA). Median plasma concentrations of DCA of 8. 61 (7. 38 - 8. 89) μg/ml were found at birth in the mare, while no detectable concentrations of the drug were found in foal plasma. Median DCA concentrations of 1. 70 (1. 30 - 1. 75) μg/ml were found in milk. No detectable amounts of the drug were found in either the allantoic or amniotic fluid. Results from this study show that therapeutic concentrations of ceftiofur sodium seem not to attain the fetal compartment or foal plasma after drug administration to the mare prior to delivery. These data suggest that ceftiofur sodium does not penetrate the equine feto-placental barrier and, therefore, may not be effective for treating mares with placentitis...|$|E
40|$|In today’s {{livestock}} farming and milk production, therapeutic, metaphylactic and prophylactic use of ß-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins) and aminoglycosides is inevitable. However, improper {{use of these}} antibiotics may lead to residues in milk and edible tissues and can cause human health hazards as well as technological problems in dairy industry. In general, antibiotics are unwanted components in food, {{and it has to}} be ensured that the consumer is not exposed to antibiotic residues at potentially harmful concentrations, i. e., above maximum residue limits (MRLs) according to Council Regulation (EEC) 2377 / 90. Therefore, efficient analytical methods are required to identify and to reliably quantify residues of these antibiotics. In this study, sensitive and selective liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LCMS/ MS) methods were developed for fifteen ß-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins) in bovine milk, muscle and kidney, for four aminoglycosides in bovine kidney and for the cephalosporin ceftiofur in bovine milk. Electrospray ionisation (ESI) proved to be suitable for the generation of positively ([M+H] +) and negatively charged ([M-H] -) gas phase ions for all compounds studied. The negative electrospray ionisation mode (ESI (-)) allowed a more sensitive analysis of the monobasic penicillins and the cephalosporin cefoperazone than the positive mode. All other compounds were measured with higher sensitivity using the positive electrospray ionisation mode (ESI (+)). It was demonstrated that the ESI-mode leading to higher sensitivity was predictable by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation considering the substance specific pKs and the pH of the eluent used for the chromatography. Collision induced dissociation (CID) with argon was used for fragmentation of the pseudomolecular ions to achieve the required selectivity for substance specific identification. By using the LC-MS/MS technique, it was possible to reduce the complexity of the required cleanup procedures to a minimum of what is necessary with less selective methods. The fifteen ß-lactams were extracted from the food samples with acetonitrile/water and cleanedup by a single reversed-phase solid phase extraction (SPE) step. Ceftiofur-related residues, bound to milk proteins, were liberated using dithioerythritol, then derivatized with iodacetamide and cleaned-up by a single reversed-phase SPE step. With the aminoglycosides it was sufficient to apply a simple ultrafiltration step for clean-up prior to the LC-MS/MS analysis. A polar deactivated phenylether HPLC column was applicable for the chromatographic separation of all ß-lactams in the reversed-phase mode as well as for the chromatographic separation of the highly polar aminoglycosides in the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic mode (HILIC). Adverse effects on the ESI caused by co-eluting endogenous matrix components were investigated. Considerable signal suppression or enhancement effects could be observed for most of the compounds studied. The results demonstrated that these matrix effects depend highly on the type of matrix. The methods for the ß-lactam antibiotics were validated closely to the EU requirements laid down in Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. Incurred ß-lactam and aminoglycoside residues in 24 samples from official food control, tested positive with a class-specific receptor test (Charm IItest), were identified and quantitatively analyzed using the developed LC-MS/MS methods. Benzylpenicillin and dihydrostreptomycine were the most prevalent residues. Furthermore, a cow suffering from postpartum metritis was treated with Excenel ® RTU, containing ceftiofur hydrochloride as active component for 3 days. All milk samples obtained during medication were analyzed quantitatively. CID-fragmentation studies were carried out on ceftiofur and <b>desfuroylceftiofur</b> using a triple quadrupole and an ion-trap mass spectrometer to allow the postulation of fragmentation pathways for these compounds...|$|E
