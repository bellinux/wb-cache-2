5000|$|In various jurisdictions, {{intensive}} {{animal production}} of some kinds {{is subject to}} regulation for environmental protection. In the United States, a CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation) that discharges or proposes to discharge waste requires a permit and implementation of a plan for management of manure nutrients, contaminants, wastewater, etc., as applicable, to meet requirements pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act. [...] Some data on regulatory compliance and enforcement are available. In 2000, the US Environmental Protection Agency published 5-year and 1-year data on environmental performance of 32 industries, with data for the livestock industry being derived mostly from inspections of CAFOs. The data pertain to <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> mostly under the Clean Water Act, but also under the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Of the 32 industries, livestock production was among the top seven for environmental performance over the 5-year period, {{and was one of}} the top two in the final year of that period, where good environmental performance is indicated by a low ratio of enforcement orders to inspections. The five-year and final-year ratios of enforcement/inspections for the livestock industry were 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. Also in the final year, the livestock industry was one of the two leaders among the 32 industries in terms of having the lowest percentage of facilities with violations. [...] In Canada, intensive livestock operations are subject to provincial regulation, with definitions of regulated entities varying among provinces. Examples include Intensive Livestock Operations (Saskatchewan), Confined Feeding Operations (Alberta), Feedlots (British Columbia), High-density Permanent Outdoor Confinement Areas (Ontario) and Feedlots or Parcs d'Engraissement (Manitoba). In Canada, intensive animal production, like other agricultural sectors, is also subject to various other federal and provincial requirements.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} considers {{structures and}} practices of regulatory <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement,</b> and particularly the relevance and effects of purported “smarter inspections” methods, e. g. risk-based ones, and how they compare with previously existing practices. Specifically, it considers efficiency and effectiveness of inspections in terms of achieving public welfare, and their economic impact. The first part considers the history of regulatory inspections and how specific inspection institutions started to appear from the 19 th century onwards. Of particular interest is how path dependency resulted in important differences in structures and methods between different fields and countries, and how these in turn produced different effects for the public. The second part looks at existing research on the interconnected issues of regulatory compliance drivers, regulatory discretion and risk and regulation. It concludes {{to the importance of}} combining several compliance drivers to achieve better results, to the appropriateness of structuring discretion in <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement,</b> and to the adequacy of “risk” as an instrument to do so.

40|$|Abstract: This {{empirical}} study {{analyzes the}} effect of corporate environmental performance on financial performance in a transition economy. In particular, it assesses whether good environmental performance affects profits, and if so, in which direction. Then the study decomposes profits into revenues and costs {{in order to identify}} the channel(s) of any identified effect of environmental performance on profits. For example, as environmental performance improves, do revenues rise and costs fall so that profits increase? For this assessment, our study analyzes the links from environmental performance to revenues, costs, and profits using an unbalanced panel of Czech firms from the years 1996 to 1998. The empirical results indicate strongly and robustly that better environmental performance improves profitability by driving down costs more than it drives down revenues. The strong reduction in costs is consistent with the substantial regulatory scrutiny exerted by environmental agencies during the sample period in the forms of prevalent monitoring (i. e., <b>inspections)</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> and escalating emission charge rates...|$|E
40|$|Years of neglect, {{combined}} with the recent development of a "hands on" judicial policy {{have resulted in a}} jail crisis in America. States, recognizing their contribution to this situation, have begun to develop policies designed to assist local jail officials in operating safe, humane, and constitutional facilities. These state efforts are a form o f mandating, and primarily concern minimum operating standards and inspections programs. In this research we investigate three questions related to state mandating of local jail operations: (1) what is the extent of state involvement, (2) what factors are associated with state involvement, and (3) what is the impact of state involvement? Our findings indicate (1) states have been active in developing and administering jail mandates, (2) state involvement is associated with state-level corrections policy, and (3) jail standards and inspections programs have a substantial impact on local jail performance. We conclude with a discussion of how state and local governments may proceed {{in the process of developing}} standards, <b>inspections,</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> procedures.

Using an original survey, we collect data on facilities 2 ̆ 7 perceptions. We then compare responses to government interventions between facilities that perceive enforcement as effective and those that do not. For facilities perceiving enforcement as effective, increased deterrence of any type generates little gain.
