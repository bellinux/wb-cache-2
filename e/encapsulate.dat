A citizen named Kelly Larson (Will Forte) comes to Leslie's office and makes a passionate plea for the Twilight books to be included. When Leslie refuses because the books have no connection to Pawnee, Kelly handcuffs himself to a pipe in her office until she reconsiders. He is able to stay several days because he brought food, water and a pillow. During his stay, Kelly notices Tom (Aziz Ansari) appears sad, and correctly deduces Tom is having romantic issues; Tom's girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) has dumped him because Tom cannot get over the fact that his ex-wife, Wendy (Jama Williamson), is dating Ron (Nick Offerman). Kelly encourages Tom to read Twilight, to which he initially scoffs, but after reading them finds he loves the books.

40|$|Background. Encapsulation {{significantly}} prolongs islet graft {{survival in}} the absence of immunosuppression. However, <b>encapsulated</b> islet graft survival is limited to periods of several months. Part of the <b>encapsulated</b> islet graft is affected by a nonprogressive pericapsular overgrowth. To investigate whether macrophages on overgrown capsules affect neighboring nonovergrown <b>encapsulated</b> islets, <b>encapsulated</b> islets were studied during coculture. Materials and methods. <b>Encapsulated</b> islet function, islet vitality, and islet cell replication were assessed, as well as the mRNA expression of Bcl- 2, Bax, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 in <b>encapsulated</b> islets after 48 h of culture together with microcapsules with macrophage overgrowth. Overgrown capsules were retrieved from the rat peritoneum, three weeks after implantation of an <b>encapsulated</b> islet graft. Results. Coculture was associated with inhibition of the stimulated insulin secretion, with decreased cell replication, and with increased cell necrosis, but not with apoptosis of <b>encapsulated</b> islet cells. mRNA expression levels in <b>encapsulated</b> islets after coculture were not different from controls, except for a decrease in Bax mRNA. We found a high level of nitrite, as an indicator of nitric oxide production, but not an increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA in islets. This, in combination with the absence of increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 mRNA and the lack of apoptosis, indicates that neither interleukin- 1 beta, nor tumor necrosis factor-alpha was responsible for the deleterious effects of coculture on <b>encapsulated</b> islets. Conclusions. Nonovergrown <b>encapsulated</b> islets are affected by the overgrowth on <b>encapsulated</b> islets in their close proximity. This overgrowth contains macrophages that produce nitric oxide which, rather than cytokines, may be held responsible for the deleterious effect on the neighboring <b>encapsulated</b> islets.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the addition of commercial lipase in various forms on the acceleration of the ripening of UF-Feta cheese. Commercial lipase from Aspergillus niger was <b>encapsulated</b> by using silica composition based on Sol-Gel method. Lipase was then added to cheeses in three forms, namely, free lipase, <b>encapsulated</b> lipase, and <b>encapsulated</b> lipase with Arabic gum. Lipase was added to the retentate in the ratio of 4 g: 100 kg. The effects of free lipase, <b>encapsulated</b> lipase, and <b>encapsulated</b> lipase with Arabic gum on lipolysis, quantity of free water, bounded water, and chemical compounds were studied during the 60 days of ripening. Based on FTIR analysis, <b>encapsulated</b> lipases were completely released from the capsules during the first 15 days of ripening period. The greatest amount of lipolysis was detected in free lipase samples, compared to <b>encapsulated</b> and <b>encapsulated</b> with Arabic gum treatments. Thermal analysis of all treatments indicated that lipolysis could affect the free and bounded water content by decreasing both of them from the 15 th to 60 th days of ripening. The amount of salt, moisture, and fat changed during the first 15 days of ripening significantly (P< 0. 05). In comparison with free or <b>encapsulated</b> lipase, the <b>encapsulated</b> lipase with Arabic gum caused more changes in types of water and chemical compositions because the produced emulsions were uniform...|$|R

40|$|The aimed {{research}} {{was to examine the}} effect of used form and level green cincau leaves (Cycleabarbata L.

The materials used were 192 Day Old Chicks (DOC) of Lohman MB Platinum with average initial body weight of 37. 4 ± 2. 87 g, <b>encapsulated</b> or non <b>encapsulated</b> green cincau leaves (Cycleabarbata L.

The method in this experiment was in vivo experiment with Nested Completely Randomized Design with 2 form of green cincau leaves (Cycleabarbata L.

The result showed that green cincau leaves (Cycleabarbata L.
