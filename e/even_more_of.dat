On several occasions he expressed his favorable {{view of the}} quality of acting, and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the technical aspects of the Yiddish theater. In 1881, he obtained for the National Theater the costumes that had been used for a Yiddish pageant on the coronation of King Solomon, which had been timed in tribute to the actual coronation of Carol I of Romania.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at Marathon. In order {{to face the}} Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available hoplites; and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1. Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against. Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered. However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially {{had no need to}} seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, time worked in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer. Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle. Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E

25|$|The {{match at}} Chelmsford {{was made into}} <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a slog-effort by the English rain, as both sides were limited to 12 overs.

25|$|The Gaza Strip {{was chosen}} as another {{military}} objective because Israel wished to remove the training grounds for Fedayeen groups, and because Israel recognised that Egypt could use the territory as a staging ground for attacks against the advancing Israeli troops.

25|$|For the Unionist leaders, the Larne gun-running was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a {{political}} coup than a military feat. The Ulster Volunteers remained inadequately armed, as the weapons shipment contained {{three types of}} weapon and insufficient proper ammunition for them. Other historians consider that the Mauser 1898 model was advanced for its time, and the Larne delivery markedly increased the amount of arms for the UVF. Many much smaller weapons purchases had resulted in the UVF as having just over 37,000 rifles by June 1914.|$|E

This, of course, earned him the enmity of the leadership of his Leyden church that barred him from the Lord's Supper in retaliation.|$|E

25|$|The {{danger of}} {{overpricing}} {{is also an}} important consideration. If a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay, the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to sell shares. Even if they sell all of the issued shares, the stock may fall in value {{on the first day of}} trading. If so, the stock may lose its marketability and hence <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> its value. This could result in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the Facebook IPO in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the Inchoatia taxa are very disjunctly {{distributed}} means that attempting to discriminate species as against subspecies is <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a subjective opinion than usual, because reproductive isolation under natural conditions cannot be observed. An objective or a generally accepted method to weigh morphological differences does not exist. DNA analyses may be extremely helpful, but cannot always be considered decisive with regard to species or subspecies status. Molecular phylogeny reconstructions made clear that reproductive isolation and lineage splitting do not always run entirely parallel, resulting in paraphyletic species. In Inchoatia, with some island-like distributions of presumably high alpine taxa, this {{may also be the}} case.|$|E
