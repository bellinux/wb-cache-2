40|$|The {{process of}} RNA editing in chloroplasts and higher plant {{mitochondria}} displays some similarities, raising {{the question of}} common or similar components in <b>editing</b> <b>apparatus</b> of these two organelles. To investigate the ability of plant mitochondria to edit plastid transcripts, we employed a previously established mitochondrial maize and cauliflower in organello system. Two plastid genes, Zea mays ndhB and ycf 3 containing group II introns and several editing sites, were introduced into mitochondria. The genes were transcribed in organello. However, these transcripts of the plastid genes are neither spliced nor edited in plant mitochondria. A comparison of maize ndhB editing sites and maize mitochondrial editing sites reveals considerable sequence similarities between three ndhB editing sites and several mitochondrial sites. Nevertheless, these ndhB editing sites were not recognized in the mitochondria. Thus, we present {{for the first time}} direct evidence that the factors present in the plant mitochondria are not sufficient to allow editing and splicing of plastid transcripts...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of mitochondrial pre-mRNAs in kinetoplastid protozoa such as Trypanosoma, Leishmania, and Crithidia are substrates of a posttranscriptional processing reaction {{referred to as}} RNA editing. The process results in the insertion and, to a lesser extent, deletion of uridylates, thereby completing the informational content of the mRNAs. The specificity of the RNA editing reaction is provided by guide RNAs (gRNAs), which serve as templates for the <b>editing</b> <b>apparatus.</b> In addition, the process relies on mitochondrial proteins, presumably acting within a high-molecular-mass ribonucleoprotein complex. Although several enzymatic activities have been implicated in the editing process, no protein has been identified to date. Here we report the identification of a novel mitochondrial DEAD-box protein, which we termed mHel 61 p. Disruption of the mHEL 61 alleles in insect-stage Trypanosoma brucei cells resulted in a reduced growth rate phenotype. On a molecular level, the null mutant showed significantly reduced amounts of edited mRNAs, whereas never-edited and nuclear mRNAs were unaffected. Reexpression of mHel 61 p in the knockout cell line restored the ability to efficiently synthesize edited mRNAs. The results suggest an involvement of mHel 61 p in {{the control of the}} abundance of edited mRNAs and thus reveal a novel function for DEAD-box proteins...|$|E
40|$|Post-transcriptional C-to-U RNA editing {{occurs in}} plant plastid and {{mitochondrial}} transcripts. Mem-bers of the Arabidopsis RNA-editing factor interact-ing protein (RIP) family and ORRM 1 (Organelle RNA Recognition Motif-containing protein 1) have been recently characterized as essential {{components of the}} chloroplast RNA <b>editing</b> <b>apparatus.</b> ORRM 1 be-longs to a distinct clade of RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) -containing proteins, {{most of which are}} pre-dicted to be organelle-targeted. Here we report the identification of two proteins, ORRM 2 (organelle RRM protein 2) and ORRM 3 (organelle RRM protein 3), as the first members of the ORRM clade to be identified as mitochondrial editing factors. Transient silencing of ORRM 2 and ORRM 3 resulted in reduced editing efficiency at ∼ 6 % of the mitochondrial C targets. In addition to an RRM domain at the N terminus, ORRM 3 carries a glycine-rich domain at the C terminus. The N-terminal RRM domain by itself provides the edit-ing activity of ORRM 3. In yeast-two hybrid assays, ORRM 3 interacts with RIP 1, ORRM 2 and with itself. Transient silencing of ORRM 2 in the orrm 3 mutant further impairs the editing activity at sites controlled by both ORRM 2 and ORRM 3. Identification of the ef-fect of ORRM 2 and ORRM 3 on RNA editing reveals a previously undescribed role of RRM-containing pro-teins as mitochondrial RNA editing factors...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of detailed {{commentary on the}} first 201 lines of Catullus 64, together with an <b>edited</b> text and <b>apparatus</b> criticus. It represents about half a planned commentary on the whole poem, which will also include an introduction. The commentary begins by discussing the poem’s Argonautic opening, its use of allusion to negotiate generic relationships with epic and tragedy, and its exploration of narrative, pictorial and first-person ‘lyric’ modes. As the narrative jumps to Peleus’ wedding, the commentary examines the complicated moral signals about Roman luxury and the golden age sent by {{the description of the}} gleaming palace surrounded by abandoned fields. The transition to the description of Ariadne prompts an examination of how this ‘disobedient’ ecphrasis emphasises details that a picture could not literally convey, together with an analysis of the male narrator’s objectifying presentation of a woman in distress. The ecphrasis proper is then disrupted by a ‘flashback’ covering Ariadne’s first encounter with Theseus and his fight with the Minotaur: the commentary explores the ways in which shifting focalisation complicates the reader’s judgement of Theseus’ heroism. Finally, the thesis looks at Ariadne’s speech as an intertextual node, investigating the meanings generated by its relationships with other speeches from both earlier and later in Greek and Roman poetic traditions, and examining how each theme or topos is used in this particular situation both by the alluding poet and by Ariadne herself. More discursive notes introducing the various sections are interspersed with shorter lemmata considering textual, metrical, linguistic and cultural-historical issues as well as literary interpretation. The commentary aims both to open up the possibilities of meaning offered by individual words and phrases, and to advance critical understanding of key aspects of the whole poem, such as its narratorial voice, engagement with visuality and place in literary history.

40|$|Progressive {{multifocal}} leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a fatal {{demyelinating disease}} of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) caused by reactivation of the human polyomavirus JCV gene expression and its replication in oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells in the brain. Once a rare disease seen in patients with lymphotproliferative and myeloproliferative disorders, PML has been seen more frequently in HIV- 1 positive/AIDS patients as well as patients undergoing immunomodulatory therapy due for autoimmune disorders including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and others. As of now there is no cure for PML and in most cases disease progression leads to death within two years. Similar to other polyomaviruses, the JCV genome is small circular double stranded DNA that includes coding sequences for the viral early protein, T-antigen, which is critical for directing viral reactivation and lytic infection. Here, we employ a newly developed gene editing strategy, CRISPR/Cas 9, to introduce mutations in the viral genome and, by inactivating the gene encoding T-antigen, inhibit viral replication. We first used bioinformatics screening and identified several potential targets within the JCV T-antigen gene that can serve as sites for the creation of guide RNAs (gRNAs) for positioning the Cas 9 nuclease on the designated area of the viral genome for editing. Results from a series of integrated genetic and functional studies showed that transient or conditional expression of Cas 9 and gRNAs specifically targets the DNA sequences corresponding to the N-terminal region of T-antigen, and by introducing mutation, interferes with expression and function of of the viral protein, hence suppressing viral replication in permissive cells. Results from SURVEYOR assay revealed no off-target effects of the JCV-specific CRISPR/Cas 9 <b>editing</b> <b>apparatus.</b> These observations provide the first evidence for the employment of a gene editing strategy as a promising tool for the elimination of the JCV genome and a potential cure for PML...|$|E
