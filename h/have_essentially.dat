5|$|Warning signals do not {{necessarily}} require that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators. Mimics such as the nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous coral snake species, <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The evolution of a warning signal by a mimicking species that resembles a species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Though Ogbu's 1978 study's {{conclusion}} was widely discussed, a 2003 work also challenged its validity. In 2003, Karolyn Tyson, a sociologist, and William Darity, Jr., an economist, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, conducted an 18-month study at 11 North Carolina schools. The {{study concluded that}} white and black students <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> the same attitudes about scholastic achievement; students in both groups want to succeed in school and show higher levels of self-esteem when they do better in school. They compared attitudes identified as acting white to the normal adolescent pains experienced in John Hughes' movies.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps with {{magnetic}} ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable {{frequency of}} 100 or 120Hz and this flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity; they {{are listed as}} problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Newer fluorescent lights without magnetic ballasts <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> eliminated flicker.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, European {{settlers}} did {{not always}} adopt the nixtamalization process, except {{in the case of}} hominy grits, though maize became a staple among the poor of the southern states.

A more varied diet and fortification of wheat flour, the other staple food, <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> eliminated this deficiency.|$|E

The ponds are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north-south along the international border. The power plant on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).|$|E

25|$|Sickle-cell {{disease can}} be treated in mice. The mice – which <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> the same defect that causes human cases – used a viral vector to induce {{production}} of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which normally ceases to be produced shortly after birth. In humans, the use of hydroxyurea to stimulate the production of HbF temporarily alleviates sickle cell symptoms. The researchers demonstrated this treatment {{to be a more}} permanent means to increase therapeutic HbF production.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made {{significant}} changes in civil rights and governance. As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the US Supreme Court ruling in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> equal populations.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 it was {{reported}} that sickle-cell disease had been successfully treated in mice using gene therapy. The researchers used a viral vector to make the mice—which <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> the same defect that causes human sickle cell disease—express production of fetal haemoglobin (HbF), which an individual normally ceases to produce shortly after birth. In humans, using hydroxyurea to stimulate the production of HbF has been known to temporarily alleviate sickle cell disease symptoms. The researchers demonstrated that this gene therapy method is a more permanent way to increase therapeutic HbF production.|$|E

25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> replaced {{all previous}} receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Washington State Legislature {{ordered a}} $500,000 study to {{investigate}} the benefits of constructing the proposed Interstate 605 north to Everett through the Snoqualmie Valley. The plan was dropped as {{the study found that}} on average only five minutes would be saved over current routes. In 2002, Bellevue Square owner Kemper Freeman, Jr. made his support known for a new freeway linking Snohomish County via the Snoqualmie Valley. Another $500,000 study was ordered in 2003 by the legislature, creating a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County in the south to the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. Had either proposal been built, it would <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> replaced highway 203 with an interstate highway.|$|E
25|$|The NFL adopted {{some of the}} {{innovations}} introduced by the AFL immediately {{and a few others}} in the years following the merger. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks {{to keep track of the}} official game time, instead of just having a stopwatch used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, <b>have</b> <b>essentially</b> made today's professional football more like the AFL than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.|$|E
