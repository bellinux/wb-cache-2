25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{excavation}} was completed, the Western Australian Maritime Museum opened an exhibition {{pertaining to the}} Long Jetty {{in an effort to}} educate the public about its history. The publicity that was generated through the excavations, public education, and press articles were sufficient <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the designs of the marina wall so that it would miss the jetty piles, thereby protecting the remains of the Long Jetty from destruction. However, a small section of the jetty would still be affected.|$|E
25|$|One {{feature of}} a plant is its phyllotaxy. The {{arrangement}} of leaves on the plant body is such that the plant can maximally harvest light under the given constraints, and hence, one might expect the trait to be genetically robust. However, {{it may not be}} so. In maize, a mutation in only one gene called abphyl (abnormal phyllotaxy) was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the phyllotaxy of the leaves. It implies that sometimes, mutational tweaking of a single locus on the genome is enough to generate diversity. The abphyl gene was later on shown to encode a cytokinin response regulator protein.|$|E

25|$|The Soviets {{agreed to}} {{recognize}} the territory to Lithuania if it agreed to form a military alliance against Poland, which was engaged in the Kiev Offensive against the Soviet Russia. The Lithuanians were tempted by the opportunity to regain Vilnius, but refused. Even though the Soviets seemed a natural ally against Poland, Lithuanians reasoned that staying on good terms with Poland and its allies, France and Great Britain, was a better long-term strategy. Lithuania informed Britain about Soviet plans. They hoped {{such a move would}} prove Lithuania's trustworthiness and would put indirect pressure on Poland to reach an acceptable agreement in regards to Vilnius. These tactics did not prove successful, as Poland was invariably backed by France and indirect British pressure was not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> Poland's foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|Even when storyboards were made, {{scenes that}} were shot {{differed}} from them significantly. Krohn's extensive {{analysis of the}} production of Hitchcock classics like Notorious reveals that Hitchcock was flexible <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much, whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including Strangers on a Train and Topaz. While Hitchcock did do {{a great deal of}} preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Skelton's {{interest}} in film work was rekindled {{with the news}} that Neil Simon's comedy The Sunshine Boys would become a movie; his last significant film appearance had been in Public Pigeon No. 1 in 1956. He screen tested for the role of Willy Clark with Jack Benny, who had been cast as Al Lewis. [...] Although Simon had planned to cast Jack Albertson, who played Willy on Broadway, in the same role for the film, Skelton's screen test impressed him <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his mind. [...] Skelton declined the part, however, reportedly due to an inadequate financial offer, and Benny's final illness forced him to withdraw as well. George Burns and Walter Matthau ultimately starred in the film.|$|E

500|$|One of two secret {{characters}} in the 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie is a 16-year-old ninja and a thief who fights with oversized shuriken that she can throw like a boomerang. A fiercely patriotic daughter of , the leader of , a culture based on real-world East Asia, Yuffie feels her country has lost its former glory and become {{nothing more than a}} resort town. After losing the war against Shinra Electric Power Company, Godo began to turn Wutai into a tourist attraction. This did not suit Yuffie, who began running off, stealing the magical Materia from unaware travelers in hope to someday become strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> this situation. Sneaky and arrogant, Yuffie has a tomboyish and charismatic personality and obsessively steals and collects Materia. She also tends to be short-tempered and is prone to motion sickness. Gameplay-wise, Yuffie possesses the special Materia [...] "Throw", enabling her to throw almost any item from the player's inventory at enemies during combat, and when leveled up, the ability [...] "Coin" [...] becomes available, allowing her to throw the party's Gil currency at the enemy.|$|E

If the K-factor coefficient is set too large, there will be too much sensitivity to just a few, recent events, {{in terms of a}} large number of points exchanged in each game. Too low a K-value, and the sensitivity will be minimal, and the system will not respond quickly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in a player's actual level of performance.|$|R

2500|$|This corrupts {{the bottom}} of the screen and the entire right half of the maze with {{seemingly}} random symbols and tiles, overwriting the values of edible dots which makes it impossible to eat enough dots to beat the level. Because this effectively ends the game, this [...] "split-screen" [...] level is often referred to as the [...] "kill screen". There are 114 dots on the left half of the screen, nine dots on the right, and one bonus key, totaling 6,310 points. When all of the dots have been cleared, nothing happens. The game does not consider a level to be completed until 244 dots have been eaten. Each time a life is lost, the nine dots on the right half of the screen get reset and can be eaten again, resulting in an additional 90 points per extra man. In the best-case scenario (five extra men), 6,760 points will be the maximum score possible, but only 168 dots can be harvested, and that is not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> levels. Four of the nine dots on the right half of the screen are invisible, but can be heard when eaten. [...] Some dots are invisible but the rest can be seen, although some are a different color from normal. One method for safely clearing this round is to trap the ghosts. To trap the three important ghosts, the player must begin by going right until Pac-man reaches a blue letter 'N', and then he goes down. He keeps going down until he reaches a blue letter 'F' and then he goes right. He keeps going right until he reaches a yellow 'B', and then he goes down again. When executed properly, Pac-Man will hit an invisible wall almost immediately after the last turn is made. Eventually, the red ghost will get stuck. The pink ghost follows a few seconds later. The blue ghost will continue to move freely for several moments until the next scatter mode occurs. At that point, it will try to reach some location near the right edge of the screen and get stuck with the pink and red ghost instead. The orange ghost is the only one still on the loose, but he is no real threat since he runs to his corner whenever Pac-Man gets close so that it is easy to eat all the dots. Emulators and code analysis have revealed what would happen if this 256th level is cleared: the fruit and intermissions would restart at level 1 conditions, but the enemies would retain their higher speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the higher stages.|$|E
