5|$|In Pennsylvania, then-governor <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> {{allocated}} $1million {{in emergency}} {{aid for the}} disaster areas, and activated 600National Guardsmen to help with clean up. After nine water plants were closed, the companies relied on reserves to provide water supply to local residents while also encouraging cutting back on usage. About 2,900people in Washington County lost access to clean water.|$|E

In 1978, he {{was defeated}} in the primary for Governor of Pennsylvania by <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh.</b> After several years in private practice with the Philadelphia law firm Dechert, Price & Rhoads, Specter ran again for the U.S. Senate in 1980. This time, he won. He assumed office in January 1981.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} the turnpike in the Philadelphia area had become a {{congested}} commuter road by the 1980s. In 1983, funding was approved to widen the turnpike to six lanes between the Valley Forge and Philadelphia interchanges. This planned project was put on hold because of disagreements between Governor <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> and the turnpike commission members, and differences between the commissioners. The Pennsylvania Legislature approved the project in 1985; the road would be widened between the Norristown and Philadelphia interchanges. Construction on the widening began on March 10, 1986, and was completed on November 23, 1987 with a ribbon-cutting at the Philadelphia interchange. The widening project cost $120 million. An interchange to serve the New Cumberland Defense Depot near Harrisburg was planned in the 1980s. In 1992, the turnpike commission decided not to build it because it would instead build a connector road to the depot between PA 114 and Old York Road that would parallel the turnpike.|$|E

25|$|On March 28, 1979, Austin {{was one of}} a {{small group}} of {{freshman}} Democratic legislators who were invited to a budget breakfast briefing with Pennsylvania Governor <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> at the Governor's Mansion.

25|$|In October 1991 William P. Barr succeeded <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> as Attorney General. In November, Barr {{appointed}} retired {{federal judge}} Nicholas J.

In March 1993 he issued a 267-page report.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, public {{employees}} of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania overpaid {{millions of dollars in}} Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes. As a result, the state solicited bids from accounting firms to determine refunds for its employees. The contract was eventually awarded to Computer Technology Associates (CTA), a California-based firm, owned by John Torquato, Jr, a native of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Later Pennsylvania Governor <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> received an anonymous memo detailing allegations of bribery that took place during the bidding process for the $4.6 million contract.|$|E
5000|$|Wohlsen was {{appointed}} interim mayor in 1979 after Mayor Richard M. Scott resigned {{to serve as}} adjutant general of Pennsylvania. Wohlsen was a Republican, {{and was one of}} several candidates, including Scott, that the state Republican Party had compelled to join the political arena from the private world during the early 1970s and 1980s. Wohlsen's first challenge as mayor was dealing with a major snowstorm that struck the city during his first day in office. Only a few weeks into his mayoral term, the 100-ton Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station experienced a partial meltdown. Despite his experience in the construction business, Wohlsen acknowledged he did not know enough about nuclear power to appreciate the seriousness of the accident. Nobody from Governor <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh's</b> office attempted to communicate with Wohlsen or any Lancaster officials the day of the meltdown. Wohlsen considered and started to prepare the evacuation the city's 57,000 residents {{as a result of the}} meltdown, but ultimately did not. Other city officials encouraged him to order elderly residents of high-rises to travel to their families ahead of a general evacuation, but Wohlsen refused, concerned it would incite panic. Wohlsen himself declined to leave the city, claiming, [...] "I felt it was my responsibility to stay here and see what happened. To be the last one to leave the ship." ...|$|R

Kennedy Department of Justice Building, {{which is of}} a woman wearing a toga-like dress with one breast revealed, from view during speeches. The curtains were first used on a rental basis during the administration of <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh.</b> Justice officials long insisted that the curtains were put up to improve the room's use as a television backdrop and that Ashcroft {{had nothing to do}} with it. Ashcroft's successor, Alberto Gonzales, removed the curtains in June 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, United States Attorney General <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> {{resigned}} {{to run for}} a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, one made vacant by John Heinz's death in a helicopter crash. Rove's company worked for the campaign, but it ended with an upset loss to Democrat Harris Wofford. Rove subsequently sued Thornburgh alleging non-payment for services rendered. The Republican National Committee, worried that the suit would {{make it hard to}} recruit good candidates, urged Rove to back off. When Rove refused, the RNC hired Kenneth Starr to write an amicus brief on Thornburgh's behalf. After a trial in Austin, Rove prevailed. Karl Rove & Co. v. Thornburgh was heard by U.S. Federal Judge Sam Sparks (who had been appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991).|$|E
25|$|Doherty {{remained}} in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center {{and attempted to}} claim political asylum, and on 15 June 1988 the Attorney General Edwin Meese overturned an earlier ruling by the Federal Board of Immigration Appeals that Doherty could be deported to the Republic of Ireland, and ordered his deportation to Northern Ireland. In February 1989 new Attorney General <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> chose not to support the decision made by his predecessor, and asked lawyers for Doherty and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to submit arguments {{for a review of}} the decision and Doherty's claim for asylum. By this time Doherty's case was a cause célèbre with his sympathisers including over 130 Congressmen and a son of then President of the United States George H. W. Bush, and in 1990 a street corner near the Metropolitan Correctional Center was named after him.|$|E
25|$|After {{wrapping}} up the 1988 Republican nomination, Bush selected Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana {{as his running}} mate, surprising many who expected Bush to select a more experienced running mate. Quayle was often mocked for his verbal gaffes, and many Republicans urged Bush to dump Quayle from the ticket. Bush selected a mostly new Cabinet, but kept around many former Reagan officials, including Attorney General <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh.</b> Bush's long-time friend James Baker, who had served as Reagan's Chief of Staff, became Secretary of State. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had previously served as Gerald Ford's Chief of Staff and would later serve as vice president under George W. Bush. Bush's first pick for Defense Secretary, John Tower, {{was rejected by the}} Senate, becoming the first cabinet nominee of an incoming president to be rejected. Brent Scowcroft was appointed as the National Security Advisor, a role he had also held under Ford.|$|E
500|$|... {{there are}} five former U.S. {{governors}} of Pennsylvania who are currently living at this time, the oldest U.S. governor of Pennsylvania being <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> (served 1979–1987, born 1932). The most recent death of a former U.S. governor of Pennsylvania was that of William Scranton (served 1963–1967, born 1917), on July 28, 2013.

500|$|Although Kemp coaxed Bush {{to support}} a $4billion housing program that {{encouraged}} public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp's pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as {{did most of the}} Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh,</b> encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force. [...] However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp's new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber. The budget left him with $256million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.|$|E

2500|$|On March 28, 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, {{along the}} Susquehanna River located in Londonderry Township which is south of Harrisburg, {{suffered}} a partial meltdown. Although the meltdown was contained and radiation leakages were minimal, {{there were still}} worries that an evacuation would be necessary. Governor <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh,</b> {{on the advice of}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Joseph Hendrie, advised the evacuation [...] "of pregnant women and pre-school age children ... within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility."

2500|$|Facing Philadelphia's two {{consecutive}} term limit, Rizzo persuaded the Philadelphia City Council {{to place a}} charter change question {{on the ballot in}} 1978 that would have allowed him to run for a third consecutive term in 1979. In a record turnout for a Philadelphia municipal election, Philadelphians voted two to one against the change, blocking Rizzo from running in 1979. In that election, Republican gubernatorial candidate <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> won a larger-than-expected percentage of the black vote (for a Republican) and the governorship against a heavily favored Democratic opponent. The anti-charter change organization would soon support a [...] "Clean Sweep" [...] ticket for municipal offices in 1979, including former Rep. William J. Green, III, who was elected mayor.|$|E
2500|$|CBS and Dan Rather {{initially}} {{defended the}} documents and the report, but on September 20, 2004 – {{less than two months}} before Election Day, CBS News stated that it had been [...] "misled" [...] and that it could not authenticate {{the documents and}} should not have used them. A later 60 Minutes broadcast an interview with Marian Carr Knox, secretary to Killian at the time, who stated that she [...] "didn't type these memos", although she stated she had typed memos of similar content. CBS then formed an independent panel headed by former U.S. Attorney General <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh</b> and retired Associated Press president Louis D. Boccardi to investigate the story and the handling of the Killian memos. The final report of the panel, while not addressing the authenticity of the documents, faulted many of the decisions made in developing the story, and producer Mary Mapes along with [...] three others were forced to resign from CBS News.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 2012, a {{group of}} alumni and supporters, {{under the name of}} Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship, {{released}} a review of the Freeh Report that was critical of the Freeh Group's investigation and conclusions. On February 10, 2013 a report commissioned by the Paterno family was released by <b>Dick</b> <b>Thornburgh,</b> former United States Attorney General and former Governor of Pennsylvania, maintaining that the Freeh report was [...] "seriously flawed, both with respect to the process of [...] investigation and its findings related to Mr. Paterno". In response, Freeh called the Paterno family's report [...] "self-serving" [...] and said that it did not change the facts and findings of his initial investigation. On June 23, 2014, at Jerry Sandusky's pension forfeiture appeal, hearing arbiter Michael Bangs ruled Sandusky's pension should be reinstated and criticized the Freeh Report stating it [...] "was based on significant hearsay and was mostly ruled inadmissible (for the proceedings), (but) was admitted in part to show it had found Sandusky had received 71 separate payments from Penn State between 2000 and 2008". Later in a footnote Bangs states [...] "The terrifically significant disparity between the finding in the Freeh report and the actual truth is disturbing. While the Freeh report found that Penn State had made 71 separate payments to (Sandusky) between 2000-2008, they were off by almost 85 percent, as the correct number was six separate payments". Bangs {{goes on to say that}} the error [...] "calls into question the accuracy and veracity of the entire report".|$|E
