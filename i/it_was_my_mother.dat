2500|$|His use of {{corrugated}} steel, {{chain link}} fencing, unpainted plywood and other utilitarian or [...] "everyday" [...] materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather's hardware store. He would spend time drawing with his father, {{while his mother}} {{introduced him to the}} world of art. [...] "So the creative genes were there", Gehry says.

60|$|I {{passed on}} to the gate and stooped down. I lifted the heavy head, put the long dank hair aside, and turned the face. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> cold and dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe I {{was asleep}} at that time, and dreaming about something, though I don't {{remember}} what it was. I started up and reached {{out as far as}} I could over the boot, and looked down. I found <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> calling to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I {{speak it}} charmingly?" [...] She laughed prettily. [...] "Well, the {{explanation}} <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> tongue. She <b>was</b> Irish, you must know." ...|$|R
60|$|VERA. Will you {{let these}} men sit down if I give you this? (Takes off her peasant's necklace.) <b>It</b> <b>is</b> all I have; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said I; [...] "it isn't {{that line}} that I <b>am</b> looking up. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's.</b> Her name <b>was</b> Dork {{before she was}} married." ...|$|R
60|$|And when Mrs. Teidelmann returned, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> who was {{the first}} to call upon her; before even my father knew that she was back. And from thence onward one might have thought them the closest of friends, my mother visiting her often, {{speaking}} of her to all in terms of praise and liking.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{old enough}} and {{strong enough to}} load and fire a pistol, Father; and I heard {{one of the men}} say we would need all the hands on board, and more if we had them; besides, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> who told me what was going on, and sent me on deck to help you to fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly I started. I {{was quick}} at hearing, and I had {{distinctly}} caught {{the sound of}} a light, firm step passing down the garden path beneath. My first impulse was to call out, but I checked it when I recognised the tall, graceful figure moving swiftly along the gravel walk {{in the shade of the}} yew-hedge. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's.</b> A pencil-writing, on a {{crushed and}} torn piece of paper, blotted with wet. Folded roughly like a letter, and {{directed}} {{to me at}} my guardian's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say {{no more of}} this, Eve; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{unpleasant}} to me. I {{hate the}} name of Assheton, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's,</b> and could wish never to hear it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I {{ever tell}} you that this <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> hair? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> hair,--and she <b>was</b> the only one that ever loved me; except poor old Mammy, nobody else loves me,--nobody ever will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ay, that's them,' he said, 'they were richt neat mended. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> 'at glued them. I mind o' her makkin' the glue, an' warnin' me an' {{my father}} no {{to sit on}} them. There was the clock too, an' the stool 'at my mother got oot an' into her bed wi', an' the basket 'at Leeby carried when she gaed the errands. The straw was aff the handle, an' my father mended it wi' strings.' ...|$|E
60|$|Here, however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> who {{was most}} reasonable, and knew best how to act. She {{said that it}} was true that as this was my house, and the charge of M. d'Aubepine had been {{committed}} to me, I had every right to be offended; but as she was the eldest lady in the house it was suitable for her to act. She wrote a billet to him demanding a personal interview with him that he might explain the insinuations which concerned the honour of herself, her son, and her daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no; he may {{say that}} he does not want any more {{servants}} in the house, but I am sure that when he sees her he will be pleased to have such a companion for Mysa. If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> I do not know. Most likely she would say no; but when she hears that it has all been settled, she will not trouble {{one way or the other}} about it. I will write my father a letter telling him all about it, and send off one of the slaves with it at once. He can get back to-morrow, and it will gladden the old man's heart to know that it is all arranged. I wish to tell my father, too, of my trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mayhap, mayhap; {{when one}} lives long one forgets. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> mother who told me; surely {{her name was}} Gagool also. But mark, ye will find {{in the place where}} the bright things are a bag of hide full of stones. The man filled that bag, but he never took it away. Evil befell him, I say, evil befell him! Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> mother who told me. <b>It</b> will <b>be</b> a merry journey--we can see the bodies of those who died in the battle as we go. Their eyes will be gone by now, and their ribs will be hollow. Ha! ha! ha!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} this little ring fastened to <b>my</b> watch-chain? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's,</b> and <b>is</b> {{too small to}} pass the joint of my little finger. You have many a time sportively purloined it. It fitted your fore-finger. Try now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well,’ said I, ‘I do {{not call}} myself all that; but I have a right to, if I chose. In the {{meanwhile}} I call myself plain Champdivers, at your disposal. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother’s</b> name, and good to go soldiering with.’ ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> I {{could not}} at first believe. She wore a plain dark dress, with a black lace kerchief about her neck; but a dress, simple though it was, of a style and {{material}} unlike any that I had ever before seen her wear. Although I knew nothing of her history, I had always suspected that she was of a very different station from my father's, {{and at that moment}} I knew it, for it seemed as though she had, of a sudden, made up her mind to assume her proper position. Not only were her dress and the fashion of arranging her hair unusual, but her manners, her voice, her whole bearing and appearance were utterly changed. It was as though she had, without the slightest warning, dropped the mask of long years, and stepped back, like a flash, into the personality which belonged to her.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and Edie who {{had come}} into the kitchen. He had not seen them the night before, but now it was all I could do to keep my face as I watched him; for instead of our homely Scottish nod, he bent up his back like a louping trout, and slid his foot, and clapped his hand over his heart in the queerest way. My mother stared, for she thought he was making fun of her; but Cousin Edie fell into it in an instant, {{as though it had been}} a game, and away she went in a great curtsy until I thought she would have had to give it up, and sit down right there in the middle of the kitchen floor. But no, she up again as light as a piece of fluff, and we all drew up our stools and started on the scones and milk and porridge.|$|E
60|$|These were {{therefore}} difficulties insurmountable, and such as I knew not {{what to do}} in. I had such strong impressions on my mind about discovering myself to my brother, formerly my husband, that I could not withstand them; and the rather, because it ran constantly in my thoughts, that if I {{did not do it}} while he lived, I might in vain endeavour to convince my son afterward that I was really the same person, and that I was his mother, and so might both lose the assistance and comfort of the relation, and the benefit of whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had left me; and yet, on the other hand, I could never think it proper to discover myself to them in the circumstances I was in, as well relating to the having a husband with me as to my being brought over by a legal transportation as a criminal; on both which accounts it was absolutely necessary to me to remove from the place where I was, and come again to him, as from another place and in another figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Maybe,' says she; 'that's what I mean to find out. And if you'll do me a kindness,' she adds, 'you won't mind {{calling me}} Marie Luthier for the future, instead of Godselle. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> name, and I've a fancy for it.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{used to tell}} me a {{good deal}} about her father, who must have been a {{wonderful}} man in many ways. What she told me was not like a sketch of his life, which I wish <b>it</b> had <b>been,</b> but mostly anecdotes of what he said and did. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> ancestral tree I determined to find, and without saying whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> on <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> or father's side I was searching for ancestors, I told Mr. Brandish that Dork was the family name.|$|R
6000|$|... "I like Anne. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> name. Old-fashioned {{names are}} the best and sweetest in my opinion. If you're going to get tea you might send the young doctor to talk to me. He's been lying on the sofa in that office ever since I came, {{laughing}} fit to kill over what I've been saying." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{learned to}} make solely from working with my mother … <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> who was very keen for us to work {{together}} and this has been the important cultural lesson I learnt from her - teaching respect for one another.|$|E

5000|$|After {{graduating from}} Idaho State University in 1969 with a bachelor's degree and then {{spending}} {{two years as}} a Peace Corps volunteer in Kenya, Spanbauer married and returned to Idaho where he obtained a job at his alma mater as a counselor and advisor to the student Indian Club. He met and became involved with Clyde Hall, a two-spirit (and later a tribal elder) Shoshone-Métis. [...] Three months later, the two became blood brothers. Hall had a deep influence on Spanbauer that directly led to the writing of The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon: ...Clyde Hall put my feet on the ground, and when I looked at the ground I saw that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> Clyde helped {{me to see the}} world was alive and full of mystery. He pretty much took me out of my Christian European culture head and helped me see that I wasn’t separated from nature. That by stepping into my body, I stepped into nature. ... The thing I want to impress on you the most, is my life and his came together {{in such a way that}} kind of blew us both out of the water. Speaking for myself, I could never have written The Man Who Fell In Love With The Moon without Clyde, or any of the rest of my books.|$|E
6000|$|When Minnie rose to go, I {{took her}} hand once more in mine. As I did so, I started. Something about it seemed strangely familiar. I looked at it close with a keen glance. Why, this <b>was</b> curious! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> Aunt Emma's hand: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> hand: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the hand in <b>my</b> mental Picture: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the hand of the}} murderer! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your pardon, master," [...] said Martin. [...] "I know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> careless; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{always told}} me that I was careless, but so <b>was</b> <b>my</b> father before me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you mean," [...] he said; [...] "and if <b>it</b> did--But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> neglect; there <b>is</b> the {{bitterness}} of it. Why, you and my father tried to stir her up {{to it in the}} spring, and she would not; and then, when for very shame she must attend, what does she do but let me go muddling on with that old woman Wells! She has regularly thrown my sight away, as much as if she had pulled my eyes out and thrown them over the hedge." ...|$|R
5000|$|Disjunctive {{cognition}} is {{a common}} phenomenon in dreams, first identified by psychoanalyst Mark Blechner, in which two aspects of cognition do not match each other. The dreamer {{is aware of the}} disjunction, yet that does not prevent it from remaining. The most frequent disjunction is between appearance and identity, such as [...] "I knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> even though it didn't look like her."The dreamer recognizes a character's identity, even though the appearance does not match the identity. Such dreams are usually not experienced as bizarre, despite the fact that such a statement in waking life would be considered psychotic. In waking life, most people would assume that they misidentified the person and correct for it, but not in dreams.Disjunctive cognition can also involve time perception. It is quite common to dream that as an adult, one goes back to a time and place of one's childhood. In this case, the perceived age of the dreamer is disjunctive with the setting of the dream. It is much less common to perceive the opposite: dreaming of oneself as a child, where the time and place are that of one's adulthood. However, it is common to dream of other people whom one knew at an earlier age appearing in the present. This is especially frequent in the dreams of people who have lost close relatives. For example, Aharon Appelfeld reported: [...] "I dreamed about my parents. They had not aged since we were together sixty-three years ago in Prague, and their faces expressed amazement that I had grown older. We were briefly united in mutual astonishment, and I knew that I had something important to tell them. But, as in every profound dream, I could not get the words out." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{was born}} in Petersburg (Leningrad) on 19 th January 1912. My father, Vitalij Kantorovich, died in 1922 and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> Paulina (Saks), who brought me up.

I imagined them all gathered like ancient Roman astrologers staking out their claims about space. About stars. But instead of a star, it was my brain up on the screen. Its gray folds, tight around a mass sitting square {{in the middle of my}} brain. Perfectly spherical [...] ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish {{to go up}} {{with the}} Nile expedition, sir. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> wish, also, that I should do so. <b>My</b> main object <b>is</b> to {{endeavour}} to obtain particulars of my father's death, and to assure myself {{that he was one}} of those who fell at El Obeid. I do not care in what capacity I go up; but as I speak Arabic and Soudanese, as well as English, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> thought that I might get employment as interpreter, either under an officer engaged on making the railway, or in some capacity under an officer in one of the Egyptian regiments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, Uncle, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> rather <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> idea than <b>my</b> own; {{she thought}} that it might conduce to my advancement, should I ever leave the hold and {{go out into the}} world." ...|$|R
