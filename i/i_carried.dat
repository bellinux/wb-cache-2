5|$|Late Medieval {{religion}} had {{its political}} aspects. Robert <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> the brecbennoch (or Monymusk reliquary), {{said to contain}} the remains of St. Columba, into battle at Bannockburn. In the Papal Schism (1378–1417), the Scottish church and crown sided with the Avignon Popes, beginning with Clement VII, along with France and other countries, while nations including England and the Holy Roman Empire sided with the Roman popes beginning with Urban VI. In 1383, Clement VII appointed Scotland's first cardinal, Walter Wardlaw, Bishop of Glasgow. The withdrawal of France from support of Clement's successor Benedict XIII created problems for Scottish clergy attending French universities and necessitated the creation of Scotland's first university at St. Andrews from 1411–13. Scotland {{was one of the}} last churches to abandon Benedict in favour of the compromise pope, Martin V, proposed by the Council of Constance (1414–28). In the subsequent debates over Conciliarism and the authority of the pope, between those who backed the church council as the ultimate authority in the Church, and those that backed the papacy, divisions in loyalty mirrored political divisions in the country and Church. King James I and his chancellor John Cameron, Archbishop of Glasgow, became conciliarists and William Croyser, Archdeacon of Teviotdale, the leading opponent of Cameron, became a papalist. After his accession, James II backed the Pope, while the Douglases, who had dominated politics in the years after James I's death, backed the conciliar movement.|$|E

Unlike smaller missile boats, both carry SA-N-4 ("Gecko") SAMs for self-defence. The original Nanuchka <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> a twin 57mm AK-257 main gun, {{replaced by a}} 76mm AK-176 in the Nanuchka III. The latter also has a rotary 30mm AK-630 point-defence gun to bolster its protection against missile attack. Currently Project 12341 ships are receiving BAGIRA Fire Control System turning them into multirole vessels.|$|E
25|$|The Armenian {{national}} movement, besides {{its individual}} heroes, was an organized activity represented around three parties of Armenian people, Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, Armenakan and Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which ARF {{was the largest}} and most influential among the three. Those Armenians who did not support national liberation aspirations or who were neutral were called chezoks. In 1839, the situation of the Ottoman Armenians slightly improved after Abdul Mejid <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> out Tanzimat reforms in its territories. However, later Sultans, such as Abdul Hamid II stopped the reforms and carried out massacres, now known as the Hamidian massacres of 1895–96 leading to a failed Armenian attempt to assassinate him.|$|E

25|$|The {{primitive}} southern Negro, as he sang, {{was sure}} to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, {{it was always the}} same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major..., and <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> this device into my melody as well... This was a distinct departure, but as it turned out, it touched the spot.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the US Ambassador to the UN at the time, wrote later in his memoirs: [...] "The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly {{ineffective}} in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> it forward with no inconsiderable success." ...|$|E

The eight [...] Model 1877 35-caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts. Four were fitted between the 9-inch guns and could traverse a total of 100°. The others were mounted {{at each end of the}} ship where they could fire directly ahead or astern. The ten [...] Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in hull embrasures of the ship, between the nine and six-inch guns to defend against torpedo boats.

She began an affair with Wilfred Smith, Parsons' mentor in the O.T.O. and had a son in 1943 who bore Parsons' surname but who was almost certainly fathered by Smith. Northrup also became pregnant but had an abortion on April 1, 1943, arranged by Parsons and carried out by Dr. Zachary Taylor Malaby, a prominent Pasadena doctor and Democratic politician.|$|E

500|$|In September 1954, {{he heard}} his minutes would be slashed, and after the second {{exhibition}} game, Pollard retired from the Eagles. As he was under contract, Pollard was threatened with legal action from General Manager Vince McNally. He avoided the legal tangle by never officially signing with another team again, thus voiding the reserve clause on his contract. Pollard explained his rationale in a 1954 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "I just got fed up... I knew they wouldn't give me {{much of a chance}} to play... <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> the ball only 23 times in 12 games last year, so something had to be wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two pairs of 12-inch Model 1895 40-caliber guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. These guns had a maximum elevation of 35° and could depress to -5°. 80 rounds per gun were carried and they could fire one round per minute. Eight of the fourteen [...] Model 1905 50-caliber guns were mounted in four twin-gun turret {{at the corners of}} the superstructure while six were mounted in casemates in the superstructure. For defense against torpedo boats, Imperator Pavel <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> twelve [...] guns mounted in casemates above the 8-inch guns in the superstructure. Two underwater [...] torpedo tubes were mounted, one on each side, and they were provided with six spare torpedoes.|$|E
500|$|The police {{inspectors}} questioned Feletti, {{but each}} time they asked about {{anything to do with}} Mortara or his removal the monk said that a sacred oath precluded his discussing affairs of the Holy Office. When Curletti ordered him to hand over all files relating to the Mortara case, Feletti said that they had been burned—when asked when or how, he repeated that on Holy Office matters he could say nothing. Pressed further, Feletti said: [...] "As far as the activities that <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> out as Inquisitor of the Holy Office of Bologna, I am obliged to explain myself to one forum only, to the Supreme Sacred Congregation in Rome, whose Prefect is His Holiness Pope Pius IX, and to no-one else." [...] After the police searched the convent for documents relating to the Mortara case—they found nothing—the inquisitor was escorted to prison. The news that Feletti had been arrested caused the press storm surrounding Mortara, which had died down somewhat, to flare up again across Europe.|$|E

500|$|He {{recalled}} later: [...] "He {{positioned himself}} {{off to one}} side of-and some distance away from-the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. 'Do you see how it's done?', Oberst Mölders' voice came over the R/T. 'Right, now you take the next one.' <b>I</b> <b>carried</b> out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. 'And again!' It was like being on a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!" [...] In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Soviet aircraft was never officially credited to him. Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.|$|E
