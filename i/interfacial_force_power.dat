40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} unique {{experimental}} configuration {{that allows us}} to determine the <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> on nearly parallel plates made from the thinnest possible mechanical structures, single and few layer graphene membranes. Our approach consists of using a pressure difference across a graphene membrane to bring the membrane to within ∼ 10 − 20 nm above a circular post covered with SiOx or Au until a critical point is reached whereby the membrane snaps into adhesive contact with the post. Continuous measurements of the deforming membrane with an AFM coupled with a theoretical model allow us to deduce the magnitude of the <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> between graphene and SiOx and graphene and Au. The nature of the <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> at ∼ 10 − 20 nm separation is consistent with an inverse fourth power distance dependence, implying that the <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> are dominated by van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, the strength of the interactions is found to increase linearly with the number of graphene layers. The experimental approach can be used to measure the strength of the <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> for other atomically thin two-dimensional materials and help guide the development of nanomechanical devices such as switches, resonators, and sensors...|$|R

Through comparing the predicted bubble velocity and void fraction profiles against the experimental data, the classic two-fluid model, {{which has been}} widely validated for two-phase flows of pure liquids, {{was found to be}} inapplicable to those of nanofluids because of the empirical nature of the <b>interfacial</b> <b>force</b> formulation.

Because of the nanoparticle layer, bubbles submerged in nanofluids would partially behave like a rigid sphere and develop a rotation movement. A slanted wake could be induced behind the bubble, generating a lateral Magnus force pointing towards the pipe centre and consequently making the positive-to-negative reversion of lift force occur at a smaller bubble diameter. Meanwhile, the slanted wake would also make bubbles in the viscous regime experience a drag force similar to that in the distorted regime, which makes the viscous-to-distorted transition point occur at a smaller bubble Reynolds number. It was recommended that the most important task when modelling bubbly flows of nanofluids using the two-fluid model is to reformulate the <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> accounting for the effects of nanoparticle adsorption...|$|R

At first, we developed large arrays of 3 -terminal graphene NEMS switches with a novel design, which help the devices to achieve low actuation voltages (down to ~ 3 V), improved reliability and mechanical integrity. These switches may find applications in mechanical computing, data storage, and RF communication, and the design can be used for other 2 D materials based NEMS switches. We also studied the electromechanical properties of the devices. A study of the threshold switching voltages is carried out, and the switching voltage is simulated with a finite element model which includes nonlinear mechanics. From this we deduce a scaling relation between the switching voltage and device dimensions. Next, we present a unique nanomechanical configuration that allows us to determine the <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> between graphene and Au/SiO 2.

To use component-scale ensemble-averaged Eulerian-Eulerian CFD multiple additional closure models are required to define the interactions between bubble-liquid and bubble–bubble interfaces, and the choice of these models inevitably affects the predictions. This thesis reports investigations into these closure models, focusing mainly on the <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> for modeling two-phase adiabatic and subcooled boiling flows, and the effects that they have upon the predictions of the flow, with the objective of attempting to identify so far as possible a "best combination". Detailed CFD investigations on adiabatic and boiling upward two-phase flows in a simple vertical pipe geometry, using the ensemble average Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid framework of the commercial CFD code STAR-CCM+, with various <b>interfacial</b> <b>force</b> models, are reported. This is done for both adiabatic and subcooled boiling flows. One of the main findings of these studies was the model inadequacies associated with the non-drag <b>interfacial</b> <b>forces</b> that are primarily responsible for the lateral void distributions. Among the <b>interfacial</b> <b>force</b> models investigated for adiabatic cases, the use of the Ishii and Zuber (1979) drag coefficient, the Behzadi et al. (2004) lift coefficient and the Antal et al. (1991) wall lubrication force model combination gives the best predictions for all the primitive variables considered. However, the need for a more appropriate model for the lift force coefficient, along with a matched/paired model for the wall lift/lubrication force, is identified. For the subcooled boiling investigation, a negative lift coefficient (- 0. 1) in conjunction with the default turbulent dispersion and wall lubrication force models predicted a reasonably accurate axial void distribution, as well as an acceptable velocity profile for both phases, and this is identified as the “best combination”. In addition, many other shortcomings regarding the closures related to the two-fluid framework have been identified and are discussed. Finally, the ‘best combination’ of models has been used successfully to simulate the boiling heat transfer on a single tube under cross-flow, which is a novel application of the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid approach in conjunction with the WHFP approach on such flow geometry.

40|$|To {{understand}} how thermocapillary forces manipulate the droplet motion in a confined microchannel, a lattice Boltzmann phase-field model is developed to simulate immiscible thermocapillary flows with consideration of fluid–surface interactions. Based on our recent work of Liu et al., 2013 [54], an <b>interfacial</b> <b>force</b> of potential form is proposed {{to model the}} <b>interfacial</b> tension <b>force</b> and the Marangoni stress. As only the first-order derivatives are involved, the proposed <b>interfacial</b> <b>force</b> is easily combined with the wetting boundary condition to account for fluid–surface interactions. The hydrodynamic equations are solved using a multiple-relaxation-time algorithm with the <b>interfacial</b> <b>force</b> treated as a forcing term, while an additional convection–diffusion equation is solved by a passive-scalar approach to obtain the temperature field, which is coupled to the interfacial tension by an equation of state. The model is first validated against analytical solutions for the thermocapillary-driven convection in two superimposed fluids at negligibly small Reynolds and Marangoni numbers. It is then demonstrated to produce the correct equilibrium contact angle for a binary fluid with different viscosities when a constant interfacial tension is taken into account. Finally, we numerically simulate the thermocapillary flows for a microfluidic droplet adhering on a solid wall and subject to a simple shear flow when a laser is applied to locally heat the fluids, and investigate the influence of contact angle and fluid viscosity ratio on the droplet dynamical behavior. The droplet motion can be completely blocked provided that the contact angle exceeds a threshold value, below which the droplet motion successively undergoes four stages: constant velocity, deceleration, acceleration, and approximately constant velocity. When the droplet motion is completely blocked, three steady vortices are clearly visible, and the droplet is fully filled by two counter-rotating vortices with the smaller one close to the external vortex. The thermocapillary convection is strengthened with decreasing viscosity ratio of the droplet to the carrier fluid. For low viscosity ratios, the droplet motion is completely blocked and exhibits the similar behavior, but {{the structure of the}} internal vortices is more complicated at the lowest viscosity ratio. For high viscosity ratios, the droplet motion is partially blocked and undergoes a series of complex transitions, which can be explained {{as a result of the}} dynamically varying Marangoni forces...|$|R
