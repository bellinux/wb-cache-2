40|$|Previous {{studies have}} mainly focused on {{homework}} in courses such as math and physics with {{little attention to}} homework in EFL (English as a foreign language) classes. The main {{purpose of the study}} reported in this paper was to give a voice to both <b>EFL</b> teachers and <b>learners</b> with regard to English homework. To this end, 8 EFL teachers and 19 <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> took part in a semi-structured interview first. Then, based on their responses to the interview questions and a comprehensive review of the literature, a questionnaire was developed and validated to investigate EFL learners’ and teachers’ perspectives on different aspects of English homework. The questionnaire was finally completed by 283 <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> and 46 English teachers from two famous English institutions in Iran. Results revealed that English homework can <b>help</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> with their language learning apart from enabling them to improve their reading, writing, vocabulary, and grammar. However, the homework assignments that are currently being used are not very interesting and do not <b>help</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> improve all their English skills. The majority of <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> usually finish their homework in a hurry just before class begins; others do not spend the time that their teachers require them to spend on doing homework. English teachers should, therefore, design homework based on their students’ needs and interests as well as resort to employing modern opportunities such as online resources and self-access centers...|$|R

40|$|The {{linguistic}} term "inchoative" is {{far from}} clear. Some scholars use the term synonymously with "inceptive" and "ingressive" referring to an aspectual form which expresses the commence of a state or activity. However, inchoative has also been used in another sense by grammarians, synonymously with "ergative" or "middle" as a verb expressing a change of state.   In the second sense, inchoative is more a voice in contrast with active and passive than an aspect. While the contrast between passive and inchoative {{plays an important role}} in language teaching and language learning, it has been neglected in almost all grammar textbooks. Furthermore, in the Persian language, certain sentences are ambiguous between inchoative and passive. This has resulted in the formation of some erroneous English sentences, by Iranian <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> This study, scrutinizing the inchoative voice in English and Persian, aims to show the relationship between, active, passive and inchoative to <b>help</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> differentiate the three voices...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this mixed method {{research}} study is to investigate the educational effects of digital storytelling as a communicative language learning strategy in an EFL elementary school class in Korea. In order {{to find out the}} benefits and challenges of digital storytelling in EFL class, this study was conducted for 12 weeks in a rural elementary school. Digital storytelling was selected and utilized in the after-school English class, as main teaching and learning tool. Guiding research questions were 1) what are the potential benefits and challenges of digital storytelling for young <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> <b>when</b> it is employed in a rural context as a language learning activity? i. e.) the change of motivation, reading, writing, listening, speaking ability, and 2) What does the English teacher find to be benefits and challenges of using a digital storytelling as pedagogical strategies in Korean EFL classroom?. In order to answer those questions, a survey questionnaire on students’ learning attitude was distributed, and pre- and post-test were employed to investigate the difference in terms of the ability of reading, writing, listening and speaking over time. In addition, student’s reflective self-evaluation log, teacher’s lecture report, classroom observation and in/formal interviews with focal students and the teacher were also collected to figure out the factors which gave an influence to students and the teacher. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed based on the characteristics of each data set. The quantitative data results indicated that students show overall improvement in academic performance in terms of reading, writing, listening and speaking. In addition to English proficiency, the learning attitude and motivation toward English learning was elevated, followed by the increase of their critical, creative thinking, and digital literacy skills. The other results of qualitative data highlighted that the English teacher and students were satisfied with the learning experience with digital storytelling in that it {{played a key role in}} motivating the learning process and was an effective tool for active learning. To sum up, it seems clear that the digital storytelling activity, as integrated instructional strategy has the potential to shed light on <b>helping</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> in a rural school to develop English skills as well as to change their learning attitude toward studying English. In addition, digital storytelling also increased skills other than academic skills related to learning English, and it also helped to improve students’ communicative ability, encouraging their collaboration, motivation and creativity to be heightened...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{practice}} of using a second/foreign language to teach non-language content subjects (e. g., science) has become increasingly popular, especially in English-as-foreign-language (EFL) contexts. Such a practice can be categorised as ‘Content and Language Integrated Learning’ (CLIL). However, <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> may encounter difficulties in accessing content knowledge through English, {{especially with regard to}} the subject-specific academic literacy. Hence, content subject teachers may need to provide more scaffolding to <b>help</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> in CLIL bridge the gap between everyday language and academic literacy. A genre-based approach, which emphasises contextualised language learning and use, serves as a useful framework to integrate content and language teaching in CLIL. This chapter shares an example of how university language specialists collaborated with science teachers in one secondary school in Hong Kong, where CLIL is practiced. Drawing insights from the genre-based approach, the university-school collaborative team designed and tried out a set of materials to help grade 8 students write a piece of sequential explanation text.

The aim {{of the current study}} thus was investigating Iranian EFL learners’ listening self-efficacy and its relationship with their metacognitive awareness of listening strategies. Three hundred and seventy-one high-school students participated in the study. They filled in English listening self-efficacy questionnaire (Renzhi, 2012) and Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire (Vandergrift et al., 2006). Both questionnaires were administered along with a listening proficiency test (Preliminary English Test, 2010). The results revealed a positive and significant relationship between listening self-efficacy and metacognitive awareness of listening strategies in general. Further, listening self-efficacy was found to be significantly and positively related to planning-evaluation and problem solving strategies and inversely to mental translation strategies. As higher self-efficacy brings about more control over listening tasks and guarantees successful strategy use, particular attention should be devoted to the role of this construct in listening instruction research and practice...|$|R
40|$|The idea {{to teach}} {{critical}} reading through literary texts {{comes from the}} analogy that language and literary works are like two sides of a coin.

This study defines it as an activity (performance or presentation) done by individual students {{in front of their}} CL peers to complete a learning task. The study took place in Indonesian secondary school EFL classrooms. Among the questions explored was: How does individual accountability in CL <b>help</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> learn the target language? To address the question, qualitative case study was employed. Data were collected through participant observations, in-depth interviewing, and document analysis. To guide data collection and analysis, constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) was used. Four levels of individual accountability in CL were identified: 1) individual accountability in pairs, 2) in home groups, 3) in other groups, and 4) to the whole class. Peer interaction usually takes place between two levels of individual accountability and an initial or lower level of individual accountability usually prepares <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> for a higher level of individual accountability. A performance or presentation of individual accountability in CL is carried out either in spoken or written mode. In the studied classrooms, these activities of individual accountability in CL promoted the EFL learners‘ production of spoken English. This role of individual accountability in CL helped meet the need of the <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> because, as they reported, speaking was the most challenging language skill to learn.

40|$|Where {{teachers}} of English {{as a foreign}} language (EFL) once observed a paucity of authentic language input, public displays of written English are now proliferating. Ideas for capitalising on this abundance {{can be drawn from}} two strands of pedagogic thought: a psycholinguistic approach to conventional literacy long established in foreign, second and first language education (e. g., Teng, 2009), and a more recent and critical approach informed by diverse theoretical understandings of the ‘linguistic landscape’ (e. g., Rowland, 2013). In this paper I draw from these two approaches to suggest ways of <b>helping</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> use environmental print to develop knowledge and skills required of English readers in the twenty-first century: (1) fluency in breaking the codes of English and other languages of publicly displayed text; (2) facility with making meaning as the English of these texts becomes ever more diverse in cultural, historical and contextual implication; (3) use of environmental English in contexts that range from the local to the transnational; and (4) critique of the presence of English and attendant worldviews in the urban environment (Chern & Dooley, forthcoming). The psychological concept of motivation and the complementary sociological concept of investment {{are at the heart of}} my deliberations here: realisation of the pedagogic potential of environmental print to develop literate resources requires consideration of sources of motivation in the classroom learning situation (Dörnyei & Ushioda, 2011), as well as learner investment in literate practices in English (Norton, 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of oral communication can {{vary depending on}} how quickly language users process not only language but also non-language information and on how that information is used. Various psycholinguistic experiments have shown that first language (L 1) users incrementally form a representation by utilizing context information, and furthermore, can predict the forthcoming information. Since this topic has not been sufficiently studied using second language (L 2) learners, theory and application of L 2 processing are thus insufficient. This study aims to investigate, using an eye-tracking experiment, whether <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> can utilize visually presented contextual information during spoken language comprehension. Specifically, it eye tracked the comprehension processes of <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> <b>when</b> auditory inputs with four two-dimensional figures (e. g.

Two conditions were manipulated in terms of figure size, color, and shape: (1) one pair of contrasting objects and; (2) two pairs of contrasting objects. It was revealed that the eye often moved to the target object before the noun (e. g. circle) was heard, adjectival information (e. g. large, red) being sufficient to restrict the domain of reference to one object in the visual display. Eye movements were thus quicker in the first condition that requires relatively little context information to distinguish the target than in the second condition that does not.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to find out which of the e-tools [...] weblogs, wikis, or podcasts [...] can better <b>help</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> excel in their writing skill. To this end, 156 Iranian sophomore students majoring in English and studying at Islamic Azad University, Abadeh and Shiraz Branches and the Zand Institute of Higher Education were selected based on random sampling as participants. As the design of the study was a pre-experimental one, there were three experimental groups involved but no control group. Before the instruction, the participants were given an essay writing test, whose results were used to divide them into three groups. Two of the groups received in-class instruction and were assigned out-of-class activities through weblogs and wikis. The third group received the instruction through podcasts. The treatment lasted for two and a half months and at the end, another essay writing test was given to all groups. A two-way ANOVA for the comparison of the participants' gain scores indicated that using the tools available on the Internet could lead to improvement in the EFL students writing abilities, and gender was not a determining factor. The study reveals the fact that web tools, in general, and blogs, wikis, and podcasts, in particular, can foster EFL students’ writing skills and teachers can use them as supplements in their language instruction...|$|R

In Indonesia, English as {{compulsory}} subject is learned from {{junior high school}} up to university. According to School-Based curriculum (Depdiknas, 2006 : 308) the objective of teaching learning English at Senior High School is that the {{students are expected to}} be able to develop communicative competence both in written and in spoken form to achieve informational literacy level. Although English is {{compulsory subject}} in Indonesia, most of senior high school students still have difficulties in learning English, especially writing. Writing {{is still one of the}} most difficult skill for language learners because writing is not just arranging the words, but writing is a process of thinking and creativity for writer to develop their ideas, knowledge, information into written language. The aims of this research are: 1) find out the EFL learners’ capability in writing report text, 2) find out the difficulties that are faced by <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> <b>when</b> writing report text. Therefore, the analysis mainly employs qualitative methods which is descriptive qualitative. In qualitative study, the researcher is the main instrument for gathering and analyzing the data (Ary et. al., 2010 : p 424). This study used observation, interview and documentation as the techniques of collecting data. Participants of this research are the second grade <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> of SMAN 1 Rajagaluh, exactly in XI MIPA 4. This study reveals that EFL learners’ capability in writing report text is categorized as fair to poor. They are still difficult to develop and express their idea to the written text. It indicates that the teacher in teaching process has to concern more to touch language structures, text functions, themes or topics, creative expression, composing processes, content, genre and contexts of writing (Hyland, 2003 : 2). In addition, the difficulties that are faced by the students when writing the report text are vocabulary, grammar and developing or expressing their idea into written text.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} linguistically naive {{descriptions}} which {{one set of}} <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> provided <b>when</b> identifying and describing accents. First and second-year English majors at a French university were asked to do two tasks. First, they listened to two extracts {{to determine whether the}} speaker’s accent sounded more British or American, and to explain which features helped them to decide. Later they answered two questions: a) What {{do you do when you}} want to sound more like an American? and b) more like a British person? The analysis of their answers highlights learners’ underlying representations of accents as well as concept formation in relation to English pronunciation. I argue that this cognitive aspect of L 2 learning should be addressed explicitly in instruction...|$|R
40|$|Although many {{researchers}} {{have worked on}} the role of feedback in immersion programs on second language learners' production, still {{little is known about the}} role of different types of immediate feedback on the grammatical accuracy of learners' production. When, where and with who different types of immediate feedback such as prompts and recasts and their different subcategories might be appropriate? The purpose of the present research was to know which types of immediate oral feedback could better <b>help</b> Iranian <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> to produce the correct form of the tense markers of their target language English. One of the primary objectives of the present study was to examine the effects of two types of oral feedback namely explicit correction and implicit or-choice feedback on Iranian EFL learners' production of different tense markers in English. The results were in favor of explicit correction over implicit or-choice feedback in helping learners to produce correct grammatical tense markers...|$|R
