5000|$|The American fiber <b>helmet</b> (also {{known as}} the American pith <b>helmet,</b> safari <b>helmet,</b> {{tropical}} <b>helmet,</b> sun <b>helmet,</b> elephant <b>helmet,</b> or the pressed fiber <b>helmet)</b> {{is a type of}} sun <b>helmet</b> made of pressed fiber material that has been used as part of the military uniform by various parts of the United States Armed Forces, from 1934 to present. As of 2017, the <b>helmet</b> continues to be worn by US military rifle range cadres, as an icon for marksmanship excellence. [...] The <b>helmet</b> is technically not a pith <b>helmet,</b> insofar as it is not constructed from pith material. [...] However, in the more generic sense of design style, this type of sun <b>helmet</b> is modeled similarly to one and thus often referred to in common use as a pith <b>helmet.</b> [...] Additionally, the <b>helmet</b> is not a combat <b>helmet,</b> insofar as it was not originally designed to protect the head during combat. However, the <b>helmet</b> was nonetheless assigned, at various times in the 1930s and 1940s, as combat gear for use in active theaters.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman <b>helmets,</b> including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation {{is that most of the}} surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed <b>helmets</b> may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all <b>helmets</b> of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} has {{a number}} of characteristics that distinguish the Swedish style from heraldry in other European countries. Common features of Swedish heraldry {{are similar to those of}} other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British heraldry and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple <b>helmets</b> and crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These <b>helmets</b> and crests are considered to be as important as the shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (as distinct from the German custom), when an even number of <b>helmets</b> is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned affronté and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the <b>helmets</b> are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British heraldry. Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British heraldry, is rare in German-Nordic heraldry. Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in mantling, supporters, or the trimmings of crowns, but rarely on the shield.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} of a protective bicycle <b>helmet</b> is to provide and maintain adequate coverage to the head.

The aims {{of the current study}} were to identify factors that influence the size of <b>helmet</b> worn, identify factors that influence <b>helmet</b> position and adjustment, and examine the effects of <b>helmet</b> size worn and adjustment on <b>helmet</b> stability. Methods: Recreational and commuter cyclists in Sydney were surveyed to determine how <b>helmet</b> size and/or adjustment affected <b>helmet</b> stability in the real world. Anthropometric characteristics of the head were measured and, to assess <b>helmet</b> stability, a test analogous to the requirements of the Australian bicycle <b>helmet</b> standard was undertaken. Results: Two hundred sixty-seven cyclists were recruited across all age groups and 91 % wore an AS/NZS 2063 -compliant <b>helmet.</b> The main ethnic group was Europeans (71 %) followed by Asians (18 %). The circumferences of the cyclists&# 039; heads matched well the circumference of the relevant ISO headform for the chosen <b>helmet</b> size, but the head shapes differed with respect to ISO headforms. Age and gender were associated with wearing an incorrectly sized <b>helmet</b> and <b>helmet</b> adjustment. Older males (> 55 years) were most likely to wear an incorrectly sized <b>helmet.</b> Adult males in the 35 - 54 year age group were most likely to wear a correctly adjusted <b>helmet.</b> Using quasistatic <b>helmet</b> stability tests, {{it was found that the}} correctness of adjustment, rather than size, head dimensions, or shape, significantly affected <b>helmet</b> stability in all test directions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Motorcycle {{accidents}} form a fatal {{category of}} motor traffic accidents. Motorcycle riders have a 34 times {{risk of death}} than the drivers {{of other types of}} vehicles and 8 {{times more likely to be}} injured. The non-use of <b>helmet</b> is a specific factor leading to head injuries and fatalities resulting from motorcycle crashes. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the commercial motorcyclists‟ attitude and their practices of <b>helmet</b> wearing. The specific objectives were to determine the following among commercial motorcyclists in Dar es Salaam region: attitude of <b>helmet</b> use, proportion of commercial motorcyclists who wear <b>helmet</b> and the practice of <b>helmet</b> use. Material and methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in urban and peri-urban areas of Dar es Salaam region in May, 2011 at randomly selected commercial motorcycle parking points. A total of 273 conveniently selected eligible commercial motorcyclists participated. Face-to-face interviews were performed using a standard questionnaire while observation was conducted using an observation checklist. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 16. 0. Results: All commercial motorcyclists were males, with the majority (64. 8 %) with primary education. The proportion of commercial motorcyclists who reported to wear <b>helmet</b> was 81. 3 %. However about two thirds of them (67. 6 %) reported to not wear <b>helmet</b> consistently. <b>Helmet</b> wearing was strongly predicted by having a positive attitude towards <b>helmet</b> for passengers (p= 0. 005), protective ability of <b>helmet</b> against head injury (p= 0. 003), wearing <b>helmet</b> during night (p= 0. 001) and wearing <b>helmet</b> even for the experienced rider (p= 0. 000). However in a multiple regression model, it was found that those who agreed regarding the protective ability of <b>helmet</b> against head injury were more likely to wear <b>helmet</b> than those who disagreed (AOR: 0. 279; 95 % CI: 0. 086 - 0. 905); those who strongly agreed on wearing <b>helmet</b> during hot weather were more likely to wear <b>helmet</b> than those who disagreed (AOR: 0. 039; 95 % CI: 0. 002 - 0. 698). Those who strongly agreed on necessity for passengers to wear <b>helmet</b> and wearing <b>helmet</b> during night were more likely to wear <b>helmet</b> than those who were undecided (AOR: 0. 091; 95 % CI: 0. 013 - viii 0. 617 and AOR: 0. 114; 95 % CI: 0. 014 - 0. 931 respectively). Those who had primary education were more likely to wear <b>helmet</b> than those who had no formal education (AOR: 6. 146; 95 % CI; 1. 345 - 28. 097). There was no significant difference in <b>helmet</b> wearing between urban and peri-urban areas (p= 0. 109). A small majority (52. 7 %) were observed wearing <b>helmet,</b> although 91. 8 % of them had no passenger‟s <b>helmet.</b> Conclusion: These findings indicate that despite the inconsistent <b>helmet</b> wearing, commercial motorcyclists had positive attitude towards <b>helmet</b> wearing. <b>Helmet</b> wearing is associated with the level of education and having a positive attitude towards <b>helmet</b> wearing. There is a high disparity on the observed <b>helmet</b> wearing between riders and passengers. Very few among the later were found to be wearing <b>helmet.</b> Recommendations: There is a need to strengthen legal enforcement of <b>helmet</b> wearing and ensuring the availability and accessibility of quality <b>helmet</b> to the majority of commercial motorcyclists. There is also a need for regular education campaigns to foster positive attitude towards <b>helmet</b> use.
