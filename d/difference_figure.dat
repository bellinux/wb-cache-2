40|$|As nineteenth-century {{scientific}} {{theories of}} racism sought to justify slavery and oppression by dehumanizing black people, popular abolitionist arguments often emphasized {{the humanity of}} enslaved black people by likening them to free white people, most popularly in {{the figure of the}} mixed-race hero(ine). Other abolitionist arguments, however, employed animals as points of familiar reference, in cross-species comparisons that did not simply repeat racist ideologies but solicited interracial sympathy. This essay reads abolitionist children’s literature that deployed a strategy of “animal humanism,” using domesticated animals to mediate their readers’ sympathy for enslaved people. Focusing on the parallel rhetorics of species and race in children’s literature, the essay centers its discussion on the abolitionist revision of Maria Susanna Cummins’s novel The Lamplighter (1854) in The Lamplighter Picture Book(1855), other abolitionist literature for children, and political cartoons in which species and racial <b>difference</b> <b>figure.</b> As pets are construed as both domesticated and domestic in these texts, the possibility of cross-species kinship presents a more proximate familiar relation than cross-racial kinship. Attention to these uses of domesticated animals reveals the limitations of sympathy that is more easily mediated through species rather than race. However, readings of the animal as not only familiar but familial open new possibilities for an abolitionist sympathy that has antiracist potential in its ability to be mediated through acknowledged positions of difference rather than a dependence on sameness. ...|$|E
40|$|The endocannabinoid system regulates {{some aspects}} of the brain’s {{inflammatory}} response, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulation of microglial activation. 1 – 4 The endocannabinoid system is composed of two G-proteincoupled receptors designated as CB 1 and CB 2 expressed throughout the body and notably by neural stem cells. 5 We have previously shown that stimulation of the CB 1 / 2 receptors using a low dose of WIN- 55, 212 - 2 significantly reversed the LPS-induced microglia activation in young rats. 2 This anti-inflammatory effect was also found in aged rats, attenuating the age-induced performance impairment observed in the water pool task. 3 As normal aging is associated with increased levels of microglial activation and a decrease in neurogenesis, both probably contributing to the hippocampus-related memory deficit, we investigated the effects of an agonist of CB 1 / 2 receptors on neurogenesis in the brain of normal aged rats. A total of 12 old (23 -month-old) and 6 young (3 -month-old) male F- 344 rats were chronically infused for 28 days subcutaneously using an osmotic minipump with WIN- 55, 212 - 2 (2 mg kg 1 per day n = 6) or the vehicle (n = 12) into the dorsal abdominal area. Two injections of 50 mg kg 1 i. p. of 5 -bromo- 2 deoxyuridine were made on day 1 and day 2 post surgery to track new cells ’ production. The rats were assigned to one of the following three groups: youngvehicle (n = 6), old þ vehicle (n = 6) and old þ WIN- 55, 212 - 2 2 mg kg 1 per day (n = 6). Doublecortin immunoreactivity was found only in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (Figure 1 A). A significant <b>difference</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1 Aa–d) in doublecortin immunoreactivity was found between young (3 -month-old, 73. 125 ± 22. 8 cells per DG) and old rats (23 -month-old, 3 ± 1. 8 P < 0. 05).

30|$|The deeper {{part of the}} mega-splay fault system (> 6 km {{below the}} seafloor) is well defined as a {{prominent}} single reflector on the analyzed seismic profiles off Kumano, as shown in Figures 2 and 6 a,b (Park et al. 2002; Tsuru et al. 2005; Bangs et al. 2009; Moore et al. 2009). The seismic velocity derived from waveform tomography (Figure 2 b) demonstrates that the footwall of the deep mega-splay fault has low P-wave velocity due mainly to an overpressured state and a lithology <b>difference</b> (<b>Figure</b> 2 c; e.g., Tsuji et al. 2014). On the other hand, the deep mega-splay fault seems to branch trenchward from beneath the WBSF, but it becomes less reflective (Figure 2 a) and has lower velocity contrast around the outer ridge (Figure 2 b; Kamei et al. 2012). Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} identify the geometry of the shallower part of the mega-splay fault system. In this study, we determined the detailed 3 D geometries of the shallower parts of the branched faults from a dense 2 D seismic profile (ODKM- 03) partially using phase information from seismic signals (i.e., instantaneous phase; Taner et al. 1979; Tsuji et al. 2005). The extracted fault geometry is discontinuous and en echelon with faults branching trenchward from beneath the outer ridge (Figure 4 a,c). These shallow discontinuous splay faults seem to merge into the deeper, single mega-splay fault at the transition zone (Figure 2). The WBSF could not be imaged clearly on the multi-channel seismic profiles, likely because the heterogeneous geological structures including fractures exclude coherent reflection events and because the dip angle of the WBSF is probably too steep to be imaged. The WBSF seems to form a flower structure (Ashi et al. 2007; Martin et al. 2010), although the relationship between the WBSF and the mega-splay thrust fault cannot be clearly revealed from reflection seismic profiles. Because the WBSF exists parallel to and close to the shallow branched mega-splay thrust fault, {{it seems likely that the}} WBSF and the mega-splay fault merge down-dip at the transition zone (black arrows in Figure 2).The characteristics of the mega-splay fault and WBSF change at a point off Cape Shionomisaki (Figure 6 c,e), where the WBSF intersects the rupture segment boundary between the 1944 Tonankai and 1946 Nankai earthquakes. However, the lineament associated with the WBSF exists continuously across the segment boundary. Off Cape Shionomisaki, the mega-splay fault does not have strong reflection amplitude, which indicates that the splay fault is not a well-developed boundary of pore pressure or lithology (Figure 6 c,e). Instead, steeply dipping faults branch directly from the basal décollement that developed close to the sediment/crust interface, and it is difficult to distinguish the splay fault from the WBSF. Thus, it seems likely that the shallow branched splay fault itself has a strike-slip component and functions as the WBSF off Cape Shionomisaki (Figure 6 d,f).|$|E

30|$|Daily between-site <b>differences</b> (<b>Figure</b> 3), however, {{are likely}} to {{substantially}} influence fire planning. Ten percent of all sample periods exhibited a mean LFM range of 30 percentage points or more. Such site-to-site variability can result in instances in which LFM at one site is well above a trigger point while LFM at another site is well below. For example, on 8 August 2009, LFM at Slaughter Creek was 119 % while LFM at Cortana, 21 km away, was 59 %. High within-sample period LFM variability appears to occur during times of seasonal transition, such as during the spring, when LFM at either the northern (Cortana and Reicher) or southern (Slaughter Creek and Onion Creek) sites begins rising before or faster {{than that of the}} others. The majority (88 %) of sample periods with a LFM range of 30 percentage points or greater occurred during April, May, and June. Such within-sample period variability may be attributable to differing times of leaf generation between sites and the stochastic nature of highly localized rainfall events.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to the density dependent mean field and the spin-orbit interaction of a Λ-hyperon in a nuclear many-body system, based on flavor-SU(3) in-medium chiral perturbation theory. The leading long-range Λ N-interaction arises from kaon exchange and from two-pion exchange with a Σ-hyperon in the intermediate state. The empirical Λ-nucleus potential depth of about - 28 MeV is well reproduced with a single cutoff scale, Λ̅= 0. 7 GeV, effectively representing all short-distance (high-momentum) dynamics not resolved at scales characteristic of the nuclear Fermi momentum. This value of Λ̅ is remarkably consistent with the one required to reproduce the empirical saturation point of isospin-symmetric nuclear matter in the same framework. The smallness of the Λ-nuclear spin-orbit interaction finds a natural (yet novel) explanation {{in terms of an}} almost complete cancellation between short-range contributions (properly rescaled from the known nucleonic spin-orbit coupling strength) and long-range terms generated by iterated one-pion exchange with intermediate Σ-hyperons.

Although several factors are known to regulate grapheme-color associations, the impact of factors, including their interrelationships, on synesthesia remains unclear. We investigated determinants of synesthetic color for graphemes (characters, letters) of Hiragana, a phonetic script in the Japanese language, and the English alphabet. Results revealed that grapheme ordinality was the strongest predictor of synesthetic colors for Hiragana characters, followed by character sound, and visual shape. Ordinality and visual shapes also significantly predicted synesthetic colors for English alphabet letters, however, sounds did not. The relative impact of grapheme properties on grapheme-color associations and the differences between these two writing systems are accounted for by considering the way graphemes are processed in the brain and introduced during an individual&# 39;s development. A new model is proposed which takes into account the developmental process of grapheme learning. The model provides comprehensive explanation of synesthetic grapheme-color association determination processes, including the differences across writing systems...|$|R
