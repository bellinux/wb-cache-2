5|$|Francium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolFr and atomic number87. <b>It</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as eka-caesium and actinium K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium, {{and is the}} second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.|$|E

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare, {{commonly}} known as the pinecone mushroom, the cone tooth, or the ear-pick fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales. It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who included it {{as a member of the}} tooth fungi genus Hydnum, but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to contain it. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily overlooked in the pine woods where it grows. A.vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consumed in France and Italy.|$|E

This research <b>is</b> conducted <b>to</b> see availability of mineral rocks in Indonesia as iron source. Four different kinds of mineral rocks are used.

Separation of limonite is done by magnetic separation process while saprolite, malachite, and chalcopyrite are done by washing separation methods. Analysis on Fe content is done at origin and roasting condition for all rocks. The results show that other mineral rocks can become iron source, separation will enhance Fe content, and lateritic nickel rocks especially limonite can be new other iron source...|$|R

In 1953, Aeroplane Jelly introduced Australia's first low calorie jelly. In 1988, in honour of the Australian Bicentenary, jelly was available in special Australian flavours such as Lilly Pilly, Quandong and Midjinberry. These flavours were phased out by 1992.

However, the use of pesticides has increased staggeringly from 1950, and presently approximately 2.5 million tons of industrial pesticides are used each year.

5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. <b>It</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E

40|$|Nobody {{would claim}} that {{debugging}} computer software is easy: {{all too often}} it proceeds by trial-and-error experiments in which programmers examine the behaviour {{of the system and}} form hypotheses that could explain what they see. These problems are exacerbated when developing distributed, peer-to-peer or multi-processor applications, or when unreliable network links form part of the system under test. Environments for pervasive computing take this to an extreme, allowing user-supplied code to run or migrate within and around the network. In this paper we show how to perform pervasive debugging, enabling complex multi-process applications <b>to</b> <b>be</b> debugged and controlled as single entities and their robustness to changes in network performance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evaluated. We do this by virtualizing the resources used by the system, allowing the threads that it involves and the network links that <b>it</b> <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> modelled within a single controllable process. ...|$|R
40|$|In performance-critical {{parts of}} {{functional}} programs substantial performance improvements {{can be achieved}} by using unboxed, instead of boxed, data types. Unfortunately, polymorphic functions and data types cannot directly manipulate unboxed values, precisely because they do not conform to the standard boxed representation. Instead, specialised, monomorphic versions of these functions and data types, which manipulate the unboxed values, have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> created. This can be a very tiresome and error prone business, since specialising one function often requires the functions and data types <b>it</b> <b>uses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> specialised as well. In this paper we show how to automate these tiresome consequential changes, leaving the programmer to concentrate on where to introduce unboxed data types in the first place. 1 Introduction Non-strict semantics certainly add to the expressive power of a language [8]. Sometimes the performance cost of this extra expressiveness is slight, but not always. It can happen that [...] ...|$|R
5|$|There is no {{consistent}} {{relationship between}} the classification of spiders {{and the types of}} web they build: species in the same genus may build very similar or significantly different webs. Nor is there much correspondence between spiders' classification and the chemical composition of their silks. Convergent evolution in web construction, in other words use of similar techniques by remotely related species, is rampant. Orb web designs and the spinning behaviors that produce them are the best understood. The basic radial-then-spiral sequence visible in orb webs and the sense of direction required to build them may have been inherited from the common ancestors of most spider groups. However, the majority of spiders build non-orb webs. <b>It</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thought that the sticky orb web was an evolutionary innovation resulting in the diversification of the Orbiculariae. Now, however, it appears that non-orb spiders are a sub-group that evolved from orb-web spiders, and non-orb spiders have over 40% more species and are four times as abundant as orb-web spiders. Their greater success may be because sphecid wasps, which are often the dominant predators of spiders, much prefer to attack spiders that have flat webs.|$|E
