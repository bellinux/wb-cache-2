500|$|Selena {{has been}} {{credited}} for helping redefine Latin music and its subgenres of Tejano, cumbia, and Latin pop. Selena broke barriers in the Latin music world. She is considered [...] "one {{of the most}} significant Mexican American singers {{of the end of the}} twentieth century". People magazine named Selena one of the most intriguing people of the 20th century. US Senator <b>Kay</b> <b>Bailey</b> Hutchison named Selena one of [...] "the spirited women who shaped [...]" [...] Selena also became one of the [...] "most celebrated cultural products" [...] of the United States-Mexico borderlands. Selena was called the [...] "Queen of Tejano music", and was described as [...] "the most important and popular Tejano star of all time".

500|$|The coin {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the nation's senators. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press columnist Suzanne Gamboa, Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas described United States currency as [...] "crummy". Gramm, {{who was one of}} the senators who voted for the bill containing the legislation that authorized it, praised the design of the Sacagawea dollar as being an improvement over the other coin designs then in production. Despite his praise of the design, Gramm condemned the Mint's approach to marketing the coin, stating that if the United States Mint were the Franklin Mint, they would be [...] "sued for deceptive advertisement." [...] He also noted his belief that the Mint had repeated the earlier mistakes of the Susan B. Anthony dollar by issuing a coin that was tailored to the requests of the vending machine industry rather than the average consumer. Texas Republican Senator <b>Kay</b> <b>Bailey</b> Hutchison criticized both the Sacagawea design as well the coin's size in relation to the other coins in circulation at the time. Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation [...] "looks like play money." [...] Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.|$|E
2500|$|Cruz ran for {{and won the}} Senate seat {{vacated by}} fellow Republican <b>Kay</b> <b>Bailey</b> Hutchison in 2012. He is the first Hispanic American {{to serve as a}} U.S. Senator {{representing}} Texas, and is one of three senators of Cuban descent.|$|E
2500|$|Sen. <b>Kay</b> <b>Bailey</b> Hutchison {{responded to}} the {{memorandum}} by stating [...] "They [...] are not taking a position {{at all on the}} legislation...

2500|$|There {{had been}} {{speculation}} that White might run for higher office.

2500|$|Radnofsky {{faced an}} uphill battle {{in a state that}} has not elected a Democrat statewide since 1994, as George W. Bush's {{landslide}} reelection as governor in 1998 had helped carry Republicans into all the other statewide offices. In the August 2006 Rasmussen poll, Hutchison led her opponent by 30 percentage points — 61 to 31. The Survey USA Poll, which is not a head-to-head matchup, but only lists approval ratings of incumbents, found Hutchison with a 61 percent approval rating. The Zogby poll, in contrast, showed a closer result, but still showed Hutchison with a 18.9 percent lead. The authors stated [...] "...Republican Sen. <b>Kay</b> <b>Bailey</b> Hutchison, who got 65 {{percent of the vote in}} 2000, is a safe bet to win a third term." ...|$|E
