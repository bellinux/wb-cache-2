40|$|Until {{recently}} {{concerns about}} the impact of aircraft noise on people have centered around the takeoff and landing operations of aircraft in the vicinity of airport terminals. The development of the advanced turboprop (propfan) engine, modifications to air corridors, and the desire to maintain a natural environment in national parks and recreation areas have now focused attention on the impact at ground level of the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise produced by aircraft at cruise conditions and altitudes. Compared to terminal area noise, <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise is characterized by relatively low noise levels, lack of high frequency spectral content, and long durations. Much research has been directed towards understanding and quantifying the annoyance caused by terminal area aircraft noise, but relatively little research has been conducted for <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise. To address this need, a laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the annoyance of people on the ground to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise generated by aircraft at cruise conditions. The objectives of the experiment are to determine the annoyance prediction ability of noise measurement procedures and corrections when applied to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise; to determine differences in annoyance response to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise and takeoff/landing noise; and to determine differences in annoyance response to advanced turboprop <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise and conventional jet <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise...|$|R

5000|$|Traffic {{management}} advisor (TMA), a CTAS tool, is an <b>en</b> <b>route</b> {{decision support}} tool that automates time based metering solutions {{to provide an}} upper limit of aircraft to a TRACON from the center over a set period of time.

40|$|While airport {{congestion}} {{has long}} been viewed as a major air traffic management problem in the United States, congestion in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace is drawing an increasing amount of attention. Sources of <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion, such as severe weather, often cause the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to delay and reroute aircraft {{in order to ensure}} safety. Most current research into methods for managing <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion seeks to reduce delay or aid in aircraft rerouting. However, there has been less attention paid to delay and reroute allocation methods  an area in which {{there appears to be a}} pressing, practical need. Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) is a movement within the air traffic management community that has combined the interests of the FAA and industry to develop a universally-accepted resource rationing process for congested airports. There is high expectation that CDM can achieve similar success in developing a parallel rationing process for the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace. The CDM-inspired research underlying this thesis led to the development of a software tool, the <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> Resource Allocation Prototype (ERAP), that supports the analysis of alternative <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace rationing methods. In this thesis, we define a basic <b>en</b> <b>route</b> traffic flow management scenario, conduct experiments, and derive ERAP results which provide insight into rationing resources in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace domain. It is hoped that ERAP can serve as a baseline for future comparison and help lead to final industry acceptance of an ideal rationing solution...|$|R
