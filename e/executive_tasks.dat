25|$|Both William and Anne {{appointed}} {{and dismissed}} Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and {{followed up on}} actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was {{an essential part of}} evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although George I (1714–1727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions. George II (1727–1760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his grandson, George III (1760–1820), is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign. Thus, the convention that Sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance. The Prime Minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign. These simple <b>executive</b> <b>tasks</b> naturally gave the Prime Minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.|$|E

40|$|Coping {{with the}} demands of pain diminishes self-regulatory {{capacity}} and causes self-regulatory fatigue, which then leads to deteriorated <b>executive</b> <b>task</b> performance. It has been suggested that optimism can counteract the depletion of self-regulatory capacity. This study employed a 2 (optimism/no optimism) x 2 (pain/no pain) between-subjects design to explore whether (1) experimentally induced pain (cold pressor <b>task)</b> deteriorates subsequent <b>executive</b> <b>task</b> performance, and (2) whether an optimism induction can counteract this sustained deteriorating effect of pain on <b>executive</b> <b>task</b> performance. Results indicated that although pain led to significantly worse performance on the <b>executive</b> functioning <b>task</b> in the no optimism condition, this sustained deteriorating effect of pain on task performance was abolished in the optimism condition. This finding is imperative because it suggests that optimism may be an important factor to implement in current psychological treatment approaches to diminish the negative impact of chronic pain on the ability to function in daily life.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} nature of the {{relationship}} between early life environment and executive functioning in a sample (n = 101) of Aboriginal and non-Indigenous young people (Age: M = 17. 46, SD = 2. 71) from primarily disadvantaged backgrounds. Results presented in the thesis are the product of replicating Miyake et al. ’s (2000) experiments in a cohort of young people that differ from Miyake’s on a range of significant factors. The aims of the research were to 1) test the premise that sociodemographic grouping has a qualitative effect on <b>executive</b> functioning <b>task</b> performance, and 2) to quantify the effects of individual-, family-, and community-level factors on <b>executive</b> functioning <b>task</b> proficiency. Initial analyses focusing on associations between <b>executive</b> functioning <b>task</b> performances produced two significant findings: The first was that the Miyake et al. three-factor executive functioning model (Inhibition, Switching, and Updating) was replicated in the current sample. The second is that the pattern of inter-task associations demonstrated in the non-Indigenous sample was replicated in the Aboriginal sample. Model fit statistics broadly support configural invariance of <b>executive</b> functioning <b>tasks.</b> The second phase that focused on quantifying the effects of capacity, affiliation and environment factors on <b>executive</b> functioning <b>task</b> proficiency produces a further list of significant findings. Preliminary between-group analyses revealed positive statistically significant effects of differences in familial socioeconomic status (SES) and level of general cognitive ability (g) on <b>executive</b> functioning <b>task</b> proficiency. Subsequent Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) suggested that individual-level (preterm birth, head injury, and childhood health), and family-level (familial SES, sibship size, and sole parent), but not community-level factors, accounted for substantial variance in <b>executive</b> functioning <b>task</b> performance. The results suggest that factors underlying the relationship between early life environment and executive functioning predominantly lie between, not within, families. Subsequent models indicate that g makes an independent contribution to understanding {{the nature of}} executive functioning, but does not fully account for the relationship between early life experience and executive functioning proficiency. Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis suggest that the relationship between early life environment and executive functioning proficiency is quantitative rather than qualitative; those from more advantaged backgrounds perform better on <b>executive</b> functioning <b>tasks,</b> perhaps as the results of characteristics that differ between families...|$|R

50|$|While {{bilingualism}} {{has repeatedly}} {{been shown to}} affect cognitive development, research has been less focused on which aspects of cognitive development, in particular, are affected. Bialystok and Barac, in a study about the generality of bilingual effects on development, compared three groups of bilinguals to one group of monolinguals {{in a series of}} linguistic tasks and one nonlinguistic, <b>executive</b> control <b>task</b> involving task-switching. The three bilingual groups differed according to three factors: similarity between languages spoken, cultural background, and language of educational experience. All three bilingual groups outperformed the monolingual group on the task-switching <b>executive</b> control <b>task,</b> however, even in excluding the monolingual group, neither of the three differentiating factors had a significant effect on the performance of the <b>executive</b> control <b>task.</b> These results suggest that bilingualism itself provides an advantage in the nonverbal, executive control aspect of cognitive development.|$|R
