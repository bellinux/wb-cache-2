5|$|During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan {{culture was}} in decline after {{the rise of}} Christianity and later Islam, but {{interest}} in Egyptian antiquity continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> medieval scholars such as Dhul-Nun al-Misri and al-Maqrizi.

5|$|Biblical {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the Qedarites are named for Qedar, the second son of Ishmael, mentioned in the Bible's books of Genesis (25:13) and 1 Chronicles (1:29), where there are also frequent references to Qedar as a tribe. The earliest extrabiblical inscriptions discovered by archaeologists that mention the Qedarites are from the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Spanning the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, they list the names of Qedarite kings who revolted and were defeated in battle, {{as well as those}} who paid Assyrian monarchs tribute, including Zabibe, queen of the Arabs (šar-rat KUR.a-ri-bi). There are also Aramaic and Old South Arabian inscriptions recalling the Qedarites, who further appear briefly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Classical Greek, such as Herodotus, and Roman historians, such as Pliny the Elder, and Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian {{themes in}} {{literature}} {{became much more}} diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values are evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes.|$|E
5|$|New Age thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived {{in an age of}} spiritual wisdom. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.|$|E

5|$|Romantic {{thinking}} was also evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who {{followed in the}} tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E
5|$|Strombid {{gastropods}} {{were widely}} accepted as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century, {{a concept that}} persisted until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. This erroneous idea originated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who classified strombids with other supposedly carnivorous snails. This idea was subsequently repeated by other authors, but were not supported by observation. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Lobatus gigas is a specialized herbivore, that feeds on macroalgae (including red algae, such as species of Gracilaria and Hypnea), seagrass and unicellular algae, intermittently also feeding on algal detritus. The green macroalgae Batophora oerstedii is one of its preferred foods.|$|E

In 1584, Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598) featured in his atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum the peculiar Chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages, just like Chinese ships. Gonzales de Mendoza also mentioned this {{a year later}} – noting even the designs of them on Chinese silken robes – while Gerardus Mercator (1512–94) featured them in his atlas, John Milton (1608–74) {{in one of his}} famous poems, and Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest (1739–801) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> his travel diary in China.|$|E

5|$|The French Spaniel and the Picardy Spaniel are {{considered}} to be the two oldest continental breeds of spaniel. Both breeds are speculated to have stemmed from the Chien d' Oysel described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Gaston Phoebus. Hunting during this period in France was one of the favourite sports of the nobility and the French type of Spaniel became the favourite hunting dog of the French Royalty. The breed can be seen in paintings dating from this period by artists Alexandre-François Desportes and Jean-Baptiste Oudry. They were also the first breed of dog to be admitted into salons.|$|E
5|$|Under the Umayyads Gaza {{served as}} a minor {{administrative}} center. In 672 an earthquake struck the city but there are few details of its effects. Under the caliph-appointed governors, Christians and Jews were taxed, though their worship and trade continued, as noted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> the bishop Saint Willibald, who visited the city in 723.

In 767, Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; al-Shafi'i founded one of the prominent fiqhs (schools of law) of Sunni Islam, named Shafi'i after him.|$|E
5|$|Around the 6th century, Porphyreon or Porphyrea is {{mentioned}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> William of Tyre, {{and while it}} lies within the area covered by modern Haifa, it was a settlement situated south of Haifa-Sycaminon. Following the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Haifa was {{used to refer to}} a site established on Tel Shikmona upon what were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona). Haifa (or Haifah) {{is mentioned}} by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler Nasir Khusraw, and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, Muhammad al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi. The Crusaders, who captured Haifa briefly in the 12th century, call it Caiphas, and believe its name related to Cephas, the Aramaic name of Simon Peter. Eusebius is also said to have referred to Hefa as Caiaphas civitas, and Benjamin of Tudela, the 12th-century Jewish traveller and chronicler, is said to have attributed the city's founding to Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest at the time of Jesus.|$|E
