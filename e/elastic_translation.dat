40|$|A new {{traceable}} metrological AFM with {{a measuring}} volume of 1 x 1 x 1 mm {{is being developed}} for the Dutch metrology institute (NMi - Van Swinden Laboratory). The instrument consists of a low-hysteresis <b>elastic</b> <b>translation</b> stage and a custom designed, kinematically mounted AFM measurement head. Here a short overview of the translation stage design will be given and some preliminary results presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} two new six {{degree of}} freedom desktop input devices based on the key concept of combining forceless isotonic rotational input with force-requiring elastic translational input. The GlobeFish consists of a custom three degrees of freedom trackball which is elastically connected to a frame. The trackball is accessible from {{the top and bottom}} and can be moved slightly in all spatial directions by using force. The GlobeMouse device works in a similar way. Here the trackball is placed on top of a movable base, which requires to change the grip on the device to switch between rotating the trackball and moving the base. Our devices are manipulated with the fingertips allowing precise interaction with virtual objects. The <b>elastic</b> <b>translation</b> allows uniform input for all three axes and the isotonic trackball provides a natural mapping for rotations. Our user study revealed that the new devices perform significantly better in a docking task in comparison to the SpaceMouse, an integrated six degrees of freedom controller. Subjective data confirmed these results. Author Keywords User interface hardware, input devices, interactio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the static}} pull-in {{instability}} of torsional nano electromechanical systems (NEMS) with coupling effect between torsion and bending is investigated considering {{the effect of}} <b>translation</b> <b>elastic</b> boundary condition. A set of normalized equations governing the static actuation properties of the torsional actuator is derived to demonstrate {{the relationships between the}} parameters of static characteristics, such as torsion angle, vertical displacement, and applied voltage. The results from this model demonstrated that the real model of boundary condition (elastic boundary condition) is very important issue which must be considered in manufacturing process...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experiments}} in our laboratory [1, 2] {{have demonstrated that}} changes in optical correlation intensity {{can be used to}} monitor small strain applied, for example, to aluminum alloy specimens in simple tension. By analyzing data separately for specimen <b>translation,</b> <b>elastic</b> strain, and plastic strain, respectively, we inferred that irreversible changes in correlation intensity associated with plastic strains of the order of 10 - 3 are caused by accompanying changes in surface topography [2]. In this paper, we present results which link metallographic observations of surface slip and related topographic changes directly to corresponding changes in optical correlation intensity, during uniaxial tensile straining of a stainless steel heat treated to two different initial conditions. The results show that in a given material, correlation intensity is not a unique function of plastic strain, but that it depends on the detailed topographic changes which occur when strain is applied...|$|R
