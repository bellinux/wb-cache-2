Kosowska, B., Strzała, T., Moska, M., Ratajszczak, R., Dobosz, T. - Seven lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) from Wrocław ZOO (three females and four males), differing {{from each other}} with {{exterior}} and sexual behaviour were verified with cytogenetic analysis in order to check their taxonomic status. Cytogenetic analysis was done using two alternative methods of blood collection: 1) conventionally with venepuncture, and 2) with blood sucking bugs from the Reduviidae family. Lymphocytes capable of growing were obtained only with conventional method of blood sampling. Karyotypes and <b>karyograms</b> of all analyzed tapirs were created using classical cytogenetic methods of chromosomes staining. All possessed <b>karyograms</b> had diploid chromosome number equal 80 (2 n = 80). Homologous chromosomes did not differ between each other with quantity, size, centromeres location, length of arms, G bands and all were classified as proper <b>karyograms</b> of Tapirus terrestris species representatives. The X chromosomes {{as well as the}} first pair of chromosomes (both metacentric), were the largest among all analyzed, respectively. All remaining 38 pairs of chromosomes were acrocentric with Y chromosome as the smallest one (in males’ <b>karyograms).</b> Blood collected with blood sucking bugs proved to be unsuitable for cell culture. None of the seven established cultures was effective as lymphocytes obtained with this method did not show growth potential in prepared media. Thus, blood collected from the tapirs via Dipetalogaster maxima species did not show usefulness for cytogenetic studies due to the inability of cells to proliferation, even after {{a relatively short period of}} time elapsed since the blood sampling (1 to 2 hours) ...|$|R

Because this methodology is able to create <b>karyograms</b> from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material, we were able to use archival stored samples for which survival data were available and correlate frequently occurring copy number changes with disease outcome. No single region of genomic change showed significant correlation with survival. However, adopting a whole-genome approach, we devised an algorithm that relates to total genomic damage, specifically the relative ratios of copy number states across the genome. This algorithm generated a novel index, which is an independent prognostic indicator in early stage squamous {{cell carcinoma}} of the lung...|$|R

During a 3 1 / 2 -year period the chromosome laboratory of Rigshospitalet has tested the Magiscan chromosome system under routine conditions and performed the first evaluation of its clinical performance. The system consists of an image processor with a light pen for manual interaction connected to a hard-copy printer and a microscope with a TV camera and a motorized scanning stage for eight slides. Automated metaphase finding takes place without operator assistance. An operator {{is involved in the}} analysis after the metaphases are located. Using two of these complete systems, we have performed a total of 4, 691 chromosome analyses comprising a count of 10 metaphases, of which three were "eyeball" karyotyped and one was "machine" karyotyped.

40|$|Oral {{verrucous}} carcinoma (OVC) is categorised as a low-grade variant of oral {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (OSCC). The aetiology of OVC is unknown, and the suggested role of human papillomavirus (HPV) as a causative factor remains contentious. Distinguishing OVC from OSCC is problematic. The rarity of these lesions also makes them difficult to investigate, so most previous studies have been made on small numbers of cases. The {{aim of this study}} is to use next generation (NG) copy number (CN) sequencing to identify OVC and oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH) genomic features and determine if CN analysis could distinguish between the genomic damage pattern in OVH, OVC, and OSCC lesions. Additionally, this project aims to investigate the transcriptional and genomic changes that occur in OVC and compare them with the alterations that occur in OSCC using NG RNA-seq and whole-exome sequencing. Also, and since a verrucous appearance is suggestive of viral aetiology, this study aims to analyse OVC and OVH lesions for the presence of HPV. A total of 57 OVC and 16 OVH FFPE cases were identified for CN analysis and were analysed for the presence of HPV subtypes and for all known human viruses. The CN <b>karyograms</b> of those cases were compared with 45 OSCC <b>karyograms.</b> Transcriptome and exome sequencing were performed on a subset of OVC cases and the results were compared with OSCC sequencing data (all OSCC data belongs to Pre-cancer Genomic Group). CN results showed that the OVC lacked any of the classical OSCC genomic abnormalities such as gain of 3 q and loss of 3 p and demonstrated considerably less genomic instability than the OSCC cohort. OVC and OSCC profiles could be clearly distinguished. An HPV- 16 sequence was identified in one OVC and one OVH, and an HPV- 2 sequence was identified in one OVC out of the 73 cases but with low viral loads. Transcriptome sequencing also identified genes that are differentially expressed between the groups. Exome sequencing showed that OVC patients lacked mutations in any of the genes commonly associated with OSCC (TP 53, CDKN 2 A, NOTCH 2 etc.). Taken together, these results lead to the conclusion that no association between HPV infections and oral verrucous lesions. OVC is not a subtype of OSCC, but should be classified as distinct entity. The distinguishing features presented in this project should be of value in diagnosis. ...|$|R

These findings were combined with data from earlier studies to infer the genetic relationships between nine species via cluster analysis using the karyotype evolutionary distance (De) and resemblance-near coefficient (λ).

MethodsWe analyzed 20. 173 amniotic fluid samples for the period of 2006 – 2013 in our department. A conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on the samples.

40|$|Our {{retrospective}} karyotype review revealed two rare recurrent translocations affecting ETV 6 (TEL) : t(7; 12) (q 36;p 13) and t(7; 12) (q 32;p 13). Five {{patients with}} a 1 (7; 12) were {{from a group of}} 125 successfully karyotyped pediatric patients enrolled in consecutive clinical AML trials of the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group over a period of 7 years. During a search of available cytogenetic databases, we found 7 q and 12 p abnormalities in two additional Dutch patients and in three participants in Pediatric Oncology Group trials. A del(12 p) had been initially identified in four of these patients and re-examination of the original <b>karyograms</b> revealed a t(7; 12) (q 36;p 13) in two instances and a probable 1 (7; 12) in the other two. FISH confirmed the presence of a t(7; 12) (q 36;p 13) in the latter. Most (n = 7) also had trisomy 19. The t(7; 12) (q 36;p 13) (n = 9) was more com mon than the t(7; 12) (q 32;p 13) (n = 1). These subtle translocations were found only in children 18 months of age or younger. A literature search revealed that the 1 (7; 12) with breakpoints at 7 q 31 -q 36 and 12 p 12 -p 13 had been reported in six children with myeloid disorders and in two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; all were 12 months of age or younger.

40|$|Postponement {{of childbearing}} {{has led to}} {{increased}} rates of age-related female subfertility. Age-related decreases in ovarian follicle numbers and decay in oocyte quality influence the natural loss of fecundity and ultimately the start of menopause. The rate of ovarian ageing is highly variable among women, so it is relevant {{to be able to}} identify women who have severely decreased ovarian reserve for their age. Spontaneous Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) is the most extreme phenotype of ovarian failure at a young age. POF is characterized by spontaneous secondary amenorrhea before the age of 40. POF not only truncates the fertile lifespan, but also has major implications for long-term health (i. e. osteoporosis, cardiovascular health and cognition). The aetiology of the great majority of spontaneous POF cases remains unknown. Since family history {{has been shown to be}} the best predictor for early menopause and strong associations have been disclosed between the menopausal ages of mothers and daughters, sisters and twin pairs, idiopathic POF is most likely due to genetic factors. The aim of this thesis was to further elucidate the phenotype of premature ovarian failure and to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying this phenotype. Classically, ovarian dysfunction is categorized on the basis of cycle history and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Our study indicated that anti-Mllerian hormone, a novel ovarian marker, may provide a more accurate assessment of the follicle pool in young hypergonadotropic patients, especially in the clinically challenging subgroups of patients with elevated FSH and regular menses or with cycle disturbances but not fulfilling the POF diagnostic criteria. Early menopause is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events later in life. Concurrent with the menopausal transition, there is a shift in lipid profile. POF provides a route to studying the effect of cessation of ovarian function on lipid profile independent of the effects of advanced chronological age. We found that loss of ovarian function at a very young age (POF) coincides with subtle changes in lipid profile (higher triglyceride levels, marginal lower HDL-cholesterol). Androgens are better markers for unfavourable lipid changes than oestrogen levels or duration of oestrogen deprivation. A genome wide association study was initiated to identify new genetic variants involved in POF. We did observe a possible association with a single nucleotide polymorphism in ADAMTS 19, a biologically plausible candidate gene. This finding warrants a larger follow-up study to investigate its role in POF. Besides SNPs, the human genome contains multiple copy number variants (CNVs), small, sub-microscopic deletions and duplications. POF is associated with macroscopic deletions, in particular on the Xq arm. Using the intensities of high-density, genome-wide oligonucleotide arrays, it is now possible to obtain an increase in resolution of more than 100 times compared to conventional <b>karyograms,</b> and it is thus possible to detect CNVs. Sixty-three percent of the long arm CNVs (90 % deletion) mapped to locus Xq 21. Our findings are preliminary although the abundant overrepresentation of CNVs on Xq 21 further substantiates the important role of this locus in the genetics of POF...|$|R

Several chromosomes that cannot be distinguished or are difficult to discriminate in the DNA-based <b>karyogram</b> can now be distinguished as individual peaks, e. g., chromosomes 1 and 2. The peak of chromosomes 9 - 12 can be separated into two peaks formed by chromosomes 9 and 11, and 10 and 12, respectively. The advantage of the system applied in this study is that the DNA vs CI analysis is performed on-line, allowing chromosomes to be sorted on the bases of their CI. Pulse shapes of the selected chromosomes can be recorded simultaneously with the transmission of the sorting command. The purity of the sorted fraction can be estimated from the off-line inspection of these pulse shapes.
