When we attempt to evaluate the effect of OA on foraminifera, we have to consider (1) that the biological responses to OA differ among different life stages (i.e., gamete, neanic, or mature) and (2) the effect of each carbonate species (i.e., [CO 32 −], [HCO 3 −], and [CO 2]) on shell calcification. Kroeker et al. (2010) reported that the larval and <b>juvenile</b> phases <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> might be more vulnerable to OA. In fact, cultured juvenile Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sin.) individuals were more affected by reductions in pH than adults (Manno et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|The advective {{motion of}} {{seawater}} governs {{the transport of}} almost everything, animate or inanimate, present in the ocean and those lacking the ability to outswim the currents have to follow the flow. This makes modelling of advective ocean transports a powerful tool in various fields of science where a displacement of something over time is studied. The present thesis comprises four different applications of ocean-transport modelling, ranging from large-scale heat transports to the dispersion <b>of</b> <b>juvenile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms.</b> The aim has been to adapt the method {{not only to the}} object of study, but also to the available model-data sets and in situ-observations. The first application in the thesis is a study of the oceanic heat transport. It illustrates the importance of wind forcing for not only the heat transport from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean, but also for the net northward transport of heat in the Atlantic. In the next study focus is on the particle-transport differences between an open and a semi-enclosed coastal area on the Swedish coast of the Baltic Sea. The modelled patterns of sedimentation and residence times in the two basins are examined after particles having been released from a number of prescribed point sources. In the two final studies the transport-modelling framework is applied within a marine-ecology context and the transported entities are larvae of some Scandinavian sessile and sedentary species and non-commercial fishes (e. g. the bay barnacle, the blue mussel, the shore crab and the gobies). The effects of depth distribution of dispersing larvae on the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>Marine</b> Protected Areas in the Baltic Sea are examined. Further, the diversity in dispersal and connectivity depending on vertical behaviour is modelled for regions with different tidal regimes in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. The spatial scales dealt with in the studies varied from global to a highly resolved 182 -metres grid. The model results, excepting those from the global study, are based on or compared with in situ-data.

40|$|Realistic {{population}} {{models and}} effective conservation strategies require {{a thorough understanding}} of the processes that drive variation in individual growth and survival, particularly within life stages that are subject to high mortality. For fragmented marine populations {{it is also important to}} consider how processes driving variation performance may vary through space and time. In this study I assess the interaction of two primary factors driving juvenile demography: benthic habitat composition and larval history traits, in a temperate reef fish, Forsterygion lapillum (the common triplefin). It is well understood that <b>juveniles</b> <b>of</b> many <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> are closely associated with structured nearshore habitats as they provide resources (refuge and food sources) that are critical for juvenile growth and/or survival. Nursery habitats are often assessed using measures <b>of</b> fitness <b>of</b> <b>juveniles</b> inhabiting them (e. g. rates of growth). However individual fitness measures may not only be indicative of conditions experienced in the benthic phase, but also an individual's prior history. Recent evidence suggests that variation in larval traits at settlement (e. g., size and age at settlement, larval growth rate) can impact on subsequent ecological performance (e. g., feeding ability and/or predator avoidance) and therefore influence subsequent fitness (i. e. rates of growth and/or probabilities of survival). I used otolith microstructure to assess separate and joint effects of habitat composition and larval traits on the growth of young F. lapillum. Both macroalgal composition of habitat patches and larval traits affected juvenile growth rates, and results suggested that habitat composition may have the potential to mediate fitness-related advantages that may accrue to certain individuals as a result of paternal effects and/or larval dispersal history. Quantifying spatio-temporal variability in the post-settlement fitness of Individuals with that differ in larval traits is essential for effective spatial management <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> populations. I further explore the joint effects of macroalgal composition and larval traits, within the context of additional spatial and temporal environmental variation. Results provide direct evidence that habitat can mediate the strength of carryover effects, but that the impact of habitat was variable between local populations and settlement events through time. In chapter 4 of my thesis, I focus on how small-scale variation in macroalgal composition within a nursery habitat (while controlling for individual variation) can affect the strength of density dependent growth and survival rates of F. lapillum. Density-dependent survival is evident during the first 30 days after settlement, and the strength of density dependence varied as a function of macroalgal composition. Resulting variation in estimates of nursery value (i. e., the number <b>of</b> late-stage <b>juveniles</b> produced per area unit of habitat) highlight the importance of incorporating local scale variation in juvenile demography into assessments of nursery habitat. Lastly, I assess a potential strategy of fishes to persist in a wide range of benthic environments. The ability to adjust traits (i. e., phenotypic plasticity) may allow organisms that encounter a range of unpredictable environmental conditions to maximise fitness within a single generation. In chapter 5 I explore patterns of variation in morphology <b>of</b> <b>juvenile</b> F. lapillum from two different subpopulations and from different macroalgal habitats. I evaluate possible evidence for constraints on morphological variation arising from variation in growth rate prior to and following settlement. Results suggest that for organisms with complex life cycles, variation in growth rates experienced during dispersal may constrain plasticity in later stages...|$|R
