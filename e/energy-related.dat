5|$|Though oil has {{historically}} dominated the state's economy, a {{collapse in the}} energy industry during the 1980s led {{to the loss of}} nearly 90,000 <b>energy-related</b> jobs between 1980 and 2000, severely damaging the local economy. Oil accounted for 35 billion dollars in Oklahoma's economy in 2007, and employment in the state's oil industry was outpaced by five other industries in 2007. , the state's unemployment rate is 4.4%.|$|E
5|$|According to Forbes magazine, Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corporation, Chesapeake Energy Corporation, and SandRidge Energy Corporation are {{the largest}} private oil-related {{companies}} in the nation, and all of Oklahoma's Fortune 500 companies are <b>energy-related.</b> Tulsa's ONEOK and Williams Companies are the state's largest and second-largest companies respectively, also ranking as the nation's second- and third-largest companies {{in the field of}} energy, according to Fortune magazine. The magazine also placed Devon Energy as the second-largest company in the mining and crude oil-producing industry in the nation, while Chesapeake Energy ranks seventh respectively in that sector and Oklahoma Gas & Electric ranks as the 25th-largest gas and electric utility company.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's <b>energy-related</b> carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{economic}} climate, demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early 1980s, which led to structural changes at Hydro-Québec. It became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is Québec government, to which it pays an annual dividend.

25|$|World Bank (2010) {{commented on}} how the Kyoto Protocol had only had a slight effect on curbing global {{emissions}} growth. The treaty was negotiated in 1997, but in 2006, <b>energy-related</b> carbon dioxide emissions had grown by 24%. World Bank (2010) also stated that the treaty had provided only limited financial support to developing countries {{to assist them in}} reducing their emissions and adapting to climate change.|$|E

2500|$|Houston {{is known}} as a world capital of the oil and gas {{industry}} with over 5000 energy firms doing business in the region. Historically, Houston has had several growth spurts (and some devastating economic recessions) related to the oil industry. The discovery of oil near Houston in 1901 led to its first growth spurt [...] by the 1920s, Houston had grown to almost 140,000 people. The city is a leading domestic and international center for virtually every segment of {{the oil and gas industry}} - exploration, production, transmission, marketing, service, supply, offshore drilling, and technology. Houston dominates U.S. oil and gas exploration and production. The city remains unrivaled as a center for the American energy industry. In January 2005, the Houston Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSA) accounted for: 31% of all U.S. jobs in oil and gas extraction (38,300 of 123,400), and 14% of all U.S. jobs in support activities for mining (28,100 of 200,900).
