Jefferson said nothing about his {{construction}} of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E

5|$|Dante Alighieri was {{designed}} by Rear Admiral Engineer Edoardo Masdea, Chief Constructor of the Regia Marina, based on the ideas of General Vittorio Cuniberti who advocated a battleship with main guns of a single caliber and optimized for broadside fire.

Illingworth of Queen Mary continued their zig-zag pattern expecting the escort cruiser to give way.|$|E

5|$|Poedjangga Baroe paid {{subscribers}} {{were always}} fewer than 150. According to historian Heather Sutherland, this low circulation {{was rooted in}} several cultural factors. Firstly, the native populace at the time had limited literacy and education. Secondly, native intellectuals mainly spoke Dutch during formal discourse, while others <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> local languages; this led to comprehension issues for the Indonesian-language Poedjangga Baroe.|$|E

5|$|Proponents {{of the use}} of {{leverage}} argue that using leverage can be risk-reducing rather than risk-increasing provided four conditions are met: (i) enough unencumbered cash is <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> meet any margin calls (ii) leverage is applied to a well-diversified portfolio (iii) assets can be rebalanced frequently and (iv) counterparty risk is minimized.|$|E

5|$|The League also {{succeeded in}} {{reducing}} the death rate of workers constructing the Tanganyika railway from 55 to 4 percent. Records were <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> control slavery, prostitution, and the trafficking of women and children.

5|$|The {{municipalities}} of Voss and Granvin {{wanted to use}} the right-of-way for a hiking and bicycle path, and NSB canceled their plans. Demolish started on 10 December 1991, although the section from Voss to Palmafoss was <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> serve a cement factory. Two of the Class 64 trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Association and are based at the Old Voss Line in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|Venture <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> {{a steady}} {{bimonthly}} schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, {{and it was}} canceled in mid-1958. The large number of competing magazines probably hurt sales, though {{since many of the}} competitors lasted for only one or two issues, Venture {{can be thought of as}} at least a partial success. An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, No Limits, was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed to Joseph Ferman as editor.|$|E

Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of clutch failure.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, {{the entire}} High Seas Fleet, {{including}} Bayern and Baden, left harbor {{with the intention}} of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. However, at 05:10 on 24 April, the battlecruiser Moltke suffered severe mechanical problems and had to be towed back to Wilhelmshaven. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. In fact, there was no convoy sailing on 24 April; German naval intelligence had miscalculated the sailing date by one day.|$|E
