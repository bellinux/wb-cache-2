5|$|The road makes several {{appearances}} in literature. In Charles Dickens' <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield,</b> the titular character {{runs down the}} road trying to escape from London to Dover, though in the narrative the street is still partly rural in nature. After suffering an attack of amnesia, the main character of George Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter, Dorothy Hare, finds herself alone on Old Kent Road. In 1985, the BBC arts series Arena included a documentary about the road.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's books cover a wide range. His fiction {{includes}} short stories, bildungsromane (Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, 1911, and the Jeremy trilogy) that {{delve into}} the psychology of boyhood; gothic horror novels (Portrait of a Man with Red Hair, 1925, and The Killer and The Slain, 1942); a period family saga (the Herries chronicle) and even detective fiction (Behind the Screen). He wrote literary biographies (Conrad, 1916; James Branch Cabell, 1920; and Trollope, 1928); plays; and screenplays including <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield,</b> 1935.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's output {{was large}} and varied. Between 1909 and 1941 he wrote thirty-six novels, five volumes of short stories, two {{original}} plays and three volumes of memoirs. His range included disturbing studies of the macabre, children's stories and historical fiction, most notably his Herries Chronicle series, set in the Lake District. He worked in Hollywood writing scenarios for two Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films in the 1930s, and played a cameo in the 1935 version of <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield.</b>|$|E

5|$|Daniel Jacob Radcliffe (born 23 July 1989) is an English actor {{best known}} for his role as Harry Potter in the film series of the same name. He made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One's 1999 {{television}} film <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield,</b> followed by his cinematic debut in 2001's The Tailor of Panama. At age 11, he was cast as Harry Potter in the first Harry Potter film, and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011.|$|E
5|$|His {{father was}} {{released}} after three months, on 28 May 1824, but the family's financial situation remained poor and Dickens had {{to continue working}} at the factory, something for which he reportedly never forgave his mother. Years later Dickens wrote about the Marshalsea and other debtors' prisons in The Pickwick Papers (1836–1837), <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield</b> (1849–1850), and most extensively in Little Dorrit (1855–1857), whose main character, Amy, is born in the Marshalsea. Trey Philpotts writes that every detail about the Marshalsea in Little Dorrit reflects the real prison of the 1820s. According to Philpotts, Dickens rarely made mistakes and did not exaggerate; if anything, he downplayed the licentiousness of Marshalsea life, perhaps to protect Victorian sensibilities.|$|E
5|$|Sleight of hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of audience to see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield</b> often include illusions featuring sleight of hand in his stage shows.|$|E

5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield</b> led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 Selznick {{returned}} to MGM, {{this time as}} a vice-president in charge of his own production unit. During his two years with the studio he produced elaborate versions of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and Charles Dickens' <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield</b> and A Tale of Two Cities. In 1935, he left MGM to form his own production company, Selznick International Pictures, where he produced adaptations of Robert Smythe Hichens' The Garden of Allah (1936), Frances Hodgson Burnett's Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936), Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), and Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938). Selznick also became {{a pioneer in the}} use of Technicolor with the first and last of these films and also with his productions of A Star is Born and Nothing Sacred (both 1937). In 1939 Selznick brought Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman to the United States to star in Intermezzo and the following year he brought Alfred Hitchcock over from England to direct Rebecca. Also in 1939, Selznick produced his epic version of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, which became the most financially successful film of all time.|$|E

25|$|After living {{briefly in}} Italy (1844), Dickens {{travelled}} to Switzerland (1846), where he {{began work on}} Dombey and Son (1846–48). This and <b>David</b> <b>Copperfield</b> (1849–50) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.|$|E
