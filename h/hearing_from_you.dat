500|$|The scene {{garnered}} scrutiny {{from members}} of The Catholic League, a self-appointed organization that is not, despite its name, affiliated with the Catholic Church. The league had criticized The Simpsons depiction of Catholicism before, namely in the episode [...] "Lisa Gets an [...] "A"", which aired the year before. The scene included an exchange between Bart and Marge that the League felt was hurtful to Catholics. William A. Donohue, {{the president of the}} league, wrote Fox a letter asking them to explain why the dialogue was in the show. After failing to receive an answer several times, Donohue was at last given a reply written by Thomas Chavez, manager for broadcast standards and practices. The league were not satisfied with Chavez' answer. After [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" [...] aired, the Catholic League issued an article in their news magazine Catalyst. In it, they mentioned the scene in [...] "Lisa Gets an [...] "A"", and wrote that The Simpsons had [...] "struck again, big time" [...] with the Super Bowl commercial in [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday". They wrote that they had sent a complaint to Chavez regarding the scene, and encouraged others to do the same; [...] "We wrote to Mr. Chavez again, but we also told him that he’d be <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>you,</b> too. So don’t disappoint us." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the USA PATRIOT Act {{was passed}} it {{remained}} controversial, {{and began to}} be questioned by some members of Congress. On June 13, 2002 the House Committee on the Judiciary {{wrote a letter to}} Attorney General Ashcroft asking 50 questions about the use and effectiveness of the Act. In the letter they stated that [...] "he Committee is interested in <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> [...] and FBI Director Robert F. Mueller concerning the Department of Justice’s use of [...] and their effectiveness. In light of the broad scope of the Act, we are initially seeking written responses to the following questions, and we plan to schedule a hearing in the near future to allow further public discussion of these and other issues relating to the Department of Justice’s activity in investigating terrorists or potential terrorist attacks." [...] Only 28 questions were answered publicly, with 7 answered under separate cover to the Committee. Meanwhile, organisations such as the ACLU, the EFF and EPIC had not stopped opposing the most controversial parts of the Act. Three months after the official response to the Select Committee on the Judiciary, EPIC filed a Freedom of Information (FOI) request seeking the information that was not released by the U.S. Department of Justice. While the Department of Justice released a number of records in response to the request, they didn't release all the material, asserting that certain responsive records were exempt from disclosure. In order to gain access to these records, the ACLU and EPIC brought a civil action against the Department of Justice, and on November 26 U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ordered the Department of Justice to complete its processing of the FOI request by January 15, 2003.|$|E

She has never been permitted to call me anything but Captain; and {{on the rare occasions}} since our union, when circumstances may have obliged her to address me by letter, her opening form of salutation has been rigidly restricted to 'Dear Sir.'

60|$|MY DEAR MADAM:--Your two {{notes of}} to-day are before me. I {{answered}} the letter you bore me from General Fremont on yesterday, and not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> during the day, I sent {{the answer to}} him by mail. It is not exactly correct, as {{you say you were}} told by the elder Mr. Blair, to say that I sent Postmaster-General Blair to St. Louis to examine into that department and report. Postmaster-General Blair did go, with my approbation, to see and converse with General Fremont as a friend. I do not feel authorized to furnish you with copies of letters in my possession without the consent of the writers. No impression has been made on my mind against the honor or integrity of General Fremont, and I now enter my protest against being understood as acting in any hostility toward him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{the clerk}} {{had time to}} make any further investigations, his master returned, sorted the papers on the table, and {{carefully}} locked up the will in the strong box devoted to the custody of Mr. Noel Vanstone's documents.

If he was then employed in superintending the execution of his client's will--which is quite possible--it follows clearly {{that he was in the}} secret of Mr. Vanstone's address after the removal of the 4th of September; and if you can do nothing on your side, it may be desirable to have the lawyer watched on ours. In any case, it is certainly ascertained that Mr. Noel Vanstone has made his will since his marriage.

60|$|DEAR UNCLE:--I was {{disappointed}} at not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> this morning, but conclude {{you are very}} busy. I don't want Hope's books, but I think I'll rather have a football. We played Gloucester on Tuesday and beat them all to sticks (five goals two tries to one try!!!). It would cost 7s. 6d., and I'll make up the one-and-six myself out of my pocket-money; but you can pay it all just now, and then I'll pay you later when I am more flush than I am at present. I'd better buy it myself, or you might not get the right kind, so you might send the money in a postal order by return. You get the postal orders at the nearest postoffice, and inclose them in a letter. I want the football at once. (1) Not a book of any kind whatever; (2) a football, but I'll buy it myself; (3) price 7s. 6d.; (4) send postal order.|$|E

Of course your company {{would be a great}} pleasure, if it were possible for you to join me. The delay in <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>you,</b> through no fault of yours, has naturally put me out a little; but, on the whole, my plan still holds, and I shall leave this on Monday for Gibraltar, where the Great Liverpool will catch me, and carry me to Malta.

60|$|Lady Beaumont in {{a letter}} to my sister told her some time ago that it was your {{intention}} to have written to me, but knowing my aversion to letter writing you were unwilling to impose upon me the trouble of answering. I am much obliged to you for the honour you intended me, and deeply sensible of your delicacy. If a man were what he ought to be, with such feelings and such motives as I have, it would be as easy for him to write to Sir George Beaumont as to take his food when he was hungry or his repose when he was weary. But we suffer bad habits to grow upon us, and that has been the case with me, as you have had reason to find and forgive already.
