25|$|High {{pressure}} electrolysis is the electrolysis of water by {{decomposition of water}} (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) {{by means of an}} electric current being passed through the water. The difference with a standard electrolyzer is the compressed hydrogen output around 120-200 bar (1740-2900 psi, 12–20 MPa). By pressurising the hydrogen in the <b>electrolyser,</b> through a process known as chemical compression, the need for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated, the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%.|$|E

40|$|Efforts {{are being}} made to produce highly {{pressurised}} <b>electrolysers</b> to increase the overall energy efficiency by eliminating mechanical compression. However, in-depth modelling of <b>electrolysers</b> suggests that electrolysis at atmospheric pressure is electrically more energy efficient if parasitic energy consumption and gas losses are incorporated in both cases. The reversible cell voltage increases with increasing pressures. The electrode activation and Ohmic losses, leakage current and inevitable heat losses increase the electrolysis voltage beyond the thermoneutral voltage and consequently heat removal from the stack becomes essential. The expected gas loss at various operating pressures is incorporated to reveal the energy consumption that would occur in practice. Comparison of total energy consumption at various operating pressure up to 700 atm is performed and atmospheric <b>electrolysers</b> are found more efficient at all levels. Practical considerations such as corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, operational complexity, dynamic response and cost are less favourable for pressurised <b>electrolysers...</b>|$|R

50|$|The core of {{the system}} is a proton {{exchange}} membrane (PEM) <b>electrolyser.</b> The <b>electrolyser</b> converts electrical energy into chemical energy, which in turn facilitates the storage of electricity. A gas mixing plant ensures that the proportion of hydrogen in the natural gas stream does not exceed two per cent by volume, the technically permissible maximum value when a natural gas filling station is situated in the local distribution network. The <b>electrolyser</b> supplies the hydrogen-methane mixture at the same pressure as the gas distribution network, namely 3.5 bar.|$|E

30|$|The {{variability}} is {{the crucial}} {{factor for the}} dimensioning of an electrolysis-based hydrogen plant, as it requires <b>electrolysers</b> and auxiliary systems {{to be able to}} handle this variation and power converters to deliver the right voltage at different capacities with more or less same efficiency.

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{technologies}} available on the market, alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers.Alkaline <b>electrolysers</b> are cheaper in terms of investment (they generally use nickel catalysts), but less efficient; PEM <b>electrolysers,</b> conversely, are more expensive (they generally use expensive platinum-group metal catalysts) but are more efficient and can operate at higher current densities, and can therefore be possibly cheaper if the hydrogen production is large enough.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{could become}} a {{significant}} fuel in the future especially within the transportation sector. Alkaline <b>electrolysers</b> supplied with power from renewable energy sources could be utilised to provide carbon free hydrogen for future hydrogen filling stations supplying Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (HFCV), or Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) modified to burn hydrogen. However, {{there is a need}} to develop and use appropriate strategies such that the technology delivers greater economic and environmental benefits. In this work, the use of alkaline <b>electrolysers</b> to increase the capacity of integrated wind power in existing radial distribution networks is explored. A novel optimisation approach for sizing, placement and controlling <b>electrolysers</b> has been introduced, and its performance is assessed through modelling using a United Kingdom Generic Distribution System (UKGDS) case study. The controller objective is to dispatch alkaline <b>electrolysers</b> appropriately to maximise the total amount of profit from selling hydrogen and reduce the losses within the network while considering the realistic characteristics of pressurised alkaline electrolysis plants and satisfying the power system constraints. The impacts of increasing wind power capacity or the initial size of hydrogen filling stations on the results have been investigated and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract : Ultra-pure {{hydrogen}} can {{be obtained}} {{through the use of}} water <b>electrolysers</b> with dense metal cathodes. In this chapter, the theory of hydrogen evolution over Pd-based cathodes and its permeation through dense metal walls is introduced, and the Damköhler − Peclet analysis for these membrane reactors is described. Optimization of the electrolysis process is considered, based on the relationship of DaPe number with the cell overpotential and the apparent activation energy of permeation. Literature studies on hollow cathode water <b>electrolysers</b> are discussed, as are new prototypes using thin-wall Pd–Ag permeator tubes, and the efﬁcient operation of cell efﬁ ciency and surface activation/deactivation phenomena. The main applications of cells with Pd-based hollow cathodes are the production of ultra-pure hydrogen at high pressure for small scale laboratory <b>electrolysers</b> and the treatment of tritiated water. The results of tests on prototypes are examined in detail, and attention is given to future trends in material development...|$|R
30|$|The use of caustic {{solution}} (typically 25 – 30 weight %) in alkaline <b>electrolysers</b> {{requires the}} electrodes to exhibit good electrochemical conductivity, {{high mechanical strength}} and a strong resistance to corrosion from the caustic environment. Nickel, or a derivative of nickel, is {{the most commonly used}} electrode material in commercial alkaline <b>electrolysers,</b> due to its high electrical conductivity and its robustness to prolonged exposure in caustic alkaline solution.

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} a system for large size hydrogen production, storage and distribution to refueling stations for its employment in land transportation. Hydrogen is produced by pressurized alkaline <b>electrolysers,</b> employing time-dependent renewable electricity produced by a large size hydroelectric plant (100 MW); the hydrogen is stored into pressurized tanks and delivered by trucks to the refueling stations. Since the technologies related to hydrogen vehicles still present high costs, an alternative solution is investigated: the hydrogen produced by water electrolysis is converted into Hydro-methane (a blend of methane and hydrogen, where H 2 maximum volume content is 30 %), which is easier to be stored and transported to the refueling stations, considering its higher energy content in volume terms. Since electricity available from the hydroelectric plant varies widely throughout the year, a time-dependent hierarchical thermo-economic analysis is performed in order {{to investigate}} both the optimal size of the whole plant and {{the management of the}} alkaline <b>electrolysers.</b> The analysis is carried out for the H 2 and Hydro-methane plant lay-outs, comparing the results from energetic, strategic and economic point of view in a typical European economic scenario (Italy). For the different plant lay-outs, two energy scenarios are considered: (i) to feed the <b>electrolysers</b> only with renewable hydroelectricity during the year, keeping them off when it is not available; (ii) to purchase electricity from the national grid in shortage periods, in order to increase the utilization factor of the <b>electrolysers</b> and the production of H 2 and Hydro-methane for the refueling stations...|$|R

40|$|In {{the market}} there are {{conventional}} alkaline <b>electrolysers</b> and advanced polymer membrane <b>electrolysers,</b> with higher performance, {{but they are}} both quite expensive. Indeed, the materials commonly utilized for water electrolysis in alkaline <b>electrolysers</b> are those based on Raney nickel and their alloys, but these materials are expensive.

Int J Hydrogen Energy 2004; 29 : 235 - 41. [2]], to highlight {{how it is possible}} to produce hydrogen in economical ways using less advanced technologies. A conventional alkaline electrolytic cell, "lab-electrolyses", has been built using economical material. It is composed of electrodes of 5. 0 cm x 5. 0 cm characterized by a current density of about 250 mA/cm(2) and an efficiency of about 65 % at 55 degrees C; the cell produces about 2. 7 Nl/h of hydrogen. The overall cost of this devise has been compared with the cost of the <b>electrolysers</b> available on the market, hypothesizing a linear dependence cost with the productive capacity. The conclusion has been that there is a big margin for costs decreasing even taking into account all the auxiliary systems for an electrolysis process.
