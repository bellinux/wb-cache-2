Here we address this question using molecular dynamics simulations in comparison with neutron scattering experiments to study the effect of temperature and pressure on the local structure of liquid water. From both simulations and experiments, we find that the liquid structure at high pressure is nearly independent of temperature, and remarkably similar to the known structure of the high-density amorphous ice (HDA). Further at low pressure, the liquid structure appears to approach the experimentally-measured structure of low-density amorphous ice (LDA) as temperature decreases.

40|$|Martian surface {{morphology}} implies that Mars was once warm enough to maintain persistent liquid water {{on its surface}} and that water {{played a significant role}} in the formation of weathered/altered terrains [e. g., 1, 2, 3]. Volatiles exhaled by volcanic activity would have been the dominant greenhouse gases and would have significantly affected the Martian climate. The enrichment of some volatile elements in the atmosphere, which would have dissolved in surface water, could also have influenced water chemistry (e. g., acidity) and {{played a significant role in}} weathering and aqueous alteration processes. While much of this picture is qualitative, Martian meteorites contain records of major Martian volatile reservoirs. This study characterizes Martian surficial volatile reservoirs based on in situ ion microprobe analyses of volatile abundances and H-isotopes of <b>glassy</b> <b>phases</b> (groundmass glass [GG] and impact melt [IM]) in Martian basalts (shergottites). Although these meteorites are of igneous origin, some <b>glassy</b> <b>phases</b> underwent impact-induced modification that trapped surficial and atmospheric volatile components [4, 5]; e. g., inert gases contained in IMs from EETA 79001 (EETA 79) match the relative abundances of modern Martian atmosphere [6].

We investigate the Zr-Cu alloy system {{as well as a}} simple model for binary alloys, in which we can change the atomic size ratio between alloying components. In both cases, we found the same nature of icosahedral order in liquid and <b>glassy</b> <b>phases.</b> The icosahedral clusters are observed in liquid phases as well as in <b>glassy</b> <b>phases.</b> As the temperature approaches to the glass transition point Tg, the density of the clusters rapidly grows and the icosahedral clusters begin to connect to each other and form a medium-range network structure. By investigating the geometry of connection between clusters in the icosahedral network, we found that the dominant connecting pattern is the one sharing seven atoms which forms a pentagonal bicap with five-fold symmetry. From a geometrical point of view, we can understand the mechanism of the formation and growth of the icosahedral order by using the Regge calculus, which is originally employed to formulate a theory of gravity. The Regge calculus tells us that the distortion energy of the pentagonal bicap could be decreased by introducing an atomic size difference between alloying elements and that the icosahedral network would be stabilized by a considerably large atomic size difference...|$|R

5000|$|The glass {{forming ability}} of gallium(III) sulfide and {{lanthanum}} sulfide {{was discovered in}} 1976 by Loireau-Lozac’h, Guittard, and Flahut. [...] This family of chalcogenide glasses, referred to as gallium lanthanum sulfide (Ga-La-S) glasses, have a wide region of glass formation centred about the 70Ga2S3:30La2S3 composition and can readily accept other modifiers into their structure. This means that Ga-La-S can be compositionally adjusted to give {{a wide variety of}} optical and physical properties. Optically, Ga-La-S has a high refractive index, a transmission window covering most of the visible wavelengths and extending to about 10 µm and a low maximum phonon energy, approx. 450 cm−1. Thermally, the refractive index of Ga-La-S glasses has a strong temperature dependence and low thermal conductivity, which results in strong thermal lensing. However, the high glass transition temperature of Ga-La-S makes it resistant to thermal damage, it has good chemical durability and unlike many chalcogenides which are based on arsenic, its glass components are non-toxic. A clear advantage over other chalcogenides is its high lanthanum content which allows excellent rare-earth solubility and dispersion of the ions in the glass matrix for active devices. Ga-La-S can exist in both glassy and crystalline phases, in a <b>glassy</b> <b>phase,</b> it is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.6 eV corresponding to a wavelength of 475 nm; consequently Ga-La-S glass takes a deep orange colour. As with all chalcogenides the phase of the bulk is determined by two key factors; the material composition and {{the rate at which the}} molten material is cooled. These variables can be controlled to manipulate the final phase of the material.|$|E
