5|$|The Native Americans {{played the}} first folk music {{in what is}} now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near {{universal}} among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of harmony and polyphony, and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures. Traditional <b>instrumentations</b> use the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments, like drums, rattles, and shakers. Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music. Modern Native American music may be best known for pow wows, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed.|$|E

40|$|Java {{bytecode}} <b>instrumentation</b> is {{a widely}} used technique, especially for profiling purposes. In order to ensure the <b>instrumentation</b> of all classes in the system, including dynamically generated or downloaded code, <b>instrumentation</b> has to be performed at runtime. The standard JDK offers some mechanisms for dynamic <b>instrumentation,</b> which however either {{require the use of}} native code or impose severe restrictions on the <b>instrumentation</b> of certain core classes of the JDK. These limitations prevent several <b>instrumentation</b> techniques that are important for efficient, calling context-sensitive profiling. In this paper we present a generic bytecode <b>instrumentation</b> framework that goes beyond these restrictions and enables the customized, dynamic <b>instrumentation</b> of all classes in pure Java. Our framework addresses important issues, such as bootstrapping an instrumented JDK, as well as avoiding measurement perturbations due to dynamic <b>instrumentation</b> or execution of <b>instrumentation</b> code. We validated and evaluated our framework using an <b>instrumentation</b> for exact profiling which generates complete calling context trees of various platform-independent dynamic metrics...|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of {{computer}} programming, <b>instrumentation</b> refers to an ability to monitor or measure {{the level of a}} product's performance, to diagnose errors and to write trace information.

500|$|... "Borderline" [...] was {{recorded}} in February 1983 and ushered a change from Madonna's [...] normal vocal tone. A sentimental track, the song talks about a love that is never quite fulfilled. According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández in his book Madonna's drowned worlds, the song's lyrics like [...] "Something in way you love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free" [...] depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism. Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's <b>instrumentations.</b> It is considered {{the best example of}} the working relationship between Lucas and Madonna, and he pushed her to find emotional depth in the song. Although sounding icy, the chorus is contemporary in style, and the vocal range for this song was later used by Madonna as her own personal range through her whole music career. It opens with a keyboard rich intro played on a Fender-Rhodes electric piano and a catchy synth melody provided by Fred Zarr. Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture.|$|E

[...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6.

Beyoncé commented: [...] "My album is a good balance of... ballads and... mid-tempos with just ridin'-in-your-car feels, to a lot of... up-tempo club songs, to really sexy songs, to songs {{that make you feel}} emotional. It's a nice mixture of different types of tracks." [...] Although the album contains high-energy songs like [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Naughty Girl", the album's focal mode, however, is slow and moody. Beyoncé said that she had written lots of ballads for the album. According to Beyoncé, she wanted to be understood as an artist and showcase her range, and by doing so, she blended various genres and musical influences in the album. The album incorporates R, hip hop, soul and reggae influences. The album took hip hop influences from Jay-Z, Outkast, and Lil' Kim; the reggae is from Sean Paul; and courtesy of Storch, the album explores Arabic music.
