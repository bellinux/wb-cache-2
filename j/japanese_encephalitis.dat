5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E
5|$|Healthcare in Tripura {{features}} a {{universal health care}} system run by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of Malaria, Diarrhea, <b>Japanese</b> <b>Encephalitis</b> and Meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major Malaria outbreak.|$|E
5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E

25|$|JEV is a {{virus from}} the family Flaviviridae, part of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> serocomplex of 9 genetically and antigenically related viruses, some which are {{particularly}} severe in horses, and four known to infect humans including West Nile virus. The enveloped virus {{is closely related to}} the West Nile virus and the St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single-stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus into the inside of the cell. The genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, N4a, NS4b, NS5). NS1 is produced as secretory form also. NS3 is a putative helicase, and NS5 is the viral polymerase. It has been noted that <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> infects the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly accumulates substantial amounts of viral proteins for the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Encephalitis.</b>|$|E

The antigen of hemagglutination of <b>Japanese</b> B <b>Encephalitis</b> that has undergone a lowspeed centrifuge, indicates certain lowest value, at immediately after it expanding gradually to the maximum in a week. This is due to inhibiting substances contained in mouse brain, which the antigen is known to digest and reduce at a low temperature, owing to its fermentative action. With the Nakayama strain, it is due to this fact that the antigenal property has often been referred to; if we aim at a low density {{as well as at}} a comparatively high temperature in its preparation, this ability would appear without fail. In case the pH at the time of production proves higher than 7. 0, antigenical effect appears marked, while weak in inhibition; in case it is low, antigenal virtue proves weak, but strong in inhibiton. These inhibitive substances are the same with those containd in normal component of mouse brain, which, would not change because of infection to virus.
