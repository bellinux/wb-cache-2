There can be little doubt that, within engineering circles, composites have revolutionized traditional design concepts and made possible an unparalleled range of new and exciting possibilities as viable materials for construction. In addition to the well-known advantages of composite columns, partially encased composite columns offered simplified beam-to-column connection as well as reduced or omitted shuttering thus achieved more cost effective construction. Some companies have patented these new types of partially encased composite column made of light welded steel shapes; moreover, the Canadian Institute of Steel construction CISC has recognized and codified this type of columns.

The flexural strength of the beam specimens has been computed by an model analytic and verified by a model of finite element analysis.

40|$|Plate bridges with <b>encased</b> <b>beams</b> are {{suitable}} for building bridges of short and medium range. The paper presented focuses on the research into progressive bridges with <b>encased</b> filler <b>beams</b> of modified steel sections designed to minimize steel consumption without affecting essentially the overall structure resistance. This type of construction is suitable for bridges over short and middle spans as it offers a number of advantages, such as little headroom, quite clear static action of forces and a short construction period with no falsework required. Among some disadvantages is the economic inefficiency of steel I-sections, which are employed {{in the majority of}} bridges of this type. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of more economical design approaches and more purposeful arrangement and employment of steel beams.

Tests {{were carried out}} on a total number of twelve beams of four different sizes with a constant length of about 2. 0 m loaded by two points loading.

The tested beams were capable of reaching moments in excess of the thoretical predictions and thus lightweight concrete may be considered as a reliable component to be used in composite construction...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} fire resistance of partially <b>encased</b> <b>beams</b> (PEB). Fire resistance {{was determined by}} means of twelve experimental tests, according to European standard EN 1363 - 1, for different load levels and shear conditions between stirrups and web steel. Three tests were also performed {{at room temperature for}} load bearing resistance. The experimental setup was designed for this purpose, using a small fire resistance furnace and portal reaction frame. Details about the specimens tested, the instruments used and the characteristics of thematerials, are also presented. Load-deflection and load-strain results were determined at room temperature. Deflection and temperature measurements were determined under ISO 834 fire exposure. Results reveal the dependence of fire resistance on load level. An increase in 37 % on load level is responsible for a decrease in 28 % on fire resistance. Tests developed for the highest load level present similar fire resistance, independently of the shear condition; however, tests with welded stirrups present higher critical time. The main experimental results are presented and discussed.

40|$|Coupled {{shear wall}} {{structures}} are recognised {{as one of}} the most efficient lateral load resisting systems. To achieve a desirable performance for such a system, coupling beams connecting to the shear walls are usually subjected to a high shear stress, and are designed with a short span and relatively deep depth. However, the shear limitation of concrete and the brittle behaviour of normal reinforced coupling beams, when subjected to seismic load, are the key drivers in seeking new practical solutions, which can increase the shear strength and the seismic capacity of coupling <b>beams.</b> <b>Encasing</b> a vertical steel plate as shear reinforcement into the traditional reinforced concrete coupling beam is therefore considered as an effective way to improve the seismic performance and enhance the shear strength. In this thesis, an experimental programme and analytical model development on the shear capacity of steel-plate <b>encased</b> concrete coupling <b>beams</b> are presented. An experimental investigation is first conducted to study the shear strength and structural performance of steel-plate <b>encased</b> concrete coupling <b>beams</b> under both monotonic and reversed-cyclic loads. In the test programme, a new test rig was designed and constructed, with a unique rail and conveyor belt system, to simulate the coupling beam action under lateral load and, at the same time, to accommodate specimens with different span lengths in a rapid and easy manner. A total of eleven large-scale coupling beam specimens were fabricated, in which nine were constructed with encased steel plates while the other two were conventionally reinforced designed as control specimens. Within the eleven test specimens, four were monotonically loaded while the rests were reversed cyclically loaded. The influences of steel plate ratio, stirrup ratio and span-to-effective depth ratio on the composite coupling beams are discussed. The test results show that the shear strengths attained by all the steel-plate <b>encased</b> concrete coupling <b>beam</b> specimens are much greater than the shear stress limits given in the current codes of practice. In addition, the energy dissipation capacity of the concrete coupling beam can be greatly enhanced by the encased steel plates. The encouraging test results reveal the feasibility of using the steel-plate <b>encased</b> concrete coupling <b>beams</b> in general practice. A comprehensive database of the test results of steel-plate <b>encased</b> concrete coupling <b>beams</b> is first established herein. The database includes the available experimental data of 41 reinforced concrete coupling beams embedded with vertical steel plates tested by the author and other researchers. The available data in the database was then used to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the common design provisions in Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada and the United States, on the strength prediction of the steel-plate <b>encased</b> concrete coupling <b>beams.</b> A comparison showed that the shear contributions from all components, including the steel plate, stirrups and reinforced concrete, should be considered in determining the shear capacity of the composite coupling beams. Among the ten different design approaches, EC 4 (2004), JGJ 138 (2001) and YB 9082 (2006) give better strength prediction with the mean and COV of the strength ratios about 1. 03 and 25 % respectively. An analytical model known as Modified Softened Strut-and-tie Model is proposed to predict the shear strength of reinforced concrete coupling <b>beams</b> with <b>encased</b> vertical steel plates. The proposed model is derived mainly based on the softened strut-and-tie model and strip model. The shear resistance of the composite beam is contributed by two shear resisting mechanisms, which are diagonal and vertical ones. The shear strengths predicted by the proposed model show good agreement with the available experimental data. The proposed method provides a rational and effective means for predicting the shear strength of the steel-plate <b>encased</b> concrete coupling <b>beams...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ultra-shallow floor types {{such as the}} USFB® and DELTABEAM® beam ‘plug’ {{composite}} flooring {{systems are}} recently developed and have seen many applications in contemporary construction. They involve partially <b>encased</b> steel <b>beams</b> in concrete, with the lower flange remaining exposed. Besides the satisfactory behavior of the system at ambient conditions, understanding their response to elevated temperatures is critical in evaluating their overall performance. Previous numerical studies of the authors have investigated their fire resistance when simply supported. The computational analyses demonstrated that such flooring systems are experiencing severe thermal gradients and bowing. When such beams are axially restrained, the compression due to the restraining may produce second order effects on the bowed beams. On the other hand, the effect of axial restraints is difficult to be estimated because of the temperature’s non-uniformity across the cross-sections. For this reason, comprehensive finite element analyses (FEA) were implemented in this paper to simulate the response of such restrained beams subjected to fire.

40|$|Composite {{structures}} {{consisting of}} structural steel and concrete maximize {{the advantages of}} the two components provided that there is sufficient shear connection. When high strength materials are applied, the positive effect becomes even more apparent. Today, using high strength materials and partially concrete encased steel profiles {{is becoming more and more}} popular and requested in modern construction. Not only the fire resistance of the composite section but also the bending stiffness as well as the load bearing capacity can be increased significantly. Generally, the composite action is achieved by headed studs welded onto the steel web. Adhesion as well as friction forces between the steel profile and the concrete encasement contribute to the bond effect, however, due to creep and shrinkage of the concrete these effects can be diminished. Thus, the scope of the dissertation is to calculate the friction forces taking into account the time-dependent material properties. The present publication reports on the interaction between high strength concrete encasement and the high strength steel profile in composite bridges and industrial structures. Numerous experimental and theoretical investigations have been performed regarding the load carrying mechanisms and their characteristics. In order to determine the effectiveness of shear connectors in uncracked as well as cracked concrete a new shear test has been developed. The influence of shrinkage of the concrete encasement has been identified for distinct concrete ages by means of extensive measurement techniques. In beam tests the load carrying behavior and the rotation capacity of partially concrete <b>encased</b> composite <b>beams</b> has been investigated under positive and negative bending moments. In order to apply the yield-line theory it has to be verified that the yield strain of the steel profile is achieved before the concrete section fails due to the exceeding concrete strains. With increasing concrete strength the strain at failure decreases in contrast to the high yield strain which is required for the high strength steel to plasticize. The load carrying behavior of the concrete encasement is characterized by a three-dimensional stress condition where the bearable compressive strains are increased significantly. By varying the degree of shear connection of the concrete encasement the influence of a partial shear connection has also been determined. By means of non-linear finite element simulation not only the global load carrying capacity has been verified but also the internal mechanisms which occur in the composite cross section have been visualized. The results of the finite element simulation show different positive effects on the load bearing behavior of composite beams. In the bending moment region the encased concrete as well as the longitudinal reinforcement are activated primarily by friction bond between the concrete and the steel flanges. Friction bond is mainly governed by the flexural curvature of the beam and in positive moment areas by the lateral contraction of the structural steel in case of tension stress. In the region of negative moments the concrete is confined by the steel profile and the stirrup reinforcement. Thus, the sustainable concrete stresses are increased. If sufficient shear connection is provided, the concrete encasement is able to increase the capacity of the section against buckling. Based on own investigations and tests described in literature design recommendations for partially <b>encased</b> composite <b>beams</b> are developed. A novel plastic design method for composite beams with concrete encasement is presented for both, full and partial shear connection. The effects of the rotation capacity which is required to achieve a plastic strain distribution and the bond between the concrete encasement and the steel profile are considered as well as the influence of creep and shrinkage of the concrete...|$|R

A incorporação do perfil de aço na laje de concreto garante revestimento ao aço contra o fogo, melhorando o desempenho da viga de aço frente às ações do fogo. Com a finalidade de avaliar o desempenho térmico e estrutural desta solução construtiva, foram desenvolvidos modelos numéricos das vigas parcialmente revestidas presentes nesse sistema estrutural em duas etapas distintas: Na primeira é realizada a análise térmica bidimensional no pacote computacional DIANA para a obtenção dos campos térmicos nas seções transversais das vigas em questão e, a partir daí, considerá-los em um processador de cálculo de momentos plásticos resistentes em todo o intervalo de tempo analisado, sendo então possível avaliar a perda da capacidade portante da seção em função do tempo de exposição ao fogo. A segunda etapa {{consiste}} na criação de modelos numéricos tridimensionais em elementos finitos no pacote computacional DIANA, com o qual é possível obter o comportamento estrutural da viga mista de aço e concreto quando exposta ao incêndio padrão, considerando então os efeitos relativos à inclusão do gradiente de temperatura tais como a perda das propriedades mecânicas, a expansão e a interação entre os materiais. Tendo em vista as funcionalidades do código computacional DIANA, diversos modelos foram construídos procurando atingir a melhor aproximação com os resultados experimentais apresentados na literatura associados ao menor custo computacional possível. Dessa forma, foram analisados casos com (1) interação parcial e total entre o aço e o concreto e com (2) diferentes modelos constitutivos para os materiais em questão. Por fim, os resultados obtidos com a análise numérica a partir do DIANA são comparados com os do método dos momentos plásticos, que por sua vez, apresentam um custo computacional bastante reduzidoSlim floor frames consists on {{structural system}} in which the steel beam is completely or partially inserted in a concrete slab, that is usually used in profiled steel decks systems. The main goal of the slim floor systems is to obtain a minimum height of the composite beam section and, consequently, achieve a higher height of the floor or a lower total height of the building. The partial encasement of the steel beam in the concrete slab provides a thermal protection, improving the behavior of the beam when subjected to fire. In order to evaluate the thermal and structural behavior of the slim floor system, numerical models considering partially <b>encased</b> <b>beams,</b> which {{can be found in the}} slim floor structures, were created. The numerical evaluation procedure was divided in two steps. In the first step, a two-dimensional thermal analysis is carried out using the general finite-element software TNO DIANA to obtain the temperatures gradient in the cross section during the fire exposure time and then, use the data in a computational code developed in FORTRAN which calculates the bearing capacity, over the exposure time, of the slim floor beams by means of the plastic moment capacity method, using the reduction factors associated to the mechanical properties of the materials presented in Eurocode 4. The second step consists in to develop three-dimensional numerical models using the software TNO DIANA and then obtain the complete structural behavior of the beam when subjected to a fire condition. Another aspect related to the loss of mechanical properties was also considered, such as the thermal expansion and the interaction between the steel and the concrete. In view of the DIANA functions, several models were developed in order to achieve a better approximation, a low computational cost, of some tests results presented in wide world literature. The cases of partial and complete interaction between the materials were analyzed, as well as the different constitutive models for them, so that the results obtained at the two steps were compared, and an evaluation of the methods was don...|$|R

The reduction of community noise at airports generated during aircraft take-off {{has become a}} major research goal. Serrated aerodynamic devices along the trailing edge of a jet engine primary and secondary exhaust nozzle, known as chevrons, have been shown to greatly reduce jet noise by encouraging advantageous mixing of the streams. To achieve the noise reduction, the secondary exhaust nozzle chevrons are typically immersed into the fan flow which results in drag, or thrust losses during cruise. SMA materials have been applied to this problem of jet engine noise.

The SMA composition chosen for the fabrication of these beams is a Ni 60 Ti 40 (wt%) alloy. In order to calibrate the material parameters of the constitutive SMA model, various thermomechanical experiments are performed on trained (stabilized) standar...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to provide {{practical}} guidelines {{for the design of}} welded joints of steel truss for <b>encased</b> composite steel–concrete <b>beams.</b> The results of experimental tests are presented and interpreted. The steel truss is made of a steel plate acting as the bottom chord, made of S 355 structural steel, coupled with steel rebars which form the upper chord, and steel inclined web rebars (V-reverse) welded to the two chord elements, both of them made of steel B 450 C. Butt welded joints of web bar to bottom steel plate and fillet welding joints of inclined web bars to top chord bars were tested, as they are different from the ones which are normally used due to the coupling of different steel types and complex geometry. For the prediction of strength of fillet welding joints, two analytical expressions are derived: the first is based on a local failure criterion and the second on a limit domain of the welding section. Comparison with experimental data proves the equivalence and reliability of the proposed indications. Guidelines for choosing the effective dimensions of the fillet weld able to ensure a required strength are provided. For validation of the suggested guidelines, a high precision digital scanner is used to determine the geometrical characteristics of the fillet weld...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} Design by Analysis {{concept is}} a trend in modern {{pressure}} vessel and piping calculations. DBA flexibility allow us to deal with unexpected configurations detected at in-service inspections. It is also important, in life extension calculations, when deviations of the original standard hypotesis adopted initially in Design by Formula, can happen. To apply the DBA to structures under variable mechanic and thermal loads, it is necessary that, alternate plasticity and incremental collapse (with instantaneous plastic collapse as a particular case), be precluded. These are two basic failure modes considered by ASME or European Standards in DBA. The shakedown theory is the tool available to achieve this goal. In order to apply it, is necessary only {{the range of the}} variable loads and the material properties. Precise, robust and efficient algorithms to solve the very large nonlinear optimization problems generated in numerical applications of the shakedown theory is a recent achievement. Zouain and co-workers developed one of these algorithms for elastic ideally-plastic materials. But, it is necessary to consider more realistic material properties in real practical applications. This paper shows an enhancement of this algorithm to dealing with limited kinematic hardening, a typical property of the usual steels. This is done using internal thermodynamic variables. A discrete algorithm is obtained using a plane stress, mixed finite element, with internal variable. An example, a <b>beam</b> <b>encased</b> in an end, under constant axial force and variable moment is presented to show the importance of considering the limited kinematic hardening in a shakedown analysis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the flexural behavior of U-shape hybrid FRP-RC composite beams. The composite beams consisted of U-shape hybrid G/CFRP profile and <b>encased</b> rectangular RC <b>beams</b> with or without inner GFRP tube confinement at concrete compression zone of the beams. A total of 15 medium-sized (i. e. 1800  mm in length, 100  mm in width and 160  mm in depth) beam specimens were constructed and tested under four-point bending, including one ordinary RC beam as reference, 10 hybrid beams with and four hybrid beams without inner GFRP tube confinement. The examined experimental variables included: (1) different arrangements of G/CFRP layer in U-shape FRP profile, (2) inner GFRP tube, (3) conventional steel rebar, and (4) different types of FRP profile and concrete interfacial bond. Based on the testing, the failure mode, load–deflection relationship, ductility, energy absorption capacity and load-strain relationship of the beams were analyzed. The results indicated that compared with the ordinary RC beam, all hybrid FRP-RC beams experienced significant enhancement in cracking, yielding and ultimate loads. The ductility and ultimate load of the composite beams increased {{with an increase in}} the thickness of the hybrid FRP profile. The use of GFRP tube at concrete compression zone had a slight increase in the ultimate load of the hybrid beams but resulted in a pronounced enhancement of their ductility. Compared with U-shape FRP profile and concrete interface with a wet-bond type, the gravel-bond type prevented the U-shape FRP profile debonding from the RC beam effectively and in turn improved the yielding load, ultimate load and ductility of the hybrid beams. The hybrid U-shape FRP profile-concrete beams without steel rebar showed the catastrophic brittle failure indicating the necessity of using internal steel rebar for such hybrid beams...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The DELTA® beam {{composite}} {{floor system}} is a recently developed shallow floor type that has seen many applications in contemporary construction. It involves partially <b>encasing</b> DELTA® steel <b>beams</b> in concrete, with the lower flange remaining exposed. Besides the satisfactory behavior of the system at ambient conditions, understanding its response under elevated temperatures is critical in evaluating its overall performance. Despite certification from the manufacturing company that the system has adequate fire resistance, its behavior under fire conditions has neither been investigated to depth nor reported in detail. The {{purpose of this paper}} is the detailed numerical investigation of their behavior in fire. For this reason, the finite element method was implemented in this paper to simulate the response of such beams subjected to fire. Material properties were modeled according to the Eurocodes. The coupled thermal-structural parametric analyses involved four different variations of the “shortest” and “deepest” cross-section (eight case studies in total) specified by the manufacturing company. Other simulations of these cross-sections, in which either the thermal expansion or the structural load were not taken into account, were carried out for comparison purposes. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology for simulating such systems, which has been successfully implemented and validated against fire test results elsewhere (Maraveas et al., 2012) was also followed here. To investigate the statement made by Maraveas et al. (2014) and the equations proposed by Zaharia and Franssen (2012) that the insulation is not so effective for “short” cross-sections, two beams, one with a D 20 - 200 (Deltabeam Technical Manual, 2013) cross-section (shallowest section) and one with a D 50 - 600 (Deltabeam Technical Manual, 2013) cross-section (deepest section), were simulated in this paper for comparison purposes. Additionally, reasonable assumptions were made for the cross-sectional dimensions not specified by the manufacturer (Deltabeam Technical Manual, 2013) and parametric analyses were carried out to investigate their effect on the structural response of the system. Findings – Composite DELTA® beams can achieve fire resistances ranging from 120 to 180 min, depending on the depth and geometry of their cross-section, with deeper sections displaying a better fire response. The intense thermal bowing that occurs when these beams are heated from below has a more pronounced effect, in terms of thermally induced deflections for deeper sections. The satisfactory fire resistance of these beams is achieved due to the action of the concrete encased web and the reinforcement which compensate for the loss of the exposed lower flange. Increasing the thickness of the web in deeper sections improves their fire rating up to 180 min. The thickness of the lower flange affects the fire rating of the beams only in a minor way. Practical/implications – The paper describes a numerical methodology to estimate the fire resistance of complex flooring systems. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|When {{we speak}} about “travi reticolari miste“ {{we refer to}} a {{composite}} steel-concrete beam {{made up of a}} steel truss encased in cast in place concrete. The steel structure is typically composed of a plate or straight bars at the bottom, straight bars at the top and diagonal web bars: all these elements are connected with welded joints in a typical pyramidal shape. These beams have a particular feature: they can bear their own weight and the weight of the slabs without any provisional support during the “first phase” and then they can collaborate with the cast in place concrete during the “second phase”. The Italian Code - DM 14. 01. 2008 and Circolare 02. 02. 2009 n° 617 /C. S. LL. PP – deals with this kind of structures in § 4. 6 “Other materials costructions” and then in “Linee guida per l’utilizzo di travi tralicciate in acciaio conglobate nel getto di calcestruzzo collaborante e procedure per il rilascio dell’autorizzazione all’impiego” (Sept 2011) : composite beams are classified in three groups (A – B – C) depending on their features and for each group suitable norms are prescribed. In particular, for “A” beams we can refer to § 4. 3 of DM 2008 or to Ec 4, for “B” beams we can refer to § 4. 1 of DM 2008 or to Ec 2 while “C” beams require the authorization of Italian Superior Council of Public Works. Welded joints are very important in encased composite steel-concrete structures: the beam behavior depends on forces and stresses that pass through these joints and weldings must have specific geometrical characteristics and dimensions in order to provide an established strength and ductility. However welding process isn’t so easy because of elements geometry: in fact joints connect rounded surfaces, weldings can’t have the exact designed features and this problem represents the weak point of these beams. “TRR Ponte” was studied in order to realize a different type of <b>encased</b> composite <b>beam</b> in wich weldings could be achieved in a more precise way: in TRR Ponte top and web bars are not directly connected but they are jointed through a steel rectangular gusset plate that becomes a plane surface on which welding process is easier and faster. Furthermore bars are welded to the rectangular plates through corner joints that have precise geometrical characteristics and dimensions: in this way weldings can really provide the required strength and ductility. At the same time connection plates reduce the buckling lengths of compressed elements, that are diagonal and top bars: if slenderness is reduced, the design buckling resistance is higher and so the steel beam is more stable during the first phase, when concrete isn’t casted yet. Then there is another very important aspect: in TRR Ponte beams web bars can be put together and welded to the straight bars trough the connection plates working on a plane and then all the beam can be composed. In this way every step of the productive process is more efficient and functional. TRR Ponte is made up of S 355 steel type elements, so it can be considered an “A” beam following Italian Code and “Linee Guida”: this means that it should be designed as a steel truss beam to calculate its shear resistance. However, even if during the first phase there are only steel elements, in the second phase a composite beam is made up also of concrete and the struts that develop could influence and improve the shear behavior of the element. At the same time, we can’t use reinforced concrete algorithms because they are based on adherence between concrete and steel elements: in “A” composite beams we don’t use roughened steel bar so the bond stress capacity is very low and we need specific models to correctly evaluate composite beams shear resistance. In this research a new shear design model is developed and {{it is based on the}} “Strut-and-Tie method” and on the equilibrium equations applied to composite truss nodes. Experimental tests have shown the development of concrete struts between the rigid joints of the steel truss and so the formation of a composite truss as presumed in the Strut-and-Tie model adopted was confirmed. Also the TRR Ponte failure mechanism was exactly predicted by the design analytical algorithm even if failure beams loads were higher than expected. TRR Ponte shear behavior has been studied also by FEM numerical analysis: the simplified FEM model proposed allow to know the failure mechanism in a fast way and give a collapse load very close to the experimental one. The fatigue behavior of TRR Ponte could be another important aspect to analyze: joint connections and beam fatigue experimental tests could show new possible applications of TRR Ponte, for example integral bridges. In this type of structures, bearings and expansion joints are eliminated so that the sub-structure (piers and abutments) and the super-structure (deck slub) are made monolithic: composite beams could be used to realize the deck slab because during the first phase they could be connected to the abutments and then in the second phase casting concrete would integrate the structure. ...|$|R
