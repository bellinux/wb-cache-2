40|$|Aim: The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe the use of skin fold advancement flaps (SFAFs) and other reconstructive techniques for closure of large skin defects following mammary tumor excision in dogs. Materials and Methods: Twelve dogs underwent reconstruction of large ventral skin defects following mammary tumor excision with wide margins. Skin fold flaps (flank fold flap and <b>elbow</b> <b>fold</b> flap) were elevated from the flank and elbow region, respectively, and transposed and sutured onto the large ventral skin defect following mastectomy in all the dogs. In addition to the skin fold flaps, other reconstructive techniques such as undermining, walking sutures, and tension-relieving suture techniques were followed during surgery in the closure of large skin defects without skin tension and compromising limb mobility. The skin flap viability was assessed subjectively by gross observation of the flap such as color, temperature, capillary perfusion, and cosmetic appearance, and scoring (1 - 4) was done. Tissue samples were collected from a surgical site on days 3, 6, and 12 post-operatively for histopathological evaluation and healing status of the skin flap. Results: All the surgical wounds healed primarily, without any major complications and the skin flap remained healthy throughout the healing process post-operatively. Distal flap necrosis was noticed in one case and necrosis of skin flap between two suture lines was noticed in another case in which the necrotized distal portion healed by secondary intention after 7 days. The mean survival of subdermal plexus flap in the above cases was 98...|$|E

40|$|Background: Elbow pain is {{a common}} {{presenting}} symptom in repetitive motion performing athletes. Due to the popular use of prolonged conservative therapy in elbow pain, {{and the importance of}} early surgical intervention in <b>Elbow</b> Synovial <b>Fold</b> Syndrome, proper and prompt diagnosis is essential. In our case report, a 16 year old male right hand-dominant baseball pitcher presents with gradual onset of posterolateral right elbow pain over 4 months. Purpose: This study helps reflect the correct timeline in imaging along with the appropriate duration of conservative management. After reviewing this study the reader will be better able to differentiate between Lateral Epicondylitis and ESFS reducing the incidence of missed diagnosis and irreversible injury. It also exhibits the positive outcome of surgical intervention following the failure of conservative therapy. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on the internet including textbooks and journals on the topic of <b>Elbow</b> Synovial <b>Fold</b> Syndrome and <b>elbow</b> pain. Information was scarce and we were unable to find any meta-analysis studies on the condition indicating the opportunity for further research in this topic. Pertinent information was included on our retrospective case report. Results: High-definition ultrasound in conjunction with MR arthroscopic examination of the joint in conjunction will provide a definitive diagnosis of ESFS in a patient presenting with persistent elbow pain. First line treatment is conservative therapy for a period of 8 weeks to no greater than 6 months. At this point arthroscopic excision of the pathologic plica is performed to avoid irreversible articular cartilage degeneration. Outcomes after arthroscopic resection, focal fibrosis, and repair of chondral defects are excellent Conclusion: <b>Elbow</b> synovial <b>fold</b> syndrome can be found in athletes, especially those in sports that require repetitive motion of the elbow. It can be easily misdiagnosed. As in our case, even an MRI may show negative findings early on. CT or MR arthrography, along with dynamic US, are helpful in diagnosing ESFS and considered superior to MRI in this specific instance. A short course of conservative therapy is appropriate, however, If conservative therapy fails, then prompt arthroscopic excision is appropriate. As was noted in our literature search, cases on ESFS are lacking and the topic would benefit from retrospective data collection over large populations and a broad time period...|$|R

6000|$|But {{even without}} the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on that simple congregation--on the hardy old men, with bent knees and shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers, with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly farm-labourers' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under their black bonnets, and with their {{withered}} arms, bare from the <b>elbow,</b> <b>folded</b> passively over their chests. For none of the old people held books--why should they? Not {{one of them could}} read.

Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent too--all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery.|$|R

This investigation retrospectively analyzed 60 patients with elderly AE. Among the clinical characteristics, a male predominance, existence of several patterns of onset and clinical course, and associations with immunoglobulin (Ig) E-allergic-status and asthmatic complication were observed. The highest positive-rate and positive-score for serum-specific IgE against Dermatophagoides farinae were 83. 8 % and 2. 65 in patients with IgE-allergic AE, and a lower incidence of lichenified eczema in the <b>elbow</b> and knee <b>folds</b> were observed. In terms of treatments and outcomes, clinical improvement and clinical remission were observed in 80. 8 % and 36. 5 % of cases, respectively, using standard treatments and combined therapy with oral corticosteroid in severe cases. As for complications and final prognosis, most elderly AE patients reached the end of life with AE, but patients with IgE-allergic AE showed significantly lower incidences of complications of malignancy and death from malignancy.

5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his <b>folded</b> <b>elbow</b> or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|R
