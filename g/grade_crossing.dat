5|$|The first {{discussion}} {{of improving the}} intersection and <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> was a study in 1898, since which there have been about three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> and intersection {{as well as several}} other alternatives including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create barriers to walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was to depress Route 135 under the intersection to prevent it from being affected by trains passing through the <b>grade</b> <b>crossing.</b> Funds have not yet become available for final design and construction.|$|E
5|$|On February 25, 1937, the Port Richmond–Tower Hill viaduct was completed, {{becoming}} the largest <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> elimination {{project in the}} United States. The viaduct {{was more than a}} mile long, and spanned eight grade crossings on the North Shore Branch of the SIRT. The opening of the viaduct marked the final part of a $6,000,000 <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> elimination project on Staten Island, which eliminated thirty-four grade crossings on the north and south shores of Staten Island.|$|E
5|$|NY345 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US11 {{in the village}} of Potsdam, just north of Clarkson University. The route heads northwestward on Pine Street and Madrid Avenue as a village-maintained, state-numbered highway, crossing the CSX Transportation-owned St. Lawrence Subdivision by way of a <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> as it heads through a commercial and residential area. It exits the village shortly afterward, at which point the route becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. It heads northwestward on a linear path through the town of Potsdam, passing through mostly undeveloped areas comprising open fields and forests. NY345 curves slightly northward at Burnham Corners before crossing Trout Brook and entering the town of Madrid, where it traverses the New York and Ogdensburg Railway by way of a <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> just outside the hamlet of Madrid.|$|E

40|$|Many {{transportation}} agencies maintain grade as {{an attribute}} in roadway inventory databases; however, {{the information is}} often in an aggregated format. Cross slope is rarely included in large roadway inventories. Accurate methods available to collect <b>grade</b> and <b>cross</b> slope include global positioning systems, traditional surveying, and mobile mapping systems. However, most agencies {{do not have the}} resources to utilize these methods to collect <b>grade</b> and <b>cross</b> slope on a large scale. This report discusses the use of LIDAR to extract roadway <b>grade</b> and <b>cross</b> slope for large-scale inventories. Current data collection methods and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. A pilot study to extract <b>grade</b> and <b>cross</b> slope from a LIDAR data set, including methodology, results, and conclusions, is presented. This report describes the regression methodology used to extract and evaluate the accuracy of <b>grade</b> and <b>cross</b> slope from three dimensional surfaces created from LIDAR data. The use of LIDAR data to extract <b>grade</b> and <b>cross</b> slope on tangent highway segments was evaluated and compared against <b>grade</b> and <b>cross</b> slope collected using an automatic level for 10 test segments along Iowa Highway 1. <b>Grade</b> and <b>cross</b> slope were measured from a surface model created from LIDAR data points collected for the study area.

5|$|After {{environmental}} {{studies on the}} White Slough, Caltrans widened and elevated that section {{of the road and}} converted it to a freeway. To accommodate bicycles and pedestrians, a cycleway was built along the eastbound side of the freeway. Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad <b>grade</b> <b>crossing).</b> The project was completed in the summer of 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the B began {{a project}} to raise the tracks of the New Hampshire Main and the {{southern}} end of the Woburn Branch for a mile through Winchester, eliminating a troublesome <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> downtown. Boxy two-story brick stations opened at Wedgemere and Winchester Center in 1957. The ticket office in the new station was closed in 1960 after just three years in service; thereafter, passengers bought tickets on the train. The station building hosted a coffee shop from 2008 to 2014.|$|E

5|$|The Fitchburg Railroad {{main line}} opened on an east-west {{alignment}} through the tiny village of South Groton in Groton, Massachusetts in December 1845. Following a town vote the previous year, Groton station was established at Flannigan's Crossing (Groton-Harvard Road). The station was {{located on the}} southwest corner of the <b>grade</b> <b>crossing,</b> with a freight house just to its west and a woodshed (to supply early wood-burning locomotives) across the tracks.|$|E
5|$|Positive {{train control}} became a Federal mandate {{with the passing}} of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. After review, the FRA waiver was granted in May 2010, marking the first time lighter-weight EMUs were allowed to share rails with freight in the United States. The grant was {{conditioned}} on meeting nine additional requirements, including demonstrating minimum crashworthiness, seating, improving <b>grade</b> <b>crossing,</b> meeting FRA positive train control standards in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 236 with CBOSS, formalizing the temporal separation plan, and issuing a safety system program.|$|E

SR202 then crosses a railroad <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> and bridges the Sammamish River, before turning south onto Redmond–Woodinville Road. The highway travels south along {{the west side of}} the Sammamish River valley into Woodinville wine country, a district of wineries and tasting rooms south of Woodinville. SR202 turns east onto NE 145th Street and crosses over the Sammamish River, and then enters the first in a series of three roundabouts that turn the highway southward.|$|E
40|$|We present use of SNP {{technologies}} to obtain {{for the first}} time, rapid, large-scale, in situ estimates of performance of crossbred cows in smallholder herds. Compared to historical approaches, our approach allowed optimum crossbreed choices to be determined more rapidly and without question about {{the relevance of the}} environment. High-density SNP assays were used to estimate breed composition for a monitored population comprising 1292 cows from 610 smallholder farms in Kenya. The achieved milk yields are much lower than generally assumed and lactation curves are very flat out to 400 days. In poor production environments, lower <b>grade</b> <b>crosses</b> (containing < 60 % exotic dairy alleles) had the same yield as high <b>grade</b> <b>crosses.</b> Allowing for the larger size and maintenance requirements of high grade exotics, lower grade exotics will be the most economically productive animals in these environments.

5|$|In 1895, the Fitchburg and B {{demolished}} the 1848-built union station. Two new station buildings {{opened to}} replace it: a passenger station (the {{centerpiece of the}} new Depot Square) in {{the northeast corner of}} the junction, and a freight station in the southeast which replaced the formerly separate freight houses. In 1897, the junction of the P was relocated slightly to the west to eliminate angled grade crossings of Main Street and Park Street. An island platform was constructed around that time between the two Fitchburg main tracks east of the diamond crossing to serve commuters to Boston. In 1906, East Main Street was rerouted onto a bridge east of the station, eliminating traffic problems caused when trains blocked the <b>grade</b> <b>crossing.</b> The old Stony Brook freight house and engine house were removed as part of the construction. Two signal bridges built at right angles over the junction in the 1910s and an interlocking tower built in 1929 controlled the various train movements across the complex junction.|$|E
5|$|In Fairport, NY250 follows South Main Street down a large {{hill that}} levels {{off at the}} {{southern}} edge of the village's business district. Here, NY250 intersects Church Street (NY31F) and passes by the First Baptist Church of Fairport, located on the northwestern corner of the junction. The route continues north {{into the center of the}} village, passing by several small businesses and Fairport Village Landing—the largest shopping plaza in the village—before crossing over the Erie Canal by way of a lift bridge and becoming North Main Street. Once on the north side of the canal, NY250 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester and West Shore Subdivisions at a single <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> ahead of High Street. At this point, the businesses give way to homes as the highway ascends a hill at the north end of the village and meets Whitney Road at the northern village line.|$|E
