On that front enemy is served by broad–gauge railway with good lateral {{communications}} and apparently ideal ground for defence. Broad–gauge railway would put him on level with me as regards numbers that could be maintained. I should require 16 or 18 divisions besides my mounted corps to ensure success against Damascus–Beirut line if strongly held, but this is probably more than my railway could support. My estimate is made on the supposition enemy will make use of his broad-gauge railway to its full capacity. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> out that Aleppo is 350miles distant and my single line of railway advances {{about half a mile}} a day. Railhead of my double line is at Bir el Mazar, but the doubling of railway has had to be stopped during my present advance. For my immediate plans see my telegram No. E.A. 598 14 December, and I think it advisable before advancing much further north to clear Turkish forces on Medina railway." [...] Allenby had reported on 14 December that the rainy season would stop a renewal of operations for at least two months.|$|E

25|$|Marriage is the {{cornerstone}} on which our society was founded.

60|$|Finally, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} if life is crowned by its success and devotion in {{industrial}} organization and ingenuity, we had better worship the ant and the bee (as moralists urge us to do in our childhood), and humble ourselves before the arrogance of the birds of Aristophanes.|$|E

The above list {{of names}} {{may appear to be}} {{somewhat}} long; but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> out that the fighting was almost constant for a week, and was of such a close nature as to demand incessant exertion from every officer in the force, and to elicit constant acts of courage and gallant example which cannot be overlooked.|$|E

"What I {{complain}} of," [...] {{the professor}} began, speaking with elaborate and impressive slowness, [...] "is that my performance is hurried over and that too long a time {{is taken up}} by Beatrice's songs.

This particular drawing of Mr. Huyshe's, for instance, proves absolutely nothing, except that our grandfathers did not understand the proper laws of dress. There is not a single rule of right costume which is not violated in it, for it gives us stiffness, tightness and discomfort instead of comfort, freedom and ease.|$|E
60|$|On the haggard face {{of every}} man among these prisoners, the same {{expression}} sat. I know not what to liken it to. It had {{something of that}} strained attention which we see upon {{the faces of the}} blind and deaf, mingled with a kind of horror, as though they had all been secretly terrified. In every little chamber that I entered, and at every grate through which I looked, I seemed to see the same appalling countenance. It lives in my memory, with the fascination of a remarkable picture.

6000|$|And {{the whole}} {{strength}} of our collective intelligence will be directed first to {{reducing the amount of}} such irksome work by labour-saving machinery, by ingenuity of management, and by the systematic avoidance of giving trouble as a duty, and then to so distributing the residuum of it that it will become the whole life of no class whatever in our population. I have already quoted the idea of Professor William James of a universal conscription for such irksome labour, and while he would have instituted that mainly for its immense moral effect upon the community, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> out that, combined with a nationalisation of transport, mining, and so forth, it is also a way to a partial solution of this difficulty of [...] "mere toil." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} the artistic spirit working, first in the {{delightful}} and technical sphere of language, the sphere of expression as opposed to subject, then controlling {{the imagination of the}} poet in dealing with his subject. And now <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> out to you its operation in the choice of subject. The recognition of a separate realm for the artist, a consciousness of the absolute difference between the world of art and the world of real fact, between classic grace and absolute reality, forms not merely the essential element of any aesthetic charm but is the characteristic of all great imaginative work and of all great eras of artistic creation - of the age of Phidias as of the age of Michael Angelo, of the age of Sophocles as of the age of Goethe.|$|E

60|$|The {{walk back}} from the summer-house through the wood is very lovely; {{but it would be}} a disappointing walk to {{visitors}} who had been prevented by a flood in the river from coming up the channel, for it indicates plainly how requisite it is that the river should be seen from below and not from above. The best view of the larger fall itself is that seen from the wood. And here again <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> out that any male visitor should walk the channel of the river up and down. The descent is too slippery and difficult for bipeds laden with petticoats. We found a small hotel open at Trenton, at which we got a comfortable dinner, and then in the evening were driven back to Utica.|$|E
60|$|Long hours, too, of the {{none too}} many {{which will make}} up my life would melt away like snow in Mrs Monnerie's library. A button {{specially}} fixed {{for me in the}} wainscot would summon a manservant. Having ranged round the lofty walls, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> up at what books I wanted. They would be strewn around me on the floor--gilded and leathery volumes, some of them almost of my own height, and many times my weight. I would open the lid, turn the great pages, and carefully sprawling on my elbows between them, would pore for hours together on their coloured pictures of birds and flowers, gems and glass, ruins, palaces, mountains--hunting, cock-fighting, fashions, fine ladies, and foreign marvels. And I dipped into novels so like the unpleasanter parts of my own life that they might just as well have been autobiographies.|$|E
6000|$|In {{concluding}} {{this brief}} {{sketch of a}} great subject, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>point</b> out its bearing upon {{the future of the}} human race. If my conclusions are just, it must inevitably follow that the higher--the more intellectual and moral--must displace the lower and more degraded races; and the power of [...] "natural selection," [...] still acting on his mental organization, must ever lead to the more perfect adaptation of man's higher faculties to the conditions of surrounding nature, and to the exigencies of the social state. While his external form will probably ever remain unchanged, except in the development of that perfect beauty which results from a healthy and well organized body, refined and ennobled by the highest intellectual faculties and sympathetic emotions, his mental constitution may continue to advance and improve, till the world is again inhabited by a single nearly homogeneous race, no individual of which will be inferior to the noblest specimens of existing humanity.|$|E
