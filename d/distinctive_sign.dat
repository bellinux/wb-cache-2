5|$|The beak of the kakapo {{is adapted}} for {{grinding}} food finely. For this reason, the kakapo {{has a very}} small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food. It is particularly fond of {{the fruit of the}} rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a <b>distinctive</b> <b>sign</b> of the presence of the bird. The kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.|$|E

Wherever she was, she was herself the great piece in the gallery. It was the first Fleda had heard of there being [...] "rubbish" [...] at Poynton, but she didn't for the moment take up this insincerity; she only, from where {{she stood in the}} room, called out, one after the other, as if she had had a list in her hand, the pieces that in the great house had been scattered and that now, if they had a fault, were too much like a minuet danced on a hearth-rug. She knew them each, in every chink and charm--knew them by the personal name their <b>distinctive</b> <b>sign</b> or story had given them; and a second time she felt how, against her intention, this uttered knowledge struck her hostess as so much free approval. Mrs. Gereth was never indifferent to approval, and {{there was nothing she could}} so love you for as for doing justice to her deep morality. There was a particular gleam in her eyes when Fleda exclaimed at last, dazzled by the display: [...] "And even the Maltese cross!" [...] That description, though technically incorrect, had always been applied, at Poynton, to a small but marvelous crucifix of ivory, a masterpiece of delicacy, of expression, and of the great Spanish period, the existence and precarious accessibility of which she had heard of at Malta, years before, by an odd and romantic chance--a clue followed through mazes of secrecy till the treasure was at last unearthed.|$|E
