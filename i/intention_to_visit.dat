500|$|After resigning the Royal secretariat {{of state}} in 1625, the new Baron Baltimore made clear his <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the colony: [...] "I intend shortly," [...] he wrote in March, [...] "God willing, a journey for Newfoundland to visit a {{plantation}} which I began there some few years since." [...] His plans were disrupted {{by the death of}} King James I, and by the crackdown on Catholics with which King Charles I began his reign to appease his opponents. The new King required all privy councillors to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance; and since Baltimore, as a Catholic, had to refuse, he was obliged to step down from that cherished office. Given the new religious and political climate, and perhaps also to escape a serious outbreak of plague in England, Baltimore moved to his estates in Ireland. His expedition to Newfoundland had set sail without him in late May 1625 under Sir Arthur Aston, who became the new provincial Governor of Avalon.|$|E

The officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the Bogside and Creggan districts. [...] A 'peace corps' was formed to maintain law and order. When the British Home Secretary, Jim Callaghan, visited Northern Ireland and announced his <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the Bogside on 28 August, he was told {{that he would not be}} allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him. Callaghan agreed. [...] Accompanied by members of the Defence Committee, he was [...] "swept along by a surging crowd of thousands" [...] up Rossvile Street and into Lecky Road, where he [...] "took refuge" [...] in a local house, and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window. In preparation for Callaghan's visit the [...] "Free Derry" [...] wall was painted white and the [...] "You are now entering Free Derry" [...] sign was professionally re-painted in black lettering.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{research}} is to investigate the direct and indirect influence of country personality dimensions on consumer behavioral <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a specific country, considering affective country image as a mediator. A quota sample of 685 valid respondents from Brazil was analyzed. Portugal was chosen as the stimulus country and the questionnaire was delivered in Portuguese for Brazilians. AMOS 20. 0 was employed to examine the proposed model. The predictors of behavioral <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> explain around 67 % of its variance. Affective country image is seen a perfect/full mediator between country personality and behavioral <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit.</b> Thus, country personality dimensions have a positive indirect effect on behavioral <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit.</b> Assiduousness and agreeableness show a positive significant influence on affective country image, whereas snobbism shows a significant negative influence. International business marketers should focus on developing marketing strategies emphasizing the distinctive personality of their country destinations.

The data were collected by applying an online questionnaire to respondents in four countries. Hypotheses are tested with structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The results verify that the extended TPB model has good explanatory power and that destination familiarity and self-concept, in particular the ideal social self, help to differentiate what drives short and long-haul travelers' <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Chile. Perceived behavioral control and subjective norms are the strongest predictors of both short and long-haul travelers’ <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Chile for vacation...|$|R

He had never told her the secret of their Indian paternity, as it had been revealed to him from the scornful lips of Gray Eagle a year ago; he knew her strangely excitable nature; besides, she was a wife now, and the secret would have to be shared with her husband. When he himself had recovered from the shock of the revelation, two things had impressed themselves upon his reserved and gloomy nature: a horror of his previous claim upon the Atherlys, and an infinite pity and sense of duty towards his own race. He had devoted himself and his increasing wealth to this one object; it seemed to him at times almost providential that his position as a legislator, which he had accepted as a whim or fancy, should have given him this singular opportunity.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps, too, {{it was his}} <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Rome; {{but while}} at Ostia he became {{involved}} in a quarrel with the bishop that resided there, which led him at length to leave Ostia abruptly, and to refuse to go to Rome. The cause of the quarrel was the bishop's asking him to pay some money that he owed the Pope. In all the Catholic countries of Europe, in those days, there were certain taxes and fees that were collected for the Pope, the income from which was of great importance in making up the papal revenues. Now Richard, in his eagerness to secure all the money he could obtain in England to supply his wants for the crusade, had appropriated to his own use certain of these church funds, and the bishop now called upon him to reimburse them. This application, as might have been expected, made Richard extremely angry. He assailed the bishop with the most violent and abusive language, and charged all sorts of corruption and wickedness against the papal government itself. These charges may have been true, but the occasion of being called upon {{to pay a debt}} was not the proper time for making them.

6000|$|The Regent, therefore, {{warned in}} her proclamations men, often {{challenged}} previously, and as often allowed, under fear of armed resistance, to escape. All that followed {{was but a}} repetition of the feeble policy of outlawing these four or five men. Finally, in May 1559, these preachers had a strong armed backing, and seized a central strategic point, so the Revolution blazed out on a question which had long been smouldering and on an occasion that had been again and again deferred. The Regent, far from having foreseen and hardened her heart to carry out an organised persecution and [...] "cut the throats" [...] of all Protestants in Scotland, was, in fact, intending to go to France, being in the earlier stages of her fatal malady. This appears from a letter of Sir Henry Percy, from Norham Castle, to Cecil and Parry (April 12, 1559) {95b} Percy says that the news in his latest letters (now lost) was erroneous. The Regent, in fact, [...] "is not as yet departed." [...] She is very ill, and her life is despaired of. She is at Stirling, where the nobles had assembled to discuss religious matters. Only her French advisers were {{on the side of}} the Regent. [...] "The matter is pacified for the time," [...] and in case of the Regent's death, Chatelherault, d'Oysel, and de Rubay are to be a provisional committee of Government, till the wishes of the King and Queen, Francis and Mary, are known.

40|$|The study {{constructs}} {{a temporal}} model of wine tourist {{behavior on the}} basis of the social psychologist 2 ̆ 7 theory of consumer attitudes and related concepts with regard to past behavior, satisfaction, perceived value, and behavioral intentions. This study proposed that wine festival attendees 2 ̆ 7 <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> revisit the festival would be affected by their satisfaction with, perceived value of, and past behavior regarding the festival. Past <b>visits,</b> satisfaction and <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> revisit resemble respectively the cognitive, affective and conative components conceptualized in the structural model of consumer attitudes. Perceived value was included to strengthen the measurement of satisfaction. Meanwhile, the model attempts to reflect the temporal nature of wine tourist experience by encompassing the stages of pre-visit, on-site visit and post-visit. More importantly, this study added two variables to this model of <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> revisit by proposing that satisfaction and perceived value had impact on attendees 2 ̆ 7 <b>intentions</b> (1) <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a local winery and (2) to buy local wine products. Using a path analysis approach and data collected from the attendees at a regional wine festival, the study examined the above relationships. The study also examined the possible mediating effects of demographic characteristics on the variables included in the hypothesized model. The results of this path analysis can be summarized as: (1) past <b>visits</b> influenced future <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> revisit and the level of perceived value but had no effect on levels of satisfaction; (2) perceived value strongly affected satisfaction; (3) satisfaction had an impact on future <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> revisit, <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> local wineries, and to buy local wine products, while perceived value only affected the former two intentions; and (4) education had medicating effect on <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> revisit the festival, <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> local wineries, and to buy local wine products. Age had mediating effect on <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> local wineries and to buy local wine products. Income had a mediating effect on <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> revisit the festival. This research makes unique contributions to the area of consumer research in wine tourism from both the theoretical and empirical perspectives. It is believed that results of the present study will be useful to organizers of wine festivals and/or managers of wineries. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide greater {{understanding}} of wine tourist behaviour through profiling wine tourists. Demographic segmentation alone is a poor predictor of tourist behaviour (Prentice et al., 1998), whilst there is a general preference for psychographic segmentation. Many studies have evaluated wine region attributes, however, it is important to recognize that the importance of these attributes differ based on the wine tourist profile in question. Profiling also includes attitudes toward wine regions, satisfaction of previous <b>visits</b> and future <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit.</b> ?Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was used, collecting data from a total of 650 wine consumers within Australia through self-administered surveys and online/email self-administered surveys. Data analysis techniques used included exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and analysis of variance (ANOVA). ?Findings Four wine tourist profiles were explored: the wine lover, the wine interested tourist, the wine curious tourist and the disinterested wine tourist. Significant differences were found between the four wine profiles with regard to important wine region attributes, satisfaction and attitudes toward wine regions and future <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a wine region. ?Practical implications The outcome of this research provides greater understanding of wine tourist segments. Profiling wine tourists provides wineries and cellar doors the opportunity to build strong relationships with each wine tourist profile through understanding their expectations of the wine tourism experience.
