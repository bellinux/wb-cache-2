40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{the most}} frequent lethal genetic disorder among Caucasians. It depends on alterations of a chloride channel expressed by most epithelial cells and encoded by CFTR gene. Also using scanning techniques to analyze the whole coding regions of CFTR gene, mutations are not identified in up to 10 % of CF alleles, and such figure increases in CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RD). Other gene regions may {{be the site of}} causing-disease mutations. We searched for genetic variants in the 1500 bp of CFTR 3 ' untranslated region, typical target of microRNA (miRNA) posttranscriptional gene regulation, in either CF patients with the F 508 del homozygous genotype and different clinical expression (n = 20), CF (n = 32) and CFTR-RD (n = 43) patients with one or none mutation after CFTR scanning and in controls (n = 50). We identified three SNPs, one of which, the c. * 1043 A>C, was located in a region predicted to bind miR- 433 and miR- 509 - 3 p. Such mutation was peculiar of a CFTR-RD patient that had Congenital Bilateral Absence of Vas Deferens (CBAVD), diffuse bronchiectasis, a borderline sweat chloride test and the heterozygous severe F 508 del mutation on the other allele. The expression analysis demonstrated that the c. * 1043 A>C increases the affinity for miR- 509 - 3 p and slightly decreases that for the miR- 433. Both miRNAs cause in vitro a reduced expression of CFTR protein. Thus, the c. * 1043 A>C may act as a mild CFTR mutation enhancing the affinity for <b>inhibitory</b> <b>miRNAs</b> as a novel pathogenetic mechanism in CF...|$|E
40|$|Gliomas are {{the most}} common and {{aggressive}} primary tumors in the central nervous system. Recently, Max interactor- 1 (MXI 1), an antagonist of c-Myc that is involved in brain tumor progression, has been reported to be deregulated in a variety of tumors including glioma. However, the mechanism of MXI 1 deregulation in gliomas remains unclear. In this study, we show that the relative expression level of MXI 1 is markedly down-regulated in glioma cell lines. Using integrated bioinformatic analysis and experimental confirmation, we identified several miRNAs by screening a panel of predicted miRNAs that may regulate the MXI 1 3 'UTR. The strongest <b>inhibitory</b> <b>miRNA,</b> miR- 155, can attenuate the activity of a luciferase reporter gene that is fused with the MXI 1 3 'UTR and decrease the expression levels of MXI 1 mRNA and protein in U 87 glioma cells. The potential role of miR- 155 in promoting glioma cell proliferation by targeting MXI 1 was confirmed in various glioma cell lines by rescue experiments using MTT assays, EdU incorporation assay, and cell counting experiments. In addition, we determined that the level of MXI 1 mRNA was inversely correlated with the expression of miR- 155 in 18 sets of glioblastoma multiforme specimens. These findings reveal {{for the first time that}} the targeting of MXI 1 by miR- 155 may result in a reduction in MXI 1 expression and promote glioma cell proliferation; this result suggests a novel function of miR- 155 in targeting MXI 1 in glioma-genesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany miRNA inhibitors {{have been}} {{developed}} and they are chemically modified oligonucleotides such as 2 ′-O-methylated RNA and locked nucleic acid (LNA). Unmodified DNA was not yet reported as a miRNA inhibitor because of the low affinity of DNA/miRNA compared to mRNA/miRNA. We designed a structured unmodified DNA that significantly inhibits miRNA function. The clue structure for activity is the miRNA binding site between double stranded regions {{which is responsible for}} the <b>miRNA</b> <b>inhibitory</b> activity and tight binding to miRNA. We developed the miRNA inhibitor constructed with unmodified DNA, and named it LidNA, DNA that puts a lid on miRNA function...|$|R
40|$|Background. microRNAs (miRNAs) are {{approximately}} 21 nucleotide non-coding transcripts capable of regulating gene expression. The most widely studied mechanism of regulation involves binding of a miRNA {{to the target}} mRNA. As a result, translation of the target mRNA is inhibited and the mRNA may be destabilized. The <b>inhibitory</b> effects of <b>miRNAs</b> {{have been linked to}} diverse cellular processes including malignant proliferation, apoptosis, development, differentiation, and metabolic processes. We asked whether endogenous fluctuations in a set of mRNA and miRNA profiles contain correlated changes that are statistically distinguishable from the many other fluctuations in the data set. Methodology/Principal Findings. RNA was extracted from 12 human primary brain tumor biopsies. These samples were used to determine genome-wide mRN...|$|R
40|$|Porphyromonas gingivalis is {{considered}} a keystone pathogen in periodontitis, a disease typically driven by dysbiosis of oral inflammophilic polymicrobial pathobionts. To combat infectious agents, the natural defense response of the host is to switch on inflammatory signaling cascades, whereby microRNA (miRNA) species serve as alternative genetic <b>inhibitory</b> transcriptional endpoints. <b>miRNA</b> profiles from diseased sites differ from those detected in disease-free tissues. miRNA profiles could therefore be harnessed as potential diagnostic/prognostic tools. The regulatory role of some miRNA species (miRNA- 128, miRNA- 146, miRNA- 203, and miRNA- 584) in the innate immune system suggests these molecular signatures also have potential in therapy. P. gingivalis–associated miRNAs are likely to influence the innate immune response, whereas its lipopolysaccharide may affect the nature of host miRNAs and their mRNA targets. This mini review discusses miRNA-dependent transcriptional and regulatory phenomena ensuing immune signaling cascade switch-on with development and progression of periodontitis initiated by P. gingivalis exposure...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{genomics}} technology over {{recent years}} {{have led to the}} surprising discovery that the genome is far more pervasively transcribed than was previously appreciated. Much of the newly-discovered transcriptome appears to represent long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), a heterogeneous group of largely uncharacterised transcripts. Understanding the biological function of these molecules represents a major challenge and in this review we discuss some of the progress made to date. One major theme of lncRNA biology seems to be the existence of a network of interactions with microRNA (miRNA) pathways. lncRNA has been shown to act as both a source and an <b>inhibitory</b> regulator of <b>miRNA.</b> At the transcriptional level, a model is emerging whereby lncRNA bridges DNA and protein by binding to chromatin and serving as a scaffold for modifying protein complexes. Such a mechanism can bridge promoters to enhancers or enhancer-like non-coding genes by regulating chromatin looping, as well as conferring specificity on histone modifying complexes by directing them to specific loci...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is a conserved {{gene silencing}} mechanism mediated by small <b>inhibitory</b> microRNAs (<b>miRNAs).</b> Promoter-driven miRNA expression vectors {{have emerged as}} important tools for delivering natural or artificially designed miRNAs to eukaryotic cells and organisms. Such systems {{can be used to}} query the normal or pathogenic functions of natural miRNAs or messenger RNAs, or to therapeutically silence disease genes. Results As with any molecular cloning procedure, building miRNA-based expression constructs requires a time investment and some molecular biology skills. To improve efficiency and accelerate the construction process, we developed a method to rapidly generate miRNA expression vectors using recombinases instead of more traditional cut-and-paste molecular cloning techniques. In addition to streamlining the construction process, our cloning strategy provides vectors with added versatility. In our system, miRNAs can be constitutively expressed from the U 6 promoter, or inducibly expressed by Cre recombinase. We also engineered a built-in mechanism to destroy the vector with Flp recombinase, if desired. Finally, to further simplify the construction process, we developed a software package that automates the prediction and design of optimal miRNA sequences using our system. Conclusions We designed and tested a modular system to rapidly clone miRNA expression cassettes. Our strategy reduces the hands-on time required to successfully generate effective constructs, and can be implemented in labs with minimal molecular cloning expertise. This versatile system provides options that permit constitutive or inducible miRNA expression, depending upon the needs of the end user. As such, it has utility for basic or translational applications. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recently a {{large number}} of short non-coding-RNAs (microRNAs, (miRNA)) have been identified. These miRNAs act as post-transcriptional {{regulators}} where they generally have an <b>inhibitory</b> function. <b>miRNAs</b> are present in all human cells, and they are also detected in serum or plasma. The miRNAs have a broad range of actions, and their biogenesis must therefore be under tight control. One putative regulator of miRNA biogenesis or miRNA level could be vitamin D, an ancient hormone with effects on cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis and the immune system. In our study miRNA were reversed transcribed in total RNA isolated from plasma and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using the miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR system (Exiqon). In 10 pilot subjects 136 miRNAs were detected in one or more plasma samples drawn at baseline and after 12 [*]months of vitamin D supplementation. The twelve miRNAs that showed the greatest change in expression in these pilots were further analyzed by RT-qPCR of RNA from baseline and 12 [*]months plasma samples in 40 subjects given high dose vitamin D 3 (20. 000 – 40. 000 [*]IU per week) and 37 subjects given placebo. Results At baseline there was a significant and positive correlation between serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D and miR- 532 - 3 p expression (r[*]=[*] 0. 24, P[*]=[*] 0. 04). The change in expression of miR- 221 from baseline to 12 [*]months (ddCp value) was also significantly different between the vitamin D and placebo group (P = 0. 04), mainly due to a change in the placebo group. Conclusions We {{have not been able to}} demonstrate a consistent effect of vitamin D supplementation on the expression profile of miRNA in plasma. However, further studies are needed as this approach might potentially throw light on unknown aspects of vitamin D physiology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Utrophin is the {{autosomal}} homolog of dystrophin, {{the product}} of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) locus. Its regulation is of therapeutic interest as its overexpression can compensate for dystrophin’s absence in animal models of DMD. The tissue distribution and transcriptional regulation of utrophin have been characterized extensively, and more recently translational control mechanisms that may underlie its complex expression patterns have begun to be identified. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a variety of bioinformatic, molecular and cell biology techniques, we show that the muscle isoform utrophin-A is predominantly suppressed at the translational level in C 2 C 12 myoblasts. The extent of translational inhibition is estimated to be, 99 % in C 2 C 12 cells and is mediated by both the 59 - and 39 -UTRs of the utrophin-A mRNA. In this study we identify five miRNAs (let- 7 c, miR- 150, miR- 196 b, miR- 296 - 5 p, miR- 133 b) that mediate the repression, and confirm repression by the previously identified miR- 206. We demonstrate that this translational repression can be overcome by blocking the actions of miRNAs, resulting in an increased level of utrophin protein in C 2 C 12 cells. Conclusions/Significance: The present study has identified key <b>inhibitory</b> mechanisms featuring <b>miRNAs</b> that regulate utrophin expression, and demonstrated that these mechanisms can be targeted to increase endogenous utrophin expression in cultured muscle cells. We suggest that miRNA-mediated inhibitory mechanisms could be targeted by methods...|$|R

40|$|Malfunction of {{synaptic}} plasticity in different brain regions, including the amygdala {{plays a role}} in impulse control deficits that are characteristics of several psychiatric disorders, such as ADHD, schizophrenia, depression and addiction. Previously, we discovered a locus for impulsivity (Impu 1) containing the neuregulin 3 (Nrg 3) gene, of which the level of expression determines levels of <b>inhibitory</b> control. MicroRNAs (<b>miRNAs)</b> are potent regulators of gene expression, and have recently emerged as important factors contributing to the development of psychiatric disorders. However, their role in impulsivity, as well as control of Nrg 3 expression or malfunction of the amygdala, is not well established. Here, we used the GeneNetwork database of BXD mice to search for correlated traits with impulsivity using an overrepresentation analysis to filter for biologically meaningful traits. We determined that inhibitory control was significantly correlated with expression of miR- 190 b, - 28 a, - 340, - 219 a and - 491 in the amygdala, and that the overrepresented correlated traits showed a specific pattern of coregulation with these miRNAs. A bioinformatics analysis identified that miR- 190 b, by targeting an Nrg 3 -related network, could affect {{synaptic plasticity}} in the amygdala, targeting bot impulsive and compulsive traits. Moreover, miR- 28 a, - 340, - 219 a and possibly - 491 could act on synaptic function by determining the balance between neuronal outgrowth and differentiation. We propose that these miRNAs are attractive candidates of regulation of amygdala synaptic plasticity, possibly during development but also in maintaining the impulsive phenotype. These results can help us to better understand mechanisms of synaptic dysregulation in psychiatric disorders...|$|R
