5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be fired from a grounded <b>frame,</b> called the M-30 (single <b>frame,</b> four round; later double <b>frame,</b> 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E
5|$|<b>Frame</b> Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A <b>frame</b> {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. <b>Frame</b> analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the <b>frame,</b> Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the <b>frame</b> (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E

30|$|To change consumers’ behavior, {{strategically}} <b>framed</b> messaging is required. Two {{kinds of}} strategies have been suggested; negative message <b>framing</b> versus positive message <b>framing,</b> local message <b>framing</b> versus global message <b>framing.</b> Negative message <b>framing</b> emphasizes loss while the positive message <b>framing</b> stresses on gains (O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole 2009; Smith and Petty 1996). Local message <b>framing</b> highlights {{the impact on}} residence region while Global message <b>framing</b> emphasizes {{the impact on the}} world (Grinstein and Riefler 2015; Scannell and Gifford 2013).|$|R
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each <b>frame</b> of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next <b>frame.</b> This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new <b>frame</b> and then pauses the film's motion while the <b>frame</b> is projected.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from <b>frame</b> number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment <b>frame.</b> The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. <b>Frame</b> 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double <b>frame</b> which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This <b>frame</b> also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh <b>frame,</b> to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped <b>frame</b> 20 was the last <b>frame</b> of the fuselage proper and the <b>frame</b> to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; <b>frame</b> 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and <b>frame</b> 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E

5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear <b>frame,</b> and between the rider and the rear <b>frame.</b> Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear <b>frame,</b> etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating <b>frame</b> parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the <b>frame</b> to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
