Additionally, the pulse output can be directed through one of three resonator banks.

50|$|Starting in the mid-1960s, Autocall began {{transitioning}} all {{of their}} fire alarm systems to solid state technology. In 1970, the company produced the NA series of fire alarm systems which utilized modular components driven by printed circuit boards instead of traditional hardwired relays. In 1973, Autocall invented the first voice evacuation system, followed by a firefighter's communication system in 1974. These technologies were OEM distributed to numerous other fire alarm companies who did not yet produce their own. In 1977, Autocall introduced Auto Monitor, an entirely solid-state multiplex system that utilized remote transponders to distribute IDC's and other connections. These transponders could handle up to 8 points and remained in production for several years thereafter. A year later, the company introduced the Auto Command, a remote microprocessor-controlled command center with built-in printer. The Auto Monitor interpreted network command centers as transponders on the multiplex loop. Shortly thereafter, the company introduced custom designed rackmount systems {{which had to be}} <b>factory</b> <b>programmed</b> for each client. Due to the rapidly growing clientele and increased complexity of programs, Autocall brought field programmability to its multiplex systems in the mid-1980s. In 1987, Autocall introduced a smaller series of one-loop field-programmable addressable systems for a burgeoning market of mid-size addressable applications. In 1989, Autocall introduced the first color touchscreen graphic annunciator, known as Autograph. In 1990, the company replaced the aging Auto Command II system with the AL-1500, a modern system capable of over 4,000 points.|$|E

50|$|Its primary aim was {{to measure}} CP {{violation}} in the decays of heavy B-mesons in the late 1990s, several years ahead of the Large Hadron Collider and B <b>Factory</b> <b>programs.</b> Unlike most particle physics detectors, the particles were produced not by colliding two circulating beams head-on, nor by slamming the beam into a stationary target, but by moving a thin wire target directly into the waste 'halo' of the circulating proton beam of the HERA accelerator. The beam was unaffected by this 'scraping' but the collision rate produced could be made extremely high, around 5 to 10 million interactions per second (5-10 MHz). A novel scheme for moving the wires and the vertex detectors {{very close to the}} beam (less than one centimetre), using a vacuum chamber and motorised 'arms', had to be developed.|$|R
