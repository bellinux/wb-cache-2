50|$|The {{molecular}} data suggests - though not with high confidence - that this species diverged relatively recently from ancestral <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasants.</b> This is quite spurious, since biogeography, its peculiarly derived plumage, {{and the fact}} that it is an insular mountain endemic indicate it is derived from a comparatively small founder population; this would confound molecular analyses. What seems clear is that the present species evolved from mainland Southeast Asian stock, probably during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene (3.6-1 mya). The loss of ocelli thus is, contrary to long-held opinion, an autapomorphy, and the southern species of this clade - formerly separated in the genus Chalcurus - are probably not each other's closest relatives.|$|R
50|$|The {{bird was}} long {{considered}} a subspecies of <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> or Polyplectron bicalcaratum. The Hainan peacock-pheasant is smaller, and it possesses a short crest and ruff (Johnsgard 1986). It has red facial skin {{as opposed to}} grey in the yellow-orange facial skin of the <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant.</b> Beebe (1922) noted various plumage {{differences between the two}} and considered them separate species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), {{also known}} as Burmese peacock-pheasant, is a large Asian member of the order Galliformes. It is the {{national}} bird of Myanmar.|$|E
50|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{cytochrome}} b and D-loop {{as well as}} {{the nuclear}} ovomucoid intron G data confirms that this species belongs to a clade together with the bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant, Germain's peacock-pheasant and <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Kimball et al. 2001).|$|E
50|$|Widespread {{throughout}} its large range, the <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is evaluated as a Species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on CITES Appendix II, restricting trade in wild-caught birds {{to preserve its}} stocks.|$|E
5000|$|... mtDNA {{cytochrome}} b and D-loop {{as well as}} {{the nuclear}} ovomucoid intron G data confirms that this species belongs to a clade together with the mountain peacock-pheasant, but also the mainland species Germain's peacock-pheasant and <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Kimball et al. 2001).|$|E
50|$|Jaguar Trail Zone The Jaguar Trail Zone is {{a walking}} zone. There {{are a lot}} of animals that the visitor can learn about animals by themselves. Example the animals in Jaguar Trail Zone, crested serpent eagle, fishing cat, binturong, <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> and Asian golden cat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is {{distributed}} in lowland and hill forests of Bangladesh, Northeast India and Southeast Asia, but excluding most of Indochina {{as well as}} the entire Malayan Peninsula. The diet consists mainly of seeds, termites, fruits and invertebrates. The female usually lays two eggs.|$|E
50|$|Bird species include bar-backed partridge, scaly-breasted partridge, silver pheasant, red junglefowl, <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> laughingthrushes, red-vented barbet, green-eared barbet, scimitar-billed babblers, brown hawk-owl, scarlet minivet, racket-tailed drongos, racket-tailed treepie, white-winged blue magpie. Migrant species include thrushes, flycatchers, tits, finches, pipits amongst others. Hornbills {{can also}} be spotted in the forest.|$|E
5000|$|Lowe's <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> was {{described}} from a captive bird of unknown provenance. Similar examples {{have turned up}} on occasion, but the validity and [...] - [...] if distinct [...] - [...] home range of this taxon remains unknown. It was theorized to inhabit western Assam or the eastern Himalayas, but {{this is based on}} conjecture.|$|E
50|$|Although the Burmese or <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is the {{national}} bird of Myanmar, the green peafowl was an ancient symbol of the monarchs of Burma. It was also shown during British colonial times on {{the flag of the}} governor and the naval ensign, {{as well as on the}} flag of the State of Burma from 1943-1945 and on the currency of independent Burma as well.|$|E
50|$|Bird species sighted in Thungyai include white-winged {{wood duck}} (Cairina scutulata), kalij {{pheasant}} (Lophura leucomelanos), <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), spot-billed pelican (Pelecanus philippensis), Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala), greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius), red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), mountain hawk-eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis), lesser fish eagle (Ichthyophaga humilis) and all six species of hornbill (Bucerotidae) living in mainland Southeast Asia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phylogeny}} of {{this species}} is somewhat enigmatic. mtDNA cytochrome b and D-loop {{as well as the}} nuclear ovomucoid intron G data confirms that it belongs to a clade together with the <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> but also the [...] "brown" [...] southernly species bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant and mountain peacock-pheasant. Biogeography suggests that it may indeed be the most ancient form in its clade, speciating parapatrically or peripatrically in Cochinchina (Kimball et al. 2001). This probably took place in the Late Pliocene, roughly 4-3 mya.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{known or}} {{suspected}} {{to live in}} Phou Hin Poun include the Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus), the Indochinese tiger (Panthera tigris corbetti), the critically endangered saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), the giant muntjac (Muntiacus vuquangensis), the Assam macaque (Macaca assamensis), François' langur (Semnopithecus francoisi laotum), and the black giant squirrel (Ratufa bicolor). Birds found in Phou Hin Poun NBCA include the <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), the hill myna (Gracula religiosa), red-collared woodpecker (Picus rabieri), the sooty babbler (Stachyris herberti), and the wreathed hornbill (Rhyticeros undulatus).|$|E
5000|$|Note however that in {{the absence}} of {{dedicated}} phylogeographic studies, the molecular data is only of limited value in this species, the most morphologically diverse and widespread peacock-pheasant: There is no data on the origin and number of specimens, but it is unlikely that {{more than one or two}} individuals [...] - [...] possibly of captive origin and undeterminable subspecific allocation [...] - [...] were sampled. All that can be reasonably assumed is that the <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> evolved on mainland Southeast Asia, probably during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene 3.6-1 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|There are 500 {{species of}} {{bird in the}} region {{including}} the critically endangered and possibly extinct white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the endemic grey-faced tit-babbler (Macronous kelleyi) and the endangered or threatened Bengal florican (Eupodotis bengalensis), greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius) and white-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni). Other birds of the remaining woodlands of the area include the silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera), Siamese fireback (Lophura diardi), Mrs. Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), sarus crane (Grus antigone), great hornbill (Buceros bicornis), Austen's brown hornbill (Anorrhinus austeni), and wreathed hornbill (Aceros undulatus).|$|E
50|$|At least 296 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} from PTR including the globally endangered white-winged wood duck, the unique ibisbill and the rare Oriental bay owl. PTR {{is a good place}} to see hornbills. Roost sites of wreathed hornbills and great hornbill can be observed on the river banks.Birds seen in Pakke Tiger Reserve include: Jerdon's baza, pied falconet, white-cheeked hill-partridge, <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> elwe's crake, ibisbill, Asian emerald cuckoo, red-headed trogon, green pigeon spp., forest eagle owl, wreathed hornbill, great hornbill, collared broadbill and long-tailed broadbill, blue-naped pitta, lesser shortwing, white-browed shortwing, Daurian redstart, Leschenault's forktail, lesser necklaced laughing-thrush, silver-eared leiothrix, white-bellied yuhina, yellow-bellied flycatcher warbler, sultan tit, ruby-cheeked sunbird, maroon oriole, and crow-billed drongo.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{detailed}} taxonomic studies, whether it was truly a subspecies (Polyplectron bicalcaratum katsumatae) or a full species remained unclear. Scientists used molecular markers, including the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and intron G of the nuclear ovomucoid gene, to reevaluate the taxonomy of the Hainan peacock-pheasant. The results showed phylogeographic monophyly and large genetic distance between the Hainan peacock-pheasant and the <b>grey</b> <b>peacock-pheasant.</b> Sequence differences corroborated the species-level distinction between these two peacock-pheasants, which were inferred to have diverged about 1.4±0.3 million years ago, near the time Hainan Island became separated from mainland China. BirdLife International has also decided to recognize the split of Polyplectron katsumatae from Polyplectron bicalcaratum.|$|E
