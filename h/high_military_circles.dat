50|$|In 1918, Finland {{declared}} its independence, and the Finnish Civil War erupted. Hallamaa joined the whites in Seinäjoki. Here {{he was assigned}} to the Uudenmaan rakunapataljoona unit where he fought in the battles at Väärinmaja, Kuhmoinen, Tampere and Lempäälä. Hallamaa, now a lance corporal (korpraali), was transferred to the navy after the war, where he worked as a signaller. Later that year he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti) and assigned to Gogland where he was tasked with gathering information on naval traffic in the Gulf of Finland and Red Navy movements in particular. He was listening to Soviet radio traffic along with Ragnvald Lind (later Ragnvalt Lautakari) who would continue to work in the radio intelligence under Hallamaa's lead. Hallamaa even managed to decipher some of the codes sent out by the Soviets. This awoke the interest in the <b>higher</b> <b>military</b> <b>circles</b> and Hallamaa was invited to come and hold a presentation on the work done at Gogland. Soon after, Hallamaa was appointed sergeant. He was now tasked with training radio operators and sent on trips to Kotka and Turku to try to repair radio stations that had been left there by the Russians.|$|R
5000|$|It was expected, even {{amongst the}} <b>highest</b> <b>military</b> <b>circles,</b> that had Howell not {{been killed in}} action in October 1916 whilst visiting front line trenches, he would have reached the highest command in the British Army. This was {{certainly}} {{the view of many}} of his contemporaries and peers. At the age of 37, he was fully gazetted as Brigadier-General in September 1915, and rather than holding [...] "temporary" [...] rank was the youngest fully promoted General in the British Army during World War I. Of military significance, was his direct role in the strategic planning of the later conclusive actions of the Somme offensive; the successful battles of Thiepval Ridge and Ancre Heights. These used more sophisticated planned attacks using techniques such as synchronised barrages, the use of a limited number of tanks and proper briefing of field commanders. Lt. General Sir Claud Jacob, is quoted as saying that much of what his Corps (II Corps) achieved during the Somme was owed to Howell's efforts, and in fact he had left much of the daily command to Howell, who was a man of exceptional capability.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this article, {{the issue}} of the Great Patriotic War is concretized through the study of the history of Soviet prisoners of war. The poor {{treatment}} of Soviet prisoners of war in Nazi camps is investigated in the context of international conventions that defined the status of prisoners of war. Without duplicating commonly known facts on the legal issues of military captivity, the author explores one of the subject’s most important aspects – issues related to the USSR’s joining international conventions on the rules for treatment of prisoners of war. The first section of the article is dedicated to a discussion in the <b>highest</b> <b>military</b> and diplomatic <b>circles</b> of Germany and certain neutral countries on the definition of the legal status of Eastern front prisoners of war. The second section focuses on the discussion of {{the issue of}} the USSR’s joining the 1907 Hague convention on ―the Laws and Customs of War on Land‖. As a result of an analysis of sources, the author comes {{to the conclusion that the}} main reason behind the poor treatment of Soviet and German prisoners of war lies in that the attitude towards Soviet prisoners of war was defined by the Nazi’s primary goal in the war against the USSR – a total annihilation of the Soviet Union...|$|R
