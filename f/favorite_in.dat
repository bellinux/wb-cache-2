5|$|Reptile {{also appears}} in , {{appearing}} in the game's opening sequence and later as a boss. During development, producer Shaun Himmerick noted that Reptile {{was included in the}} game because the character was one of Himmerick's <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> the series. Originally included in NBA Jam Tournament Edition alongside other Mortal Kombat characters as an unlockable player, he was eventually removed from later versions of the game {{at the request of the}} NBA.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, held in Rome, Soni set a meet {{record in}} the heats of the 100-meter breaststroke, {{with a time of}} 1:05.66. In the semi-final, Soni {{recorded}} a time of 1:04.84 to set a new world record and become the first female to finish under 1:05 for the event. In the final of the 100-meter breaststroke, Soni won the gold with a time of 1:04.93. Despite being the <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> the 200-meter breaststroke, Soni went out too fast {{in the first half of}} the race and faded in the final meters, ultimately placing fourth. In the 50-meter breaststroke, Soni was narrowly beaten for the gold and the world record by two one-hundredths (0.02) of a second by Russian swimmer Yuliya Yefimova.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{libretto}} {{are considered}} analogous with the libretto for Giovanni Pacini's Adelaide e Comingio, {{and the final}} scene {{is based on the}} François-Thomas-Marie de Baculard d'Arnaud play Les Amants malheureux, ou le comte de Comminges. Donizetti worked on the opera in late 1839—its final page is dated 27 December 1839. Because the subject matter involved the mistress of a Neapolitan king, and may thus have caused difficulties with the Italian censors, Donizetti decided that the opera should be presented in France. The theater company Donizetti contracted went bankrupt; L'ange was never performed and was reworked as La <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> September 1840.|$|E

5|$|Smiley Smile {{opened a}} seven-year string of under-performing Beach Boys albums, but has since grown in stature {{to become a}} cult and {{critical}} <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> the Beach Boys' oeuvre. At one point, it was used by some rehab centers to help relieve the aftereffects of intense psychedelic experiences. Regarded as a forerunner to certain bedroom pop acts, in 1974, it was voted the 64th greatest album of all time by NME writers and, in 2000, {{it was one of}} 100 albums featured in the book The Ambient Century as a landmark in the development of ambient music. Some session highlights from the album are featured on the compilations The Smile Sessions (2011) and 1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow (2017).|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers were 12–10 {{against the}} Braves overall for the season, though the Braves outscored them {{by a single}} run (96 to 95) in those games. The Braves were a 5–8 betting <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> Las Vegas on September 25 to win the pennant while the Dodgers had 6–5 odds. The World Series odds were evenly split, with 11–10 odds {{available}} at that time for either the Chicago White Sox (the American League champion) or the eventual NL pennant winner.|$|E
5|$|When Governor Isaac Shelby {{announced}} he would not seek reelection, Garrard's friends encouraged {{him to become a}} candidate. The other announced candidates were Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd. Logan was considered the <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> the race due to his military heroism while helping settle the Kentucky frontier. However, his oratory was unpolished, and his parliamentary skills were weak, despite his considerable political experience. Todd, who had served as secretary of all ten Kentucky statehood conventions, had the most political experience, but his youth was considered a disadvantage by some. Garrard benefited from his political connections in Bourbon County, and many held him in high regard due to his work in the Baptist church.|$|E

5|$|American Pharoah's {{connections}} {{drew the}} number five post {{position for the}} Belmont on June 3. Pundits immediately noted {{it was the same}} slot from which Seattle Slew had won the 1977 Belmont and the Triple Crown, and that 14 other Belmont winners had started from the position. American Pharoah was the 3–5 morning line <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> an eight-horse field that included Tale of Verve, as well as five rivals from the Kentucky Derby who had skipped the Preakness, and one horse, Madefromlucky, who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races, but, like Tonalist the year prior, had instead won the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. American Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered, but he was also the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{supporters}} {{believed he}} would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be {{appointed to the}} Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president. Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Chapman {{was killed in an}} automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's appointee to fill the vacancy. Underwood was considered a heavy <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman. Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the Korean War. Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman's term. His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.|$|E
5|$|Later in the night, Styles and Tomko helped Angle {{retain the}} TNA title during {{the main event}} as Cage looked on from the ramp. Styles and Tomko were later {{announced}} as members of Angle's new group, The Angle Alliance, {{which led to a}} title match between the two on January 6, 2008 at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event, and also turning into a fan <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> the process. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Tomko left both Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance. Cage failed to win the title at Final Resolution, as a result of Styles' betraying and attacking him during the bout, thus ending Christian's Coalition. Cage got a rematch against Angle on February 10, 2008 at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event with Samoa Joe as the special outside enforcer. He once again was defeated by Angle as this time Tomko interfered and cost Cage the match.|$|E

5|$|On May 2, American Pharoah {{started as}} the 2.9–1 <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> an eighteen-runner {{field for the}} 141st running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. His opponents {{included}} Dortmund, winner of the Santa Anita Derby; Carpe Diem, who won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes; Firing Line, winner of the Sunland Derby; Wood Memorial winner Frosted; Florida Derby winner Materiality; international entry Mubtaahij, who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the UAE Derby; and Upstart, winner of the Holy Bull Stakes. The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the starting gate; his connections and supporters worried that he was using up energy he needed for the race.|$|E
5|$|ToeJam & Earl and its sequel ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkatron {{together}} formed {{one of the}} Mega Drive's main series. However, creator Greg Johnson {{said that}} installments for the console's Mega-CD or 32X add-ons were never planned, and though rumors of a new game persisted throughout the commercial life of the Sega Saturn console, that system's poor performance in North America prevented development of a sequel. Johnson and programmer Mark Voorsanger regained the rights to ToeJam and Earl in 1995, and in November 1998 made an agreement with GT Interactive to publish a new game in the franchise for the Nintendo 64. Johnson and Voorsanger conducted research to determine whether series fans preferred the original ToeJam & Earl or its sequel; the former emerged as the clear <b>favorite.</b> <b>In</b> April 1999, however, {{it was reported that}} the deal with GT Interactive had fallen through; the publisher had decided that the series' previous game was not an encouraging success commercially, particularly in Europe. GT Interactive's restructuring and the Nintendo 64's declining commercial performance were also believed to be factors by commentators.|$|E
5|$|Wrestling in Tennessee in 1977, LeDuc {{teamed with}} Bob Armstrong {{to win the}} NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship in September. They were put over Bob Orton, Jr. and Mr. Knoxville for the belts but lost them in a rematch. While in Tennessee, LeDuc gained notoriety from a worked feud with Jerry Lawler. Wrestling as a heel, he faced Jerry Lawler, who was a <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> the state, in many matches {{throughout}} the year. LeDuc was placed with a new partner, Jean Louie, to win the NWA Mid-America Southern Tag Team Championship in May. They faced Lawler and Jimmy Valiant on May 22 to defend the belts, but the match was declared a no contest and the title was vacated. Lawler and Valiant won the belts in a rematch the following week, but LeDuc and Louie regained them the following month. In September, LeDuc and Louie dropped the belts once again, this time to Lawler and the Mongolian Stomper.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{started with}} the trading of Mike Fisher to the Nashville Predators in {{exchange}} for a first-round pick in the 2011 draft. Fisher already had a home in Nashville with new wife Carrie Underwood. The trading of Fisher, a fan <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> Ottawa, lead to a small anti-Underwood backlash in the city with the banning of her songs from the play lists of some local radio stations. Murray next traded Chris Kelly, another veteran, to the Boston Bruins for a second-round pick in the 2011 draft. A few days later, pending unrestricted free agent Jarkko Ruutu was sent to the Anaheim Ducks {{in exchange for a}} sixth-round pick in 2011. A swap of goaltenders was made with the Colorado Avalanche which brought Craig Anderson to Ottawa in exchange for Brian Elliott. Both goalies were having sub-par seasons prior to the trade. Under-achieving forward Alex Kovalev was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a seventh-round draft pick. On trade deadline day, Ottawa picked up goaltender Curtis McElhinney on waivers, and traded Chris Campoli with a seventh-round pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for a second-round pick and Ryan Potulny. Goaltender Anderson played very well down the stretch for Ottawa, and the team quickly signed the soon-to-be unrestricted free agent to a four-year contract. After media speculation on the future of Murray within the organization, Murray was re-signed as general manager on April 8, to a three-year extension. On April 9, Head Coach Cory Clouston and assistants Greg Carvel and Brad Lauer were dismissed from their positions. Murray said that the decision was made {{based on the fact that}} the team entered the season believing it was a contender, but finished with a 32–40–10 record. Former Detroit Red Wings Assistant Coach Paul MacLean was hired as Clouston's replacement on June 14, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the <b>favorite</b> <b>in</b> the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E
