5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E

On the perfect action of this doctor depends the entire success of printing, and as its sharpness and angle of inclination to the copper roller varies with the styles of work in hand it requires an expert to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> (sharpen it) properly and considerable practical experience {{to know exactly what}} qualities it should possess in any given case.

The steel or cleaning doctor is pressed against the roller by means of weighted levers, but the lint doctor is usually just allowed to rest upon it by its own weight as its function is merely to intercept the nap which becomes detached from the cloth and would, if not cleaned from the roller, mix with the colour and give rise to defective work.|$|E

500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the film}} with a 'B–' rating, {{summarizing}} it as a [...] "lulling, happy-face story of retirement-age self-renewal, {{set in a}} shimmering, weltering, jewel-colored India", and that it succeeded in selling [...] "something safe and sweet, in a vivid foreign setting, to an underserved share of the moviegoing market." [...] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, was more igneous in his 2/5 star review, saying that the film [...] "needs a Stannah chairlift to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to any level of watchability, {{and it is not}} exactly concerned to do away with condescending stereotypes about old people, or Indian people of any age." [...] Noting the luminous, prolific resumes of the cast he noted [...] "nothing in this insipid story does anything like justice to the cast's combined potential." [...] He went on to opine that the film appeared [...] "oddly like an Agatha Christie thriller with all the pasteboard characters, 2D backstories and foreign locale, but no murder." [...] In further negative reviews, critics from The Guardian and the blog Marshall and the Movies criticized the film for having a colonialist and orientalist point of view towards India.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the black}} flag {{is used for}} {{disciplinary}} reasons in most races in North America, a driver is required to return to pit lane for at minimum a drive-through penalty. [...] A driver may be black-flagged for failing to maintain a reasonable minimum speed, even if no apparent damage or mechanical failure is present. In almost all cases, the team is {{given a chance to}} make repairs to the car and <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to an acceptable condition. If the driver still cannot maintain minimum speed in relation to the leaders after repairs, the driver may be required to park {{for the remainder of the}} race. For example, NASCAR requires that a driver run at or above 115 percent of the fastest lap time by any driver in the final practice. (This can be converted to an average speed-limit based on the length of the course, which for oval tracks will be close to the actual speed limit at any given time.) IndyCar has a 105 percent rule, most notably used when officials parked Jean Alesi and Simona de Silvestro during the 2012 Indianapolis 500.|$|E
