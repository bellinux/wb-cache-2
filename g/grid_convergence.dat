40|$|The {{accuracy}} of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model {{to capture the}} complex flow around a small {{vertical axis wind turbine}} (VAWT) on 2 D and 3 D grids is investigated. The aerodynamic complexity of the flow is mostly due to rapid variation of the angle of attack of the rotating blades. The resulting flow includes large separation flows over the blades, dynamic stall, and wake-blade interaction. These features are sensitive to the grid resolution and turbulence models. In the present research, a <b>grid</b> <b>convergence</b> study is conducted on 2 D grids to examine the CFD model sensitivity to mesh resolution and to identify when <b>grid</b> <b>convergence</b> is obtained.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} studies have employed {{a wide variety}} of mesh styles and levels of <b>grid</b> <b>convergence</b> to assess velocity fields and particle deposition patterns in models of branching biological systems. Generating structured meshes based on hexahedral elements requires significant time and effort; however, these meshes are often associated with high quality solutions. Unstructured meshes that employ tetrahedral elements can be constructed much faster but may increase levels of numerical diffusion, especially in tubular flow systems with a primary flow direction. The objective {{of this study is to}} better establish the effects of mesh generation techniques and <b>grid</b> <b>convergence</b> on velocity fields and particle deposition patterns in bifurcating respiratory models. In order to achieve this objective, four widely used mesh styles including structured hexahedral, unstructured tetrahedral, flow adaptive tetrahedral, and hybrid grids have been considered for two respiratory airway configurations. Initial particle conditions tested are based on the inlet velocity profile or the local inlet mass flow rate. Accuracy of the simulations has been assessed by comparisons to experimental in vitro data available in the literature for the steady-state velocity field in a single bifurcation model as well as the local particle deposition fraction in a double bifurcation model. Quantitative <b>grid</b> <b>convergence</b> was assessed based on a <b>grid</b> <b>convergence</b> index (GCI), which accounts for the degree of grid refinement.
