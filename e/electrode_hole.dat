40|$|The {{electrochemically}} catalyzed oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) {{is essential}} to operation of most fuel cells and many types of batteries; oxygen, being prevalent in air, provides a costless, ambient, high-energy (1. 23 V vs. normal hydrogen <b>electrode)</b> <b>hole</b> source to complete the electrochemical redox circuit. Oxygen mass transport and electrochemical overpotential losses however represent the largest efficiency losses in conventional polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Mass transport {{is limited by the}} inherent low solubility of oxygen in water. This low solubility and diffusivity can be overcome through reduction of electrolyte thickness, and by utilizing a thin cell wall of highly a permeable material, such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The well-characterized utility of PDMS in microfluidics as well as its stability in a wide array of aqueous electrolytes, proves PDMS an excellent material for electrochemical devices. The results presented herein utilize microfluidics to reduce the electrolyte thickness (and therefore the thickness of the diffuse layer), and control the thickness of the PDMS layer.

40|$|Methane {{injection}} {{into the}} arcs of electric arc furnaces {{has been shown}} on pilot scale {{to lead to a}} remarkable arc voltage increase at constant arc current and arc length. The investigations have been concerned with the associated metallurgical effects making use of a gas-tight 150 -kg arc furnace operated with two AC plasma torches. The test runs with bored graphite electrode in DC-mode with a bottom electrode in this furnace confirmed the power increase observed during methane injection. The carburization slowly occurring when 6 % CH 4 was injected into the argon atmosphere of the furnace could be avoided by adding minor amounts of CO 2. A slag layer decreased mass transfer rates without noticeably affecting heat transfer. Manganese loss by evaporation was measured to investigate the influence of power increase and slag layers. From the results, an increase of 200 K was concluded for the melt surface temperature when CH 4 was added to pure argon. Methane injection into the arcs proved to accelerate nitrogen removal considerably. Starting with an intentionally high nitrogen content of about 200 ppm, the nitrogen removal rate was found to be slowest with pure argon plasma arcs, faster with 90 % Ar + 10 % H 2, and the fastest with 95 % Ar + 5 % CH 4 reaching final contents of less than 20 ppm of nitrogen. Based on thermodynamic calculations, the denitrogenation reactions appear to take place via atomic nitrogen in pure argon plasma, via NH 3 in Ar + H 2 and via HCN in Ar + CH 4. Several suggestions about how to prevent the possible carbon deposition in the graphite <b>electrode</b> <b>hole</b> due to injection of 95 % Ar + 5 % CH 4 through the hole have been discussed...|$|E

40|$|In South Africa, the {{ferrochromium}} industry produces approximately 100, 000 t {{bag house}} filter dust and slurry, while {{the stainless steel}} industry produces 24, 000 t of dust annually [17, 39]. The toxic substances in these wastes potentially {{pose a threat to}} the environment and human health, especially Cr (VI) due to its toxic, carcinogenic, highly soluble and strongly oxidizing properties. Therefore, the existence and treatment of wastes from stainless steel and ferrochrome production remain a challenge and an issue of concern. The increase of environmental legislation globally and the trend towards sustainable development are drives for alternatives to landfill. In the present thesis, the characteristics, formation mechanisms, leachability and stabilisation of the Cr (VI) -containing electric furnace dust and filter cake were investigated using various techniques such as XRD, XRF, TG/DTA, XPS, SEM-EDS, FT-IR, Raman spectrometer and UV/Vis spectrometer. The electric furnace dust and filter cake are very fine particles. Stainless steel dust forms by the entrainment of charge materials, evaporation or volatilisation of elements and ejection of slag and metal by spitting or the bursting of gas bubbles. It was found that ferrochrome dust is formed by the ejection of slag and metals droplets from the <b>electrode</b> <b>hole,</b> the entrainment of charge materials, vaporisation as well as the formation and precipitation of compounds from vaporised species in the off-gas duct. Filter cake contains crystal phases (CaF 2 and CaSO 4) and metal rich amorphous phases. It is formed due to super saturation and precipitation. Leaching experiments on the wastes showed that Cr (VI) rapidly leaches out by distilled water. Bricks were produced by mixing wastes (stainless steel plant dust, ferrochrome dust and filter cake) and clay. The optimum sinter parameter was found to be 1100 oC and 5 hours for a 50 wt% SPD- 50 wt% AS mixture in the brick. The leachability of Cr(VI) is strongly influenced by the mass%CaO/mass%SiO 2 ratio and alkali metal oxides content in the wastes. The emission factors from the stabilised wastes (SPD, FCD 1, FCD 2 and FC) are similar to those reported for the cement industry. Semi-dynamic leaching tests indicated that the predominant leaching mechanisms of chromium species are initial surface wash-off followed by matrix diffusion.

However, progress is needed to enhance the electrical conductivities of the materials and to provide understanding about their structure-transport relationships. This work presents the synthesis of highly conductive PEDOT-based polymers using iron(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate as oxidant for the first time. The metallic behaviour of the polymer is revealed by conductivity monitoring from 3 to 300 K. The electrical conductivity is further improved (to 2273 S cm(- 1)) using acids, leading to a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity at an unprecedented 45. 5 % oxidation state. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analyses demonstrate a complete replacement of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anions by hydrogen sulphate counter ions.

40|$|Metal oxide {{semiconductor}} capacitors with oxidized {{thick and thin}} nitride films of two different nitride thicknesses were used to study the conduction and charge-trapping behavior under positive stress bias to the upper electrode. Although the top oxide thickness {{of the two groups}} of oxidized nitride films is the same, the charge-trapping character-istics are different. It was found that due to the positive stress to the upper electrode of oxidized thick nitride, the gate voltage is shifted to the negative direction, whereas in oxidized thin nitride, it is shifted to the positive direction, just like the nitride films. It was also observed that in nitride films, irrespective of nitride thickness, due to the positive stress bias, the gate voltage is shifted to the positive direction. From the experimental results of oxidized thick and thin nitride, it can be inferred that in oxidized thick nitride, due to electron injection from the lower <b>electrode,</b> <b>holes</b> are generated in the nitride film and are trapped near the interface. As a result of trapped holes near the interface of the top oxide and nitride, as well as a shallow electron trap centered below the conduction band of the nitride, a large increase in current is observed in oxidized thick nitride. On the other hand, in oxidized thin nitride films for the same positive stress bias, only a few holes are generated in the nitride film because most of the injected electrons from the lower electrode tunnel through the nitride and are trapped in the top oxide.

Strong interactions are found between all the checked metals, with the energy band structure of ML phosphorene destroyed. In terms of the quantum transport simulations, ML phosphorene forms a n-type Schottky contact with Au, Cu, Cr, Al, and Ag electrodes, with electron Schottky barrier heights (SBHs) of 0. 30, 0. 34, 0. 37, 0. 51, and 0. 52 eV, respectively, and p-type Schottky contact with Ti, Ni, and Pd <b>electrodes,</b> with <b>hole</b> SBHs of 0. 30, 0. 26, and 0. 16 eV, respectively. These results are in good agreement with available experimental data. Our findings not only provide an insight into the ML phosphorene-metal interfaces but also help in ML phosphorene based device design...|$|R
