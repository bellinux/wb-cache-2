I could just write "nothing's happened," and go on my way, or just say "there's not yet a good process" and leave it at that. But I found that there is still a lot of controversy regarding deacidification within the preservation profession. In the first month of research into new developments in mass deacidification, I heard or read "morpholine is the only viable process," "I looked at the Canadian Archives project, it looks great," "diethyl zinc {{is the only way to}} go," "VPD is the best method of deacidification.

50|$|By {{the time}} Theodosius I reached Arbogast's {{location}} in September, after {{passing through the}} Julian Alps, {{he was able to}} see the forces of Arbogast and Eugenius in the plain below with their backs turned to the river Frigidus, firmly entrenched and ready for the battle. Theodosius <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the strategic elevated positions were already occupied by some of Arbogast's forces, and given that Arbogast moved a portion of his forces to the south, thus making the possibility of out-flanking Arbogast a difficult one. With this in mind, on September 5, 394 AD, Theodosius led his force on a frontal assault of Arbogast and his troops, with many Visigoths serving in the vanguard. The brutal fighting lasted the entire day with Theodosius I unable to break the lines of Arbogast's forces while taking heavy losses to his barbarian troops in the process. With defeat getting near, Theodosius and his armies retreated towards the protection of the Julian Alps where Theodosius prayed to God asking him for help against his enemies. Meanwhile, at the camp of Arbogast and Eugenius, the men were celebrating what they believed to be a victory over Theodosius. At this time, Arbogast sent a considerable portion of his army to attack Theodosius I from the rear in the Alps. This did not go according to Arbogast's plan, however, and as soon as his troops came upon the camp of Theodosius I, he offered them substantial portions of money, which they agreed to relatively easily.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, David Shore and Paul Attanasio, {{along with}} Attanasio's {{business}} partner Katie Jacobs, pitched the series (untitled at the time) to Fox as a CSI-style medical detective program, a hospital whodunit {{in which the}} doctors investigated symptoms and their causes. Attanasio was inspired to develop a medical procedural drama by The New York Times Magazine column, [...] "Diagnosis", written by physician Lisa Sanders, who is an attending physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), and Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) is modeled after this teaching institution. Fox bought the series, though the network's then-president, Gail Berman, told the creative team, [...] "I want a medical show, but I don't want to see white coats going down the hallway". Jacobs has said that this stipulation {{was one of the}} many influences that led to the show's ultimate form. [...] "We knew the network was looking for procedurals, and Paul Attanasiocame up with this medical idea that was like a cop procedural. The suspects were the germs. But <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> began to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> we needed that character element. I mean, germs don't have motives." [...] —David Shore to Writer's Guild magazine After Fox picked up the show, it acquired the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain ("zebra" [...] is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while [...] "circling the drain" [...] refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline). The original premise of the show was of a team of doctors working together trying to [...] "diagnose the undiagnosable". Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies. As Shore {{and the rest of the}} creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role. The character was named [...] "House", which was adopted as the show's title, as well. Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode. Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the [...] "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show". Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Roueché, a staff writer for The New Yorker between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.|$|R

Akhlas, the mother of the family, worked diligently on her ESL homework, which dealt that day with the concept of “family. ” Akhlas paused and stared at the workbook page, momentarily stumped.

She explained, however, that she could not count up all the people in her family because there were “a LOT! ” I told Akhlas that in America, this sort of question usually refers to the people who live in one household, and I suggested that she just count the people in her home.

40|$|On 2 December 1999, I was birding at {{the east}} end of Lake Ogallala in Keith County. I was {{scanning}} the large diving duck flock just above the Keystone diversion dam when I noticed a scaup-like duck with a thin crest. <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the bird was a male Tufted Duck. I carefully studied the, bird from 9 : 32 - 10 : 28 a. m. The bird spent all of its time actively foraging with a large flock of Greater and Lesser Scaup. It was approximately the same size as a Lesser Scaup. The head shape was rounded like a scaup, not 2 ̆ 2 peaked 2 ̆ 2 like a Ring-necked Duck. The bill was bluish with a black tip and a narrow white subterminal band, unlike the bill of a male Ring-necked Duck (black tip with a broad white subterminal band). The bill also lacked the white base of the bill of a male Ring-necked Duck. The eye was yellow. The head appeared dark-colored, except that it had a purplish sheen at some angles. The most conspicuous feature was the narrow crest, or tuft, which I estimated to be at least 5 cm long. This was visible at all times, except that it was sometimes flattened against the head immediately after the bird surfaced after a dive. The flanks were similar to those of a male Ring-necked Duck, except that they were a dirty white color instead of gray. The flanks were not clean white like those of many male Lesser Scaup. The mantle was conspicuously black, and lacked the pale vermiculations of a male Lesser Scaup. In flight, the upperwings were dark with a bold white stripe on the secondaries and inner primaries. The upperwing pattern very closely resembled that of a Greater Scaup. I did not note the tail pattern. On the basis of the flank color and long tuft, I aged the bird as an adult male molting into alternate plumage.

40|$|My uncle, Mike “Dog” Davidson, was {{stationed}} in Saigon, 1969 - 70. When I was younger, I would always be afraid {{to ask him about}} his service in the U. S. army. Perhaps the subject is too personal, I thought, or rude of me to pry about such dark memories. My curiosities eclipsed those considerations after Dog let slip that he and his unit buddies kept a journal during their deployment (a mistake on his part after four very potent cosmopolitans). Following that, I’d ask for the journal each chance I’d get over the next five years. It must have been Dog’s threshold for pestering, because the journal turned up in my mailbox. In hindsight I feel naive about nagging him to let me see the book, but I hold no regrets after what I found inside. The book {{can only be described as}} a stream-of-consciousness narrative. Its thick cardboard cover is draped in an army-green canvas, which is in a sorry condition at this point. On the front, in marker, it reads, “Recording Room 629. ” Room 629 was the unit’s Saigon lodging in “The Plaza Hotel,” I deduced from an untitled poem glued to one of the pages. To be sure, there is no lack of anti-war expression in the book, through its drug-infused scrawlings, quips, doodles and the shaky script of journaling, it serves as a platform for well-deserved venting. Between some of the pages there are loose inserts that tell a story of the times, like a flier advertising a John and Yoko short film screening or a political cartoon depicting the Pentagon building as a peace sign. <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the book in my possession was a time capsule of American culture and an heirloom. I had come upon a uniquely atmospheric, poetically-expressed, true story that deserved to be told. Between November 2015 and March 2016, I produced a film based on elements found within “Room 629. ” The film hinges on stop-motion animations in order to heighten the writing of its source material and to reflect the homemade quality of the book itself. These animated images are woven between interview footage of Dog speaking about Vietnam. In the accompanying paper, written in a personal narrative style, I breakdown the film on technical and thematic levels. The paper is also reacting to the cultural paradigm shifts that resulted in the wake of the Vietnam War, the effects of which have shaped my own experience as a post- 9 / 11 citizen.

40|$|What is {{the nature}} of art/science collaborations in museums? How do art objects and {{activities}} contribute to the successes of science centers? Based on the premise that art exhibitions and art-based activities engage museum visitors in different ways than do strictly factual, information-based displays, I address these questions in a case study that examines the roles of visual art and artists in the Exploratorium, a museum that has influenced exhibit design and professional practice in many of the hands-on science centers in the United States and around the world. The marriage of art and science in education is not a new idea - Leonardo da Vinci and other early polymaths surely understood how their various endeavors informed one another, and some 20 th century educators understood the value of the arts and creativity in the learning and practice of other disciplines. When, in 2010, the National Science Teachers Association added an A to the federal government's ubiquitous STEM initiative and turned it into STEAM, art educators nationwide took notice. With a heightened interest in the integration of and collaboration between disciplines comes an increased need for models of best practice for educators and educational institutions. With the intention {{to understand the nature of}} such collaborations and the potential they hold, I undertook this study. I made three site visits to the Exploratorium, where I took photos, recorded notes in a journal, interacted with exhibits, and observed museum visitors. I collected other data by examining the institution's website, press releases, annual reports, and fact sheets; and by reading popular and scholarly articles written by museum staff members and by independent journalists. <b>I</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the Exploratorium was not created in the way than most museums are, and the history of its founding and the ideals of its founder illuminate what was then and continues now to be different about this museum from most others in the United States. This dissertation presents an account of the history of the institution and the continuing legacy of the early Exploratorium and its founder, Frank Oppenheimer. I argue that the institution is an early example of a constructivist learning museum. I then describe how art encourages learning in the museum. It provides means of presenting information that engage all of the senses and encourage emotional involvement. It reframes familiar sights so that viewers look more closely in search of recognition, and it presents intangible or dematerialized things in a tangible way. It facilitates play, with its many benefits. It brings fresh perspectives and processes to problem solving and the acquisition of new knowledge. This project is the study of an institution where art and science have always coexisted with equal importance, setting it apart from more traditional museums where art was added as a secondary focus to the original disciplinary concentration of the institution. Many of the exhibits were created by artists, but the real value the visual arts bring to the museum is in its contributions to processes such as inquiry, play, problem-solving, and innovation...|$|E
