50|$|The cartoon {{begins as}} a coyote howls from a {{mountain}} top, under a full moon. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath as his body inflates to accommodate extra air and releases another howl.|$|E
50|$|A heavy {{cigarette}} smoker, O'Keefe died of {{lung cancer}} in 1968 at the age of sixty. In the film The Diamond Wizard (1954), he played a U.S. Treasury Agent in London who, ironically, is trying to quit smoking. Throughout the film, different characters prevent him from lighting up. After the rousing finale, however, as a reward for his heroism, he is finally allowed to have a cigarette. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> puff and joyously exhales.|$|E
5000|$|Superman derives {{his power}} from the yellow Sun of Earth. Forced under a red sun akin to that of his homeworld, or exposed to red sun radiation, Superman rapidly loses his powers, {{reverting}} to the stature equal to a normal human. This version of Superman also needs to breathe, as <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath in [...] "Apokalips Now... Part 2" [...] before plunging into the ocean, and has a special suit for when he needs to operate in outer space.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{breath and}} stood simmering. Miss Smith came forward and, with <b>a</b> smothered giggle, <b>took</b> the mate's arm and {{squeezed}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, if the gineral an' {{company was}} sthopped somewhere beyond thot pass?" [...] queried Casey, shrewdly, as <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> pull at his pipe.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} help him to say that. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> inhalation, pressed his lips tightly together, and nodded at her to confirm his words.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pig-Pen" [...] {{is known}} for his perpetually filthy {{overalls}} and the cloud of dirt and dust that follows him wherever he goes. When <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath (to sing, for example), the dust rises briefly around him. He sometimes refers to the cloud that surrounds him with pride as the dust of ancient civilizations. He cannot seem to rid himself of the dust for more than the briefest of periods — indeed, in spite of his best efforts, it appears that he cannot stay clean. He is referred to in an early strip as the only person who can get dirty while walking in a snowstorm. Nevertheless, on rare occasions he has very briefly appeared clean, and hence unrecognizable. Once this was in order to impress Violet, of whom he was a bit fond. On another occasion (September 6, 1954), he managed to keep one side of his body clean and presented this clean side to Patty, causing her to believe that he was completely clean.|$|E
50|$|Tom's head {{is stuck}} in the board, but he is safe. Jerry then {{proceeds}} to twist the board like a helicopter propeller and Tom lifts off. The cat stops the board's rotation and unravels his neck, and then frees himself from the board. Tom sighs in relief until he sees that he is falling toward the sea. He grabs the board again and uses it to actually fly like a glider. He dives after an unsuspecting Jerry, and when Jerry spots him, Tom chases him into a vent pipe. However, Tom is squeezed {{through the hole in}} his board and bounces around through the pipe. Tom crawls through successively shorter widths of pipe in order to reach the mouse, and when the chase exits the plumbing, Tom is compressed into a cylinder with legs barely a centimeter wide, forming himself in some kind of a walking stick. When the cat realizes this, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath and uncompresses himself, briefly looking like a more monstrous feline in the process.|$|E
60|$|He watched Little Brown Betty {{until she}} had filled his mug, and the froth ran over the top. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught and began again.|$|R
60|$|The new-comer {{threw back}} his head, {{and a look}} that was half wonder, half {{enlightenment}} gleamed in the black depths of his imperious eyes. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath.|$|R
5000|$|Seán Mac Réamoinn (27 November 1921 [...] - [...] 17 January 2007) was an Irish {{journalist}} and broadcaster. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in Irish culture and language and religious affairs.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught of the posset, {{and as he}} set it down {{he heard}} Lionel's step without. Then the door was flung open, and his brother stood on the {{threshold}} a moment at gaze.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{breath and}} clenched 'his hands together. By the time Mr. Chase {{came into the}} room he was able to greet him with a {{stealthy}} wink. Mr. Chase, with a humorous twist of his mouth, winked back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh" [...] said Mr. Chase. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath. [...] "Oh, really!" [...] he said. [...] "I wouldn't 'ave {{thought it}} of you, Gussie. I wouldn't 'ave thought you'd have played it so low down. I'm {{surprised}} at you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks to}} me as if the animals used this trail when they wanted a drink," [...] was Luke's comment. [...] "That water looks pretty good to me," [...] and bending down, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught. [...] "It's fine," [...] he went on; [...] "try it!" ...|$|R
60|$|Rage had transfigured her. She {{scarcely}} {{heard her}} own words. They poured out senselessly, monotonously, one calling up another, {{as if from}} the lips of a Cassandra. Lawford sank back into bed, clutching the sheets with both lean hands. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath and shut his mouth.|$|R
60|$|The {{old man had}} <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> {{liking to}} Bradley {{on account of his}} oratory, and the {{possibilities}} of making him a Democratic leader had really taken possession of him. He had no son of his own, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in young men of the stamp of Milton and Bradley.|$|R
50|$|In {{his later}} years, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{interest}} in {{the fate of the}} strange foundling Kaspar Hauser who had excited so much attention in Europe. He was the first to publish a critical summary of the ascertained facts, under the title of Kaspar Hauser, ein Beispiel eines Verbrechens am Seelenleben (1832).|$|R
60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} turned {{and gazed at}} each other in stupefaction. Mr. Stokes was the first to recover, and, taking his dazed friend by the arm, led him gently away. At {{the end of the street}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath, and, after a slight pause to collect his {{scattered}} energies, summed up the situation.|$|R
50|$|In February 2007 a {{professorship}} in his honour {{was established}} at Berkeley called the Dean A. Richard Newton Memorial Professorship. This was established {{with funding from}} the EDA Consortium and other friends, colleagues and corporate partners of Richard Newton. The Professorship will specifically advance the field of synthetic biology, an emerging area in which <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{last great}} scheme {{in which he}} was {{employed}} was the projected Great Eastern Northern Junction Railway Bill of 1860, (known familiarly as the ‘Coal line,’) which his good friend George Parker Bidder had placed in his hands, and in which <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest; but death cut him short whilst in the active discharge of his duties.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{breath and}} then {{stepped out onto}} the gray, rubbled ground. After a minute he lit a {{cigarette}} and stood gazing around him. The landscape was dead. Nothing stirred. He could see for miles, endless ash and slag, ruins of buildings. A few trees without leaves or branches, only the trunks. Above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray, drifting between Terra and the sun.|$|R
50|$|Dr. AllahDad Bohyo {{started his}} {{practical}} {{life as a}} teacher in 1957. Later on he was promoted as director of education and remained on this post till {{the last days of}} his life. Dr. Bohyo is known as literary circle with his criticism and linguistic qualities. He worked his whole life for the promotion of language and literature, his favorite fields were research and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in social linguistics.|$|R
6000|$|He {{returned}} to America in 1885, {{and once more}} occupied the somewhat dilapidated historic mansion at Elmwood. Once more he moved amid his rare and precious books, and heard the birds singing in the elms {{that his father had}} planted, or in the clustered bushes back of the house. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in the struggle for international copyright. He was President of the American Copyright League, and wrote the memorable lines:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{waiting for}} you there," [...] said Mrs. Chaffery. She held a dismal little oil lamp, and they descended a tenebrous spiral {{structure}} into an underground breakfast-room lit by gas that shone through a partially frosted globe with cut-glass stars. That descent had a distinctly depressing effect upon Lewisham. He went first. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath at the door. What on earth was Chaffery going to say? Not that he cared, of course.|$|R
50|$|One day Pamban Swami called Chinaswami Jothidar to {{look for}} land in Tiruvanmiyur as his last days were near. Pamban Swami marked the floor corners with his leg all {{arrangements}} were made to for that portion of land to be purchased. On 30 May 1929 at 7:15 am Pamban Swami called his followers and advised them to believe in Lord Murugan. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath, held it inside his stomach and entered samādhi state.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cross of Saint Andrew!" [...] said Le Balafre; [...] "that is what I call an onslaught! Ay, these Ogilvies {{were ever}} but sorry {{neighbours}} to Glen Houlakin--an evil chance it was; but fate of war--fate of war.--When did this mishap befall, fair nephew?" [...] With that <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught of wine, {{and shook his}} head with much solemnity, when his kinsman replied that his family had been destroyed upon the festival of Saint Jude [October 28] last bypast.|$|R
60|$|He {{wondered}} why Gwen {{had gone to}} bed without her pet. She would want the silly thing. The strong feeling of affection for his children came over him, battling with something else. He sank in his chair, and gradually his baffled mind went dark. He sat, overcome with weariness and trouble, staring blankly into the space. His own stifling roused him. Straightening his shoulders, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath, then relaxed again. After <b>a</b> while <b>he</b> rose, <b>took</b> the teddy-bear, and went slowly to bed.|$|R
50|$|Jayaji Rao died in 1886 and was {{succeeded by}} his son, Madho Rao Sindhia, then {{a boy in}} his tenth year. A council of Regency {{conducted}} the administration until 1894, when the Maharaja obtained powers. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> and active interest {{in the administration of}} the state, and had a comprehensive grasp of the work done in each department. In 1900 the Maharaja went to China during the Boxer Rebellion, at the same time presenting a hospital ship for the accommodation of the wounded.|$|R
50|$|While not yet 30 he was {{appointed}} district attorney of Oneida County and soon rose to the front rank of the profession there. Later he relocated to New York City. Though never <b>a</b> politician <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in public affairs and {{was a man of}} extensive learning. His conversational powers were of the highest order. He cultivated an interest in beauty, art, and literature, and he possessed one of the finest law libraries in the U.S., which, upon his death, he gave to Hamilton College.|$|R
5000|$|Hirsch devoted much of {{his time}} to schemes for the relief of Jews in lands where they were persecuted and oppressed. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{interest}} in the educational work of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, and on two occasions presented the society with gifts of a million francs. For some years, he regularly paid the deficits in the accounts of the Alliance, amounting to several thousand pounds a year. In 1889, he capitalized his donations and presented the society with securities producing an annual income of £16,000.|$|R
5000|$|The {{show was}} also praised by Simon Vozick-Levinson (Rolling Stone). He says [...] "But {{for the most}} part, this was a night of pure pop joy. Afterward, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> bow, {{accepted}} <b>a</b> bouquet from someone in the front rows - his second of the night - and walked offstage with a delighted grin". For the concert at the Ronit Farm Amphitheater, Rachel Marder (The Jerusalem Post) felt Wainwright channelled Elton John. She writes, [...] "The show felt like a true ensemble performance, with the saxophone-player, clarinetist, drummer and backup singers all taking solos".|$|R
60|$|The latter I {{could not}} quite understand. The only thing about him {{perfectly}} clear {{was that he was}} just the worst companion possible for Silchester. For the rest, he was so clever that his presence here at all as a pupil seemed unnecessary. He appeared to be rich and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest of some sort in Cecil. Seemingly it was a friendly interest, but of that I did not feel assured. At any rate, it was an injurious association for Cecil, and I determined to do everything in my power to counteract it.|$|R
2500|$|But Leavitt's {{interests}} were {{not limited to}} confections for the Gilded Age elite. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in city planning, especially that of his adopted city of New York. On January 3, 1922, for instance, Leavitt was moved to write The New York Times concerning the routing of traffic flow, an issue addressed in a recent Times story. [...] "The construction, operating, financial and economic aspects of any problem belong to the engineer and his field", wrote Leavitt to The Times. [...] "This city is rich in her wealth of men of engineering genius and talent." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{interest}} in education, chairing a committee on educational endowments from 1885 to 1897. He gave {{evidence to the}} Royal Commission {{on the future of}} Trinity College, Dublin, and the University of Dublin in 1906. He strongly defended the University's policy on the admission of Catholics, pointing out that Chief Baron Palles, one of his most distinguished colleagues on the Bench, was a Catholic graduate of the same University, and shared FitzGibbon's deep attachment to it. He generously praised Clongowes Wood College, Palles' old school, {{as an example of the}} best of Roman Catholic education.|$|R
50|$|Nasir ul-Mulk succeeded {{his father}} in 1936. He {{received}} a modern education, becoming a noted poet and scholar in his own right. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in military, political and diplomatic affairs, and {{spent much of his}} time on improving the administration. Dying without a surviving male heir in 1943, his successor was his immediate younger brother, Muzaffar ul-Mulk. Also a man with a military disposition, his reign witnessed the tumultuous events surrounding the Partition of 1947. His prompt action in sending in his own Bodyguards to Gilgit was instrumental in securing the territory for Pakistan.|$|R
