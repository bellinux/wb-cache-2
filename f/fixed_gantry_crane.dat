Recently, most of <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> use open loop system to control {{position}} while anti-swing control is done manually by skilful operators.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the design system for high efficiency <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system using elevator and conveyor system. The basic concept {{for the proposed}} <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system {{can be used with}} modification of the classical <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> instead of changing lots of them. However, the proposed crane system can reduce the cycle time more than the classical <b>gantry</b> <b>crane.</b> The high efficiency <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> can also improve the productivity of the container transportation job because of reducing cycle time. In order to achieve the effectiveness of the proposed design system, the loading and unloading capabilities are compared with the classical crane, and then these results show that the proposed crane system has better performances than the classical type.

Nowadays, most of <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> use open loop system to control {{position}} while antiswing control is operated manually by skillful operators. The open loop system is sensitive to the parameter variations and disturbances while operator's skills are restricted by fatigue problem and will affect {{the performance of the}} <b>gantry</b> <b>crane.</b> In order to overcome the problems, feedback control is adopted in this study. Firstly, classical PID and PD were introduced as position and anti-swing control respectively. The experimental result showed that the PID and PD controllers were successfully controlled both position and swing of the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> especially for small load displacement. However, the positioning performance was degraded due to the saturation of the actuator. In addition, the PID controller design is a time consuming process, since model and parameters of the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> are needed. Secondly, nonmodel based of fuzzy logic controllers are implemented in the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system for position and anti-swing control. The experimental result showed that fuzzy logic controllers had resulted on good performances for anti-swing controller. However, the results for position control were inconsistent for small desired position. The tuning process may improve the control performance but it may affect other desired positions. Finally, non-model based of NCTF controller, was proposed for position control of the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system while the anti-swing control by using fuzzy logic controller remained the same since it gave good performance.

40|$|<b>Gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} for transporting heavy loads and hazardous materials in shipyards, factories, nuclear installations, and high building construction. The crane should move the load {{as fast as possible}} without causing any excessive movement at the final position. However, most of the common <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> results in a swing motion when payload is suddenly stopped after a fast motion. The swing motion can be reduced but will be time consuming i. e. reduce the facility availability as well as productivity. Moreover, the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> needs a skilful operator to control manually based on his or her experiences to stop the swing immediately at the right position. Furthermore to unload, the operator has to wait the load stop from swinging. The failure of controlling crane also might cause accident and may harm people and surrounding. To overcome this problem, an intelligent <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system had been introduced. Fuzzy logic controllers is proposed, designed and implemented for controlling payload position as well as the swing angle of the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane.</b> PID control approach will be taken as comparator based on the previous research.

The optimal control strategy takes into account a performance index, including integrated time and absolute error criterion. To do this, nonlinear dynamic equations of the system are derived using Lagrange’s Principle. The minimum tracking error of the trolley and the minimum oscillation of the hoisting line are assumed as design parameters, and the best gains of the feedback controller are achieved. Finally, some tracking simulations are performed which demonstrate the capability of the simple proposed method in the optimal tracking control of a <b>gantry</b> <b>crane...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Most of {{the common}} <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> results in a sway motion when {{transporting}} the load as fast as possible. In addition, precise cart position control of <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> must required a zero or near zero residual sway. Approach: In this study, the development of hybrid control schemes for input tracking and anti-sway control of a <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system was investigated. To study {{the effectiveness of the}} controllers, a Proportional-Derivative (PD) -type fuzzy logic control was developed for cart position control of a <b>gantry</b> <b>crane.</b> It was then extended to incorporate input shaper control schemes for anti-sway control of the system. The positive and new modified Specified Negative Amplitude (SNA) input shapers were designed based on the properties of the system for control of system sway. The new SNA was proposed to improve the robustness capability while increasing the speed of the system response. Results: Simulation results of the response of the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> with the controllers were presented in time and frequency domains. The performances of the of the hybrid control schemes were examined in terms of input tracking capability, level of sway reduction and robustness to parameters uncertainty. Conclusion: A significant reduction in the system sways had been achieved with the hybrid controllers regardless of the polarities of the shapers.
