She graduated with her BS in 1932. She next went to the University of North Carolina, where John Wheeler stimulated {{an interest in}} nuclear physics, and she became his first PhD student. Because jobs were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by during the Great Depression, she stayed on {{as a graduate student}} after completing the requirements of her PhD.|$|E
5|$|Some solid {{performances}} in the early 1930s led to rumours {{that he would be}} brought into the Australian team in order to retaliate against England's Bodyline tactics during the 193233 Ashes series. However, this never eventuated and thereafter Halcombe increasingly found state selection <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by. In retirement he became a well known sports commentator for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, providing description of cricket and Australian rules football matches until his retirement from the media in 1968.|$|E
5|$|There {{continued}} to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery {{at the site of}} the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{his initial}} success, playing time was <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by in 1963 and Jiménez found himself {{splitting}} time between Triple-A {{and the big}} leagues {{for the remainder of}} the decade.|$|R

6000|$|After he left, Lance lay {{for a while}} {{thinking}} {{over the}} conversation. He was puzzled to know what had prompted <b>Harding</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his rescue. The Allenwood settlers had certainly been none too friendly to the prairie man, who was considered an outsider because he believed in work and in progress. Lance {{thought that there was}} no selfish motive in Harding's offer. What, then? ...|$|R
5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by {{as the season}} was purely domestic with no touring Test team, so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed to make an impact, scoring two runs in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win. Harvey took the wicket of H Hinman in the first innings, ending with 1/24 from four overs.|$|E
5|$|By 1952, {{the farm}} {{had become a}} burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labor was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by; the Colonel {{suffered}} increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was stolen. The farm was sold, and Olga, {{her husband and her}} former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga. Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.|$|E
5|$|Beardmore was {{sufficiently}} impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support, but other donations proved <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by. Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton {{presented to the}} Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, {{were published in the}} Royal Society's newsletter, Geographic Journal. The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (2011 equivalent £157,000) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship Nimrod. On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of Lieutenant).|$|E
50|$|Birch {{stayed at}} Wolves {{for five years}} as the club (unsuccessfully) tried {{to break into the}} Premier League.

5|$|On 31 August, Smith joined Queens Park Rangers on {{an initial}} three-month loan deal. His move was made {{permanent}} in January 2011, with Smith having agreed a three-year deal {{for a fee}} of around £1.5 million. Smith provided the assist for Heiðar Helguson in a 2–1 win against Crystal Palace on 2 October and has since made many positive contributions to the QPR team but found starts <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by {{in the early days}} of his Rangers career. He scored his first goal for the club against Reading on 6 November, and also netted a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw with former club Portsmouth three days later, scoring a last-minute penalty to earn QPR a point and keep their unbeaten start to the season intact. On 20 August 2011, he scored his and QPR's first goal of the 2011–12 Premier League season, in a 1–0 away win against Everton.|$|E
5|$|Poulton came to {{prominence}} in youth cricket by captaining New South Wales to the Under-17 national championships in 2000. In 2002–03, {{she made her}} senior debut for New South Wales in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL). She found runs <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by in her first three seasons and {{was in and out}} of the team frequently, aggregating only 24 runs in her second and third seasons combined. Despite this, she regularly captained Australia's Under-19 and Under-23 teams during this time, leading the latter on a successful tour of Sri Lanka in 2004. In 2005–06, made a substantial impact on the WNCL for the first time, scoring 325 runs, more than twice her previous best season's total, playing in the first of five consecutive WNCL triumphs for New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E

5000|$|ZooMumba {{revolves}} around two currencies, PetPennies and ZooDollars. PetPennies is the currency {{that is more}} readily available as numerous jobs and concession stands can produce zoo pennies. ZooDollars are a bit <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by and {{they are used to}} purchase special/rare animals and exquisite decorations for the zoo.|$|R
5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by, {{an even more}} pressing need was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E

25|$|In recent scholarship, Bart Ehrman has {{championed the}} view that in general, it is {{impossible}} to either prove or disprove supernatural events such as miracles using the historical method, for proving them would require belief in a supernatural world not amenable to historical analysis, and disproving them would require historical evidence that is usually <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} season, under Jacques Santini {{and then}} Martin Jol, he found appearances <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> by {{and had two}} loan spells, first at Coventry City, and then Wolverhampton Wanderers, linking up with his former manager, Glenn Hoddle.
