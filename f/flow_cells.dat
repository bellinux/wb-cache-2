40|$|We have {{developed}} a microfluidic <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> where stepwise enzymatic digestion is performed on immobilized proteoliposomes and the resulting cleaved peptides are analyzed with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> channels consist of two parallel gold surfaces mounted {{face to face with}} a thin spacer and feature an inlet and an outlet port. Proteoliposomes (50 – 150 nm in diameter) obtained from red blood cells (RBC), or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, were immobilized on the inside of the <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> channel, thus forming a stationary phase of proteoliposomes. The rate of proteoliposome immobilization was determined using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) which showed that 95 % of the proteoliposomes bind within 5 min. The <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> was found to bind a maximum of 1 μg proteoliposomes/cm 2, and a minimum proteoliposome concentration required for saturation of the <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> was determined to be 500 μg/mL. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies showed an even distribution of immobilized proteoliposomes on the surface. The liquid encapsulated between the surfaces has a large surface-to-volume ratio, providing rapid material transfer rates between the liquid phase and the stationary phase. We characterized the hydrodynamic properties of the <b>flow</b> <b>cell,</b> and the force acting on the proteoliposomes during <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> operation was estimated to be in the range of 0. 1 – 1 pN, too small to cause any proteoliposome deformation or rupture. A sequential proteolytic protocol, repeatedly exposing proteoliposomes to a digestive enzyme, trypsin, was developed and compared with a single-digest protocol. The sequential protocol was found to detect 65 % more unique membrane-associated protein (p < 0. 001, n = 6) based on peptide analysis with LC–MS/MS, compared to a single-digest protocol. Thus, the <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> described herein is a suitable tool for shotgun proteomics on proteoliposomes, enabling more detailed characterization of complex protein samples...|$|R
