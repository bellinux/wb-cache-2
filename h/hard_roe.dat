50|$|Much of {{the rest}} of the Lower Lincolnshire {{limestone}} is oolitic. It formed in warm, shallow seas where evaporation concentrated the dissolved calcium carbonate and wave action rolled the precipitated material into tiny balls. It takes its name from its similarity to the <b>hard</b> <b>roe</b> of fish.|$|E
50|$|Roe {{consumed}} {{within the}} UK is generally soft roe {{as opposed to}} <b>hard</b> <b>roe.</b> Though not popular, herring roe is sold within many British supermarkets. Battered cod roe can also be bought from many fish and chip shops. Various tinned roes are on sale in supermarkets e.g. soft cod roes, pressed cod roes and herring roes.|$|E
5000|$|Roe (...) or <b>hard</b> <b>roe</b> is {{the fully}} ripe {{internal}} egg masses in the ovaries, or the released external egg masses {{of fish and}} certain marine animals, such as shrimp, scallop and sea urchins. As a seafood, roe is used both as a cooked ingredient in many dishes and as a raw ingredient. The roe of marine animals, such as the roe of lumpsucker, hake and salmon, is {{an excellent source of}} omega-3 fatty acids. Roe from a sturgeon or sometimes other fishes is the raw base product from which caviar is made.|$|E

The following ten amino acids were detected: leucine, valine, alanine, serine, glutamic acid, lysine, taurine, proline, tyrosin and methionine, the 3 last ones in negletable amounts.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to {{determine}} total mercury concentrations in “rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) ” at their embryo-larval and juvenile stages and to assess mercury concentration dynamics in individual tissues. Samples of rainbow trout were collected at two-month intervals over a period of 18 months (one stock production cycle) at the Velká Losenice trout farm. Feedstuff samples were collected {{at the same time and}} analyzed for mercury concentrations. Tissue mercury concentrations were determined in muscle, liver, and kidneys. Analyses were performed using the AMA 254 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The lowest mercury concentration was found in 14 -day-old embryos (<b>hard</b> <b>roe),</b> and the highest concentrations in muscle tissue, liver, and kidneys at the end of monitoring, that is, in rainbow trout aged 18 months. The amount of mercury in feedstuffs showed an increasing trend and ranged between 0. 0126 and 0. 0859 [*]mgkg− 1.

50|$|In the United States, {{several kinds}} of roe are produced: salmon from the Pacific coast, shad and herring species like the American shad and alewife, mullet, paddlefish, American bowfin, and some species of sturgeon. Shad, pike and other roe are {{sometimes}} pan-fried with bacon. Spot Prawn <b>roe</b> (<b>hard</b> to find) is also a delicacy from the North Pacific. Flounder roe, pan-fried and served with grits is popular on the Southeastern coast.|$|R
5000|$|The Blisworth {{limestone}} lies {{above the}} Upper Estuarine Series of strata. The latter was formed {{close to the}} coast where rivers flowed from the London-Brabant Island. The land sank a little {{in relation to the}} sea so the site lay a little further offshore. In the hot, shallow sea, the water partially evaporated so that the dissolved calcium carbonate (CaCO³) was precipitated onto minute nuclei to form tiny spheres which together resemble <b>hard</b> fish <b>roe.</b> This is composed of eggs; hence the name oölite. The process goes on today in the seas off the Bahamas (Kirkaldy p. 59). Much of it also contains marine shells, notably of oyster. Subsequently, the site was submerged less deeply so that the overlying Blisworth Clay was deposited in brackish conditions. (Gallois p. 20) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} basic industrial fish species in the Syamozero Lake has been investigated. The restrospective evaluations on the general and average-annual number of the populations and number of the spawning flocks, evaluations of the coefficients on the natural and industrial morbility and growth and also the morbility component have been obtained firstly. The multiple recursive regression where {{the value of the}} morbility component in the first live year independing upon the density was as a qualitative variable has been used for study of the environment influence on the fish reproduction. The mathematical model of the separately-taken fish populations has been developed and identified. The model reflects the basic processes of the {{population dynamics}}: survival and growth of young fishs during action of regulation density mechanisms, growth and decrease of adult fishs, processes of ripening and introduction into spawning flock, production of population fund of laid <b>hard</b> <b>roe</b> and also decrease process under action of industry. The different behaviour of the considered systems has been determined. The periodical dynamics-variations are characteristic for some populations (lake white-fish, bream, pike-perch). The dynamics of the cisco population is stabilized. The smelt holds the intermediate position.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of a-tocopherol in some marine sources. Apart from {{commercial}} oils, which were of normal quality, care was taken to ensure fresh material. The a-tocopherol contents have been determined in eleven marine oils, four liver oils and seven body oils. The liver oils showed values from 35 - 700 µg per g. Cod liver oil ranged from 150 - 225, whereas Greenland shark liver oil showed very high contents, 300 - 700 µg a-tocopherol per g. The body oils normally contained 20 - 80 µg per g, thus eight samples of unspecified fish oils for hydrogenation showed 40 - 70 µg per g. Capelin oil showed high values, 50 - 230 µg per g. Fish livers varied greatly, the highest values were found in wrasse and catfish with respectively 108 - 180 and 290 - 300 µg a-tocopherol per g. Estimated. values for the liver oils were in the order of 200 µg per g for most species studied, exceptions were again wrasse and catfish with 1540 and 3100 µg per g, respectively. Values of this extremely high order were confirmed in additional analysis on extracted oils from these species. The muscle of ten species of fish were analysed. The a-tocopherol contents varied from 1. 0 to 16 µg per g, with a clear tendency for fat fillets to show the highest values. Estimation of the contents in the fats showed values generally in the order 300 - 500 µg a-tocopherol per g. Some values were confirmed on extracted oils. The distribution of a-tocopherol in different organs were studied on male and female herring, cod and coalfish. There was a striking difference between the content in the liver of the male and female herring. Both were in the spawning state and the male contained ten times more than the female, the estimated values for the liver fat being respectively 7000 and 700 µg per g. No difference of importance could be observed between the testis (soft roe) and ovaries (<b>hard</b> <b>roe),</b> with 32 and 41 µg per g, respectively. The pyloric caeca showed similar values for all species, 8 - 18 µg per g. The a-tocopherol content of ten species of echinoderms and mollusks were investigated. The analysis refer to the whole animal except for the squid. The values were in the order 4 - 15 µg per g fresh weight, and approx. 100 µg per g dry weight. Exceptions were the littoral snails periwinckle and limpet, with approx. 40 and 150 µg per g fresh weight, or approx. 200 and 1000 µg per g dry weight, respectively. The high values in the limpet was confirmed in extracted oils. Fat extracted from the deep sea prawn showed 950 µg a-tocopherol per g...|$|E
