By early 1888 the Joint Board had placed an order with Hathorn Davey & Company of Leeds, England for a 75 horse power, inverted compound non-rotative engine coupled to a two-stage pumping system, with a capacity of 20,000 gallons per hour. The engine was designed by Henry Davey who made a significant contribution to the development of steam powered water pumping systems during the late 19th century. His differential system, applied to vertical compound engines, greatly increased the efficiency of non-rotative pumping engines and prolonged their viability as alternatives to rotating machines. Plans for the <b>engine</b> <b>foundations,</b> specifications for the assembling of engine and boilers, directions for the construction of buildings to protect them, and plans for a 60 feet high chimney arrived from Hathorn Davey in June 1888.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe vibroacoustic {{behavior}} of a structure excited by a partially space-correlated random pressure fields such as turbulent boundary layers or internal diffuse fields is of great interest for aeronautical or naval applications. Many works {{have been carried out}} for structures such as plates or simple cylinders whereas little attention has been paid on more complex cases. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study this problem for a ribbed cylindrical shell coupled to internal structures. The proposed modeling is based on the combination of two methods developed recently by the authors: the wavenumber-point (k, M) reciprocity technique and the Condensed Transfer Function (CTF) method. The first one estimates the sensitivity functions at point M of the system from its vibratory velocity field induced by a point excitation at M. This velocity field is estimated with the second method. The CTF method is a substructuring approach which consists in coupling a semi-analytical model of a submerged cylindrical shell with Finite Element models of axisymmetric (ribs, bulkheads) and non-axisymmetric (floor partitions, <b>engine</b> <b>foundations)</b> internal frames. A numerical example of a submerged stiffened cylindrical shell excited by random pressure fields will be given and the influence of the internal frames will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to design warships so as to acoustically insulate them from enemy vessels. The conventional designs of various systems have to be modified for achieving this purpose. The aim is to keep all the types of sound transmission to a low level viz. air-borne, water-borne or structure borne. As such the structure borne noise i. e. engine or machinery noise transmitted through the foundation and hull of the vessel has to be minimized. The design of the machinery mounting system hence becomes very important. One of the techniques used is to mount all vital machinery on double stage vibration isolation systems. A two-stage mounting system (also called as raft mounting) is employed {{where there is a}} demand for high structure-borne noise attenuation. The present paper deals with the dynamic analysis and design sensitivity analysis of such a marine <b>engine</b> <b>foundation</b> system considering it as a two degree freedom system. An algorithm has been developed for the same. The vertical vibrations of the system are assumed to be most predominant. The other types of vibrations like rocking or transverse type of vibrations are assumed to negligible and to be taken by the mounts and limiters...|$|E
40|$|Development of on-line {{diagnostic}} (monitoring) {{method of}} marine propulsion system working parameters is the authors ' target. Crankshaft springing characteristics {{are one of}} the most important from the ships ' main engines reliability point of view. Planned monitoring system will be able to verify crankshaft springing characteristics by continuous measurements of the crankshaft free-end's axial deformations. Development of the analysis methods of crankshaft's stiffness characteristics is the first step of planned SHM system. The main purpose of research is method developing of the springing analysis for the marine crankshafts in the high-power engines. Crankshaft modeling method, by Finite Element Method, has been discussed. Short overview of the crankshaft boundary conditions is presented. Bearings ' oil film stiffness characteristics, ship hull stiffness characteristics and temperature deformation of the ship hull and main engine body are taking into account. Influence of the crankshaft's foundation stiffness on springing values is analysed. During the analyses it was proved that flexibility of <b>engine</b> <b>foundation</b> has a big influence upon the value of crankshaft springing.

40|$|The {{value of}} a super-yacht project can be {{measured}} in terms of cost, size, autonomy, design and lately also in terms of comfort on board, since the competition among the various shipyards is now being played on quality of living onboard, as well as on more traditional aspects such as design, cost and performance. Since the on-board comfort has become a performance parameter, the vibration and noise level are topics of increasing interest to ship-owners, ship designers and builders. The engine-mount loading is the primary source of vibrations onboard boats. Indeed, the increased sophistication of the on board outfitting has required lower limits levels on vibration and noise over the last decade. By contrast, the current trend aims at producing faster ships, equipped with increasingly powerful engines, which imply, in the absence of proper measures of contrast, higher levels of vibration and noise. In order to improve the comfort level onboard their superyachts, Azimut|Benetti Shipyards, in cooperation with the Naval Architecture Section of the DITEN Department of the University of Genova and with the DIA Department of the University of Trieste, began an investigation campaign of the dynamic response of the marine Diesel engine foundations. The dynamic behavior of the Diesel <b>engine</b> <b>foundation</b> is a paramount importance to evaluate its effectiveness in the coupling system between the Diesel engine and the ship structures. An accurate study of the dynamic behavior of these elements allows both avoiding high levels of vibrations in the low frequency range and limiting the structure-borne noise levels in the high frequency range. The knowledge of dynamic response of Diesel engine foundations is a key factor for the comfort assessment in the first phase of ship and superyacht design with regards to noise and vibration characteristics. Given the labour time needed to perform a dynamic FE analysis, with particular reference to mobility analyses, in this study a procedure to individuate the optimum dimensional characteristics of engine foundations numerical models has been performed, in order to achieve in reasonable calculation times reliable results. The investigation has been supported by a wide measurement campaign by which it has been possible to make a validation of numerical result...|$|E
