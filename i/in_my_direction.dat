500|$|As Altgens {{set up for}} {{a second}} {{photograph}} along Elm Street, he heard a sound that he recognized as gunfire, {{and saw that the}} President had been struck in the head. Altgens later wrote that his camera was focused and ready, [...] "but when JFK's head exploded, sending substance <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> I virtually became paralyzed.... Yet, many news people say I should have taken the picture anyway... I should have made the picture that I was set up to make. And I didn't do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|For the score, Giacchino felt no {{pressure}} to align his music with the style or tone of previous MCU films, and [...] "in fact they {{encouraged me to}} go <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> so there were never any handcuffs put on me." [...] In regards to the title character, Giacchino felt the key [...] "was getting inside of him—not worrying {{so much about the}} magic stuff, more just thinking about who he was as a person, what he lost and then how that loss affected him. For me it's a very sad story, {{and a lot of the}} music has this very melancholy feel to it." [...] To particularly differentiate the score, and help create a [...] "mystical mood", Giacchino used a harpsichord and an electric sitar.|$|E
60|$|Several times Thurid pointed {{across the}} river <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> but that his {{gestures}} had any reference to me I did not for a moment believe. Presently he and Matai Shang entered the latter's boat, which turned out into the river and, swinging round, forged steadily across <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Rulli's {{father taught}} {{him about the}} birds and the bees in the seventh grade when he [...] "threw a book <b>in</b> <b>my</b> general <b>direction,</b> and said, 'Let me know if you have any questions.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Their eyes--indeed, {{for that}} matter {{the eyes of the}} entire company--were turned <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> before.|$|E
60|$|Therefore I danced again {{among the}} gods till a {{policeman}} {{saw me and}} took steps <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Lord, sir!" [...] groaned Job, [...] "surely she don't mean us to {{walk across}} that there place on that there thing," [...] as <b>in</b> {{obedience}} to <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> he pushed the long board towards me.|$|R
60|$|At the {{critical}} moment my courage failed me. I {{was afraid to}} tell him <b>in</b> what <b>direction</b> <b>my</b> suspicions pointed.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{it was the}} Captain who awakened me, not I the Captain, {{saying that}} {{daylight}} was on the break and we had better be stirring. So {{we went down to}} the Store, where I was thankful to find that everything had been tidied up <b>in</b> accordance with <b>my</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|R
60|$|A gentleman {{with a fine}} head {{of white}} hair {{suddenly}} pointed an impatient finger <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> and apostrophised me.|$|E
60|$|I {{laughed at}} this, and Challenger looked <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> with his coldest and most supercilious stare. It {{was a most}} petrifying experience.|$|E
60|$|The {{face of the}} Mother Superior was {{slightly}} flushed, as she walked rapidly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b> Saluting her, I inquired what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you go <b>in</b> that <b>direction,</b> <b>my</b> dear, {{have the}} {{goodness}} to remind Miss Helstone {{to wrap up}} well, {{as there is a}} fresh wind, and she appears to me to require care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] he said, [...] "there's {{one thing}} certain, {{and that is}} that Elsa won't have to suffer again from the {{insolence}} of that Jewess. I have cut the ground from under your feet <b>in</b> that <b>direction,</b> <b>my</b> friend." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to express my deep and sincere {{gratitude}} to all who made this work possible. I am especially grateful to Professor Ali Hajimiri for his constant support and guidance throughout my Ph. D. studies. His broad vision, together with his remarkable knowledge of our field of research, {{has proved to be}} invaluable <b>in</b> defining <b>my</b> research <b>direction.</b> He has been a great instructor, supervisor, and friend...|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} {{silent for a}} while and then with a polite smile and a movement of the head <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> he warned her.|$|E
60|$|He shot a most unamiable glance <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> and, turning {{upon his}} heel, {{he walked with}} little, quick, {{noiseless}} {{steps out of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|While I stared {{with a sort}} {{of wonder}} he {{asserted}} himself by opening his eyes and even moving them <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b> A minute stir.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} again blushed, but answered, {{with a smile}} that had a {{beautiful}} effect upon his countenance, [...] "I was not, at the moment, aware <b>in</b> which <b>direction</b> <b>my</b> horse's head was turned. I have to thank you for arresting me in a journey which was likely to prove much longer than I intended." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{mother said}} nothing in that discussion. The word colonies always upset her. She was afraid, I think, {{that if she}} turned her mind <b>in</b> that <b>direction</b> <b>my</b> errant father might {{suddenly}} and shockingly be discovered, no doubt conspicuously bigamic and altogether offensive and revolutionary. She {{did not want to}} rediscover my father at all.|$|R
5000|$|The New Czar's debut album, Doomsday Revolution, was {{released}} September on 14, 2010 on Samson Records. About the album, Hampton explained, “You can {{hear some of}} the elements of the past records I’ve been involved in. There’s an inherent nature <b>in</b> <b>my</b> writing <b>direction,</b> which stems from my roots. I had been raised in the South in the blues-rock/funky vein, but there are some industrial rock, pop and progressive elements to our music." [...] Produced by Hampton, Doomsday Revolution also includes contributions on the six-string by Adrian Belew. “His sensibilities for progressive and weird music and bizarre pop stuff are certainly on par with my thinking,” Hampton said about the living legend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Friends!" [...] said Mackay. [...] "Who were ye meaning?" [...] and Cotton turned <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> {{with the}} face of one who had {{narrowly}} escaped a blunder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Admirable tenderness!" [...] said Madame Fosco, admiring her husband, with a last viperish look <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b> She took up {{the cage}} carefully, and left the room.|$|E
6000|$|Just then my {{antagonist}} {{turned his}} face around <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> the freckled light from the watchman's tin lantern fell on it, and, by George, he was the wrong man! ...|$|E
40|$|My lifelong mentors iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I want {{to express}} my heartfelt {{gratitude}} to my thesis advisor Dr. Nikil Jayant for his constant encouragement and his faith in me. His great insights have given me enough leeway to nurture <b>my</b> creativity <b>in</b> research and yet stay focussed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> research <b>direction.</b> I {{would also like to}} thank my committee member Professor Raghupathy Sivakumar and Professor Yucel Altunbasak for their invaluable inputs during the course of the research. Their insights helped shape my thought process during the course of the work. I thank Professor Ian Akyildiz and Professor Doug Blough for their mentorship early <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Master program and also Ms. Barbara Satterfield, Mr. Rex Smith and Ms. Tina Clonts for their help with administrative matters. I would like to thank my parents and my sister for their unconditional love an...|$|R
60|$|And this is {{just what}} happened. The {{lot of them were}} almost, {{swallowed}} up in the twilight for a moment. Then they reappeared again, but this time far to the right and circling back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> general <b>direction.</b> I waited until I could get some clear idea of the right spot to gain that I might intercept the lidi; but even as I waited I saw the beast attempt to turn still more to the right--a move that would have carried him far to <b>my</b> left <b>in</b> a much more circumscribed circle than the hyaenodons had mapped out for him. Then I saw the female leap forward and head him; and when he would have gone too far to the left, Raja sprang, snapping at his shoulder and held him straight.|$|R
60|$|Having thus {{spent nine}} months in Holland, refused the best offer ever woman <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{circumstances}} had, parted unkindly, and indeed barbarously, with the best friend and honestest man in the world, got all <b>my</b> money <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket, and a bastard <b>in</b> <b>my</b> belly, I took shipping at the Brill in the packet-boat, and arrived safe at Harwich, where my woman Amy was come by <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> to meet me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] she explained, more <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> than to me, [...] "that I {{had none}} to begin with. But Alderling had. His people {{believed}} in the future life." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the bustle}} I made the girl turned her eyes slowly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> {{and even the}} old woman was checked in her knitting. I stopped a moment to exclaim excitedly: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{waited until}} his small, round eye had rolled back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b> [...] "Yes, Adam," [...] I said, [...] "but {{what did he}} say? You mean {{she told him about}} me?" ...|$|E
40|$|I wish {{to express}} my {{gratitude}} to my supervisor, Professor Benoît Macq, who {{gave me the opportunity}} to carry out this study with significant freedom <b>in</b> <b>my</b> research <b>directions.</b> I particularly thank him for his trust and openmindness that allowed me to perform research in three different laboratories without losing academic nor personal track. I {{would also like to thank}} Professor Simon K. Warfield from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard Medical School (USA) for his dedication to share with me his experience in medical applications and his kindness for introducing me to Harvard Medical School. I fully appreciated the advice and suggestions he gave me while I was searching for interesting applications for my research, and again while preparing research papers. I am equally most grateful to Professor Alan H. Barr from the Computer Graphics group at the California Institute of Technology (USA) for his support and understanding throughout my work. Thanks to his insight...|$|R
60|$|Not even vanity could persuade me {{that they}} were {{laughing}} at anything more grotesque than myself, so, putting a bold face on matters so humiliating, I sauntered as carelessly and loftily as I dared <b>in</b> their <b>direction.</b> <b>My</b> courage seemed to abash them a little; they gathered back their petticoats like birds about to fly. But at hint of a titter, they all three began gaily laughing again till their eyes sparkled brighter than ever, and their cheeks seemed shadows of the roses above their heads.|$|R
6000|$|... 'From {{the brow}} {{of the next}} hill I saw a thick wood {{spreading}} wide and black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in particular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I {{could no longer see}} the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was <b>in</b> doubt of <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b> I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would be {{out of sight of the}} stars. Even were there no other lurking danger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose upon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike against.|$|R
