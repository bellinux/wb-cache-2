50|$|The {{widespread}} {{construction of}} UK conservatories {{came to a}} halt with the onset of World War II. While the advent of insulated glass in the 1950s and 1960s saw the development of simple sunroom structures, {{it was not until the}} 1970s that creative architects and builders began to recreate the Victorian styling of 19th-century English conservatories in smaller domestic versions using insulated glass. In contemporary construction, a conservatory differs from an orangery in having more than 75% of its roof surface made from glass. A conservatory by definition must have more than 50% of its wall surface glazed. Contemporary conservatories use a number of technologies to ensure glass is as energy efficient as possible, ensuring it lets in the maximum light possible while maintaining a steady temperature throughout summer and winter.

The proper use of thermal insulation in buildings does not only contribute in reducing the required air-conditioning or heating size, reducing the thickness of walls but also in reducing the annual energy cost.

40|$|As the {{development}} of civil construction, the heat island effect in large cities of China has gradually become a social issue. Pavements, especially asphalt pavements, {{are considered to be}} one of the main causes of the heat island effect as they cover wide area of cities. In some regions, the surface of asphalt pavements can even be heated up to more than 70 ℃ by solar irradiation in summer times due to the excellent heat-absorbing property of asphalt concrete. In this paper, a solar <b>heat</b> <b>reflective</b> coating on asphalt pavement was investigated to reduce asphalt pavements temperature and mitigate the heat island effect. A solar <b>heat</b> <b>reflective</b> coating was synthesized with certain component contents of resin, pigments, fillings and additives on the basis of the principles of heat reflection.

The influence of the reduction in the surface temperature on the air temperature was simulated. The research results indicate that the solar <b>heat</b> <b>reflective</b> coating can obviously reduce the surface temperature of asphalt concrete for its high light-reflection rate in the infrared and visible wavelength region. Furthermore, the accelerated loading test also suggests that this coating improves the rutting resistance of the asphalt concrete compared to the reference when exposed to the same irradiation strength. Therefore, this solar <b>heat</b> <b>reflective</b> coating on asphalt pavement could be adopted as a countermeasure against the heat island effect...|$|E

Although radiation resistant refractive optics functioned well for the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) periscope system during D-T operation, this design approach is unpromising in the much more hostile radiation environment of future D-T devices such as the International Thermonumclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

40|$|Measured {{data and}} {{computer}} simulations {{have demonstrated the}} impact of roof albedo in reducing cooling energy use in buildings. Savings are a function of both climate {{and the amount of}} roof insulation. The cooling energy savings for reflective roofs are highest in hot climates. A reflective roof may also lead to higher <b>heating</b> energy use. <b>Reflective</b> coatings are also used in commercial buildings to protect the roofing membrane, and hence, maintain and prolong the useful life of the roof. Reflectivity of coatings changes with weathering and aging which in turn could have an effect on building cooling-energy savings. For that reason, reflective roof coatings are not primarily marketed for their energy savings potential. To monitor the field performance of reflective coatings, the authors initiated a demonstration project where three commercial buildings in California were painted with light-colored roof coatings. The buildings are two medical care centers and one drug store. At all sites, the roof reflectance, both fresh and aged, and cooling energy use were monitored. In addition, they measured temperature throughout the roof systems and inside the conditioned space. In the monitored buildings, increasing the roof reflectance from an initial value of about 20 % to 60 %, dropped the roof temperature on hot summer afternoons by about 45 F. Summertime standard-weekday average daily air-conditioning savings were 18 % (198 kWh) in the first medical office building, 13 % (86 kWh) in the second medical office building, and 2 % (13 kWh) in the drug store.

40|$|Temperature {{distributions}} {{resulting from}} insonation with stationary or steered beams of unfocused or focused ultrasound were measured in tissue-equivalent phantom, beef muscle in vitro, dog muscle mass, and transplanted murine tumours in vivo. Arrays of 4 to 6 thermocouples {{stepped through the}} volume of interest under computer control were {{used to measure the}} steady-state temperatures at 600 to 800 locations in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results were confirmed in spontaneous tumours in dog patients using fewer multi-thermocouple probes. Plane wave ultrasound was found to result in spatially non-uniform hyperthermia even in superficial tumours. The region of maximum temperature rise was small in extent and was situated at a depth which varied in the different models from 0. 5 to 1. 0 cm. Neither its location nor its extent could be varied by spatial manipulations of the transducer or by changing the insonation parameters except the ultrasonic frequency. A second region of hyperthermia was produced at depth by <b>reflective</b> <b>heating</b> if an ultrasonically reflective target, such as bone or air-containing tissue, was located below the target tissue. On the other hand, using available steered, focused ultrasound techniques, tumours (whether situated superficially or at depth) could be heated to a uniform, controllable temperature without undesirable temperature elevation in surrounding normal tissues. The use of steered, focused ultrasound permits deposition of energy to be tailored to the specific needs of each individual tumour. The small size of the focal region enables heating of tumours even when located near ultrasound reflecting targets...|$|R
