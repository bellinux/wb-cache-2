5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E

25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

[...] In 2007, U.S. {{presidential candidate}} Mitt Romney, George's son, told the Salt Lake Tribune that [...] "I haven't heard my name associated with [...] or anything of that nature.

In the article, Harpole is quoted talking about [...] "small ghettos" [...] being created and [...] "rival tribes" [...] being settled together. Despite Harpole's assertion that he was misquoted, multiple conservative sites, including Breitbart News, picked up the story. Harpole insisted, [...] "I have no concern about refugees and ones that have been here. I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> that they've been a big part and {{a good part of}} our community". Later, on April 21, 2016, Harpole testified in front of the Texas Senate on the issue, complaining that Amarillo has not [...] "been involved in the consultation meetings [...] at all".|$|E

500|$|All of the {{officers}} and troopers of Forbes' column had high praise for Burnham's actions, and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later. One member of the column, Trooper ME Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald in 1944 that once Commandant Piet Raaff took over command from the disgraced Major Forbes it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion." [...] For his service in the war, Burnham was presented the British South Africa Company Medal, a gold watch, and a share of a 300-acre (120ha) tract of land in Matabeleland. It was here that Burnham uncovered many artifacts in the huge granite ruins of the ancient civilization of Great Zimbabwe. Matabeleland {{became part of the}} Company domain, which was formally named Rhodesia, after Rhodes, in 1895. Matabeleland and Mashonaland became collectively called Southern Rhodesia.|$|E

[...] Burnham proceeded to become a key figure {{for a number of}} commanding officers, including Frederick Carrington, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Roberts. Carrington called him [...] "the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa. He was my Chief of Scouts in '96 in Matabeleland and he was the eyes and ears of my force". The US President Theodore Roosevelt described him in 1901 as [...] "a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter... the ideal scout." [...] While fighting with the British Army in the Second Boer War, Burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, then Britain's second highest military honour.|$|E
2500|$|I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the}} basis {{assumptions}} underlying Book of Mormon wordprint studies are faulty. I concur with {{the assessment of}} John Tvedtnes, who points out that (1) an English translation should reflect {{the language of the}} translator rather than the original author, and (2) the particles used in wordprint studies (such as [...] "of") are often non-existent in Hebrew, which tends to use syntax to express the meaning of English particles.|$|E

2500|$|Protestants <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> {{obliged to}} help people. They have founded hospitals, homes for {{disabled}} or elderly people, educational institutions, organisations that give aid to developing countries, {{and other social}} welfare agencies. In the nineteenth century, throughout the Anglo-American world numerous dedicated members of all Protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery, prison reforms, and woman suffrage. As {{an answer to the}} [...] "social question" [...] of the nineteenth century, Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state (health insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, old-age pensions). To Bismarck this was [...] "practical Christianity". These programs, too, were copied by many other nations, particularly in the Western world.|$|E

2500|$|Crabb is {{a member}} of Conservatives for Israel. In May 2016, he spoke at a meeting {{organised}} by an Orthodox Jewish youth movement to mark the establishment of Israel in 1948. He celebrated the claim that Israel is a country in the Middle East where Christians are not persecuted and said of his visit to Israel in 2007: [...] "As a Christian, I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> a very close affinity with the Holy Land. It was a delight to see places [...] that I had learned about during my own childhood at Sunday school and {{in the pages of the}} scriptures we were encouraged to read."

2500|$|Jackson's {{idea for}} [...] "Black Cat" [...] {{was based on}} a warning to a rebel {{involved}} in substance abuse, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the folklore superstitions of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything–that's the way I feel about my work."

I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape." [...] She later recalled Jam & Lewis saying [...] "they thought it was something that might work."

2500|$|In 1909, Murphy {{published}} a column deploring the ongoing agitation against college football. He responded to charges {{that it was}} a brutal sport as follows: [...] "I am not disposed to deny that football is a rough game. But when cleanly played as it is in our big colleges, and when properly safeguarded the element of danger is almost entirely eliminated." [...] In response to proposals to replace football in American universities with either soccer or Canadian rugby, Murphy expressed disdain: [...] "Both of these are jokes when compared to the American game. They lack the science of our football and certainly would not prove very interesting to the spectators." [...] Murphy spoke in favor of removing restrictions on the forward pass, which he viewed as a spectacular play and one that weakens the defense. His main suggestions for eliminating injuries were to abolish the diving tackle, develop better padding, and eliminate the kickoff. With respect to the kickoff, Murphy noted: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> that it was in the crash of the two teams that most accidents occurred." ...|$|E
