50|$|Goswami's {{studies have}} been {{focusing}} focused on clinical endocrinology and he has carried out research on diseases such as hypocalcemia and idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. His studies on vitamin D deficiency covered <b>etiopathogenesis</b> and gravity of the disorder across the population and his work {{was the first of}} its kind in India. His research revealed that vitamin D deficiency among Indian population is due to their dark skin (which prevented formation of vitamin D by blocking ultra violet rays) as well as inhibition of over-expression of Calcitriol receptor gene, resulting in inadequate bio-adaptation. He advocated against treating the nutritional deficiency through supplements and advised exposure to sunlight as a remedial measure. His work on idiopathic hypoparathyroidism assisted in widening the understanding of the disease with regard to its clinical signs such as parathyroid spondyloarthropathy, basal ganglia calcification and development of hyperphosphatemia. His {{studies have been}} documented by way of a number of articles of which many have been listed by online article repositories such as Google Scholar and ResearchGate. Besides, he has contributed chapters to books published by others and his work has drawn citations from other authors. He has also presented his research at medical forums including the National Symposium on Nutrition and Bone Health of Nutrition Foundation of India held in 2007. and serves as an editorial associate for the Annals of the National Academy of Medical Sciences (India).|$|E

The effects of {{nitrogen dioxide}} poisoning of female reproduction may be linked with the effects of oxidative stress in female reproduction.Nitrogen dioxide poisoning disrupts the balance of reactive oxygen species, ROS which results in OS and this has significant effects on female reproductive life span. ROS {{play a significant role in}} body physiology, from oocyte production, development and maturation to fertilization, development of embryo and pregnancy.Exposure to nitrogen dioxide causes an ovulation-induced oxidative damage to the DNA of ovarian epithelium.There is a growing literature on the pathological effects of ROS on female reproduction in relation to free radical-induced birth defect, abortion, hydatidiform mole and pathophysiogy of pre-eclampsia. ROS also play a significant role in <b>etiopathogenesis</b> of endometriosis, a disease in which tissue that normally grows inside the uterus grows outside the uterus.Oxidative stress causes defective placentation which is likely to lead to placental hypoxia, shortage of oxygen in the placental as well as reperfusion injury resulting from ischemia which may lead to endothelial cell dysfunction.Over-expression of oxidative stress caused by nitrogen dioxide poisoning may results in ovarian epithelium inflammation and sometime leads to cancer in severe cases.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Alopecia areata (AA) is a recurrent, autoimmune, {{inflammatory}} disease characterized by loss of scarless hair. The <b>etiopathogenesis</b> {{is not exactly}} known, however genetic, emotional, environmental factors and autoimmunity are accused. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the role of oxidative stress in the <b>etiopathogenesis</b> of AA. Methods: Thirty seven AA patients and thirty five healthy volunteers as control group were included in the study. Oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated by measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant capacity (TOC) in patient and control group serum samples. Results: The TAC values of the patient group were found to be higher than the control group (p= 0. 036). A nonsignificant difference was found between the two groups statistically bordered by TOC (p= 0. 058). There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups in terms of OSI (p= 0. 270). Conclusion: Oxidative stress may play a role in the <b>etiopathogenesis</b> of AA. The increase in TAC values suggests that the antioxidant system works adequately in patch-type mild severe AA...|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory, pruritic {{skin disease}} with increasing prevalence. The <b>etiopathogenesis</b> of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and involves a complex interplay {{of environmental and}} genetic factors that induce derangements in the structure and function of the epidermal barrier and immune system. Due to great heterogeneity of <b>etiopathogenesis,</b> there is also great variability of clinical presentation, and diagnosis can sometimes be challenging and difficult. Diagnosis mostly relies on clinical features and laboratory tests, but morphology alone cannot reliably establish the diagnosis, so the spectrum of features associated with AD must be considered. Traditionally, patients with AD have been separated into two different subgroups, i. e. intrinsic and extrinsic. Today, most of authors prefer the outside to inside and back to outside hypothesis, suggesting that the primary disorder lies in epidermal structure and function, resulting in inflammation and immunological downstream activation which further provokes secondary barrier abnormalities.
