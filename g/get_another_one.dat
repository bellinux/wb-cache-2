50|$|Having no {{real purpose}} or any use after 1947, North Field was soon officially {{abandoned}} by the USAAF. Immediately after the war, the locals on the island {{did not have to}} farm or do work of any kind for the first two years after the airfield was abandoned because the withdrawing American military forces left entire stocks of almost everything ranging from food, brand-new military uniforms and even ice-cream makers (these were simply left behind in North Field's many warehouses). Any of the locals who wanted to get a vehicle could just do so by heading to the airfield and drive it until it fell apart or could not be repaired anymore before <b>getting</b> <b>another</b> <b>one.</b> Some abandoned B-29 Superfortress bomber aircraft wrecks were also left behind at the airfield after the war ended, but these were eventually melted down for scrap metal in the 1950s.|$|R

He wastes his time, spoils his temper, makes himself and everyone around him uncomfortable, and after all he is robbed. Life is too short for it, especially in a climate like this.

40|$|According to {{extensive}} {{ab initio}} calculations of lattice QCD, {{the very large}} energy density available in heavy-ion collisions at SPS and now at RHIC must be sufficient to generate quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a new state of matter {{in the form of}} plasma of free quarks and gluons. The new state of matter discovered at RHIC seems to be perfect fluid rather than free plasma. Its shear viscosity is assumed to be almost zero. In this work, I first considered the theoretical and phenomenological consequences of this discovery and finally asked questions about the nature of phase transition and properties of matter. It is important to answer these questions, otherwise QGP will remain a kind of black box; one sends a signal via new experiments or simulations or models and <b>gets</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> from it. I will show that some promising ideas have already been suggested a long time ago. I will also suggest a new phase diagram with separated deconfinement and freeze-out boundaries and a mixed state of thermal quark matter and bubbles of hadron gas. ...|$|R
6000|$|How few men, {{says the}} Oldest Member, possess the proper golfing temperament! How few indeed, {{judging by the}} sights I see here on Saturday afternoons, possess any {{qualification}} at all for golf except a pair of baggy knickerbockers and enough money {{to enable them to}} pay for the drinks {{at the end of the}} round. The ideal golfer never loses his temper. When I played, I never lost my temper. Sometimes, it is true, I may, after missing a shot, have broken my club across my knees; but I did it in a calm and judicial spirit, because the club was obviously no good and I was going to <b>get</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> anyway. To lose one's temper at golf is foolish. It gets you nothing, not even relief. Imitate the spirit of Marcus Aurelius. [...] "Whatever may befall thee," [...] says that great man in his [...] "Meditations", [...] "it was preordained for thee from everlasting. Nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by nature to bear." [...] I like to think that this noble thought came to him after he had sliced a couple of new balls into the woods, and that he jotted it down on the back of his score-card. For there can be no doubt that the man was a golfer, and a bad golfer at that. Nobody who had not had a short putt stop on the edge of the hole could possibly have written the words: [...] "That which makes the man no worse than he was makes life no worse. It has no power to harm, without or within." [...] Yes, Marcus Aurelius undoubtedly played golf, and all the evidence seems to indicate that he rarely went round in under a hundred and twenty. The niblick was his club.|$|E
6000|$|I am ravished by {{your letter}} {{after reading the}} play (keep it locked up, safe and secret, though there are three or four copies in existence) which makes me feel as {{if there had been}} a triumphant première and I had {{received}} overtures from every managerial quarter and had only to count my gold. At any rate I am delighted that you have been struck with it exactly as I have tried to strike, and that the pure practical character of the effort has worked its calculated spell upon you. For what encourages me in the whole business is that, as the piece stands, there is not, in its felicitous form, the ghost of a [...] "fluke" [...] or a mere chance: it is all [...] "art" [...] and an absolute address of means to the end--the end, viz., of meeting exactly the immediate, actual, intense British conditions, both subjective and objective, and of acting in (to a minute, including entr'actes) 2 hours and 3/4. Ergo, I can do a dozen more infinitely better; and I am excited to think how much, since the writing of this one piece has been an education to me, a little further experience will do for me. Also I am sustained by the sense, on the whole, that though really superior acting would help it immensely, yet mediocrity of handling (which is all, at the best, I am pretty sure, that it will get) won't and can't kill it, and that there may be even something sufficiently general and human about it, to make it (given its eminent actability) [...] "keep the stage," [...] even after any first vogue it may have had has passed away. That fate--in the poverty-stricken condition of the English repertory--would mean profit indeed, and an income to my descendants. But one mustn't talk of this kind of thing yet. However, since you have been already so deeply initiated, I think I will enclose (keep it sacredly for me) an admirable letter I have just received from the precious Balestier in whose hands, as I wrote you, I placed the settlement of the money-question, the terms of the writing agreement with Compton. Compton saw him on Monday last--and I send the letter mainly to illustrate the capital intelligence and competence of Balestier and show you in what good hands I am. He will probably strike you, as he strikes me, as the perfection of an [...] "agent"--especially when you consider that he has undertaken this particular job out of pure friendship. Everything, evidently, will be well settled--on the basis, of course, which can't be helped, of production in London only about the middle of next year. But by that time I hope to have done a good bit more work--and I shall be beguiled by beginning to follow, in the autumn, the rehearsals for the country production. Keep Balestier's letter till I come back--I shall <b>get</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> from him in a day or two with the agreement to sign.... These castles in Spain are at least exhilarating: in a certain sense I should like you very much to communicate to William your good impression of the drama--but on the whole I think you had better not, for the simple reason that it is very important it shouldn't be talked about (especially so long) in advance--and it wouldn't be safe, inasmuch as every whisper gets into the papers--and in some fearfully vulgarized and perverted form. You might hint to William that you have read the piece under seal of secresy to me and think so-and-so of it--but are so bound (to me) not to give a sign that he must bury what you tell him in tenfold mystery. But I doubt if even this would be secure--it would be in the Transcript the next week.|$|E
