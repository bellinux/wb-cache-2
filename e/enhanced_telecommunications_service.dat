40|$|Modern {{stored program}} control (SPC) digital exchanges {{represent}} an opportunity to <b>enhance</b> traditional <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services</b> by offering subscribers finer control over the way their calls are managed. Thus far, the predominant approach (Intelligent Networks) has involved making highly specialised, well-defined functions available as services. These tend to exhibit a low degree of configurability and often {{interact with each other}} in undesirable ways (a phenomenon commonly known as feature interaction). This approach does not exploit the potential offered by SPC exchanges to the full, and cannot adequately deal with specific customer requirements. We propose an alternative approach whereby calls are managed by a number of cooperating agents acting on behalf of subscribers. In this model, subscribers have finer control over the functionality offered by the switch via their agents. The latter communicate amongst each other using a negotiation protocol which enables many kinds of fea [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The coming {{decade of}} Mars {{exploration}} involves {{a variety of}} unique telecommunications challenges. Increasing spatial and spectral resolution of in situ science instruments drive the need for increased bandwidth. At the same time, many innovative and low-cost in situ mission concepts are enabled by energy-efficient relay communications. In response to these needs, the Mars Exploration Program has established a plan for an evolving orbital infrastructure that can provide <b>enhancing</b> and enabling <b>telecommunications</b> <b>services</b> to future Mars missions. We will present the evolving capabilities of this network over the coming decade in terms of specific quantitative metrics such as data volume per sol and required lander energy per Gb of returned data for representative classes of Mars exploration spacecraft...|$|R
