5|$|Titanics {{survivors}} {{were rescued}} around 04:00 on 15April by the RMS Carpathia, which had steamed {{through the night}} at high speed and at considerable risk, as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs en route. Carpathias lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe more than a half) had died overnight. The remaining survivors– {{an unknown number of}} men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner Oceanic, with the bodies still aboard.|$|E
5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher wrote Speeches and The Christian Faith, proposing a theodicy which John Hick later {{identified}} as Irenaean in nature. Schleiermacher began his theodicy by asserting that God is omnipotent and benevolent and concluded that, because of this, [...] "God would create flawlessly". He proposed {{that it would}} be illogical for a perfect creation to go wrong (as Augustine had suggested) and that evil must have been created by God for a good reason. Schleiermacher conceived a perfect world to be one in which God's purposes can naturally be achieved, and will ultimately lead to dependence on God. He conceived sin as being an obstruction to humanity's dependence on God, arguing that it is almost inevitable, but citing Jesus {{as an example of a}} sinless man, whose consciousness of God was unobstructed. This theology led Schleiermacher to universalism, arguing that it is God's will for <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saved and that no person could alter this.|$|E
500|$|Stating {{that such}} a {{conservative}} criticism of his film's [...] "strong environmental anti-war themes" [...] was not unexpected, Cameron stressed that he was [...] "interested in saving the world that my {{children are going to}} inhabit", encouraged <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a [...] "tree hugger", and urged that we [...] "make a fairly rapid transition to alternate energy." [...] The film and Cameron's environmental activism caught the attention of the 8,000-strong Dongria Kondh tribe from Orissa, eastern India. [...] They appealed to him to help them stop a mining company from opening a bauxite open-cast mine, on their sacred Niyamgiri mountain, in an advertisement in Variety that read: [...] "Avatar is fantasy... and real. [...] The Dongria Kondh... are struggling to defend their land against a mining company hell-bent on destroying their sacred mountain. Please help...." [...] Similarly, a coalition of over fifty environmental and aboriginal organizations of Canada ran a full-page ad in the special Oscar edition of Variety likening their fight against Canada's Alberta oilsands to the Na'vi insurgence, —a comparison the mining and oil companies objected to. [...] Cameron was awarded the inaugural Temecula Environment Award for Outstanding Social Responsibility in Media by three environmentalist groups for portrayal of environmental struggles that they compared with their own.|$|E
500|$|The level design {{received}} mixed comments. Mueller called {{some of them}} [...] "extremely frustrating". Helgeson {{stated that}} the fast-paced [...] "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for Game Informer, called the level design [...] "disastrous". Official Xbox Magazine was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D Sonic gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed Sonic Heroes. GameTrailers found that [...] "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the Sonic universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops {{and an assortment of}} other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." [...] Bettenhausen included [...] "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" [...] of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina deplored the [...] "stupid level design", adding that [...] "Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy with the outcome." [...] GameSpy observed that [...] "the areas are much less open than in previous Sonic games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints." [...] Nintendo Power singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.|$|E

500|$|Michael {{had shown}} the office a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{cut of the}} film years ago, but the {{employees}} all mistook it for a comedy, and Michael was so offended by their laughing that he shut down the screening. Everyone is very eager to see Michael's film, albeit only because they all appear in it, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) warns <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mindful of how sensitive Michael is and not laugh. However, Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress his laughter at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers {{the rest of the}} office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept. While watching, Michael begins noting how the film is not really very good; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that people are having fun watching. They sit down and laugh {{with the rest of the}} office through the film's conclusion.|$|E
500|$|The {{county court}} system in England and Wales {{dates back to}} the County Courts Act 1846, which {{received}} Royal Assent on 28 August 1846 and was brought into force on 15 March 1847. England and Wales (with the exception of the City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 county courts within these circuits. The then Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, wanted <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> within seven miles of a court, and the final scheme came close to that aim. One county court judge was appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary, sitting in each court at least once a month. Few permanent courts were needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use. In some places, a building is now shared with the local Crown Court (as at Maidstone Combined Court Centre, for example), Family Court, or magistrates' court. The judicial business of the county courts is now carried out by circuit judges (a term introduced by the Courts Act 1971) and district judges (as the post of registrar was renamed by section 74 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990). Part-time judges (recorders, deputy district judges and some retired judges) also sit in the county court. [...] As at 1April 2015, there are 640 circuit judges and 441 district judges.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E

500|$|In mid-2013, the {{paternity}} of Summer (now 18 years old) is questioned {{upon the}} revelation that Nick declared himself her father despite the initial paternity test being corrupt. Nick did this {{to fill the void}} left by Cassie's death. Sharon feels that Summer's birth and the affair between Nick and Phyllis ruined her destiny with him, so she makes the decision to change the results of another test undertaken by Nick; which revealed that he was in fact Summer's father. Following her controversially changing the results, Jack is believed by <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Summer's father. The storyline received negative complaints from fans of the character. Speaking of the storyline, Case told On-Air On-Soaps that an unstable Sharon was trying to reverse the damage caused by Nick's affair with Phyllis. Phyllis overhears Sharon confessing to altering the test results; a fight between the two women in a stairwell results in Phyllis falling down the stairs and slipping into a coma. In a February 2014 [...] "super-secret plot twist", it was revealed that Victor had hired a Cassie doppelganger to haunt Sharon, who has been known to see visions of her deceased daughter while she was off her bipolar medication. Camryn Grimes (who is playing the Cassie lookalike) stated that Victor and Fake Cassie's [...] "initial plan" [...] was to make Nick believe Sharon was [...] "nuts and seeing ghosts" [...] so that he would not reunite with her. However, [...] "then they find out Sharon has an explosive secret — one Victor can really use", that being the secret of Summer's paternity, which Sharon no longer recalls due to recent ECT treatment having resulted in memory loss.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the renewal}} of the fifth season, Abrams stated some {{skepticism}} for a renewal opportunity, but hoped {{that if it was}} cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans. We want them to see where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we want <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{education}} the authors declared that not only should it be made free, it should be made compulsory.

[...] In this system, during times when there wasn't enough space in the prisons, convicts were leased out to work as cheap laborers for [...] "railway contractors, mining companies and those who farm large plantations".

2500|$|Homicide {{case against}} Italian VPD marines: Italy had {{threatened}} to leverage its influence within the Institutions of the European Union to impact relations with India over the ongoing legal wranglings regarding the case of two Italian Navy Marines who India holds responsible for shootings which lead {{to the deaths of}} two Indian fishermen. Federica Mogherini, who was the Italian foreign minister prior to becoming the EUHRVP and head of the European External Affairs Service (EEAS) told the European Parliament in January 2015 that [...] "it's good for <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully aware of how much of an impact the unresolved dispute of the two Italian Navy officials can have on relations between the EU and India. It is putting them to the test". Italian MEPs led debates in the European Parliament and obtained a resolution condemning India for alleged human-rights violations of the two Italian Navy marines. The legal squibblings over the fate of the two Italian marines compounded already tense bilateral relations following earlier investigations in Italy which revealed that Finmeccanica had made illegal payments in the procurement of a fleet of 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters by the Indian Air Force. The European External Affairs Service (EEAS) decided not respond to repeated Indian queries on dates for the Indian Prime-Minister to visit Brussels. Cesare Onestini, the Political Chargé d'Affaires of the Delegation of the European Union to India said: [...] "No date has been formally proposed to the Indian side." [...] The European Parliament's Chair for the delegation on relations with India, Geoffrey Van Orden, said: [...] "This (Italian Marines issue) should not be a matter which affects relationship between the EU and India. This (the EU-India relationship) is something far larger and wider platform to unite. That is why we have expressed disappointment that the summit has been postponed,". Van Orden added: [...] "We attach importance to imprisonment of citizens of our member states. (...) We do respect the Indian legal process, but think the case has taken too long and {{would like to see it}} expedited. Even so, the European parliament would be very concerned if it had any evidence that the EU-India summit delay had anything to do with the case of the marines." [...] Vice Chair, Nina Gill cautioned: [...] "I think it would be very regrettable if that (Italian Marines) issue played any part in it,". Italy's bid to prevent the case coming to trial in India (by involving the Catholic church, proposing blood money to the victims, and actively stalling legal proceedings) appears to have hardened India's stance.|$|E
