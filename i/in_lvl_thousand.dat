40|$|International audienceKey messageA {{modelling}} {{method is}} proposed {{to highlight the}} effect of cambial age on the effective modulus of elasticity of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) according to bending direction and veneer thickness. This approach is relevant for industrial purposes in order to optimize the performance of LVL products. ContextLVL is used increasingly in structural applications. It is obtained from a peeling process, where product’s properties depend on cambial age, hence depend on radial position in the log. AimsThis study aims to highlight how radial variations of properties and cambial age impact the mechanical behaviour of LVL panels. MethodsAn analytical mechanical model {{has been designed to}} predict the modulus of elasticity of samples made from poplar LVL panels. The originality of the model resides in the integration of different data from the literature dealing with the variation in wood properties along the radius of the log. The simulation of the peeling process leads to veneers with different mechanical properties, which are randomly assembled <b>in</b> <b>LVL</b> panels. ResultsThe model shows a correct mechanical behaviour prediction in comparison with experimental results of the literature, in particular with the decrease <b>in</b> MOE <b>in</b> <b>LVL</b> made of juvenile wood. It highlights that the bending direction and veneer thickness have no influence on the average MOE, but affect MOE dispersion.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Non-destructive {{commercial}} ultrasonic grading provides {{laminated veneer}} lumber (LVL) manufacturers a means for sorting veneer based on average ultrasonic propagation time (UPT) and/or average dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEd). While this may provide reliable estimations of modulus of elasticity (MOE), {{little is known about}} the influence of veneer defects on strength properties of veneer and LVL. It was hypothesized that inclusion of veneer defect and growth ring pattern measures, obtained via optical scanning, would improve veneer and LVL static tensile MOE and strength (Ft) property predictions. Non-destructive and destructive testing on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) veneer and LVL was performed to evaluate improvements <b>in</b> veneer and <b>LVL</b> tensile MOE and Ft property predictions. Various models based solely on density, optical, and ultrasonic system measures, as well as various combinations of systems measures, were developed for individual veneer and LVL property predictions. 	The integration of optical and ultrasonic measures (i. e., combined system model) best explained the variation in veneer static tensile MOE and Ft. The combined system model best predicted average LVL static tensile MOE. LVL static Ft was best predicted by using overall average veneer measures comprising the entire LVL material, rather than the average of individually predicted veneer Ft used <b>in</b> assembling the <b>LVL.</b> Specifically, the combined system model, which included various specific average defect, growth ring pattern, and MOEd measures comprising the LVL material, best explained the variation <b>in</b> <b>LVL</b> static Ft values (R 2 = 0. 65) as compared to all other models. Results from this study suggest improved veneer and LVL Ft predictions can be achieved by integrating the existing ultrasonic and optical systems already existing in many manufacturing facilities. 	Additionally, the optical model which included average defect, growth ring, and density measurements within the LVL material better explained the variation <b>in</b> <b>LVL</b> static Ft values (R 2 = 0. 58), as compared to the MOEd (R 2 = 0. 52) and UPT (R 2 = 0. 31) models.

The strength properties of the materials for different loading directions were compared for LVL and timber. At 5 % compressive strain in the same materials, the average stress in the tangential direction of timber was larger than that in the radial direction for all species except for radiata pine, and the average stress in the edge-wise direction of LVL was larger than that in the flat-wise direction for all species except for radiata pine.

30|$|Curved {{laminated}} veneer lumber (<b>LVL)</b> for use <b>in</b> furniture-making was produced from glue-coated pieces of rotary-cut veneers that were assembled and pressed between molds. Pressure was applied until glue-lines were set and finally held in an assembly of the desired curvature. Pressure was an important factor during pressing of curved <b>LVL.</b> <b>In</b> this study we deduced some equations for designing the shape of molds and calculating the total pressure from the mechanics. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The position angle of every section of curved <b>LVL</b> assembly <b>in</b> molds on the horizontal and the total pressure during pressing can be calculated {{in relation to the}} shapes and dimensions of the curved LVL. (2) The pressure distributions in the glue-line measured using pressure-sensitive film were in good agreement with the glue-line unit pressure provided for the experiment and calculation. Therefore, the equations deduced in this study were suitable for calculating the position angle and pressure of curved <b>LVL</b> <b>in</b> molds. (3) The total pressure on curved LVL was greater than the pressure on straight LVL. The total pressure consisted of the pressure on the glue-lines of straight LVL with the same length and width as curved LVL plus the supplementary pressure needed to bend the veneers. (4) The total pressures and position angles of curved <b>LVL</b> <b>in</b> molds were affected by the shape, bent angle, and length of each section of curved LVL.|$|R
40|$|Documenting the {{environmental}} performance of building products {{is becoming increasingly}} common. Developing environmental product declarations (EPDs) based on life-cycle assessment (LCA) data {{is one way to}} provide scientific documentation. Many U. S. structural wood products have LCA-based “eco-labels ” using the ISO standard. However, the standard requires underlying life-cycle inventory (LCI) data to be of recent age. This study updates the gate-to-gate manufacturing LCI data for laminated veneer lumber (LVL) for Pacific Northwestern (PNW) and for southeastern (SE) United States. Modeling the primary industry data per 1. 0 m 3 of LVL through LCI analysis provides the inputs and outputs from veneer logs to LVL starting at the forest landing. For PNW and SE, cumulative mass-allocated energy consumption associated with manufacturing 1. 0 m 3 of LVL was found to be 5. 64 and 6. 87 GJ/m 3, respectively, with about 25 % of the primary energy derived from wood residues. Emission data produced through modeling found that estimated biomass and fossil CO 2 emissions in kg/m 3 were 127 and 139 for the PNW and 108 and 169 for the SE. One m 3 (~ 535 OD kg wood potion) of LVL stores about 980 kg CO 2 equivalents. The amount of carbon stored <b>in</b> <b>LVL</b> thus exceeds total CO 2 emissions during manufacturing by about 350 %. This study provides the necessary gate-to-gate LVL manufacturing LCI data for the cradle-to-gate LCA to develop an updated EPD...|$|R
