5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|Butler {{was next}} {{assigned}} to garrison {{duty in the}} Philippines, where he once launched a resupply mission across the stormy waters of Subic Bay after his isolated outpost ran out of rations. In 1908, he was <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a nervous breakdown and received nine months sick leave which he spent at home. He successfully managed a coal mine in West Virginia, but returned to active duty in the Marine Corps at the first opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The Vezina Trophy {{was named}} in honor of Georges Vezina, an {{exceptional}} goaltender with the Montreal Canadiens. Vezina collapsed during a game in 1925 and was <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> tuberculosis, of which he died in 1926. Upon Vezina's death, the trophy was donated to the League by the Canadiens' owners, Leo Dandurand, Louis Letourneau and Joe Cattarinich to honour Vezina permanently. It was first awarded {{at the end of the}} 1926–27 NHL season to George Hainsworth who had come to Montreal to succeed Vezina.|$|E

He said he would travel to the Netherlands around the end of January for treatment. Education Minister and Independence Party vice-chairman Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir was to serve as Prime Minister in his absence. The leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, Foreign Minister Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, was also unwell, undergoing treatment for a benign brain tumour since September 2008. The government recommended that elections be held on 9 May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a case}} of {{shingles}} in February 1981, Bobbi Campbell {{suffered a}} succession of unusual illnesses, including leukopenia later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed on his feet lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), then {{thought of as a}} rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in California and New York and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis of a patient with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The Oliviers {{returned}} to Britain in March 1943, and Leigh toured through North Africa {{that same year}} {{as part of a}} revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. She reportedly turned down a studio contract worth $5,000 a week to volunteer as part of the war effort. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944 she was <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> tuberculosis in her left lung and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was filming Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, then had a miscarriage. Leigh temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point, with her falling to the floor, sobbing in an hysterical fit. This was the first of many major bipolar disorder breakdowns. Olivier later came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode– several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.|$|E

25|$|World Health Organization (WHO) {{criteria}} for {{impaired fasting glucose}} differs from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, because the normal range of glucose is defined differently by each. Fasting plasma glucose levels 100mg/dL (5.5mmol/L) and higher {{have been shown to}} increase complication rates significantly, however, WHO opted to keep its upper limit of normal at under 110mg/dL for fear of causing too many people to be <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> impaired fasting glucose, whereas the ADA lowered the upper limit of normal to a fasting plasma glucose under 100mg/dL.|$|E
40|$|Leiomyoma is an {{uncommon}} {{smooth muscle tumor}} on the face. Its occurrence is common in the uterus.

5000|$|Some {{eccentrics}} are pejoratively considered [...] "cranks", {{rather than}} geniuses. Eccentric behavior is often considered whimsical or quirky, {{although it can}} also be strange and disturbing. Many individuals previously considered merely eccentric, such as aviation magnate Howard Hughes, have recently been retrospectively <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> actually <b>having</b> suffered from mental disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder in Hughes' case).|$|R

25|$|An {{accurate}} diagnosis may {{be difficult}} {{because of the way}} the disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, carpal tunnel syndrome, TMD, Tourette's syndrome, conversion disorder or other neuromuscular movement disorders. It has been found that the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntington's disease, where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation, sustained fist clenching, knee flexion, and foot inversion. Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntington's disease include long disease duration and use of antidopaminergic medication.|$|E
25|$|Irritability is {{most often}} noticed along with {{the first signs of}} nervous system impairment. Within {{the first few years of}} life, {{extrapyramidal}} involvement causes abnormal involuntary muscle contractions such as loss of motor control (dystonia), writhing motions (choreoathetosis), and arching of the spine (opisthotonus). Signs of pyramidal system involvement, including spasticity, overactive reflexes (hyperreflexia) and extensor plantar reflexes, also occur. The resemblance to athetoid cerebral palsy is apparent in the neurologic aspects of LNS. As a result, most individuals are initially <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> cerebral palsy. The motor disability is so extensive that most individuals never walk, and become lifelong wheelchair users.|$|E

She has a French mother and a British father, David Blatt (known also as {{author of the book}} Manchester United Ruined My Wife), whose Jewish {{ancestors}} were from Poland and Russia and a younger sister named Jasmine. She was brought up in both the UK and France. In 1986, Blatt was <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> scoliosis. Since her parents were not satisfied with the treatment for the condition in the United Kingdom they decided to move to France, where a specialist inserted three metal rods in her back.|$|E

25|$|After the 1910 general {{election}} the Liberal Party {{did not have}} a majority in the House of Commons and so entered into a coalition with 42 Labour Party MPs who had been elected. This led to further reforms as the Liberals required Labour support and Irish support to remain in office. In 1912, school clinics were set up to treat children who had been <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> an illness during a School Medical under the 1907 scheme. This measure ensured that more children had access to free medical care. From 1912, Exchequer grants were paid to education authorities providing medical treatment for children, and by 1914, 214 out of the (then) 317 local authorities were providing some kind of medical treatment for children.|$|E
25|$|In the Gothenburg study, a {{questionnaire}} for preschool teachers was used from which children with some potential psychiatric problems were classified into either a high-index or a low-index group. In the final investigation, there were 22 children (14 boys and 8 girls) in the high-index group and 60 children (52 boys and 8 girls) in the low-index group. These {{were compared with}} a randomly selected control group. The control group ultimately consisted of 59 children (29 boys and 30 girls). Of the total of 141 children, 42 (33 boys and 9 girls) were <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> MBD/DAMP; of the 42, 40 were in the index group (18 in the high-index group) and 2 in the control group. All the children were initially age 6–7 (born 1971) and were from Gothenburg, Sweden. The children were later investigated at ages 10, 13, 16, and 22.|$|E
25|$|Ray Blanchard, an American-Canadian sexologist {{known for}} his {{research}} studies on pedophilia, addressed (in his literature review for the DSM-5) the aforementioned objections to the DSM-IV-TR, and proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias. This meant namely a distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder. The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable mental disorder which meets Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B can be ascertained but not <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a paraphilia. Blanchard {{and a number of}} his colleagues also proposed that hebephilia become a diagnosable mental disorder under the DSM-5 to resolve the physical development overlap between pedophilia and hebephilia by combining the categories under pedophilic disorder, but with specifiers on which age range (or both) is the primary interest. The proposal for hebephilia was rejected by the American Psychiatric Association, but the distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder was implemented.|$|E
