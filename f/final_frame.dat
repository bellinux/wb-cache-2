5|$|At the Masters on 12 January, Stephen Maguire {{edged out}} O'Sullivan in a <b>final</b> <b>frame</b> {{to win their}} first-round match at Wembley. In a battle of the top two players in the {{provisional}} world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 1–4 down to level at 5–5 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. O'Sullivan missed the final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals. After withdrawing from the invitational Malta Cup, O'Sullivan returned at the Welsh Open in February. Playing a good tournament, he reached the final. Although he led 8–5, Selby won the last four frames to beat him 9–8. O'Sullivan {{was present at the}} China Open, in Beijing, where he lost 4–5 to Marco Fu in the first round. However, at the press conference, which followed the match, O'Sullivan was heard making some lewd remarks inviting a member of the press to perform fellatio on him, then laughing with the World Snooker media spokesman. O'Sullivan also joked about the size and girth of his penis, before simulating a sexual act on his microphone. In June 2008, the WPBSA punished him for his behaviour by docking the appearance money and world-ranking points that he had earned from the event.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{captured}} {{two more}} ranking {{titles in the}} 1997/1998 season. By beating three-time defending champion Stephen Hendry 10–6 in the final, O'Sullivan won his second UK Championship title. O'Sullivan also triumphed at the Scottish Open by defeating John Higgins 9–5 in the final. For the third year in a row, O'Sullivan made {{the final of the}} Charity Challenge. He was defeated, like the year previous, in a <b>final</b> <b>frame</b> decider, 8–9 to John Higgins. For {{the first time in three}} years O'Sullvian did not reach the final at the Masters, losing to Steve Davis. After defeating Ken Doherty 9–3 in the final of the Irish Masters, a post-match drug test found traces of cannabis in his system. O'Sullivan was stripped of the title, forfeited of the prize money and the title was awarded to Doherty by the WPBSA. O'Sullivan reached the World Championship semi-finals for the second time in his career, but lost 9–17 to eventual champion John Higgins.|$|E
5|$|English Open: O'Sullivan {{competed in}} the first of the four Home Nations events, the English Open. In the First Round, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Zhang Anda 4–1. He won despite injuring his ankle prior to the match, and was forced to play in trainers in violation of the player's dress code. World Snooker later gave O'Sullivan permission to wear trainers {{for the rest of the}} Open. In the Second Round, O'Sullivan beat Mark Davis 4–1, compiling back-to-back century breaks of 136 and 134 in the last two frames of the match. In the Third Round, he continued his good form, winning 4–1 against Zhang Yong. O'Sullivan compiled three centuries during the Third Round match. The match was interrupted at the end of the <b>final</b> <b>frame</b> by a female spectator running around the table. Despite the distraction, O'Sullivan continued playing and potted the pink ball for a break of 129 before he offered his cue to the spectator so she could take his last shot (where she missed twice) before being led away by security. In the Last Sixteen match, O'Sullivan trailed John Higgins 0–1, 1–2, and 2–3 before triumphing in the decider and winning 4–3. In the Quarterfinals O'Sullivan beat Jack Lisowski 5–2. In the Semifinals O'Sullivan scored a 6–4 victory over Anthony McGill to reach the Final. In the Final, O'Sullivan defeated Kyren Wilson 9–2 for his 29th ranking title. During the Final match he compiled four centuries and had a pot success of 98%, missing only a total of 6 balls during the 11 frames played. Altogether, O'Sullivan compiled 12 centuries during the tournament, more than any other competitor. This was O'Sullivan's first victory in a ranking event in more than 20 months.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze whether quiet {{standing}} posture is related to compensatory postural adjustment. INTRODUCTION: The latest data in clinical practice suggests that static posture may play a significant role in musculoskeletal function, even in dynamic activities. However, no evidence exists regarding whether static posture during quiet standing is related to postural adjustment. METHODS: Twenty healthy participants standing on a movable surface underwent unexpected, standardized backward and forward postural perturbations while kinematic data were acquired; ankle, knee, pelvis and trunk positions were then calculated. An initial and a <b>final</b> video <b>frame</b> representing quiet standing posture and the end of the postural perturbation were selected in such a way that postural adjustments had occurred between these frames. The positions of the body segments were calculated in these initial and <b>final</b> <b>frames,</b> together with the displacement of body segments during postural adjustments between the initial and <b>final</b> <b>frames.</b> The relationship between the positions of body segments in the initial and <b>final</b> <b>frames</b> and their displacements over this time period was analyzed using multiple regressions with a significance level of p < 0. 05. RESULTS: We failed to identify a relationship between the position of the body segments in the initial and <b>final</b> <b>frames</b> and the associated displacement of the body segments. DISCUSSION: The motion pattern during compensatory postural adjustment is not related to quiet standing posture or to the final posture of compensatory postural adjustment. This fact should be considered when treating balance disturbances and musculoskeletal abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Static posture cannot predict how body segments will behave during compensatory postural adjustment...|$|R

5|$|O'Sullivan {{started the}} 2013/2014 season ranked number 19. Although {{he was out}} of the top 16, winning the World Championship the {{previous}} season allowed him to be seeded in every tournament he decided to enter (number 1 in World Championship 2014 and number 2, behind the defending champion, for all the others. For personal reasons, he pulled out of the first ranking tournament of the season, the Wuxi Classic, shortly before he was due to face Michael Wasley in the qualifying round. In June 2013 he competed in the Bulgarian Open, his first tournament appearance outside England in 15 months, but lost 2–4 against John Higgins in the semi-finals. He went on to win the Paul Hunter Classic by defeating Gerard Greene 4–0 in the final. O'Sullivan then qualified for the International Championship by defeating Joel Walker 6–1 in the qualifying round, and defeated Anthony McGill 6–2 at the venue, before losing 4–6 against Liang Wenbo in the last 32. After that O'Sullivan reached the final of the Antwerp Open, but lost 3–4 against Mark Selby, despite leading 3–1. In the Champion of Champions he defeated Ding Junhui and Neil Robertson in <b>final</b> <b>frame</b> deciders and went on to win the title by defeating Stuart Bingham 10–8 in the final. He reached the quarter-finals of the UK Championship, but lost 4–6 against Bingham, despite making breaks of 135 and 127 in the match.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{played a}} major role in keeping the White Sox {{competitive}} with the powerhouse Yankees through most of the 1950s, and after a rough period from June 1951 to July 1952 in which he dropped 10 of 11 decisions to New York (despite a respectable 3.69 ERA in those games), he held his own against the Yankees, posting a record of 21–21 from August 1952 through the 1960 season. Ironically, the turnaround in his fortunes against the Yankees followed one of Chicago's most crushing defeats to their rivals; on July 29, 1952 he left with a 7–3 lead and one out in the eighth inning, only to see the Yankees come back against the White Sox bullpen to win 10–7 on Mickey Mantle's grand slam in the ninth. Years later, Pierce still recalled the game as being one of his most frustrating outings. He faced Whitey Ford 15 times in his career (more than against any other pitcher), including a 1–0 loss on May 17, 1955, a 3–2 loss in 10 innings on June 5 later that year, a 2–1 loss on July 15, 1956, a 3–2 loss in 11 innings on September 18 of that year (in which the Yankees clinched the pennant on Mantle's 50th home run in the <b>final</b> <b>frame),</b> a 3–1 win on May 21, 1957, and a 4–3 win in 11 innings on April 30, 1959.|$|E

25|$|Liang faced Northern Ireland's Joe Swail in {{the last}} 16 of the tournament. In a humorous incident, Liang fluked a red after {{scattering}} the balls, but failed to notice {{and went back to}} his seat. To laughter, Swail pointed out his mistake and the referee called Liang back to the table. In the 23rd frame, Liang, with a 12–10 lead, prematurely celebrated winning after potting match ball, only to go on to lose the frame due to a snooker. Swail came back to level the match at 12–12. In the <b>final</b> <b>frame,</b> Liang made breaks of 34 and 30 early on. He missed the final yellow but snookered Swail, leaving the white in the jaws of the pocket. Liang played a safety and Swail snookered him behind the blue, but Liang failed to hit the ball and Swail had the white replaced. Liang then hit the yellow directly. This incident proved controversial as the referee replaced the white in the wrong position, giving Liang a better sight of the yellow. At the time, Swail nodded his assent to the referee, but in a post-match interview, complained and accused Liang of unprofessional behaviour for not pointing out the referee's error. Commentators countered that Swail should have queried the placement of the ball before Liang took his shot, and given the tension of the situation Liang could be forgiven for not thinking clearly. Liang {{went on to win the}} frame 74–34, and thus, the match 13–12.|$|E

However, in the <b>final</b> <b>frame</b> Ding missed a red when on a break of 32 which allowed the world number 100 Cahill a chance to knock Ding out which he took. The loss still guaranteed that Ding became the 11th world number one and first from Asia due to Mark Selby and Neil Robertson also suffering early exits. He held the top spot for a week before Robertson reclaimed it. Ding's poor form continued into 2015 as he was knocked out in the first round in six successive events: 6–3 to Joe Perry at the Masters, 5–4 to Ryan Day at the German Masters, 4–1 to world number 115 Lee Walker at the Welsh Open, 4–3 to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh at the Indian Open, 4–1 to Ricky Walden at the World Grand Prix and 4–1 to Joe Perry at the 2015 Players Championship Grand Final. The run was halted at the China Open as he came past Marcus Campbell and Mark Davis both 5–1 and Mark Williams 5–2 to reach the quarter-finals, where he beat John Higgins 5–4 on the colours. In Ding's second ranking event semi-final of the season he tied the scores at 5–5 after being 5–3 down to world number 56 Gary Wilson, but lost the deciding frame.|$|E

Fu faced home favourite and world number one Neil Robertson in the final, defeating him 9–6 to take the second ranking event title of his career and regain {{his place in the}} top 16 of the world rankings. Another final followed at the minor-ranking Bluebell Wood Open, with Fu fighting back from 1–3 down against Ricky Walden to square the match at 3–3 and was unfortunate in the decider when Walden fluked a red, before making a match winning clearance. Fu then lost {{in the second round of}} both the Shanghai Masters and the Indian Open 5–3 to Kyren Wilson and 4–3 to Gary Wilson respectively. He advanced to the quarter-finals of the International Championship in Chengdu, China, where he played Mark Selby. Fu came back from 5–3 down to take the match 6–5 with consecutive breaks of 84 and 112 in the <b>final</b> <b>frame.</b> His semi-final match against Joe Perry was very tight with many frames lasting 40 minutes, but it was Fu who won 9–8 on the colours to reach his third ranking event final of 2013.
