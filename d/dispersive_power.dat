5000|$|Glass with weaker <b>dispersive</b> <b>power</b> (greater [...] ) {{is named}} crown glass; that with greater <b>dispersive</b> <b>power,</b> flint glass. For the {{construction}} of an achromatic collective lens ( [...] positive) it follows, by means of equation (4), that a collective lens I. of crown glass and a dispersive lens II. of flint glass must be chosen; the latter, although the weaker, corrects the other chromatically by its greater <b>dispersive</b> <b>power.</b> For an achromatic dispersive lens the converse must be adopted. This is, at the present day, the ordinary type, e.g., of telescope objective; the values of the four radii must satisfy the equations (2) and (4). Two other conditions may also be postulated: one is always the elimination of the aberration on the axis; the second either the Herschel or Fraunhofer Condition, the latter being the best vide supra, Monochromatic Aberration). In practice, however, it is often more useful to avoid the second condition by making the lenses have contact, i.e. equal radii. According to P. Rudolph (Eder's Jahrb. f. Photog., 1891, 5, p. 225; 1893, 7, p. 221), cemented objectives of thin lenses permit the elimination of spherical aberration on the axis, if, as above, the collective lens has a smaller refractive index; on the other hand, they permit the elimination of astigmatism and curvature of the field, if the collective lens has a greater refractive index (this follows from the Petzval equation; see L. Seidel, Astr. Nachr., 1856, p. 289). Should the cemented system be positive, then the more powerful lens must be positive; and, according to (4), to the greater power belongs the weaker <b>dispersive</b> <b>power</b> (greater [...] ), that is to say, crown glass; consequently the crown glass must have the greater refractive index for astigmatic and plane images. In all earlier kinds of glass, however, the <b>dispersive</b> <b>power</b> increased with the refractive index; that is, [...] decreased as [...] increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the new achromats, and were employed by P. Rudolph in the first anastigmats (photographic objectives).|$|E

Others criticized the experiments, saying that the length of the spectrum was never more than three and a half times the breadth, whereas Newton found it to be five times the breadth. It appears that Newton made the mistake of supposing that all prisms would give a spectrum of exactly the same length; the objections of his opponents led him to measure carefully the lengths of spectra formed by prisms of different angles and of different refractive indices; but he was not led thereby to the discovery of the different <b>dispersive</b> <b>powers</b> of different refractive substances.|$|R

CROSS incorporates the differential <b>dispersive</b> <b>powers</b> of Na and K and {{the differences in the}} flocculating effects of Ca and Mg. The CROSS of the dispersed soil solutions, from the differently treated soils of three soil types varying in clay content, mineralogy, and organic matter, was highly correlated with the amount of clay dispersed. The relation between CROSS and exchangeable cation ratio depended on soil type, and particularly organic matter and the content and mineralogy of clay. Threshold electrolyte concentration of the flocculated suspensions was significantly correlated with CROSS of the dispersed suspensions. The cationic flocculating charge of the flocculated suspensions, which incorporates the individual flocculating powers of the cations, was significantly correlated with CROSS. However, these types of relations will depend on several soil factors even within a given soil class.

60|$|I find as {{a general}} rule that the {{constancy}} of species is in an inverse ratio to their range. Those which are confined to one or two islands are generally very constant. When they extend to many islands, considerable variability appears; and when they have an extensive range over {{a large part of the}} Archipelago, the amount of unstable variation is very large. These facts are explicable on Mr. Darwin's principles. When a species exists over a wide area, it must have had, and probably still possesses, great powers of dispersion. Under the different conditions of existence in various portions of its area, different variations from the type would be selected, and, were they completely isolated, would soon become distinctly modified forms; but this process is checked by the <b>dispersive</b> <b>powers</b> of the whole species, which leads to the more or less frequent intermixture of the incipient varieties, which thus become irregular and unstable. Where, however, a species has a limited range, it indicates less active powers of dispersion, and the process of modification under changed conditions is less interfered with. The species will therefore exist under one or more permanent forms according as portions of it have been isolated at a more or less remote period.|$|R
30|$|An orthogonal-dispersion PGD was {{investigated}} in theory. The ray-tracing simulations by ZEMAX indicated {{the accuracy of the}} theoretical analysis and mathematical formulas. In order to improve the spectral resolution, the <b>dispersive</b> <b>power</b> of the PGD needs to be improved, which can be realized by either appropriately increasing the vertex angle of the prism, properly reducing the groove spacing of grating, or both. In addition, the <b>dispersive</b> <b>power</b> of the PGD can also be changed by choosing different materials of the prism and grating. There are two main features to the PGD. First, the orthogonal-dispersion PGD is based on the transmission grating, whereas traditional cross-dispersion systems are based on the reflection grating. Second, the transmission grating is superimposed on the hypotenuse surface of an optical wedge with a right-angle surface directly attached to the prism, which not only makes the PGD compact, but also makes the air-glass interfaces fewer and therefore makes the reflection loss less. The unique design makes the PGD capable of providing a compact, small-sized and broadband orthogonal-dispersion device that is applicable to the medium resolution spectrometers.|$|E

The <b>dispersive</b> {{approach}} to <b>power</b> corrections {{is given a}} precise implementation, valid beyond single gluon exchange, {{in the framework of}} Sudakov resummation for deep inelastic scattering and the Drell-Yan process. It is shown that the assumption of infrared finite Sudakov effective couplings implies the universality of the corresponding infrared fixed points. This property is closely tied to the universality of the virtual contributions to spacelike and time-like processes, encapsulated in the second logarithmic derivative of the quark form factor. The infrared (IR) finite coupling (“dispersive”) {{approach to}} power corrections [1] provides an attractive framework where the issue of universality can be meaningfully raised. This approach however seems to be tied in an essential way to the single gluon exchange approximation. In this talk I show that it can actually find a precise implementation in the framework of Sudakov resummation, and that its validity extends beyond single gluon exchange. Consider first the scaling violation in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in Mellin space at large N.

In this thesis, the major tasks were to optimise of the RDC technology, to evaluate the microstructure and mechanical properties of RDC AZ 91 D Mg-alloy in both as-cast and heat treated conditions, and to understand the solidification process in the TSSM. The results of the RDC as-cast state indicated that the microstructure of primary a-Mg particles had a fine size (around 40 μm), extremely spherical morphology and uniform distribution throughout the entire castings; the RDC AZ 91 D samples had extremely low levels of porosity. Due to the unique microstructure and much reduced level of defects, the RDC AZ 91 D alloy exhibited a substantial improvement in mechanical properties. In addition, a traditional full heat treatment was performed for RDC AZ 91 D alloy. Compared with HPDC alloy, the RDC AZ 91 D alloy was found to exhibit an accelerated dissolution of ß-Mg 17 A 112 during solution treatment, and a faster age-hardening kinetics of the ß-phase during subsequent ageing. The microstructural investigations showed that under intensive forced convection, heterogeneous nucleation occurred continuously throughout the entire volume of the solidifying melt and the nuclei grew spherically. Ostwald ripening took place by dissolution of the smaller particles but at a very slow coarsening rate. Increasing the intensity of forced convection enhanced nucleation and reduced volume fraction of primary phase solidified in the slurry maker. This study has demonstrated that the novel RDC process possesses a number of advantages and it is suitable for production of high integrity Mg-alloy components.
