5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following <b>factors</b> <b>to</b> compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental <b>factors</b> <b>to</b> compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E

CLB-RAg 201, an MAb against von Willebrand factor, completely inhibits the binding of von Wil-lebrand <b>factor</b> <b>to</b> collagen type I and type III. CLB-RAg 201 does not inhibit the binding of 'SI-von Willebrand <b>factor</b> <b>to</b> extracellular matrices of endothelial cells, to smooth muscle cells, or to the subendothelium. CLB-RAg 201 partly inhibits platelet adhesion to these surfaces, but this directly affects the interaction between von Willebrand factor and platelets and is not due to inhibition of binding of von Willebrand <b>factor</b> <b>to</b> these surfaces. Another MAb, CLB-RAg 38, does not inhibit the binding of von Willebrand <b>factor</b> <b>to</b> collagen. CLB-RAg 38 completely inhibits the binding of von Willebrand <b>factor</b> <b>to</b> extracellular matrices. CLB-RAg 38 inhibits platelet adhesion to cellular matrices completely insofar as it is dependent on plasma von Willebrand factor. CLB-RAg 38 does not inhibit the total bind-ing of von Willebrand <b>factor</b> <b>to</b> subendothelium, as {{there are too many}} different binding sites, but it completely inhibits the functional binding sites for von Willebrand factor that support platelet adhesion. The epitopes for CLB-RAg 38 and 201 on the von Wille-brand factor molecule are located on different fragments of the molecule. These results indicate that von Willebrand <b>factor</b> binds <b>to</b> subendothelium and matrices of cultured cells by a mechanism that is different from that by which it binds to collagen...|$|R

Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate {{them from the}} rest of the cytoplasm where necessary.

At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.|$|E
