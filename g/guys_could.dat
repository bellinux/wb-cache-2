25|$|Living Sacrifice drummer Lance Garvin {{filled in}} for Smith {{when the rest}} of the <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> not find him for a couple of 2003 festival dates. However, the Liberate era lineup reconvened in Greensburg around the promise of a new record label that offered to fund a new Zao album. The label ended up falling apart before a note of music was ever recorded, {{prompting}} Smith to reach out to Ferret Music who agreed to sign the band to a two-album deal. After cutting some new demos, Weyandt left the group.|$|E

[...] A critic for MTV concurred that [...] "it'd take a great leap of logic to tag 'Avatar' as anti-American or anti-capitalist." [...] Ann Marlowe called the film [...] "the most neo-con movie ever made" [...] for its [...] "deeply conservative, pro-American message". [...] But Cameron admitted to some ambiguity on the issue, agreeing that [...] "the bad <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> be America in this movie, or the good <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> be America in this movie, depending on your perspective", and stated that Avatars defeat at the Academy Awards might {{have been due to}} the perceived anti-U.S. theme in it.|$|E
500|$|Series head {{writer of}} the first season Merriwether Williams said the episode's story is [...] "so simple." [...] She remarked [...] "To me, it's {{one of the best}} episodes.

[...] Williams said the episode was [...] "so small that you could explore gags and {{opportunities}} for gags." [...] The episode was an example of [...] "a good outline" [...] in the series where the storyboards and humor were done easily. Williams said [...] "it was great for the board guys." [...] She added [...] "In many ways, my job was to create situations where the board <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> be funny, to create a situation that could be funny, and let them go for the actual, specific jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|During the 2005–06 season, Laich {{played in}} 104 {{regular season and}} playoff games between the Capitals and their new AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears; this tied him for the most games played in the {{organization}} with Boyd Gordon. After training camp, he started the season in the AHL, but was optimistic about his chances {{to play in the}} NHL, saying, [...] "You've just got to work hard. There's spots up there, <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> go down with an injury, {{you want to be the}} first guy called up." [...] He spent most of the season at the NHL level, playing in 73 games and recording 21 points. After the Capitals' season was over, Laich rejoined the Bears for their playoff run and scored eight goals in 21 games while helping the team capture the Calder Cup. Laich played the entire 2006–07 season with the Capitals, scoring eight goals and adding ten assists. After the season, Laich and the Capitals went to salary arbitration, where he was awarded a one-year contract worth $725,000.|$|E
500|$|Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first {{adaptation}} {{outside of}} comic books {{took place in}} the third season of Batman (1967), Barbara Gordon having been discussed months earlier by her father and Batman in the second season episodes, [...] "Batman's Waterloo" [...] and [...] "The Duo Defy". Les Daniels, in Batman: The Complete History (2004) wrote that the goal of ABC was to [...] "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men." [...] According to Craig: [...] "I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice." [...] A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, [...] "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl {{through the use of a}} straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use." [...] However, Craig has also stated: [...] "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> do, and sometimes better. I think that’s lovely." [...] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women.|$|E

[...] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women. Since Batman, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in The Batman/Superman Hour (1968), Melendy Britt in The New Adventures of Batman (1977), Melissa Gilbert in [...] (1992), Tara Strong in The New Batman Adventures (1997) and Beware the Batman (2013), Danielle Judovits in The Batman (2004), Mae Whitman in [...] (2008) and Alyson Stoner in Young Justice (2011). The Batman series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode [...] "Artifacts" [...] (2007). She also appears in DC Super Hero Girls voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999's Batman Beyond, who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department.|$|E

2500|$|The image change {{seemed to}} pay dividends, because in 1973 the band got a record deal, and for Falsk, {{who was still}} the band's manager, it became much easier to book concert dates. By late 1975, the band had {{released}} three albums, but felt they weren't getting enough backing from their record company, and wanted to get fired from their contract. To achieve this, they decided to make an album containing the absolute worst music the <b>guys</b> <b>could</b> imagine, and Falsk was given the task of producing the record, only because he had absolutely no experience in the field. The album was named Endelig! (Uff, ikke nå igjen?) (translated: At Last! (Oh no, not again?)), was recorded in just four days, and featured JFRRB's take on protest songs, disco, football chants, Swedish dansband music, yodeling and every other genre that the band hated [...] and to everyone's surprise, the album became an overwhelming success, peaking at number 15 on the Norwegian national album chart, and was by far JFRRB's most successful album to date in terms of record sales.|$|E
