50|$|Media reports {{suggested}} that settlement of Jackson's estate could last many years. The value of Sony/ATV Music Publishing is estimated by Ryan Schinman, chief of Platinum Rye, to be US$1.5 billion. Shinman's estimate makes Jackson's share of Sony/ATV worth US$750 million, from which Jackson {{would have had}} an annual income of US$80 million. Sony Corporation has not commented on whether it intends to buy Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate. Jackson's creditors could force a <b>distressed</b> <b>sale,</b> which would act in Sony's favor since it would lower the sale price, {{but only if the}} trust set up by Jackson for his stake in Sony/ATV is revocable. A <b>distressed</b> <b>sale</b> would lower the value of Jackson's estate, and thus might not raise enough to cover the debts owed by the estate.|$|E

40|$|Farmers in the Nicaragua {{countryside}} face {{substantial risk}} due to legal uncertainty regarding property rights, price fluctuations and {{limited access to}} rural financial markets. Income shocks can lead to obligations to sell land, can fuel differentiation processes, and can drive people into poverty. We review empirical evidence on income shocks and related <b>distress</b> <b>sales</b> by households of different wealth endowments. From panel data of the 1995 and 2000 land market surveys, estimates are made to identify relevant farm household characteristics and the market forces that determine <b>distress</b> <b>sales.</b> Results show that small farms are most affected by idiosyncratic shocks and usually try to adopt a defensive strategy based on reduced consumption to retain their land resources. In the long run, this strategy occasionally succeeds in preserving land ownership and maintaining income at higher levels than those enjoyed by landless peasants. But the pressures towards <b>distress</b> <b>sales</b> can, nevertheless, be powerful, and different responses to income shocks by poor, middle and rich peasants are likely to increase rural differentiation...|$|R
50|$|In March 2010, Shnaider {{invested}} in a property consortium that bought Toronto's King Edward Hotel for $50 million.

50|$|However, Nutmeg {{once again}} lost {{out on the}} $200,000 {{purchase}} of WXLS, and the station was sold to Delta Communications Co. of Washington, D.C. in 1979. Delta was a minority owned company, making the station the state’s first minority owned FM station. The station was sold for $175,000 under the FCC’s <b>distressed</b> <b>sale</b> policy, allowing stations facing license renewal hearings to avoid losing their license by selling to minority owned companies at prices below market value. WXLS and co-owned WKND were facing allegations of fraudulent billing practices and staff mismanagement. Both stations were sold to separate minority-owned companies.|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} {{different}} measures may differ significantly - for example, one may purchase a stock for $1, {{and the market}} value may increase to $100, so the book value is $1 and the market value is $100. Conversely, one may purchase a house for $100,000, and then the housing market may fall, with the identical house next door selling for $80,000. In both these cases, book value and market value (to the extent {{that there is a}} market) differ, and which is more accurate may be debatable - one may argue that liquidation value (price obtained if sold immediately) would be a <b>distressed</b> <b>sale</b> and not reflect the potential value in a more orderly sale.|$|E

The article starts with the most often cited factor, namely the <b>distressed</b> <b>sale</b> argument, and then shifts the focus to determinants that have received far less attention: an unusual extension of the "distressed sale" argument and another, more important one, namely the legacy of the oversized industrial sector and resultant availability of firms ready (or forced) to test their mettle on the world markets. The following section extends the list of determinants to foreign direct investment and the growing export activity of domestic de novo firms.

50|$|First, {{the program}} sought to stimulate {{diversity}} with the Tax Certificate Policy. This policy worked by awarding like-kind tax exchange breaks to licensees who sell their licenses to minorities. This was a two-year like-kind exchange, whereby the seller {{would not be}} required to pay taxes on money made by selling their license, as long as the capital gains are reinvested into a similar communication industry within two years of the sale. In addition the second program implemented through this statement was the <b>Distress</b> <b>Sale</b> Policy, which held that any license owners facing scrutiny by the FCC and potential license revocation, can sell their station to a minority buyer for 75% of the appraised value. The benefit of the <b>Distress</b> <b>Sale</b> Policy for licensees under investigation by the FCC, is that once they sell their license to a minority owner, the FCC would reward them by ceasing their inquiry into the licensee. The statement would also formalize the Comparative Hearing Process.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Tax Certificate Policy and the <b>Distress</b> <b>Sale</b> Policy incentives for encouraging diversity, the 1978 Broadcast Policy Statement authorized the use of comparative credit or favorable consideration for minority applicants. These comparative hearings would award merit to applicants poised {{to contribute to the}} Commission's goal of broadening ownership inclusion, and their aim for a [...] "diversity of viewpoints". Earning this favorable consideration meant that the applicant would be an active participant in the facilities daily operations, and serve a practicable purpose to the community in terms of content and viewpoints. Eventually the <b>Distress</b> <b>Sale</b> Policy was overturned in 1987 by a 2-1 vote within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and later, the Tax Certificate Policy was repealed by congress in 1995 with perceived abuses being the reason. [...] In the 1990's the court would eliminate policies that awarded extra credit using race and gender as a basis for consideration. This period saw a movement away from policies concerning the use of gender or racial factors in comparative hearings and employment practices, and the 1996 Telecommunications Act eliminated the comparative hearing process for renewal of broadcast licensing entirely.|$|R
25|$|A {{secondary}} buyout {{is a form}} of {{leveraged buyout}} where both the buyer and the seller are private equity firms or financial sponsors (i.e., a leveraged buyout of a company that was acquired through a leveraged buyout). A secondary buyout will often provide a clean break for the selling private equity firms and its limited partner investors. Historically, given that secondary buyouts were perceived as <b>distressed</b> <b>sales</b> by both seller and buyer, limited partner investors considered them unattractive and largely avoided them.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} mortgage defaults in Southern California during the housing bubble of the 2000 s. The rapid {{decline in the}} housing market that precipitated the current recession has been accompanied by an unprecedented number of loan defaults and foreclosures. Recent studies have identified two major theories of default [...] the 2 ̆ 2 double trigger 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis, where negative equity and an income shock are necessary conditions for default [...] and 2 ̆ 2 strategic default 2 ̆ 2 where negative equity is a sufficient condition for default. This paper adds to the default literature by adding short sale as another possible outcome of mortgage default. The primary goal is to analyze the determinants of mortgage default to assist in understanding the conditions under which strategic behavior of home sales is most likely to occur. Data from Los Angeles County was analyzed from 2007 to 2010 for every closed sale, then coded into three possible sales outcomes: 1) Organic 2) Short Sale 3) Real Estate Owned (REO). A multinomial probit model was used to model homeowner decision-making based on the sale outcome. The model rejected the 2 ̆ 2 double trigger 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis, as it was found that income shocks do no {{have a significant effect on}} impacting the predicted probability for <b>distressed</b> <b>sales.</b> Education levels, the sales price of homes, credit card debt, and market price reductions were found to be significant variables in determining <b>distressed</b> <b>sales</b> outcomes, thereby confirming the strategic default hypothesis. The next section studied spatial association of short sales and REO to see if any contagion effects were present. It was found that both short sales and REO form into clusters of hot and cold spots. Social stigma is believed to impact consumer behavior, the theory was confirmed through the findings of contagion and spatial lag. The final section constructed a hedonic price model to capture the price effects that <b>distressed</b> <b>sales</b> have on neighborhood pricing. Foreclosures were found to have three times the negative impact on neighborhood pricing compared to short sales...|$|R

Rich farmers, or those with surplus grain production, could donate a quintal to the bank.

40|$|We {{present a}} stylized {{model of the}} {{over-the-counter}} markets {{in the tradition of}} Duffie Gârleanu and Pedersen (2005) with two distinctive features: (i) buyers have heterogenous preferences and their willingness to pay is private information and (ii) sellers become financially distressed if they cannot sell for too long. A unique steady-state equilibrium exists and it is characterized by predatory buying. Specifically, during periods where sellers are more likely to become distressed (e. g. during economic crises, financial turmoils etc.) buyers become more selective and hold off purchasing despite the abundance of <b>distressed</b> <b>sales</b> and low prices.
