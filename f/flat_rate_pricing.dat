While this option is also available to end-users, they do not always {{take advantage of this}} option. One reason may be that it is common to pay on a per-VM-basis, whereas the telecommunications sector has shown that customers prefer <b>flat</b> <b>rates.</b> A <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> for cloud services needs to define utilization thresholds, to cap the usage of heavy customers and thereby limit their impact on the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>price</b> and the cloud performance. Unfortunately, customers consume multiple heterogenous resources in clouds, e. g., CPU, RAM, disk I/O and space, or network access. This makes the definition of a customer’s fair “cloud share” and according utilization thresholds complex. Backed by a questionnaire among more than 600 individuals, this paper designs the new Greediness Metric (GM) that formalizes an intuitive understanding of multi-resource fairness without access to consumers’ utility functions. This GM enables the introduction of attractive cloud <b>flat</b> <b>rates</b> and fair sharing policies for private/commodity clouds and provides incentive to customers to wisely determine VM configurations...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Time-of-use {{electricity}} pricing is characterised by high 'peak' prices, generally {{throughout the day}} and evening, and low 'off-peak' prices, generally at night. Consumers can benefit from time-of-use pricing provided their ratio of peakto- off-peak electricity consumption {{is less than a}} ratio of the relative prices of the two tariffs. To alter their consumption ratio, consumers can time-shift their demand, known as demand response. Consumers with grid-connected PV systems, however, already have reduced net demand during the day-time peak, due to the PV generation. The first question of interest to this paper is whether consumers with PV systems would benefit financially from switching to timeof- use pricing even if they do not engage in demand response. There remains the concern, however, of high prices during the evening peak, when the PV is not generating. Consumers unwilling or unable to engage in demand response during these periods can install battery storage systems, which are charged during the day and discharged during the evening. Two additional questions are therefore: what is the additional financial benefit of battery storage to PV systems with time-ofuse pricing and are batteries financially viable for domestic consumers with PV? These questions are answered using data from real dwellings with PV in the UK and simulating power flows using a published lead-acid battery model. Economic impacts are measured for a range of time-of-use pricing tariffs from the UK and Ireland. Results indicate that PV has little effect on the financial benefit of time-of-use pricing with day period prices that are similar to the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>price.</b> For tariffs where the day period price is greater than the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>price,</b> PV improves the benefit, but not enough to make it an economic choice for the average consumer. Battery storage improves the financial return, but this is not enough to make the business case positive. Even using optimistic assumptions, such as lossless batteries and high electricity price increase, system costs need to be lowered by at least 33. 5...|$|R

There were greater differences between the TRNSYS and HOT 2000 simulations most likely due to the lack of possible inputs that HOT 2000 requires.

The objective of the proposed model is to maximize the surplus of a consumer that is equipped with wind power and storage devices.

Bidirectional communication between the consumer and the supplier allows for interval price updates, so the consumer can flexibly adjust hourly demand.

40|$|With the {{transition}} from a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> dominated <b>pricing</b> regime towards volume-based tariffs, bandwidth is often bundled with specific allowances or overuse-charges for data consumption. One central element in many new telecommunications tariffs is the implementation of data caps, which are a common tool to address several challenges telecommunications providers face in today’s markets. In this context the recent introduction of so-called “managed services”, or “all-you-can-app ” offers draws the attention of regulators. The term “managed service ” is coined by operators to describe online-services that have a special agreement with the network operator. These service providers agree to revenue-sharing agreements and in turn their customers are alleviated from counting the data traffic they cause against their monthly quota. In this paper we develop a framework that incorporates the different forms of volume-based Internet tariffs in the market. Furthermore, w...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the stated literature, we derive a consumer surplus model with the intention to explain the theoretically optimal tariff choice. Within this model, tariff choice relies on the preferences of a representative consumer, and not on an exogenous demand or observed choice. This modeling approach has the distinct advantage that the demand for tariff usage is derived endogenously and depends also on the chosen tariff and the pricing structure. In other words, given the same preferences, a consumer will exert a different consumption pattern under a cost cap tariff than under a pay-per-use or <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> plan, because <b>prices</b> are different. This endogenous change in demand {{should be taken into}} account when choosing a tariff.|$|R

Regional companies such as Med Health Services Inc. in the Pittsburgh area and Northwest Radiology Network of Indianapolis have been among the first in the nation to implement the practice on a trial basis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Flat</b> – <b>rated</b> {{internet}} <b>pricing</b> {{is increasingly}} becoming {{the most common}} mode of dial - up access nowadays. However, the debate about whether ISP bound telephone calls should also be unmetered is still open. On the one side, consumers and ISPs complain about {{the high costs of}} telephone calls and demand unlimited local calling for a fixed monthly fee as in the U. S (or now in some European countries). On the other side, incumbent LECs complain about the investment they have to make to keep pace with ever increasing traffic and congestion without due compensation. The problem lies in the fact that, as it is always the case, both sides are probably right. This paper addresses an important issue on dial up internet access and pricing: The ISP’s model of interconnection with the incumbent LEC and its implications on market prices and welfare. To that end and assuming <b>flat</b> – <b>rated</b> internet <b>pricing,</b> several interconnection models are studied. Among the metered models, the termination and origination models (the “benchmark” metered models), the free internet model and the 0610 model in Argentina. Among the unmetered models: The standard CLEC – terminating American model, the FCC’s newly proposed C. O. B. A. K model and the British F. R. I. A. C. O model. All arrangements are confronted with each other in terms of equilibrium ISP prices, welfare and consumer and producer surpluses generated. Within that framework the paper tries then to answer the question of whether and under what conditions unmetered telephone calling in addition to <b>flat</b> <b>rated</b> internet use is welfare enhancing. Conclusions and policy recommendations are drawn from the theory and some practical cases. Internet Access, ISP interconnection, access cost...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{irrigated}} {{agricultural regions}} in Europe are supplied by surface irrigation networks managed by local water authorities (WAs). Under such conditions, WAs {{are not able}} to fully monitor water usage and farmers have an information advantage vis-a-vis the WA. This results in the water authority suffering ‘pricing failure’ if it decides to apply an incentive pricing strategy (tariffs proportional to the alleged water uses). Indeed, farmers could exploit their information advantage by behaving in an opportunistic manner, withdrawing more water than declared, and ultimately paying less than they should. This situation could also undermine the efficacy and the efficiency of the WA incentive pricing strategies. This paper analyses incentive water pricing schemes under asymmetric information by the means of a Principal-Agent model. The Agency problem between the WA and farmers is addressed by introducing a monitoring strategy that would enable the WA to detect farms action. In doing so, we compare incentive strategies with <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> water <b>pricing</b> and investigate under what conditions the WA might provide/not provide incentive water pricing in the absence of water metering...|$|R

The main idea is very clear, the user will generate less traffic when the session price goes up.As a result, the pricing method will change the user behavior and the traffic as in electricity tariffs and smart-grid applicationsand even better than there, because of the immediate feedback and latency in the order of seconds,which allows for best response and training.|$|E

Under typical practices occurring in rice production operations in the Texas Rice Belt, sprinkler irrigation technology is not profitable at current water costs.

Yield reductions associated with sprinkle-irrigated rice are a significant disincentive. For equivalent flood and sprinkle-irrigated rice yields, an increase in water prices of over 175 percent is required before the investment in a sprinkler irrigation system becomes economically feasible.

40|$|One of {{the major}} areas for {{research}} and investment related to the Internet is the provision of quality of service (QoS). In this paper, study the equilibrium outcomes when two Internet Access Providers (IAPs) interact. These IAPs {{are assumed to be}} rural dialup providers (as data shows that duopolies often exist in such markets), using empirically based demand functions. To determine the equilibria, we construct duopoly game model and solve it by simulation and computational methods. For the demand function, we use data from the U. S. General Accounting Office (GAO) survey for Internet usage. In our game model, each IAP has three factors it can control: pricing strategy, investment level, and technology choice (best effort (BE) or QoS). We study the case in which one IAP chooses <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> QoS <b>pricing</b> and the other chooses a two-part tariff, and both IAPs choose the investment level to maximize their profitability. Investment level is equivalent to the maximum number of users they can support. Finally, they can determine their product mix (BE vs QoS), depending on their capacity level and pricing scheme for optimal profits. Based on the results of the model, we conclude that QoS-IAP with the two-part tariff has a better market position in the future QoS Internet. The two-part tariff is constructed such that the flat portion of the tariff (the access rate) is for BE service, and the variable portion (usage rate) is for QoS. Thus, the IAP using a two-part tariff is able to differentiate BE and QoS users, which is essentially a form of price discrimination...|$|R
