25|$|The Maginot-era {{improvements}} to Sarts comprise two combat blocks. The ouvrage was built {{within the walls}} of the old Fort des Sarts. An underground gallery connects the two blocks. A second phase was planned to provide two artillery blocks armed with one 75mm twin gun turret each, as well as an <b>entry</b> <b>block</b> outside the walls of the old fort.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} post at Pic-de-Garuche , while closer to Ouvrage Castillon to the north, reported to Saint-Agnès. The post comprised an <b>entry</b> <b>block</b> and an observation block {{with a unique}} example of a VP cloche. The design was by CORF, the primary Maginot design organization, but construction was managed by MOM (Main d’Œuvre Militaire), which carried out the construction {{of many of the}} lesser posts.|$|E
500|$|A {{separate}} <b>entry</b> <b>block</b> was planned, {{adjacent to}} the Villy Est casemate. The underground gallery system at La Ferté is simple, limited to a gallery linking the two blocks, which were initially designed to function as separate units with separate generating plants and ventilation facilities in each block. The [...] gallery contained some shared facilities, such as a kitchen, a laundry and an infirmary, at an average depth of [...] below the surface. The gallery's small size made it most useful as a link, rather than as the garrison, magazine, command post and long-term shelter afforded by the gallery systems of most Maginot ouvrages. Unlike most ouvrages, La Ferté's living spaces were near the surface in the two combat blocks. A more typical Maginot position would have such spaces under [...] of earth or rock cover. Unlike many Maginot positions, the main drain at La Ferté was not configured as an emergency exit. The mixed-arms turret used on Block 2 {{was known to be}} mechanically trouble-prone, and La Ferté's turret particularly so.|$|E
