25|$|In the Second Test Ray Illingworth {{was put in}} to bat, but Rowan refused {{his request}} for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later {{realised}} his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. Even John Snow applauded when he and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a very reasonable and fair man, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not agree with him' {{and that they could}} talk problems through. Brooks {{was the only one of}} the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.|$|E
500|$|English fantasy author Neil Gaiman guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, helping Homer and the others write the book. He {{recorded}} his lines in January 2011 in Los Angeles, California {{under the direction of}} Selman. Gaiman has said that when he first agreed to guest star, he assumed he would only be getting a brief appearance, popping up for a few seconds. He told the press that [...] "when they actually sent me the script and I started to read it and discovered that I was in it all the way through and was actually having to act and that stuff happened, it was enormously fun." [...] Gaiman also noted that he does not think the episode gives an entirely accurate portrayal of him, commenting: [...] "Truthfully, the real-life me almost never hangs around in Barnes & Noble-like bookstores waiting to find groups of local townsfolk who've decided to write pseudonymous young adult fantasy series, offering my services. And <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I probably wouldn't be doing the catering." [...] On his official Tumblr page, Gaiman noted that while he did not have much input on the story, he got to improvise while recording and gave suggestions on how to make his dialogue sound as close to something he might actually say in real life.|$|E
2500|$|In Hynek and Vallee's 1975 book The Edge of Reality, Hynek {{published}} a stereoscopic {{photograph of a}} UFO he took during a flight. According to the book, the object stayed in sight long enough for Hynek to unpack his camera from his luggage and take two exposures. UFO researcher Robert Sheaffer writes in his book Psychic Vibrations that Hynek seemed to have forgotten the photographs when he later told a reporter for The Globe and Mail {{that he had never}} seen a UFO. The article states that in all the years he had been looking upward, Hynek [...] "has never seen 'what I would so dearly love to see. Oh, the subject has been so ridiculed that I would never report a UFO <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> see one—not without a witness'".|$|E

2500|$|The {{promoter}} became violently {{angry and}} [...] "sailed into us, barehanded", threatening {{to stop the}} fight. Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey's small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, [...] "I might kill that skinny guy." [...] The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as [...] "Jack Dempsey", the future champion downed Copelin six times {{in the first round}} and twice in the second. From there, it was a battle of attrition ("Neither Bernie nor I had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek."), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh, moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. Dempsey: [...] "In those days they didn't stop mining-town fights as long as one guy could move." [...] This trial by fire carried with it a $100.00 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, [...] "...and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I wouldn't give you anything." ...|$|E
