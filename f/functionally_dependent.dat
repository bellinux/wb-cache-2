40|$|This {{paper is}} the {{conclusion}} of a series that lays the groundwork for a structure and classification theory of second-order superintegrable systems, both classical and quantum, in conformally flat spaces. For two-dimensional and for conformally flat three-dimensional spaces with nondegenerate potentials we have worked out the structure of the classical systems and shown that the quadratic algebra always closes at order 6. Here we describe the quantum analogs of these results. We show that, for nondegenerate potentials, each classical system has a unique quantum extension. We also correct an error in an earlier paper in the series (that does not alter the structure results) and we elucidate the distinction between superintegrable systems with bases of functionally linearly independent and <b>functionally</b> linearly <b>dependent</b> symmetries...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the extrageniculo-striate visual mechanisms. Although the {{definition}} of a “visual area” is not always clear, it is supposed that each of them represents specific aspects of visual stimuli. The anatomical connectivity and location of the various areas suggests a grouping of these distributed visual field representations into various visual subsystems. Thus, according to their different afferent organization, two visual systems, a retino-geniculo-striate and a retino-collicularextrastriate visual system were distinguished. These two schemes also stand for two alternative mechanisms of information flow in the cortex, the first one for the model of parallel representation and the second for sequential processing. In primates and especially in man the chapter assumes that the extrastriate visual cortex is <b>functionally</b> more <b>dependent</b> on the striate cortex in that neurons in the prelunate and inferotemporal cortex are reported to become visually inexcitable after ablation or cooling of the striate cortex and in that area 17 lesions in monkey and man appear to be more devastating to visual behavior than in lower mammals...|$|R

To help the many elderly housebound people without primary medical care we initiated a medical services home care program. The goals were patient identification, clinical assessment, medical and social stabilization, matching of the housebound patient with a nearby family physician willing and able to provide home care and provision of a backup service to the physician for consultation and help in arranging admission to hospital if necessary. In the program's first 2 years 105 patients were enrolled; the average age was 78. 9 years. More than 50 % were widowed, single, separated or divorced, over 25 % lived alone, and more than 40 % had no children living in the city. In almost one-third of the cases there had never been a primary care physician, and in another third the physician refused to do home visits.

One-third of the patients or their families said that it was not easy to reach the physician when necessary.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) radio {{emission}} from a compilation of hard X-ray-selected samples, all observed in the 1. 4 GHz band. A {{total of more than}} 1600 AGNs with 2 - 10 keV de-absorbed luminosities higher than 10 (42) erg s(- 1) cm(- 2) were used. For a sub-sample of about fifty z less than or similar to 0. 1 AGNs, it was possible to reach similar to 80 % of radio detections and therefore, for the first time, it was possible to almost completely measure the probability distribution function of the ratio between the radio and the X-ray luminosity R(X) = log(L(1. 4) /L(X)), where L(1. 4) /L(X) = nu L(nu) (1. 4 GHz) /L(X) (2 - 10 keV). The probability distribution function of R(X) was <b>functionally</b> fitted as <b>dependent</b> on the X-ray luminosity and redshift, P(R(X) vertical bar L(X), z). It roughly spans over six decades (- 7 10 (22) cm(- 2)) and un-absorbed AGNs. Measurement of the probability distribution function of R(X) allowed us to compute the kinetic luminosity function and the kinetic energy density which, at variance with that assumed in many galaxy evolution models, is observed to decrease by about a factor of 5 at redshift below 0. 5. About half of the kinetic energy density results in being produced by the more radio quiet (R(X) < - 4) AGNs. In agreement with previous estimates, the AGN efficiency epsilon(kin) in converting the accreted mass energy into kinetic power (L(K) = epsilon(kin) (m) over dot c(2)) is, on average, epsilon(kin) similar or equal to 5 x 10 (- 3).

Kuusela, Nature (London) 276 : 718 - 720, 1978), an interaction that may be important in bacterial attachment and opsonization. Recently some strains of streptococci of serological groups A, C, and G were also found to bind fibronectin. The binding to one selected strain of Streptococcus pyogenes has been characterized here. The binding of [125 I]fibronectin to streptococcal cells resembles that to staphylococcal cells and was found to be time <b>dependent,</b> <b>functionally</b> irreversible, and specific in the sense that unlabeled proteins other than fibronectin did not block binding. Bacteria incubated with proteases largely lost their ability to bind fibronectin, and material released from the streptococci by a brief trypsin digestion contained active fibronectin receptors. This material inhibited the binding of [125 I]fibronectin to the streptococci. The inhibitory activity was adsorbed on a column of fibronectin-Sepharose but not on a column of unsubstituted Sepharose 4 B or egg albumin Sepharose. The receptor appeared to be a protein nature since the inhibitory activity of the trypsinate was destroyed by papain and was not absorbed on a column containing monoclonal antibodies directed against lipoteichoic acid bound to protein A-Sepharose. Binding sites in fibronectin for streptococci and staphylococci, respectively, were localized by analyzing the ability of isolated fragments to inhibit [125 I]fibronectin binding to bacteria and by adsorbing 125 I-labeled tryptic fragments with staphylococcal and streptococcal cells. Both species of bacteria appeared to preferentially bind a fragment (Mr = approximately 25, 000) originating from the N-terminal region of the protein. In addition, streptococci also bound a slightly smaller fragment (Mr = approximately 23, 000). Fibronectin receptors solubilized from either streptococci or staphylococci inhibited the binding of fibronectin to both species of bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Phylogenetic tree {{reconstruction}} {{for a set}} {{of species}} is an important problem for understanding the evolutionary history of the species. Existing algorithms usually represent each species as a binary string with each bit indicating whether a particular gene/protein exists in the species. Given the topology of a phylogenetic tree with each leaf representing a species (a binary string of equal length) and each internal node representing the hypothetical ancestor, the Fitch-Hartigan algorithm and the Sankoff algorithm are two polynomial-time algorithms which assign binary strings to internal nodes such that the total Hamming distance between adjacent nodes in the tree is minimized. However, these algorithms oversimplify the evolutionary process by considering only the number of protein insertions/deletions (Hamming distance) between two species and by assuming the evolutionary history of each protein is independent.
