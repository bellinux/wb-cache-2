5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about Raynald's life while he was kept in jail for fifteen years. He shared his prison with Joscelin <b>III</b> <b>of</b> Courtenay, who had been {{captured}} {{a couple of months}} before. In Raynald's absence, Constance wanted to rule alone, but BaldwinIII of Jerusalem made Patriarch Aimery regent for her fifteen-year-old son (Raynald's stepson), Bohemond <b>III</b> <b>of</b> Antioch. Constance died around 1163, shortly after her son reached the age of majority. Her death deprived Raynald of his claim to Antioch. However, he had become an important personality, with prominent family connections. His stepdaughter, Maria of Antioch, married ManuelI Komnenos in 1161. Raynald's own daughter, Agnes, became the wife of Béla <b>III</b> <b>of</b> Hungary.|$|E
