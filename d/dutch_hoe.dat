5000|$|The {{etymology}} for hood is [...] "covering," [...] Old English hod [...] "hood," [...] from Proto-Germanic *hodaz (cf. Old Saxon, Old Frisian hod [...] "hood," [...] Middle <b>Dutch</b> hoet, <b>Dutch</b> <b>hoed</b> [...] "hat," [...] Old High German huot [...] "helmet, hat," [...] German Hut [...] "hat," [...] Old Frisian hode [...] "guard, protection"), from PIE *kadh- [...] "cover" [...] (see hat)." [...] The modern spelling {{is early}} 15th century {{to indicate a}} [...] "long" [...] vowel, which is no longer pronounced as such. Meaning [...] "removable cover for an automobile engine" [...] attested by 1905. Little Red Riding Hood (1729) translates Charles Perrault's Petit Chaperon Rouge ("Contes du Temps Passé" [...] 1697)." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dutch writer Geert Mak used Jorwert as {{the hook}} for his book Jorwerd: The Death of the Village in late 20th century Europe (...) - though the <b>Dutch</b> title <b>Hoe</b> God verdween uit Jorwerd {{translates}} as How God disappeared from Jorwerd. Mak describes {{the changes that have}} affected the village over the last century, and writes eloquently about the people and their experiences.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Dutch</b> <b>hoe</b> is {{designed}} to be pushed or pulled through the soil to cut the roots of weeds just under the surface. A <b>Dutch</b> <b>hoe</b> has a blade [...] "sharp on every side so as to cut either forwards and backwards". The blade must be set in a plane slightly upwardly inclined in relation to the dual axis of the shaft. The user pushes the handle to move the blade forward, forcing it {{below the surface of the}} soil and maintaining it at a shallow depth by altering the angle of the handle while pushing. A scuffle hoe can easily cultivate soil and remove weeds from the surface layer.|$|E
50|$|A scuffle hoe is used {{to scrape}} {{the surface of the}} soil, loosen the top inch or so, and to cut the roots of, remove, and disrupt the growth of weeds efficiently. These are {{primarily}} of two different designs: the <b>Dutch</b> <b>hoe</b> and the hoop hoe.|$|E
5000|$|In how (Old English hū, from Proto-Germanic χwō), the w {{merged into}} the lave of the word, {{as it did}} in Old Frisian hū, hō (<b>Dutch</b> <b>hoe</b> [...] "how"), but it can still be seen in Old Saxon hwō, Old High German hwuo (German wie [...] "how"). In English, the gradual change of voiceless stops into voiceless fricatives (phase 1 of Grimm's law) during the {{development}} of Germanic languages is responsible for [...] "wh-" [...] of interrogatives. Although some varieties of American English and various Scottish dialects still preserve the original sound (i.e. ʍ rather than w), most have only the w.|$|E

5000|$|While the Afrikaans verb heet {{can be used}} to mean [...] "to be called", {{like the}} Dutch heten, it is less {{commonly}} used for that purpose, hence [...] "what is your name?" [...] and [...] "my name is John" [...] would be wat is jou naam? and my naam is John, rather than hoe heet jy? ("how are you called?") and ek heet John. By contrast, <b>Dutch</b> would use <b>hoe</b> heet je? and ik heet John.|$|R
