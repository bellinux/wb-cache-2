30|$|The article {{presents}} {{a survey of}} Russian researchers’ synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility as {{an element of the}} global system of scientific labor market. Synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility is a simultaneous holding of scientific positions in institutions located in different countries. The study explores bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection and socio-economic indicators for 56 countries. In order to examine <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility, we use a method of affiliations. The paper introduces a model of synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility. It enables to specify country’s involvement in the <b>international</b> division of <b>scientific</b> labor. Synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility is a modern form of the international division of labor in science. It encompasses various forms of part-time, temporary and remote employment of scientists. The analysis reveals the distribution of Russian authors in the space of affiliations, and directions of upward/downward <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility. The bibliometric characteristics of mobile authors are isomorphic to those of receiver country authors. Synchronous <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> mobility of Russian authors is determined by differences in scientific impacts between receiver and donor countries.|$|R
