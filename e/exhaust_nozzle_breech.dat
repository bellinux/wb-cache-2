40|$|The {{proposed}} adaptive <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{features an}} innovative {{use of the}} shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators for actively control of the opening area of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> for jet engines. The SMA actuators remotely control the opening area of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{through a set of}} mechanism. An important advantage of using SMA actuators is the reduction of weight of the actuator system for variable area <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Another advantage is that the SMA actuator can be activated using the heat from the exhaust and eliminate the need of other energy source. A prototype has been designed and fabricated. The functionality of the proposed SMA actuated adaptive <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> is verified in the open-loop tests...|$|R

40|$|The HSCT <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> must manage high {{temperature}} exhaust gases and pressure gradients while meeting HSCT economic and noise goals. The important features and requirements for an HSCT <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> are shown for a 2 DCD (two-dimensional convergent-divergent) design. The same requirements {{would apply to}} an axisymmetric design. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> weight has an adverse effect on the overall aircraft range, payload, and engine specific fuel consumption and is therefore the primary driver for advanced <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> materials. Because of the large airflow and pressure gradients, <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles</b> are extremely large and heavy when made from current materials. The use of advanced materials with higher specific strength will reduce the weight of <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> components. In addition to the flow of high-temperature exhaust gases into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle,</b> ambient air is entrained to reduce gas exit velocities and suppress sound. This leads to components exposed to extremely {{high temperature}} gradients and, hence, high thermal stresses. Further, exhaust gases are highly oxidizing; material environmental resistance {{will be an important}} factor for long life. Several viable concepts have been identified to reduce noise through the mixture of exhaust and ambient air. Sound can be further suppressed by acoustic panels that absorb high-frequency noise...|$|R

Improvements from 4. 5 to 17 percent in over-all engine specific fuel consumption over conventional engines and from 2 to 8. 5 percent over engines equipped with only adjustable-area <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles</b> were obtained at 60 -percent rated power with adjustable-stator turbines and variable-area <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The improvements depend on design parameters...|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} new fan <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> technologies was performed. Three new uniform chevron nozzles were designed, based on extensive CFD analysis. Two new azimuthally varying variants were defined. All five were tested, {{along with two}} existing nozzles, on a representative model-scale, medium BPR <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Substantial acoustic benefits {{were obtained from the}} uniform chevron nozzle designs, the best benefit being provided by an existing design. However, one of the azimuthally varying nozzle designs exhibited even better performance than any of the uniform chevron nozzles. In addition to the fan chevron nozzles, a new technology was demonstrated, using devices that enhance mixing when applied to an <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The acoustic benefits from these devices applied to medium BPR nozzles were similar, and in some cases superior to, those obtained from conventional uniform chevron nozzles. However, none of the low noise technologies provided equivalent acoustic benefits on a model-scale high BPR <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle,</b> similar to current large commercial applications.

Free-stream Mach number was varied from 0. 6 to 1. 2, and model angle of attack from 0 deg to 9 deg. The jet exhaust affected drag more than it affected lift and pitching moment. The largest effects occurred at a Mach number of 0. 9 and for the afterburning mode of <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> operation. The combined differences between the aerodynamic characteristics of the realistic and reference configurations (which were due to afterbody and nozzle contours, jet operation, and simulated reference support interference) were considerably different from those for the jet interference alone...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} hydromechanical {{control modes}} for TF 30 -P- 3 engine were implemented on a digital process control computer. Programming methods are described, and a method {{is presented to}} solve stability problems associated with fast response dynamic loops contained within the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> control. A modification of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> control to provide for either velocity or position servoactuation systems is discussed. Transient response of the digital control was evaluated by tests on a real time hybrid simulation of the TF 30 -P- 3 engine. It is shown that the deadtime produced by the calculation time delay between sampling and final output is more significant to transient response than the effects associated with sampling rate alone. For the main fuel control, extended update and calculation times resulted in a lengthened transient response to throttle bursts from idle to intermediate {{with an increase in}} high pressure compressor stall margin. Extremely long update intervals of 250 msec could be achieved without instability. Update extension for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> control resulted in a delayed response of the afterburner light-off detector and <b>exhaust</b> <b>nozzle</b> overshoot with resulting fan oversuppression. Long update times of 150 msec caused failure of the control due to a false indication by the blowout detector...|$|R
