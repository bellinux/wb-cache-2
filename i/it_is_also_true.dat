It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds, went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{visit to}} the Peloponnese in 1862 a new coup was {{launched}} and this time a Provisional Government was set up and summoned a National Convention. Ambassadors of the Great Powers urged King Otto not to resist, and the king and queen took refuge on a British warship and returned to Bavaria aboard (the same way they had come to Greece) taking with them the Greek royal regalia which they had brought from Bavaria in 1832. It has been suggested that had Otto and Amalia borne an heir, then the King would not have been overthrown, as succession was also a major unresolved question at the time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true,</b> however, that the Constitution of 1843 made provision for his succession by his two younger brothers and their descendants.|$|E

5|$|The A4 {{motorway}} is {{a significant}} northsouth motorway in the northern Croatia connecting the nation's capital, Zagreb, to the Hungarian M7 motorway at the Goričan border crossing The southern terminus of the A4 motorway at the interchange in Ivanja Reka represents its junction {{with the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network via the A3 motorway. As a part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is a part of European route E65 and European route E71. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of the development of its economy, notably tourism, as it represents the shortest and the most comfortable route between Budapest, Hungary and the Adriatic Sea. This particularly applies to tourist resorts on the Istria and Kvarner Gulf islands and to the Port of Rijeka, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> for resorts in the Dalmatia region, served via the A1 motorway. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of the proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node. This expansion is planned to encompass the growth of the Port of Rijeka's cargo handling capacity, improved railroad links and a new Rijeka bypass motorway linking the A6, via a new interchange, to the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways. The project is, among other goals, aimed to increase traffic along the Croatian part of Pan-European corridor Vb, of which the A4 motorway is a part.|$|E

30|$|Nonetheless, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that funding matters. In a 14 -state comparison, more generous subsidy policies (that is, greater investment and higher income thresholds) were associated with higher quality of care in nonprofit centers, but not in forprofit centers, perhaps because the latter had few subsidized children. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that states with more stringent ratios had fewer subsidized children in center care (Rigby et al., 2007).|$|R
25|$|However, not all {{restoration}} {{work was}} purely negative: {{a side effect}} of a number of restorations was the rediscovery of long-lost features, for instance Anglo-Saxon carving that had been incorporated into Norman foundations, or wall-paintings that had been whitewashed over, at St Albans Cathedral. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> to say that had they not been restored many churches would have fallen into disrepair.|$|E

25|$|Metric {{spaces are}} paracompact Hausdorff spaces and hence normal (indeed they are {{perfectly}} normal).

25|$|It is true, as {{the critics}} suggest, that the {{readings}} forego overt emotion, but what emerges instead {{is a solid}} sense of structure, letting the music speak convincingly for itself. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that Strauss's tempos are generally swift, but this, too, contributes to the structural cohesion and in any event is fully in keeping with our modern outlook in which speed is a virtue and attention spans are defined more by MTV clips and news sound bites than by evenings at the opera and thousand page novels.|$|E
25|$|Though Cavaignac, Pinet and Pierre-Arnaud Dartigoeyte {{were soon}} replaced, the new representatives such as Pierre-Anselm Garrau {{also tended to}} meddle in {{military}} decisions.

The army {{was supposed to be}} reinforced from the Vendée by 15,000 troops but only 3,000 foot soldiers and 500 horsemen arrived in mid-September. For the fall 1794 offensive, Moncey's army numbered 52,000 troops in 64 battalions and four cavalry regiments. During the winter, an epidemic killed 3,000 soldiers and many inhabitants in the occupied areas of Spain.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is true}} that in most {{patients}} ophthalmopathy, goiter, and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis appear more or less coincidentally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that in certain cases eye signs may appear long before thyrotoxicosis is evident, or become worse when the thyrotoxicosis is subsiding or has been controlled by treatment. In approximately 20% of ophthalmopathy patients, ophthalmopathy appears before the onset of hyperthyroidism, in about 40% concurrently, and in about 20% in the six months after diagnosis. In the remainder, the eye disease first becomes apparent after treatment of the hyperthyroidism, more often in patients treated with radioiodine.|$|E

25|$|The best {{available}} {{estimate of the}} number of persons in Turkey speaking the Kurdish language is about five million (1980). About 3,950,000 others speak Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji) (1980). While population increase suggests that the number of speakers has grown, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that the ban {{on the use of the}} language in Turkey was only lifted in 1991 and still exists in most official settings (including schools), and that many fewer ethnic Kurds live in the countryside where the language has traditionally been used. The number of speakers is clearly less than the 15 million or so persons who identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.|$|E
25|$|From the gene's {{point of}} view, {{evolutionary}} success ultimately depends on {{leaving behind the}} maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave {{the maximum number of}} viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reports were}} that the team's colours would be changed to red and white, but the Leafs were wearing white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927. On September 27, 1927, it was {{announced}} that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white, which they have worn ever since. While the Leafs say that blue represents the Canadian skies and white represents snow, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that top-level Toronto teams have worn blue since the Toronto Argonauts adopted blue as their primary colour in 1873. Another theory is that Smythe changed the colours as a nod to his high school alma mater, Upper Canada College, whose teams have worn blue and white since 1829 and the University of Toronto whose teams have also worn blue and were called the Varsity Blues.|$|E
