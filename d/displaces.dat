Argon is denser than air and <b>displaces</b> oxygen close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.|$|E

5|$|Large and {{predominantly}} white, {{the king}} vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail feathers. The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also <b>displaces</b> smaller New World vulture species from a carcass.

5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice <b>displaces</b> only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{document}} the post-displacement employment patterns observed between 1979 and 2004 for <b>displaced</b> workers aged 50 to 54. We uncover four key patterns. First, we detect no upward {{trend in the}} re-employment rates of male <b>displaced</b> workers in the aggregate, in manufacturing or outside manufacturing. Second, we show that re-employment rates of <b>displaced</b> women generally increased over time. Third, we find substantial evidence that median and average earnings losses of males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing in recent years (i. e. between 2000 and 2004) were {{higher than those of}} comparable cohorts <b>displaced</b> during the 1980 s. Part of this increase is related to the lower re-employment rates observed in recent years for males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing. These lower re-employment rates suggest that, following displacement, aggregate working hours likely fell for males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing. Finally, we show that median and average earnings losses of women <b>displaced</b> from non-manufacturing firms fell over time. Layoffs, Job security, Job loss, Job stability, Labour turnover...|$|R
5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it <b>displaces</b> {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} {{in western}} jackdaw flocks {{is determined by}} supplanting, fighting, and threat displays—several {{of which have been}} described. In the bill-up posture, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A bill-down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the forward-threat posture, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the defensive-threat posture, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. Supplanting is where one bird moves in and <b>displaces</b> another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.|$|E
5|$|Although it locates food by vision, {{the role}} smell has {{in how it}} {{specifically}} finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been {{that it does not}} detect odours, and instead follows the smaller turkey and greater yellow-headed vultures, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass, but a 1991 study demonstrated that the king vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense. The king vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the king vulture <b>displaces</b> the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it is at the same kill as the larger Andean condor, the king vulture always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the king vulture has fed. The vulture’s tongue is rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass’s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The king vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the moriche palm when carrion is scarce in Bolívar state, Venezuela.|$|E

40|$|People often <b>displace</b> their {{aggression}} against innocent targets. Notwithstanding {{the merits of}} previous research on <b>displaced</b> aggression, critical gaps remain. First, {{it is unclear whether}} and how situational and dispositional factors interact to influence <b>displaced</b> aggression. Moreover, it is unclear whether engaging in direct aggression increases or decreases <b>displaced</b> aggression. To address these gaps, the present experiment investigated how situational factors (provocateur availability, provocation intensity) and dispositional factors (callousness, trait aggressiveness) jointly influence <b>displaced</b> and direct aggression in male adolescents. Participants (N = 175, Mage = 13. 1 years) completed a personal profile that was allegedly evaluated by peer judges. After randomly receiving mild or strong negative feedback, participants could aggress against these peer judges as well as against other innocent peers (direct and <b>displaced</b> aggression) or against innocent peers only (<b>displaced</b> aggression). Results showed that <b>displaced</b> aggression occurred only when the negative feedback was strong and participants could not retaliate directly. Higher levels of callousness specifically predicted more <b>displaced</b> (but not direct) aggression. However, the potentiating effects of callousness emerged only when the negative feedback was strong. This finding highlights the importance of examining disposition by situation interactions in <b>displaced</b> aggression research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to study displacement operations in offshore petroleum industry. Typically MEG or Methanol is circulated through parts of the subsea production systems to lower their hydrocarbon content. This is often done {{at the beginning of}} a prolonged production shut-in, to avoid formation of hydrates or to minimize the emissions of chemicals to the environment when a component is to be replaced. Experimental and numerical analyses have been conducted on a previously built pipe system formed like a U-shaped jumper. Through the project it has been investigated necessary <b>displacing</b> time required to achieve target hydrocarbon concentration in the domain, optimal displacement rate for efficiently removal of hydrocarbons, and how these variables depend on different fluids and their properties. The investigation was performed through measuring the volume fraction in the domain of the <b>displacing</b> fluid by draining the jumper, after the fluid had been flooding in the system for a certain time. The system was filled and <b>displaced</b> with both water and Exxsol D 60. The experimental results have been used as validation for the accuracy of the models made in the transient multiphase flow commercial simulator LedaFlow®. A sensitivity analysis was performed, considering density, viscosity, interfacial tension, different fluids and geometry. The experimental results showed small changes in the amounts <b>displaced</b> between 2 and 3 volumes. For the displacement to be considered successful, a criterion of a volume fraction for the <b>displacing</b> fluid higher than 95 % was set. For oil <b>displacing</b> water, a flow rate of 28. 16 m 3 /h was required. For water <b>displacing</b> oil, 20. 77 m 3 /h was sufficient. LedaFlow predicted the volume fractions well, deviating from the experimental points with an average of 5. 5 % for oil <b>displacing</b> water and 5. 7 % for water <b>displacing</b> oil. The sensitivity analysis showed significant changes in the <b>displaced</b> amounts, when changing the density of the <b>displaced</b> fluid. For a density a bit higher than the <b>displacing</b> fluid, the amount was decreasing exponentially as the density increased. Changes in viscosities for both the <b>displacing</b> fluid and the fluid to be <b>displaced</b> had little effect, unless the viscosity of the <b>displacing</b> fluid was highly increased. It was observed a linear relationship between changes in interfacial tension and obtained volume fraction. Simulations with methanol <b>displacing</b> oil predicted higher amounts <b>displaced</b> than when oil <b>displaced</b> water. With gas included as a fluid to be <b>displaced</b> in the system, the <b>displaced</b> amounts were reduced. With a dead-leg included in the geometry, it showed no visible effects in the simulation. Experimental data and observations have been obtained. The results of the numerical models in LedaFlow are in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
