5000|$|The Henson, 'Cheval Henson' or [...] is {{a modern}} French breed of horse from {{the area of the}} Baie de Somme in Picardy (now part of Hauts-de-France), in {{north-eastern}} France. It was created by selective breeding of light saddle horses with the small, heavier horses of the Norwegian Fjord breed. The aim was to breed small horses suitable for <b>equestrian</b> <b>tourism.</b> A breeders' association, the Association du Cheval Henson, was formed in 1983. In 1995 the stud-book was closed to horses not born from Henson parents, and in 2003 the breed was officially recognised by the Haras Nationaux and the Ministère de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt, the French ministry of agriculture.|$|E
5000|$|Contrary to the {{majority}} of French horse breeds, the Henson was created in the late 20th century with the goal to obtain a hardy horse adapted to all forms of <b>equestrian</b> <b>tourism,</b> outdoor riding and leisure; it is therefore the most recent of all French horse breeds. The Baie de Somme, a natural area of 70 km², formed the birthplace of the breed. The Henson became one of the emblems {{in the same way as}} birds, thanks to its mode of breeding [...] "in the sense of a preserved area". Its economic impact remains modest but is growing from year to year with the rise of ecotourism. It is considered a regional success [...] "in the new logic of horse riding”.|$|E
50|$|Other {{questions}} arise {{with the way}} in which mankind puts the horse to work. Well-conducted equestrianism is similar to sports training in that it allows the horse to gain flexibility and muscle. The wrong approach to riding, however, causes back pain because of the weight of the rider on the dorsal and thoracic vertebrae. Positioning the neck high and hollow (where the rider keeps his hands high and holds the reins tight) is particularly deleterious. These problems are exacerbated by the excess weight carried by some riders relative to the horse's constitution: according to studies, the rider's weight should not exceed 20 to 29% (including equipment) of the horse's weight. However, certain breeds are better carriers than others, particularly the mixed breeds. The exploitation of certain horses for mounted or harnessed <b>equestrian</b> <b>tourism,</b> in Camargue among other places, causes considerable suffering through lack of rest or care.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{article is}} devoted to {{contemporary}} <b>equestrian</b> <b>tourism</b> in Poland: the factors de-termining its state of affairs, development opportunities, and barriers. Using extensive literature, statistical data, and estimates and opinions expressed by leading {{experts in the field}} (gathered through IDI’s), the author tries to formulate conclusions and recommendations on the possibilities of <b>equestrian</b> <b>tourism</b> development in Poland {{and its impact on the}} local development. Starting by defining the tourism in question, the author analyses sociocultural, economic, legal, and institu-tional aspects of contemporary equestrian/horse riding tourism. One of the general conclusions is that there is limited knowledge about the equine industry in Poland – a weakness that should be removed as one of the preconditions of any strategic development. Other recommendations refer to the need for improved and standardized training for beginners, changed attitudes towards both horses and equestrianism as a precondition of institutional and legal changes towards the creation of an equestrian-friendly environment, and the improvement of the quality of the tourist offer. Finally, it should be stressed that the international marketing of <b>equestrian</b> <b>tourism</b> in Poland – which consists of quality equestrian services, horse trails, accommodation centers, and auxiliary tourist services – can only be successful when all of its elements are in place...|$|E

From the analysis, it is concluded that the critical success factors are significant in motivating equestrian tourists, namely the quality of equestrian infrastructures, the Lusitano horse, the hospitality, among others. It is also possible to analyze that the equestrian tourist demonstrates a strong commitment: they are knowledgeable, since they read a lot about riding, belong to equestrian clubs and often face the possibility of having an occupation linked to the equestrian sector. Finally, the results highlight the agreement between participants and a significant number of statements made in the questionnaire related to motivation and involvement.
