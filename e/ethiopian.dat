5|$|By the 16th century <b>Ethiopian</b> works {{began to}} discuss the {{profound}} impact of foreign peoples in their own regional history. The chronicle of Gelawdewos explained the friction between the <b>Ethiopian</b> Orthodox Church and the Catholic missionaries from Spain and Portugal, after {{the arrival of the}} Jesuits in 1555. With the persuasion of Jesuits in his realm, emperor Susenyos I (r. 1607–1632) became the only <b>Ethiopian</b> ruler to convert from Orthodox Christianity to Catholicism, perhaps earlier than the accepted date of 1625, after which his attempts to convert his subjects and undermine the Orthodox church led to internal revolts. In 1593 the <b>Ethiopian</b> monk, historian, and ethnographer Bahrey published a work of ethnography that provided reasoning for the military success of the polytheistic Oromo people who fought against the <b>Ethiopian</b> Empire. <b>Ethiopian</b> histories of this period also included details of foreign Muslims, Jews, Christians (including those from Western Europe), Safavid Iranians, and even figures of the fallen Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|Edward Ullendorff {{considered}} the German orientalist Hiob Ludolf (1624–1704) {{to be the}} founder of <b>Ethiopian</b> studies in Europe, thanks to his efforts in documenting the history of Ethiopia and the Ge'ez language, as well as Amharic. The <b>Ethiopian</b> monk Abba Gorgoryos (1595–1658), while lobbying the Propaganda Fide in Rome to become bishop of Ethiopia following his Catholic conversion and expulsion of the Jesuits by <b>Ethiopian</b> emperor Fasilides, collaborated with Ludolf – who never actually visited Ethiopia – and provided him with critical information for composing his Historia Aethiopica and its Commentaries. The ethnically-Ethiopian Portuguese cleric António d'Andrade (1610–1670) aided them as a translator, since Abba Gorgoryos was not a fluent speaker of either Latin or Italian. After Ludolf, the 18th-century Scottish travel writer James Bruce, who visited Ethiopia, and German orientalist August Dillmann (1823–1894) are also considered pioneers {{in the field of}} early <b>Ethiopian</b> studies. After spending time at the <b>Ethiopian</b> royal court, Bruce was the first to systematically collect and deposit <b>Ethiopian</b> historical documents into libraries of Europe, in addition to composing a history of Ethiopia based on native <b>Ethiopian</b> sources. Dillmann cataloged a variety of <b>Ethiopian</b> manuscripts, including historical chronicles, and in 1865 published the Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae, the first such lexicon to be published on languages of Ethiopia since Ludolf's work.|$|E

50|$|Between 5 and 7 December, {{for reasons}} which {{have never been}} clearly determined, there was a {{skirmish}} between the garrison of Somalis, who were in Italian service, and a force of armed <b>Ethiopians.</b> According to the Italians, the <b>Ethiopians</b> attacked the Somalis with rifle and machine-gun fire. According to the <b>Ethiopians,</b> the Italians attacked them, supported by two tanks and three aircraft. In the end, approximately 107 <b>Ethiopians</b> and 50 Italians and Somalis were killed.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{historians have}} taken new {{approaches}} to analyzing both traditional and modern <b>Ethiopian</b> historiography. For instance, Donald Crummey (1941–2013) investigated instances in <b>Ethiopian</b> historiography dealing with class, ethnicity, and gender. He also criticized earlier approaches made by Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960) and Richard Pankhurst (1927–2017), who focused primarily on the <b>Ethiopian</b> ruling class while ignoring marginalized peoples and minority groups in <b>Ethiopian</b> historical works. Following the 1974 <b>Ethiopian</b> Revolution and overthrow of the Solomonic dynasty with the deposition of Haile Selassie, the historical materialism of Marxist historiography came to dominate the academic landscape and understanding of Northeast African history. In her 2001 article Women in <b>Ethiopian</b> History: A Bibliographic Review, Belete Bizuneh remarks {{that the impact of}} social history on African historiography in the 20th century generated an unprecedented focus on the roles of women and gender in historical societies, but that <b>Ethiopian</b> historiography seems to have fallen outside the orbit of these historiographic trends.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Ethiopians</b> {{advanced}} in three columns of 3,000 men each. In the first attacks, the <b>Ethiopians</b> hurled {{themselves at the}} Italian positions in waves.

50|$|The 1,000 <b>Ethiopians</b> behind Criniti {{joined the}} battle {{at this time}} and Criniti's command came under fire from all directions. The <b>Ethiopians</b> surged forward, {{slaughtered}} the Eritrean infantry, and engulfed the Italian tanks. Some <b>Ethiopians</b> were able to approach the tanks from the rear and were then able to disable the tracks and machine guns. Their tanks rendered useless, the two-man crews were killed.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Ethiopian</b> {{highland}} hare is predated by the <b>Ethiopian</b> wolf (Canis simensis) and statistically forms 1.6% of its diet numerically, or 11.6% by weight. The {{tawny eagle}} (Aquila rapax) {{is also a}} known predator of the <b>Ethiopian</b> highland hare.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1960s, the carrier {{provided}} some initial aviation support to the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission in its operation to acquire topographic maps of Ethiopia. The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from <b>Ethiopian</b> Air Lines to <b>Ethiopian</b> Airlines. By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an <b>Ethiopian</b> deputy general manager.

5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} <b>Ethiopian</b> biographical {{tradition}} became far more complex, intertextual, and broader in {{its view of}} the world given Ethiopia's direct involvement in the conflicts between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires in the Red Sea region. The annals of Dawit II (r. 1508–1540) describe the defensive war he waged against the Adal sultan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (r. 1527–1543), in an episodic format quite different from the earlier chronicling tradition. The chronicle of Gelawdewos, perhaps written by the <b>Ethiopian</b> Orthodox Church abbot Enbaqom (1470–1560), is far more detailed than any previous <b>Ethiopian</b> work of history. It explains the <b>Ethiopian</b> emperor's military alliance with Cristóvão da Gama (1516–1542), son of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, against the Adal Sultan al-Ghazi and his Ottoman allies, and later against the Ottoman governor of Yemen, Özdemir Pasha (d. 1560).|$|E
50|$|The Italian {{mechanized}} columns {{responded with}} a series of out-flanking maneuvers which quickly compelled the <b>Ethiopians</b> to withdraw and leave the field of battle. Unfortunately the weary army could not withdraw fast enough as it was again assaulted from the air. The <b>Ethiopians</b> could find no relief and their withdrawal quickly became a disorganized retreat. In this unequal chase, the <b>Ethiopians</b> were on foot and the Italians were generally in motor vehicles. The Italians blocked the few wells that lay along the way and closely pursued the parched <b>Ethiopians.</b> Ras Desta's army soon disintegrated under these assaults.|$|R

5|$|<b>Ethiopian</b> historiography {{embodies the}} ancient, medieval, early modern and modern {{disciplines}} of recording {{the history of}} Ethiopia, including both native and foreign sources. The roots of <b>Ethiopian</b> historical writing {{can be traced back}} to the ancient Kingdom of Aksum (c. 100 – c. 940 AD). These early texts were written in either the <b>Ethiopian</b> Ge'ez script or the Greek alphabet, and included a variety of mediums such as manuscripts and epigraphic inscriptions on monumental stelae and obelisks documenting contemporary events. The writing of history became an established genre in <b>Ethiopian</b> literature during the early Solomonic dynasty (1270–1974). In this period, written histories were usually in the form of royal biographies and dynastic chronicles, supplemented by hagiographic literature and universal histories in the form of annals. Christian mythology became a linchpin of medieval <b>Ethiopian</b> historiography due to works such as the Orthodox Kebra Nagast. This reinforced the genealogical traditions of Ethiopia's Solomonic dynasty rulers, which asserted that they were descendants of Solomon, the legendary King of Israel.|$|E

The <b>Ethiopians</b> formed up in a {{horseshoe}} formation on the surrounding crests and Criniti ordered his tanks to smash a way through them.
