50|$|However, it {{was also}} said that in his later years, Wang Lin was {{impotent}} after suffering a stroke. He had favored the close associate Gui Shouming (歸守明), and Gui thus was allowed to enter the palace freely. Empress Chen began an affair with him, and also with another associate, Li <b>Keyin</b> (李可殷). As Li <b>Keyin</b> had falsely accused the officer Li Fang (李倣), and Empress Chen's clansman Chen Kuangsheng (陳匡勝) had disrespected Wang Jipeng, both Li Fang and Wang Jipeng became resentful of the situation. When Wang Lin's conditions grew worse in winter 935, Wang Jipeng {{thought that he was}} going to inherit the throne, and therefore was happy. Meanwhile, as Li Fang believed that Wang Lin would not recover, he had Li <b>Keyin</b> killed. However, when Wang Lin's conditions subsequently became better, Empress Chen informed him of Li Keyin's death, and he ordered an investigation. Li Fang, in fear, started an uprising and took his soldiers into the palace. The soldiers wounded Wang Lin, who was suffering tremendously from his wound. His palace servants, not wanting to see him suffer further, killed him. Li Fang and Wang Jipeng then killed Empress Chen, Chen Kuangsheng, another Chen clansman Chen Shou'en (陳守恩), Gui, and Wang Jipeng's younger brother Wang Jitao (whom Wang Jipeng also disliked). Wang Jipeng then took the throne (as Emperor Kangzong).|$|E

As Li <b>Keyin</b> had falsely accused the imperial guard officer Li Fang (李倣), and Empress Chen's family member Chen Kuangsheng (陳匡勝) had disrespected Wang Jipeng, both Li Fang and Wang Jipeng were discontent with the situation, such that when Wang Lin's illness became more serious, Wang Jipeng became pleased, believing that he would be emperor next. Li Fang also came to believe that Wang Lin would not recover, and found an opportunity to assassinate Li <b>Keyin.</b> However, when Wang Lin then recovered slightly, Empress Chen informed him of what happened, and he decided to investigate Li Keyin's death. In fear, Li Fang started a mutiny and sent his soldiers into the palace. The soldiers gravely injured Wang Lin, whose ladies in waiting then decided to kill him to relieve his suffering. Li Fang and Wang Jipeng then killed Empress Chen, Chen Kuangsheng, another of Empress Chen's relatives Chen Shou'en (陳守恩), Gui, and Wang Jitao. Wang Jipeng then, claiming that it was the will of Empress Dowager Huang, took the throne and changed his name to Wang Chang.|$|E

5000|$|Linear probing is a {{component}} of open addressing schemes for using a hash table to solve the dictionary problem. In the dictionary problem, a data structure should maintain a collection of key-value pairs subject to operations that insert or delete pairs from the collection or that search for the value associated with a given <b>key.In</b> open addressing solutions to this problem, the data structure is an array [...] (the hash table) whose cells [...] (when nonempty) each store a single key-value pair. A hash function is used to map each key into the cell of [...] where that key should be stored, typically scrambling the keys so that keys with similar values are not placed near {{each other in the}} table. A hash collision occurs when the hash function maps a key into a cell that is already occupied by a different key. Linear probing is a strategy for resolving collisions, by placing the new key into the closest following empty cell.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{moving in}} with Borthwick in the winter 1911, Wright resumed work on his {{architectural}} projects, but he struggled to secure commissions because of the ongoing negative publicity over his affair with Borthwick (whose ex-husband, Edwin Cheney, maintained main custody of their son and daughter). However, Wright did produce {{some of his most}} acclaimed works during this time period, including the Midway Gardens in Chicago and the Avery Coonley Playhouse in Riverside. He also indulged his hobby for collecting Japanese art, and quickly became a renowned authority. Borthwick translated four works from Swedish difference feminist Ellen <b>Key.In</b> his spare time, Wright developed a fruit farm on the property with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred gooseberry, two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, which may have been done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E

Nonbinary convolutional coding technique is a coding technique {{which is similar to}} the binary convolutional codes with the same decoding strategy but they are designed for general nonbinary sources. The nonbinary convolutional coding technique is described and simulated under various channel conditions. Synthetic nonbinary source sequences are produced by using Markov processes. The channels used in the experimental simulations include additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and flat fading channel models.

40|$|Consider a {{communication}} network where each process needs to securely exchange messages with its neighboring processes. In this network, each sent message is encrypted using one or more symmetric keys that are shared only between two processes: the process that sends the message and the neighboring process that receives the message. A straightforward scheme for assigning symmetric keys to the different processes in such a network is to assign each process O(d) keys, where d is {{the maximum number of}} neighbors of any process in the network. In this paper, we present a more efficient scheme for assigning symmetric keys to the different processes in {{a communication}} network. This scheme, which is referred to as logarithmic keying, assigns O(log d) symmetric keys to each process in the network. We show that logarithmic keying can be used in rich classes of communication networks that include star networks, acyclic networks, limited-cycle networks, planar networks, and dense bipartite networks. In addition, we present a construction that utilizes efficient keying schemes for general bipartite networks to construct efficient <b>keyin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Six {{techniques}} for three-key text entry are described. The techniques use Left- and Right-arrow keys to maneuver a cursor over a linear sequence of characters, and a Select key to select characters. The keystrokes per character (KSPC) for the methods varies from 10. 66 to 4. 23. Two techniques {{were chosen for}} formal evaluation. Method # 2 positions characters in alphabetical order, while Method # 6 uses linguistic enhancement to reorder characters following each entry to minimize the cursor distance to the next character. Both methods position SPACE {{on the left and}} use a snap-to-home cursor mode, whereby the cursor snaps to SPACE after each entry. Entry rates were about 9 - 10 wpm for both techniques, as measured in an experiment with ten participants. Interaction issues are examined, such as the challenges in using linguistic knowledge to accelerate input, and the opportunity for using typamatic (viz. auto-repeat) keying strategies {{to reduce the number of}} physical keypresses.

40|$|Using {{coherent}} optical {{detection and}} digital signal processing, laser phase noise and equalization enhanced phase noise can be effectively mitigated using the feed-forward and feed-back carrier phase recovery approaches. In this paper, theoretical analyses of feed-back and feed-forward carrier phase recovery methods {{have been carried out}} in the long-haul high-speed n-level phase shift keying (n-PSK) optical fiber communication systems, involving a one-tap normalized least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm, a block-wise average algorithm, and a Viterbi-Viterbi algorithm. The analytical expressions for evaluating the estimated carrier phase and for predicting the bit-error-rate (BER) performance (such as the BER floors) have been presented and discussed in the n-PSK coherent optical transmission systems by considering both the laser phase noise and the equalization enhanced phase noise. The results indicate that the Viterbi-Viterbi carrier phase recovery algorithm outperforms the one-tap normalized LMS and the block-wise average algorithms for small phase noise variance (or effective phase noise variance), while the one-tap normalized LMS algorithm shows a better performance than the other two algorithms for large phase noise variance (or effective phase noise variance). In addition, the one-tap normalized LMS algorithm is more sensitive to the level of modulation formats.
