5|$|A liberal <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased {{government spending and}} power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> {{is certain}} that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

25|$|An apatheist <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is not {{interested}} in accepting or denying any claims that gods exist or do not exist. An apatheist lives as if there are no gods and explains natural phenomena without reference to any deities. The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view.|$|E
25|$|Environmental vegetarianism can be {{compared}} with economic vegetarianism. An economic vegetarian <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> practices vegetarianism either out of necessity or because of a conscious simple living strategy.

25|$|A tax protester <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> {{refuses to}} pay a tax {{claiming}} that the tax laws are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Tax protesters are different from tax resisters, who refuse to pay taxes as a protest against the government or its policies, not out of {{a belief that the}} tax law itself is invalid. The United States has a large and organized culture of people who espouse such theories. Tax protesters also exist in other countries.|$|E

25|$|The Extended Cut {{provides}} additional {{scenes and}} dialogue {{towards the end}} of the story. Shepard's squadmates are critically injured (incinerated if EMS is low) by Harbinger during the push to the Citadel beam, forcing Shepard to call in the Normandy to extract them. Shepard can now refuse to activate the Crucible, leading to a fourth ending where the Reapers destroy all advanced life in the galaxy, but are defeated in the next cycle via knowledge from one of Liara's beacons. Otherwise, the flashbacks after Shepard's final decision have also been adjusted: the first is Anderson, the second <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> died during the events of the story, and the third is Shepard's love interest. The mass relays are now severely damaged instead of being destroyed by the Crucible's firing unless EMS is low.|$|E

25|$|In {{a change}} {{made to the}} bylaws in 2000, {{categories}} of membership were formally established. Playing members originally made up the band and {{were the only people}} who qualified to be Board members. Auxiliary members do not perform, but contribute to the band with their time and services. These services range from assisting with promotional mailings to staffing the Banjo Jubilee. A former member <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> resigns from the band or who has not attended a practice or performance for at least three years. Both playing and auxiliary members have voting rights as long as they meet certain annual criteria laid out in the Standing Rules of the Bylaws. Former (playing) members are those who have not practiced or performed with the band for at least three years. An honorary member is any person who has made significant contribution to the objectives of the Peninsula Banjo Band and are elected after nomination by the Board of Directors. Honorary members may not vote nor serve on the Board of Directors.|$|E
25|$|In this section, Rousseau expresses {{his belief}} that actors and actresses {{themselves}} are people of an undesirable lifestyle and potentially weak moral foundation. Rousseau describes them as scandalous, hedonistic, and compares them to jesters, who were more blatantly indecent and obscene. Once again looking to Greece and Rome as an ideal, he says that Sparta did not tolerate theatres, and Rome considered the acting profession dishonourable. He writes that the actor <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is artificial, performs for money, subjects himself to disgrace, and abandons {{his role as a}} man. Though the actor is not necessarily malevolent with his talents of deception, Rousseau goes on, the seductive, manipulative nature of acting could potentially be used by actors to do harm in society outside of the theatre. It is also problematic, according to Rousseau for women and men to be working together as actors and actresses. Because of the natural respect men have for the moral sense and timidity of women, for men to be amongst women as actresses will be a further threat to men's morality.|$|E

I feel like that's a lost art, and just saying 'please' and 'thank you' goes a very long way with me. That's just so lost these days. So, ladies, it's OK to say 'thank you.' ...|$|E
