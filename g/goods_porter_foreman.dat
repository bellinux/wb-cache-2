60|$|We {{returned}} to a hasty dinner [in Pall Mall], and then hurried away to see honest Dan Terry's house, called the Adelphi Theatre, where we saw the Pilot, from the American novel of that name. It is extremely popular, the dramatist having seized on the whole story, and turned the odious and ridiculous parts, assigned by the original author to the British, against the Yankees themselves. There is a quiet effrontery in this that is of a rare and peculiar character. The Americans were so much displeased, that they attempted a row--which rendered the piece doubly attractive to the seamen at Wapping, who came up and crowded the house night after night, to support the honour of the British flag. After all, one must deprecate whatever keeps up ill-will betwixt America and the mother country; and we in particular should avoid awakening painful recollections. Our high situation enables us to contemn petty insults and to make advances towards cordiality. I was, however, glad to see honest Dan's theatre as full seemingly as it could hold. The heat was dreadful, and Anne was so very unwell that she was obliged to be carried into Terry's house,--a curious dwelling, {{no larger than a}} squirrel's cage, which he has contrived to squeeze out of the vacant spaces of the theatre, and which is accessible by a most complicated combination of staircases and small passages. Here we had rare <b>good</b> <b>porter</b> and oysters after the play, and found Anne much better. She had attempted too much; indeed I myself was much fatigued.|$|R

He had sufficient strength to raise himself high enough to reach it, but it far exceeded his powers to draw the cork, even had the ordinary means been at hand, which they were not. There was a hammer on the shelf, however, and with that instrument he did succeed in making a hole {{in the side of the}} bottle, and in filling a tumbler. This liquor he swallowed at a single draught. It tasted deliciously to him, and he took a second tumbler full, when he lay down, uncertain as to the consequences. That his head was affected by these two glasses of porter, Mark himself was soon aware, and shortly after drowsiness followed. After lying in an uneasy slumber for half an hour, his whole person was covered with a gentle perspiration, in which condition, after drawing the sheet around him, the sick man fell asleep.|$|R

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 61 elbow synovectomies in 50 {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis, with follow-up varying from 4 to 10 years (mean 6. 5 years). The results were graded as satisfactory in 70 %, with {{no significant difference}} in the results between joints which were radiologically good before operation and those which had been destroyed. Longer term results were analysed of 27 elbow synovectomies in 22 patients followed up for over six years. The results were satisfactory in 67 % of the patients in both 1981 and in 1987, with no deterioration over this period. The elbow joint is frequently affected in rheumatoid arthritis (Raunio 1981) but seldom receives surgical treatment because the destructive changes are oversha-dowed by those in otherjoints. Synovectomy ofthe elbow is an accepted procedure with <b>good</b> results (<b>Porter,</b> Richardson and Vainio 1974; Copeland and Taylor 1979; Gschwend 1980; Fer!ic et a! 1987) but there is still debate about the long-term results and about its effect in radiologically destroyed joints (Porter et a! 1974; Brum-field and Resnick 1985; Ferlic et a! 1987). These two points have become more relevant with the introduction of unconstrained elbow prostheses which rely on good ligaments for stability and on relatively good bone stock for fixation. There is therefore a great deal of overlap in the indications for synovectomy and arthroplasty. Various surgical techniques have been employed. The lateral approach has been used in most recent series (Eichenblatt, Hass and Kessler 1982; Rymaszewski et a! 1984; Gschwend and Steiger 1986 : Ferlic et a! 1987) and the alternative approach by osteotomy of the olecranon (Ing!is, Ranawat and Straub 197 !) has never become very popular.

It was indeed the Duke of Thunder, his name printed under his effigies in the Hawaiianised form of Nelesona. I thought it a fine instance of fame that his features and his empty sleeve should have been drawn on stone in San Fransisco, which was a lone Mexican mission while he lived; and lettered for a market in those islands, which were not yet united under Kamehameha when he died. And then I had a cold fit, and wondered after all if these good folk knew anything of the man's world-shaking deeds and gunpowder weaknesses, or if he was to them a [...] "bare appellation" [...] and a face on stone; and turning to the schoolmaster, I asked of him the question. Yes, the Hawaiians knew of Nelesona; {{there had been a}} story in the papers where he figured, and the portrait had been given for a supplement. So he was known as a character of Romance! Brave men since Agamemnon, like the brave before, must patiently expect the [...] "inspired author." [...] And nowhere has fiction deeper roots than in the world of Polynesia.

5000|$|The {{narrator of}} the ballad begins by placing him-/herself {{firmly on the}} side of the anti-Catholics by declaring to tell how the Jesuit, Devil, and POPE did agree,Our STATE to destroy, and Religion so old.To murder our KING,A most Horrible Thing!:(1.3-6)(S)he then goes on to tell the murder of the knight Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a member of Parliament and a staunch Protestant. The narrator {{describes}} as a fitting place for the murder a back-court of Somerset House, presumably because many people gather there, making it easier to disguise a murder. Godfrey's body is handled very roughly by his murderers:His Body they tossd;From Pillar to Post:(II.4-6)When his body begins to decay, and in order to conceal the murder, the killers place his corpse on horseback to Soho and drive his own sword through his body, leaving his money and making sure his shoes are clean, to make it seem as if he has been killed by a thief. The murder of Godfrey is an attempt by participants in the plot to bring the vengeance of [...] "the excess of Jesuitical rage" [...] upon London by stealing from and setting fire to its houses, which they have attempted to do many times before.The narrator may even be attributing blame for the Great Fire of London of 1666 to the plotters:You have seen how they once set the Town all in flame;And divers times since have attempted the same:(IV. 8-9)The narrator then credits the fraudster and informer William Bedloe for knowledge of Jesuits conniving their way into Londoners' homes disguised as drivers of <b>goods</b> vehicles, <b>porters,</b> chimney-sweeps, or coal sellers and then sabotaging the homes.

40|$|Cluster economies {{establish}} {{criteria in}} which to examine an industry, its mechanism of production, {{its effect on the}} city’s economy, and its potential for sustainability in an unknown future. Clusters can be defined by a geographic concentration of firms and institutions of a particular industry, the subsequent consumer efficiency achieved from the geographic concentration, an interconnectedness between firms, buyers and suppliers and clients and firms, and the potential to generate collective action in the production of <b>goods</b> and services (<b>Porter</b> 1998). This study uses these conditions as a basis for examining a group of galleries and museums in the Miracle Mile neighborhood of Los Angeles in order to establish the existence of an arts cluster economy. The study finds a significant concentration of art facilities in the Miracle Mile neighborhood with location quotients for both galleries and museums substantiating data regarding the increasing number of establishments. A survey of visitors corroborated that consumers experience greater utility in attending art facilities in the Miracle Mile, and interviews with galleries and vendors, as well as informal conversation with museum representatives, revealed interactions between businesses as well as the presence of collective action. However, barriers to collective action, such as heterogeneity of firms, inhibit the Miracle Mile cluster from achieving optimal production of collective action, suggesting the possibility of public intervention such as the implementation of specific community plans, public signage programs and outside agents to increase the effectiveness of the arts cluster economy...|$|R
50|$|Porter’s books give {{techniques}} for getting {{a handle on}} the possible average profitability of an industry over time. The analysis of these forces is the base for estimating a firm’s relative position and competitive advantage. In any industry, the sustained average profitability of competitors varies widely. The problem is to determine how a business can outperform the industry average and attain a sustainable competitive advantage. It is possible that the answer lies in information technology together with <b>good</b> management. <b>Porter</b> claims that the principal types of competitive advantage are low cost producer, differentiation, and focus. A firm has a competitive advantage if it is able to deliver its product or service at a lower cost than its competitors. If the quality of its product is satisfactory, this will translate into higher margins and higher returns. Another advantage is gained if the firm is able to differentiate itself in some way. Differentiation leads to offering something that is both unique and is desired, and translates into a premium price. Again, this will lead to higher margins and superior performance. It seems that two types of competitive advantage, lower cost and differentiation, are mutually exclusive. To get lower cost, you sacrifice uniqueness. To get a premium price, there must be extra cost involved in the process. To be a superior performer, however, you must go for competitive advantage in either cost or differentiation. Another point of Porter’s is that competitive advantage is gained through a strategy based on scope. It is necessary to look at the breadth of a firm’s activities, and narrow the competitive scope to gain focus in either an industry segment, a geographic area, a customer type, and so on. Competitive advantage is most readily gained by defining the competitive scope in which the firm is operating, and concentrating on it. Based on these ideas of type and scope, Porter gives a useful tool for analysis which he calls the value chain. This value chain gives a framework on which a useful analysis can be hung. The basic notion is that to understand competitive advantage in any firm, one cannot look at the firm as a whole. It is necessary to identify the specific activities which the firm performs to do business. Each firm is a collection of the things that it does that all add up to the product being delivered to the customer. These activities are numerous and are unique to every industry, but it is only in these activities where cost advantage or differentiation can be gained. The basic lis that the firm’s activities can be divided into nine generic types. Five are the primary activities, which are the activities that create the product, market it and deliver it; four are the support activities that cross between the primary activities.|$|R
