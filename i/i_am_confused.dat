5000|$|James’ firing was not handled well. Believing a {{resignation}} {{could be}} covered by a volunteer resignation, Athletic Director Robert Kane adopted opacity over transparency. [...] The result was a University employee left {{to work through the}} termination, alone and in silence. As James’ said after the University announcement, “It hit me like a bombshell, I just didn’t expect it. I really don’t know what I’ll do. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused</b> by the whole thing.” [...] Part of the confusion lay in the lack of consensus between Ivy League presidents and their sports-supporting alumni. When the Ivy League was created in 1956, it was to focus on athletics as a means of teaching and building character. Winning was incidental. But within its first decade, five of its coaches were let go for ‘losing’. The University administrations were unable to reconcile the creation of the Ivy League with the aspirations of donors.|$|E
5000|$|A speech {{given by}} Speedy {{to the girls}} of North London Collegiate School in about 1883 was remembered by Molly Hughes in her A London Girl of the 1880s: [...] "A certain Captain Speedy had just {{returned}} from Abyssinia, and gave us an amusing talk about it, dressing up, like a quick-change artist, as a general, a priest, a merchant, a courtier, and so on, and throwing in some amazing details of their religious rites, wedding ceremonies, and methods of commerce. He won our gratitude, too, by saying: 'I understand that you girls have to write an account of my talk to you. Well, the very word Abyssinia means confusion, because the races are confused, the religion is confused, the mountains and valleys are confused, and I know that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused</b> in addressing so many girls. So the more confused your accounts are, the better they will represent the country and the lecture." ...|$|E
5000|$|The town of Libon, {{as it is}} {{presently}} known was originally called Libong. It is not known when and how the letter [...] "g" [...] got dropped. Some writers believe that the Spaniards must have {{found it difficult to}} pronounce the word [...] "Libong" [...] with the letter g, so that in due time Libong became Libon. There are conflicting and various versions regarding the origin of the name Libong. Some say that the word must have been derived from the Bicol term [...] "libong" [...] or [...] "ribong", meaning puzzled, dizziness, losing one's sense of direction, or becoming oriented. Others believe that the word Libon must have originated from a Spanish term [...] "libon", which means [...] "assault". Another version is that the word is a corruption of the Bicol word [...] "libtong", meaning difficulty, obstacle or pool of stagnant water, which when applied to a place could mean a difficult or stagnant place. The more popular and perhaps more plausible version is the claim that Libon originated from the Bicol term [...] "libong" [...] or [...] "ribong", and there is a story which seems to support this view. The story goes that Captain Juan de Salcedo and his men arrived in this place, by sailing across Lake Bato and entering the river called, Quimba. Sailing upstream, they finally landed in a place called Linao; (Linao is one of the barrios of Libon today and is situated on the banks of Quimba River). Here Salcedo and his men proceeded to find a town. However, after exploring the surrounding area and noting that Linao was {{at the foot of a}} mountain range, making it vulnerable to enemy attacks from the surrounding mountains, Salcedo and his men, with some natives as their guide, decided to move on to a more suitable place. Traveling across marshy land, they arrived at a slightly elevated area. Upon looking around and trying to determine where they were, one native guide remarked [...] "libong aco". (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused).</b> The Spaniards on hearing the word [...] "libong" [...] understood it to mean the name of the place. Hence, Salcedo christened it [...] "Santiago de Libon." ...|$|E

Questions surrounding authenticity or genuineness pervade my experiences as I wonder {{what it means to be}} close to someone, what it means to be genuine, and even what is real. To cope with these questions, I turn to my art practice, bringing physical form to the virtual, exposing myself through stereotypically impersonal media, or breaching the lines of appropriate interaction in a way similar to many advancements in technology. While these projects and practices reveal the complexities of the topic as opposed to solving or answering any of the problems or questions, I attempt to engage in discussion and prompt conversation that can lead to a coping or acceptance of the state of relationships in the midst of these colliding digital and physical worlds...|$|E

40|$|I am {{glad that}} Terrence Deacon and Ty Caslunan wrote their very thought-provoking essay 2 ̆ 2 Steps to a Metaphysics of Incompleteness. 2 ̆ 2 I {{remember}} {{a conversation with}} Deacon in 2010 where he described some of these ideas to me {{and a few other}} people, and I asked if he had shared these ideas widely and he said no. He said they were not ready to share, so he wasn 2 ̆ 7 t going to. But now he has, and for that 1 am appreciative. It is a courageous thing to present independent thinking to the world, because people will almost certainly disagree. But without some disagreement over what we already do or do not know, we can never learn anything new. And in our plain ignorance about so much, new ideas are our only hope for better understanding our universe. With that said, now I have to start disagreeing. First I will swnmarize the paper and where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused</b> or disagree, and second I will get into speculative extensions of the paper, and where I see some of its fascinating ramifications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{distribution}} and variability {{of the age of}} stratospheric air in the ERA-interim reanalysis data. Age spectrum and mean age are calculated using the backward trajectory method. The calculated mean age in the ERA-interim agrees well with mean age derived from in-situ and satellite measurements. The authors show that the mean age has a strong annual cycle in the lower stratosphere. They also find that the QBO has an important impact on age of air in the tropics. Finally the linear trend of the mean age is discussed. These results are important to understand stratospheric transport in the ERA-Interim. I recommend publication of the paper after my concerns are addressed. Major Comments: 1. Section 2. 3. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused</b> by how the age spectrum and mean age are calculated in this study. My understanding is that F(τ) in equation 1 is the age spectrum. Equations C 6544 (1) and (2) are not correct because mean age is the first moment, not the mean, of the age spectrum [e. g., equation (1) of Scheele et al., 2005]. This is not a trivial issue...|$|E
40|$|Suicide {{researchers}} are a robust group. We have to be. We are employed, often for {{years at a}} time, to think about death by suicide {{with the aim of}} finding patterns that can help to prevent further deaths. It is an emotionally challenging and complex topic. Those of us who have dedicated considerable portions of our career to thinking about it do so with the sole intention of creating evidence to help address the problem. It is notoriously difficult to predict times of increased suicide risk because the variables are so great. However, there is strong evidence of a link between insensitive media reporting of suicide and increases in the suicide rate. To say the reporting has disappointed many of us who work in suicide research is an understatement. From a researcher’s perspective, the solution is quite simple: don’t report on the methods or reasons for suicide in a simplistic way. Yet some of the headlines I read yesterday suggested the suicide research we produce is absolutely futile. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused.</b> Journalists tell me there is always a detailed discussion held before reporting of a suicide with the reporting guidelines held at the forefront of their decisions. They are clearly not ignorant of the issues. So what is it that the media are responding to when they report on the details of a suicide in this way? The Leveson Inquiry has taught us that journalists will fight to protect their right to publish stories which they think are in the public’s interest. Is it possible that in reporting what suicide researchers would call “excessive detail” journalists are merely responding to the public’s curiosity about suicide...|$|E

The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas. I heard Daniel Dennett, last year, winding up his Royal Institute of Philosophy Millennial Lecture with the prediction: “I anticipate a day when philosophers and scientists and laypeople will chuckle over the fossil traces of our earlier bafflement about consciousness ” (Dennett, in press). And I thought at the time: that’s not quite right. Future philosophers won’t chuckle over the difficulties we now have with understanding consciousness- any more than we, today, chuckle over the difficulties people had two centuries ago with understanding the evolution of life. We chuckle when something is comical. But the spectacle of earnest seekers after truth trying their very best to make sense of something that is presently beyond their capacity is, I’d say, more chastening than comical. In the case of evolution, when we look back on the effort...|$|R
