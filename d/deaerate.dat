Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In <b>deaerating</b> heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) <b>Deaerating</b> heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two <b>deaerating</b> heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type <b>deaerating</b> heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type <b>deaerating</b> heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|R
