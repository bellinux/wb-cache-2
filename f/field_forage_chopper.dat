O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o inteiramente casualizado com duas repetições e os resultados avaliados por meio da análise de regressão. O ângulo oblíquo de 10 º propiciou, aos três DPMs, maior eficiência e, em algumas situações o ângulo oblíquo de 38 º proporcionou melhor desempenho aos DPMs 1 e 2; enquanto em outras, o ângulo de 30 º proporcionou ao DPM- 4, melhor desempenho. É possível baixar o custo de produção quando se trabalha em menores rotações, em virtude do valor do consumo específico ser reduzido. Embora o DPM- 4 tenha apresentado menor demanda energética, ressalta-se que esta máquina possui maior preço de aquisição que os outros dois modelos e maior dificuldade de alimentação, obrigando o produtor a contratar mais uma pessoa para executar este processo. The {{production capacity}} and specific energy consumption in <b>forage</b> <b>choppers</b> type Disintegrator/Chopper/Grinder for elephant grass processing were evaluated. The treatments {{consisted of the}} combination of three <b>forage</b> <b>choppers</b> (DPM- 1, DPm- 2 and DPM- 4), each operating in five different rotations, three oblique angles of the knives and two angles of the knives' edges.

The oblique angle of 10 º led to greater efficiency for the three DPMs. In some situations, the oblique angle of 38 º provided better performance for DPMs 1 and 2, while in others, the angle of 30 º provided better performance for DPM- 4. It is possible to lower production costs, when working at lower rotation speeds, due to the specific consumption being reduced. Although the DPM- 4 has presented a lower energy demand, it is worth pointing out that this machine is more expensive than the other two models and presents greater difficulty in feeding, forcing the farmer to employ an extra person to execute this process...|$|R

They can be very useful in reducing household labour requirements, especially during the peak production season when these requirements are high. Women have been specifically targeted in the development and dissemination of such tools, with the aim of helping them reassign time from farming and domestic activities towards income generating activities. Engineers have always assumed that taking women into consideration in the development and dissemination processes of labour saving tools will guarantee their use and reduce women’s labour time in agriculture, but this has not been effectively achieved. The <b>forage</b> <b>chopper</b> is one such technology that was developed with the aim of reducing women’s labour burdens, and indeed empowering them, only to find out that realities of use are much more complex.

The study was conducted in fourdairying sub-counties of Masaka district, Uganda. The research showed thatit does not make sense to cordon off women as a group and undertake development work with or for them in isolation, because women’s activities are integrated in larger systems and processes. Instead of focusing exclusively on women as individual entities, technology development and dissemination processes should focus as much or more on the social and material context, in order to achieve the goal of technologies that are of truly transformative potential.  ...|$|R

40|$|Summary (En) SummaryThe {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to introduce new technologies to Trinidad and Tobago for livestock feeding based on sugar cane product diversification. The project established a farm site on both islands of Trinidad and Tobago, and equipped them with cane crushers and <b>forage</b> <b>choppers.</b> Another site was created at the Sugar Cane Feeds Centre to also be used as an extension and training unit. Four energy sources from sugar cane were evaluated for livestock production in the country. A pilot molasses-urea block plant was established at the Sugar Cane Feeds Centre, and a training manual prepared on this technology. The local design and manufacture of simple equipment for block making was initiated. Two technicians received two weeks of training in Colombia. Lectures and seminars were given by the project on the use of sugar cane for livestock feeding and on information systems. Field Days were also held on the use of sugar cane juice as livestock feed and on the project's `Sugar Cane Village'. Trichantera, a bush-like tree, was introduced as a protein source for pigs and ruminants, as was molasses fish-silage for pigs and Azolla filiculoides, a water fern, for ducks. The Sugar Cane Feeds Centre should continue to develop the `Sugar Cane Village' concept for sustainable livestock production. Molasses-urea block making should continue to be promoted, and a commercial development programme pursued involving the sugar and chemical industry. Molasses fish-silage should continue to be promoted. Feeding trials using Azolla filiculoides should continue, and those using Trichantera should commence. The use of fresh sun-dried coconuts should be promoted as an on-farm energy source for small ruminants. The liaison established by the project between the Sugar Cane Feeds Centre and the Agricultural Division of the Tobago House of Assembly should be maintained for the exchange of technical information and the promotion of the `sugar cane village' technology. A small follow-up national project should be pursued to support alternative uses of sugar cane for livestock production, and efforts should be made to encourage mixed- integrated farming systems for sugar cane farmers...|$|R

Mevinphos {{is used to}} control aphids, mites, grasshoppers, cutworms, leafhoppers caterpillars, and many other insects on {{a broad range of}} <b>field,</b> <b>forage,</b> vegetable, and fruit crops. Eleven products containing mevinphos are registered in California.

This document addresses the risk of both dietary and occupational exposure to mevinphos. RISK ASSESSMENT The risk assessment process consists of four aspects: hazard identification, dose response assessment, exposure evaluation, and risk characterization. Hazard identification entails review and evaluation of the toxicological properties of each pesticide. The dose-response assessment then considers the toxicological properties and estimates the amount which could potentially cause an adverse effect. The amount which will not result in an observable or measurable non-oncogenic effect is called the No-Observed-Effect Level, NOEL. In general, it i...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of phytoremediation for purification of an anaerobically treated dairy manure {{and production of}} forage crops was investigated. Four crops (two cereals and two grasses) were examined {{for their ability to}} grow hydroponically and to remove pollutants (nutrients) from dairy wastewater. The preliminary experiments showed that timothygrass and orchardgrass did not perform well as aquatic plants. Only 24 and 29 % of the seeds germinated after 19 - 21 days giving a crop yield of 21 and 19 t ha &# 713; 1 for timotygrass and orchardgrass, respectively. Wheat and barley grow very well as aquatic plants with a seed germination of 83 and 73 (in 7 days) and a crop yield of 106 and 86 t ha &# 713; 1 for wheat and barley, respectively. The effect of light duration, seeding rate, wastewater application rate and fungicidal treatment on the wheat crop yield and pollution potential reduction were studied. The results indicated that with this system, a wheat forage crop could be produced in 21 days from germination to harvest. A treatment combination of wastewater application rate of 900 mL day &# 713; 1, a seeding rate of 400 g and a light duration of 12 hrs gave the best results for crop yield (3. 81 kg of wheat tray &# 713; 1). Based on thirteen harvests per year, a total possible yield of 3300 t ha &# 713; 1 per year can be achieved with the system. This is more than 102 times grater than the yield obtainable from a filed grown conventional forage of 245 t ha &# 713; 1 per year.

40|$|Many {{farmland}} {{breeding bird}} populations decline, while large herbivorous bird species, which forage on farmland outside the breeding period, increase their numbers. Intensification of agriculture causes both processes. Foraging habitat choice was studied in farmland breeding Eurasian Curlews and spring-staging waterfowl, through repeated counts of birds on <b>fields.</b> <b>Foraging</b> Eurasian Curlews shifted from grasslands to tilled, newly sown cereal fields in June, while non-foraging birds did not. The {{conclusion is that}} earthworms in dry untilled grassland soils become gradually harder to access for probing birds, while tilled soil remain easy to penetrate. Eurasian Curlews benefit from mosaic landscapes {{with a mixture of}} crops, and which offer ample foraging conditions throughout the season. During spring-staging, geese and swans commute between the roost and agricultural fields. Variable selection in hurdle models revealed that field size, distance to the roost and agricultural treatments ley, stubble and unharvested cereal were important for foraging habitat choice, while other agricultural treatments and disturbance were not. Fields with unharvested cereal were, by far, the most attractive. The dataset had high levels of zero-inflation and aggregation, and hurdle models did not fit the data very well. Instead, we created the ADJUN model, which performed better than the hurdle model. ADJUN and hurdle models were used to estimate the coefficients of the important variables. Based on the estimates, we present mathematical formula to calculate the probabilities for presence, and the expected numbers of the four studied waterfowl species on agricultural fields of staging sites similar to the Ume River Delta area. From these studies, I conclude that agricultural treatment is the most important determinant of the quality of a <b>field</b> for <b>foraging</b> birds, and also, that landscape-wide planning of treatment of farmed fields can be an effective tool for bird conservation, and for the reduction of crop damage by birds...|$|R

40|$|Diachasmimorpha kraussii is a larval {{parasitoid}} of dacine fruit flies. Host utilisation behaviour, including <b>field</b> <b>foraging</b> behaviour, {{is poorly}} known in this species. The diurnal foraging behaviour of D. kraussii {{and one of}} its common hosts, Bactrocera tryoni, in a nectarine orchard was concurrently recorded. Observations of mating, resting, feeding and oviposition were taken two-hourly on 42 trees, commencing at 07 : 00 h and terminating at 17 : 30 h, for 17 days. Resting and oviposition were common events within the orchard for both species, while mating behaviours were not recorded in the orchard for either species. Feeding was not observed for D. kraussii and was rare for B. tryoni. At the level of the individual tree there was a very weak, but significant correlation between parasitoid and fly abundance over a day, but when broken down to the individual observation periods the correlations were absent, or were weakly significant in an inconsistent manner (i. e. sometimes positively correlated, sometimes negatively correlated). At the orchard level, abundance of the parasitoid was not correlated with adult fly abundance. Results suggest that D. kraussii forage independently to adult B. tryoni, a result consistent with a prediction that their foraging is largely driven by larval or plant damage cues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 1. Most of what {{is known}} about {{parasitoid}} behaviour comes from laboratory observations: field quantitative observations on searching parasitoids are extremely difficult to do and are rare. The basic components of Aphytis melinus’s response to California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii) were studied in the laboratory: encounter, rejection, drumming, probing, oviposition, and hostfeeding. It was then asked whether these observations provided a reliable guide to behaviour in the field in a situation that was very different from the laboratory. 2. Field observations were carried out on bark on the trunk and interior branches of trees where live scale density is extremely high in patches, dead scale make up 90 % of all scale, and could be expected to interfere with Aphytis search. 3. The laboratory observations predicted well the time taken in the field for each basic event (drumming or probing) and average times spent on a scale. Also well predicted were the distributions of times spent on drumming, probing, and total time on a scale. Rejection rates were much higher in the field. Thus, the laboratory studies predicted foraging behaviour in the field with variable success; potential explanations for observed mismatch between laboratory and field and its possible larger implications are discussed.

40|$|Behavioral and {{electrophysiological}} {{tests were}} performed to evaluate the responses of workers of the ant Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius) from different size categories to Dufour gland extracts. Morphometric measures based in head widths across eyes {{were used to determine}} worker sizes. Trail following response of different worker sizes to Dufour gland extract from workers of different sizes was assessed. For each worker size category olfactory responses to Dufour gland extracts were determined using electroantennography (EAG). Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to determine the chromatographic profile of Dufour gland secretion for each worker size. Morphometric measures permitted to classify the workers of S. geminata as large, medium and small workers. Medium S. geminata workers displayed a significantly higher behavioral response to Dufour gland extracts produced by medium size workers. Similarly, medium workers showed a significantly higher EAG response to Dufour gland extracts produced by medium sized workers. Chromatographic profile of Dufour gland secretions produced by workers showed that each size category exhibited a characteristic profile of the three main components considered as potential trail pheromone constituents. This work showed that medium workers of S. geminata exhibited a high trail-following behavior as well as a high antennal response to Dufour gland secretion. This and their relative abundance in <b>field</b> <b>foraging</b> areas, suggest that medium-sized workers are specialized in foraging activities...|$|R
40|$|Large herbivores can impose spatial {{patterns}} on otherwise homogeneous vegetation, but how these patterns change through time is poorly understood. Domestic livestock pastures are model systems for studying how foraging behavior influences {{the development of}} coupled grazing and vegetation patterns. We sampled forage production and utilization by cattle along distance-from-water gradients to provide a snapshot of grazing and vegetation patterns, and then evaluated the ability of simulation models to qualitatively reproduce these patterns. In the <b>field,</b> <b>forage</b> production increased with distance from water, as expected, but utilization peaked at intermediate distances from water in two of three study areas. Likewise, simulations based {{on a variety of}} foraging strategies produced gradients in forage production and, after forage availability near water declined sufficiently, peaks in utilization at intermediate distances. Distance-from-water gradients thus represent cumulative but not necessarily present day gradients in grazing intensity. The model with a foraging strategy based on time minimization produced slightly more realistic patterns in forage abundance than a model based on energy maximization, although results were sensitive to the value of the threshold for rejecting sites of low forage biomass. However, all models produced implausible thresholds in grazing and forage distribution, suggesting that factors besides resource distribution influence herbivore distributions. Moreover, different foraging rules produced similar vegetation gradients, especially on point water source landscapes, illustrating the difficulty of inferring foraging processes from vegetation patterns...|$|R

Each individual was banded, sexed, measured (wing, beak, and tarsus lengths), and observed to quantify foraging behavior in the <b>field</b> (<b>foraging</b> height, foraging distance from trunk, foraging substrate diameter, and foraging technique). The data provided descriptions of associations between intraspecific morphological variation and foraging behavior, individual and interindividual variation in foraging, changes in population total niche width and its components, and seasonal variation in breadth and overlap of the feeding niche between the two parid populations. I measured changes {{in the degree of}} generalization in foraging at both the individual and the population levels. The flexibility of individuals and populations in response to food reduction from early to late winter helped to test predictions made by foraging theory and competition theory. ^ Correlations between morphological characters and foraging behavior were not strong and provided only partial support for the expectation that intraspecific morphological variation is related to resource utilization and is an adaptation to avoid niche overlap among individuals in the population. Individuals of both species were generalists. Individual foraging generalization increased to a degree that approached population-level generalization in late winter when food is most scarce. ^ Population-level patterns are not always mirrored on the individual level, as is often assumed. Although most individuals showed similar changes in foraging behavior and became more generalized when food was scarce, some individuals shifted in opposite directions or generalized much more than others. Most results are consistent with the prediction based on foraging theory that food scarcity will favor behavioral generalization and broadening diet. Competition pressure for avoidance of overlap in resource use among individuals and between species seems weak in comparison to individualistic generalization. Competition between and within these populations was not strong enough to force either significant divergence among conspecifics or niche divergence of populations in spite of a declining food supply. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding the {{behavior}} of birds in agricultural habitats can {{be the first step}} in evaluating the conservation implications of birds' use of landscapes shaped by modern agriculture. The existence and magnitude of risk from agricultural practices and the quality of resources agricultural lands provide will be determined largely by how birds use these habitats. Buff-breasted Sandpipers (Tryngites subruficollis) are a species of conservation concern. During spring migration large numbers of Buff-breasted Sandpipers stopover in row crop fields in the Rainwater Basin region of Nebraska. We used behavioral observations as a first step in evaluating how Buff-breasted Sandpipers use crop fields during migratory stopover. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured behavior during migratory stopover using scan and focal individual sampling to determine how birds were using crop <b>fields.</b> <b>Foraging</b> was the most frequent behavior observed, but the intensity of foraging changed {{over the course of the}} day with a distinct mid-day low point. Relative to other migrating shorebirds, Buff-breasted Sandpipers spent a significant proportion of their time in social interactions including courtship displays. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that the primary use of upland agricultural fields by migrating Buff-breasted Sandpipers is foraging while wetlands are used for maintenance and resting. The importance of foraging in row crop fields suggests that both the quality of food resources available in fields and the possible risks from dietary exposure to agricultural chemicals will be important to consider when developing conservation plans for Buff-breasted Sandpipers migrating through the Great Plains...|$|R

Field sampling demonstrated strong spatial heterogeneity in the population densities of I. obsoleta. We experimentally tested three hypotheses: (i) I. obsoleta are strongly attracted to areas {{with high levels of}} detritus; (ii) local abundances of deposit-feeding annelids are limited by detritus; and (iii) the foraging activities of I. obsoleta negatively affects annelid assemblages. We manipulated the density of mud snails using inclusion fences and the levels of detritus using dried Ulva. Results showed that high densities of I. obsoleta were attracted to areas enriched with Ulva detritus. In addition, high densities of snails negatively affected abundances of annelids, with the opportunistic species, Capitella spp. and Paranais litoralis, being most affected. The addition of Ulva detritus had more specific effects on annelid assemblages. Only Capitella spp. showed a significant positive response, although previous evidence has demonstrated that higher experimental detrital inputs stimulated growth of other species of annelids and microphytobenthos. In an experimental treatment with enhanced detritus and low densities of snails, we found population abundances of opportunistic annelids (up to 200, 000 m− 2) substantially larger than has ever been recorded in 5 years of sampling. Because mud snails in natural areas actively search, locate and exploit areas with enhanced detritus and their foraging negatively affects abundances of opportunistic worms, I. obsoleta probably controls the upper limits of annelid abundance in the <b>field.</b> <b>Foraging</b> behavior of I. obsoleta therefore modulates spatial variation in benthic community structure in an environment where limiting resources are patchily distributed...|$|R

The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design, with three treatments and six replications. The residue used in the study was passed through a <b>forage</b> <b>chopper</b> and mixed to the inoculums in a concrete truck mixer. The treatments evaluated were: TF + EB + RB - tobacco residue, bovine manure and bovine rumen; TF + EB + MP - tobacco residue, bovine manure and Microsept-Dust and TF + EB - tobacco residue and bovine manure. The temperature and humidity of the piles were monitored weekly. The piles were initially turned up side down every seven days, and then every fourteen days till closing 60 days. Samples for chemical analysis of the composted material were collected at 30, 60 and 90 days after the beginning of the composting process. The temperature of the piles stayed around 57 to 60 ºC in the period between the 20 to 40 days after the beginning of the composting process. The mix containing cattle rumen (RB) presented the lowest temperature after forty days. At the end of the composting the mix containing Microsept-Dust (MP) presented the lowest humidity. The C/N relation of the composts obtained was around 10 / 1 and 11 / 1. The three treatments presented pH values close to the neutrality in the mature stage. A period of sixty days seems to be sufficient to obtain a mature and stable biocompost of tobacco waste using manure independent of the addition of inoculums. Os resíduos vegetais podem ser utilizados na produção de adubo orgânico por meio da compostagem. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o efeito de dois inoculantes sobre a velocidade de decomposição do resíduo da cultura do fumo. O experimento foi conduzido em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com três tratamentos e seis repetições, sendo o resíduo picado em picadeira e misturado aos inoculantes em betoneira. Foram avaliados os tratamentos: TF + EB + RB - talo de fumo, esterco bovino e rúmen bovino; TF + EB + MP - talo de fumo, esterco bovino e microsept-pó e TF + EB - talo de fumo e esterco bovino. A temperatura e a umidade das pilhas foram monitoradas semanalmente. As pilhas foram revolvidas a cada 07 dias, inicialmente e a seguir a cada 14 dias até os 60 dias. Aos trinta, sessenta e noventa dias, foi feita a coleta, para análise química, do material em compostagem. Entre vinte e quarenta dias as pilhas mantiveram temperatura entre 57 e 60 ºC. A mistura contendo rúmen bovino (RB) apresentou a menor temperatura após 40 dias. Ao final da compostagem a mistura contendo microsept-pó (MP) foi a que apresentou menor umidade. A relação C/N, do composto obtido, ficou entre 10 / 1 e 11 / 1. Os três tratamentos apresentaram pH fracamente alcalino na fase de cura. Pode-se considerar que 60 dias de compostagem são suficientes para a obtenção de um composto estabilizado a partir da mistura resíduo de fumo usando esterco, com ou sem a adição de inoculantes...|$|R

40|$|A pasture on the solonchakic {{solonetz}} {{soil in the}} vicinity of the village of Iđoš (Banat, Serbia) was found to harbor 137 plant taxa (129 species, 7 subspecies and 1 variety). The plant cover they formed was specific from the ecological, phytogeographical and phytocoenological points of view. The specific ecological feature of the surveyed plant cover was that 47 or 34. 31 % of the recorded taxa were rated with the ecological index S+ due to their ability to grow in saline soil. The specific phytogeographical feature of the surveyed plant cover was the presence of two Pannonian endemics, Plantago schwarzenbergiana Schur and Statice gmelini subsp. hungaricum (Klokov) Soó, and two subendemics, Puccinellia limosa Holmb. and Roripa kerneri Menyh. The specific phytocoenological feature of the surveyed plant cover was the presence of two phytocoenoses from the class Phragmitetea Tx. et Prsg. 1942 (ass. Scirpo-Phragmitetum medioeuropaeum and ass. Bolboschoenetum maritimi continentale), one phytocoenose from the class Molinio- Arrhenatheretea Tx. 1937 p. p., Br. -Bl. et Tx. 1943 p. p. (ass. Trifolio-Lolietum perennis) and ten phytocoenoses from the class Festuco-Puccinellietea Soó 1968 (ass. Puccinellietum limosae, ass. Pholiuro-Plantaginetum tenuiflorae, ass. Hordeetum histricis, ass. Agrostio-Alopecuretum pratensis, ass. Agrostio-Beckmannietum, ass. Halo-Agropyretum repentis, ass. Poeto-Alopecuretum pratensis halophyticum, ass. Artemisio-Festucetum pseudovinae, ass. Trifolio-Festucetum pseudovinae and ass. Achilleo-Festucetum pseudovinae). The presence of 34. 31 % of taxa rated with the ecological index S+, the presence of two Pannonian and two sub-Pannonian floristic elements and the predominance of stands from the class Festuco-Puccinellietea Soó 1968 led us to conclusion that the pasture near the village of Iđoš (Banat, Serbia) is a part of the halobiome of the Pannonian Plain.

40|$|Free-range pig {{production}} in Northern Europe {{is characterized by}} high inputs of concentrate on grassland. This increases risk of nutrient leaching, increases feed costs and puts a pressure on land resources. Pigs’ unique ability to find {{a part of their}} food directly in the field where they are kept should be taken into consideration. One below ground <b>field</b> <b>forage</b> characterized by very high yields and with great potential as fodder source is Jerusalem Artichokes (JA) tubers. The nutritional contribution from free-range foraging, growth, feed conversion and behaviour were investigated in 36 growing pigs foraging on JA and fed concentrates restrictedly (30 % of energy recommendations) or ad libitum. Behavioural observations were carried out weekly over the entire experimental period of 40 days. The average daily consumption of concentrate was 51 MJ and 11 MJ ME pig- 1 for pigs fed ad libitum and restrictedly, respectively. Compared to the ad libitum fed pigs, the pigs fed restrictedly had a significant lower daily gain (560 vs. 1, 224 g pig- 1), improved feed conversion ratio (17. 6 vs. 42. 8 MJ ME concentrate kg- 1 live weight gain) and spent more time foraging JA tubers (7. 9 vs. 1. 1 %). Body conditions were comparable between the two treatments. It is estimated that pigs fed restrictedly found approximately 60 % of their energy requirement from foraging in the range and consumed 1. 3 kg to 1. 6 kg DM of JA pig- 1 per day. The results indicate good possibilities for substituting a large proportion of concentrates with home-grown JA tubers biological harvested by foraging pigs. Future studies are needed to reveal the most appropriate concentrate feeding regime when combined with foraging JA in relation to consequences for growth and feed conversion, but also for meat quality, animal health and nutrient balances...|$|R
