30|$|Direct-sequence optical code {{division}} multiple access technology is one efficient and simple way to reduce the multiple access interferences that existed in visible light communication system due to its ease implementation by simply turning the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on and off.

40|$|The {{development}} of distributed systems, parallel computation technology, and Peer-to-Peer systems facilitates {{the realization of}} a distributed interactive world model. Thereby, we can implement a worldwide distributed simulation and virtual community, e. g., city traffic simulation and Massively Multiuser Virtual Environments (MMVE). In this thesis, we present Content-Addressable Network for Simulations (CANS), {{which is based on}} CAN. Thus, it incorporates all the advantages of CAN, such as self-organization, scalability, and fault-tolerance. The peers in CANS carry out the simulation for the zone assigned to them, and the zones are allocated {{in such a way that}} there is as little communication between the peers as possible. We propose two approaches for reorganizing zone-assignments after peers churn. These approaches are based on the distributed tree structure and prefix code. In comparison to existing approaches, our proposed approaches are more efficient and reliable. Since CANS is used to simulate “city traffic” and MMVE, it requires a low-dimensional key space, i. e., a two-dimensional or three-dimensional key space. Thus, we propose CAN tree routing and <b>zone</b> <b>code</b> routing, both of which adopt long links. CAN tree routing has a hierarchical design that is based on the CAN tree. Each peer equips two long links on average. <b>Zone</b> <b>code</b> routing is based on B*-tree. Each peer equips long links and shares the load evenly. Both of these routing solutions achieve routing hops on average. Consequently, the existing CAN can be optimized to perform simulations efficiently and reliably...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes {{the real}} time {{implementation}} of CDMA, a multiple access technique, which brings forth the complete bandwidth usage by spreading {{the data of}} same transmitted power, over the whole bandwidth thereby ensuring safe communication and preventing the occurrence of jamming. GNU Radio is a software defined radio which puts experiments into practice using software rather than the normal hardware implementation. Blocks for data spreading, code despreading with and without code tracking are created using Zero Correlation <b>Zone</b> <b>code</b> (ZCZ, a combination of ternary codes that is 1, 0 and - 1 which is specified in the program). Thus the real time implementation of CDMA checks the feasibility of an asynchronous multiuser communication among users with good results...|$|R

It bases on “CAN Tree Routing for Content- Addressable Network” 1 which is a solution for peer-to-peer routing. We concentrated on coordinate routing in this paper. The key idea of our approach is a recursion process to calculate target <b>zone</b> <b>code</b> and search in CAN tree 1. Because the hops are via long links in CAN, it enhances routing flexibility and robustness against failures. Nodes automatically adapt routing table to cope with network change. The routing complexity is, which {{is much better than}} a uniform greedy routing, while each node maintains two long links in average...|$|R
