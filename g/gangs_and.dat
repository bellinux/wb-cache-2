40|$|An Arizona {{drug control}} {{strategy}} was initially developed in 1987 with extensive input from local, state, {{and federal officials}} and agencies. Through the years, the drug control strategy was updated, refined, and expanded to include <b>gang</b> <b>and</b> violent crime. The first multi-year strategy was released in 2000 and continued for three years, followed by a four-year strategy developed in 2004 and a subsequent strategy in 2008. Drug, <b>gang</b> <b>and</b> violent crime {{continue to be a}} persistent threat to the public safety and health of Arizonans. Through granting millions of dollars in federal and state funds to address drug, <b>gang</b> <b>and</b> violent crime, the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission serves an integral role in responding to the problem.

The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music.|$|E
5|$|In September 1949, Mirta {{gave birth}} to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat. Castro {{continued}} to put himself at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the Partido Ortodoxo. The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13, exposing the government's secret deals with the <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> identifying key members. Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered the <b>gangs,</b> <b>and</b> Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.|$|E

Johnson published works championing the rights of slaves, Jews, women, prisoners, Dissenters, chimney sweeps, abused animals, university students forbidden from marrying, victims of press <b>gangs,</b> <b>and</b> those unjustly accused of violating the game laws.|$|E
5|$|Susan Eloise Hinton (better {{known as}} S. E. Hinton) is an American author who {{is best known}} for writing young adult fiction. The Outsiders was Hinton's first {{published}} book in 1967; Hinton wrote the book at the age of seventeen. Hinton based the characters, the Greasers and the Socs, off of teenage <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> alienated youth in her hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma during the 1960s. The Outsiders has sold over fourteen million copies since it was published. In 1983, The Outsiders became a movie, and was later released onto DVD. After experiencing a writer's block and going into a state of depression, Hinton met somebody in her freshmen biology class, who inspired her to continue writing.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore {{was home}} to a major doo wop scene {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are {{considered}} one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore {{was home to}} numerous African American vocal groups, and talent scouts scoured the city for the next big stars. Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street <b>gangs,</b> <b>and</b> some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a rough boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.|$|E

5|$|Edward was {{responsible}} for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials. It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice, but {{he appears to have}} involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322. Edward made extensive use of Roman civil law during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning the established principles of the English Common Law. Edward was also criticised by contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although just how widely they did so is unclear. Amid the political turbulence, armed <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> violence spread across England under Edward's reign, destabilising the position of many of the local gentry; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus proved {{themselves}} to be as incompetent as Caesar had hoped. Clodius terrorized the city with his armed <b>gangs,</b> <b>and</b> agitated Pompey {{to such a degree}} that Pompey was able to secure the passage of a law in 57 BC which recalled Cicero from his exile. This was more of a triumph for the senate than it was for Pompey, however, since Pompey was allied with Caesar. Pompey was so inept that the senate decided to override him, and rescind the land laws that Caesar had passed in 59 BC for Pompey's veterans. This forced a renewal of the triumvirate: Pompey and Crassus were promised the Consulship in 55 BC and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, soon died in childbirth, and a year later, Crassus was killed during his invasion of the Parthian Empire. These two events severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.|$|E
5|$|The sociopolitical {{atmosphere}} of Chicago {{was one of}} ethnic tension caused by competition among many new groups. With the Great Migration, thousands of African Americans from the South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side, near jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking plants. The Irish had been established first, and fiercely defended their territory and political power against all newcomers. Post World War I tensions caused frictions between the races, especially in the competitive labor and housing markets. Overcrowding and increased African American militancy by veterans contributed to the visible racial frictions. Also, a combination of ethnic <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> police neglect strained the racial relationships. According to official reports, the turmoil came to a boil {{after the death of}} an African American youth who had accidentally drifted into a swimming area at an informally segregated beach. Tensions between groups arose in a melee that blew up into days of unrest.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing that violence is not the solution to their problems.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 3 April 1888, {{following}} the Easter Monday bank holiday, prostitute Emma Elizabeth Smith was assaulted and robbed {{at the junction}} of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, {{in the early hours}} of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the London Hospital, where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. She developed peritonitis and died at 9am on 4 April 1888. The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims. The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught. Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper, but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang. Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. Prostitutes were often managed by <b>gangs,</b> <b>and</b> Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation. She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal, and her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings.|$|E
25|$|Neither Nicaragua nor {{the city}} of Managua have major gang problems, in {{comparison}} to some of its regional neighbors. The number of gang members was estimated at 4,500 throughout the country, lower than all of its Northern neighbors in the region except Belize.

In 1991, there were 110 gangs in Managua, in 2001 the number of gangs reduced to 96 gangs {{with a total of}} 1,725 members. Over the next 3–4years the number of <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> gang members both decreased and increased. In late 2005 the number of <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> members decreased significantly to 34 <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> their 706 members in Managua, these represented 38% and 32% of the national total of <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> its members.
