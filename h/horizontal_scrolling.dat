5|$|Defender {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of purely <b>horizontal</b> <b>scrolling</b> shooters. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{developed}} its own breakthrough {{hit with}} the release of 1980's Defender, whose gameplay, <b>horizontal</b> <b>scrolling,</b> and dynamic color influenced many subsequent games. It was followed by a sequel in 1981, Stargate, and a group of popular and influential titles: Joust, , Sinistar, and the licensed Moon Patrol. With the exception of Sinistar, these were widely ported to home systems by external developers and publishers including Atari, Inc.|$|E
