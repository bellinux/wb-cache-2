40|$|A {{generalized}} {{least squares}} method for deducing both total ozone and aerosol extinction spectrum parameters from <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> <b>measurements</b> was developed. An error analysis applied to this system indicates {{that there is little}} advantage to additional measurements once a sufficient number of line pairs have been employed to solve for the selected detail in the attenuation model. It is shown that when there is a predominance of small particles (less than about 0. 35 microns in diameter) the total ozone from the standard AD system is too high by about one percent. When larger particles are present the derived total ozone may be an overestimate or an underestimate but serious errors occur only for narrow polydispersions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Global {{variations}} in stratospheric ozone and lower stratospheric temperature are documented {{for the period}} 1991 - 1994, following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991. Column ozone measurements are from the {{total ozone mapping spectrometer}} instruments on the Nimbus 7 and Meteor 3 satellites, together with solar backscattered ultraviolet data from NOAA 11; these satellite ozone data are validated by comparisons with ground-based <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> <b>measurements.</b> Ozone profile data from the halogen occultation experiment and microwave limb sounder instruments on the upper atmosphere research satellite are also analyzed. Satellite temperature data are from the microwave sounding unit channel 4, representing a mean of the 150 - to 50 -mbar layer. The ozone observations show substantial decreases in column ozone (of order 5 - 10 %) over large regions of the globe; largest losses are observed in northern hemisphere middle-high latitudes during winter-spring of each year (largest in 1992 - 1993), over southern hemisphere high latitudes in spring 1993, and episodically over the tropics during 1991 - 1993. Temperatures are anomalously warm (by order 1 K) over 30 øN-S for 1 to 2 years following the eruption. Significant cold anomalies are also observed over the northern hemisphere polar cap during summer 1993, a result probably related to the decreased ozone levels throughout 1993. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study mainly {{focuses on}} the {{validation}} of total column (TC) ozone data derived from the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) on board the NASA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite (NPP). OMPS is an advanced suite of three hyperspectral instruments that maps global ozone {{on a daily basis}} and extends the more than 30 yr total ozone and ozone profile records. The algorithm used to derive OMPS TC ozone is adapted from the heritage of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Version 7 algorithm but with a number of enhancements. Validation is primarily performed through comparisons with an ensemble of 74 global distributed Brewer and <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> <b>measurements.</b> Linear regression performs fair agreement between OMPS TC ozone and ground-based TC ozone measurements with root mean square error (RMSE) around of 3 % (10 DU). Comparison shows that OMPS TC ozone estimates 0. 21 % higher than Brewer measurements average, with station-to-station standard deviation of 3. 14 %. As comparing with Dobson measurements, OMPS TC ozone averages 0. 86 % higher than the station average with standard deviation of 3. 05 %. The relative differences between OMPS and ground TC ozone were analysed varying with latitude and time as well as viewing geometry respectively. Comparisons show relative differences within 2 % over most of latitude and viewing conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ozone layer}} is under threat due to warming in the {{troposphere}} {{brought about by}} the increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations. Warming in the troposphere makes the stratosphere cooler, producing polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) that support chemical reactions that produce active chlorine which destroys ozone. Ozone measurements and analyses with different instrument platforms (satellite-borne and ground-based) must still be performed as they remain essential even with the signing of the Montréal Protocol. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) contributes to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) [2006 - 2013] by measuring daily total ozone column using a <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer.</b> Maximum amount of ozone was observed during the northern hemisphere summer period and minimum throughout the northern hemisphere winter due to unequal solar radiation which is a factor for ozone production. The differences between satellite-borne and ground-based ozone measuring instruments were investigated and it was found out that the measurements vary due to local weather events, solar zenith angle, sky conditions, and the relatively large footprint of the satellites.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the susceptibility of the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> No. 118 to stray light interference. In this regard, {{a series of}} total ozone content measurements were carried out in Athens, Greece for air-mass values (μ) extending up to μ = 5. The monochromatic-heterochromatic stray light derived by Basher's model was used in order to evaluate the specific instrumental parameters which determine if this instrument suffers from this problem or not. The results obtained indicate that the measurements made by the Dobson instrument of the Athens station for air mass values up to 2. 5, underestimates the total ozone content by 3. 5 DU in average, or about 1 % of the station's mean total ozone content (TOC). The comparison {{of the values of}} the same parameters measured 15 years ago with the present ones indicates the good maintenance of the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> No. 118. This fact is of crucial importance because the variability of the daily total ozone observations collected by the Athens Dobson Station since 1989 has proved to be representative to the variability of the mean total ozone observed over the whole mid-latitude zone of the Northern Hemisphere. This stresses the point that the Athens total ozone station, being the unique Dobson station in south-eastern Europe, may be assumed as a ground truth station for the reliable conversion of the satellite radiance observations to total ozone measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Despite the {{extensive}} investigations {{to understand the}} difference between ground-based and space-borne measurements, there still exist differences in total ozone (TO) measured at those two different platforms. Comparisons were carried {{out for the first time}} between TO data obtaiend from the ground based <b>Dobson</b> and Brewer <b>spectrophotometers,</b> and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board EOS-Aura satellite in a megacity site in Northeast Asia. The TO values retrieved by the OMI-DOAS (Differential optical absorption spectroscopy) algorithm tend to be lower than those measured by the ground based sensors in spring and summer as well as the low solar zenith angle condition. We found that such underestimation of the OMI-DOAS TO is caused by tropospheric ozone underestimated by the OMI-DOAS algorithm when tropospheric ozone are significantly enhanced.

40|$|Visible {{spectra of}} the zenith-sky were {{recorded}} at Faraday in Antartica (65 °S) during 1990. Line-of-sight ozone amounts were deduced by fitting laboratory cross-sections to the spectra. At the lattitude of Faraday, visible spectra are more useful than the u. v. wavelengths {{used by the}} <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer,</b> because they permit observations of ozone throughout the winter {{when the sun is}} too low in elevation for useful measurements with the Dobson. In order to find the accuracy of the visible-light system for the determination of medium- and long-term trends in ozone, Langley plots of the ozone amounts were examined to determine the stability of the offset to the zero of the ozone measurement. The plots revealed changes which correlated with shifts in wavelength of the spectrometer. This allowed the use of wavelength shift as a surrogate for offset, fortunate because the use of Langley plots to determine the offset on an individual day from zenith-sky spectra at high latitudes is unreliable. The standard deviation of the ratios of total ozone measured on the same day at Faraday by the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> and the visible spectrometer was 10 % using offsets calculated from wavelength shifts. This is 4 % less than the standard deviation using a straight-line fit to the offsets.
