40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we propose a new theory of the <b>Gestalt</b> <b>law</b> of good continuation. In this theory perceptual {{processes}} are modeled by an exponential pyramid algorithm. To test the new theory we performed three experiments. The subject's task was to detect a target (a set of dots arranged along a straight or curved line) among background dots. Detectability was high when: (a) the target was long; (b) the density of target dots relative to the density of background dots was large; (c) the local change of angle was small along the entire line; (d) local properties of the target were known to the subject. These results are consistent with our new model and they contradict prior models. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The new screen designs were then evaluated by asking students and others to compare the designs.

40|$|AbstractAs {{expressed}} in the <b>Gestalt</b> <b>law</b> of good continuation, human perception tends to associate stimuli that form smooth continuations. Contextual modulation in primary visual cortex, {{in the form of}} association fields, is believed {{to play an important role}} in this process. Yet a unified and principled account of the good continuation law on the neural level is lacking. In this study we introduce a population model of primary visual cortex. Its contextual interactions depend on the elastica curvature energy of the smoothest contour connecting oriented bars. As expected, this model leads to association fields consistent with data. However, in addition the model displays tilt-illusions for stimulus configurations with grating and single bars that closely match psychophysics. Furthermore, the model explains not only pop-out of contours amid a variety of backgrounds, but also pop-out of single targets amid a uniform background. We thus propose that elastica is a unifying principle of the visual cortical network...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the applicability of}} the Gestalt principle of perceptual grouping by proximity in the haptic modality. To do so, we {{investigated the}} influence of element proximity on haptic contour detection. In the course of four sessions ten participants performed a haptic contour detection task in which they freely explored a haptic random dot display that contained a contour in 50 % of the trials. A contour was defined by a higher density of elements (raised dots), relative to the background surface. Proximity of the contour elements as well as the average proximity of background elements was systematically varied. We hypothesized that if proximity of contour elements influences haptic contour detection, detection will be more likely when contour elements are in closer proximity. This should be irrespective of the ratio with the proximity of the background elements. Results showed indeed that the closer the contour elements were, the higher the detection rates. Moreover, this was the case independent of the contour/background ratio. We conclude that the <b>Gestalt</b> <b>law</b> of proximity applies to haptic contour detection. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} contour {{detector}} which performs global {{analysis of the}} input image, in order to discriminate between texture edges and object contours. We introduce a new morphological operator, called adaptive pseudo-dilation (APD), which uses context dependent structuring elements {{in order to identify}} long curvilinear structures in the edge map. We show that grouping edge pixels as the connected components of the output of APD results in a good agreement with the <b>gestalt</b> <b>law</b> of good continuation (GLGC). The novelty of this operator is that dilation is limited to the Voronoi cell of each edge pixel. An efficient implementation of APD is provided. The grouping algorithm is then embedded in a multi-threshold contour detector. At each threshold level, small groups of edges are removed, and contours are completed by means of a generalized reconstruction from markers. The use of different thresholds makes the algorithm less sensitive to the values of the input parameters. Both qualitative and quantitative comparison with existing approaches prove the superiority of the proposed contour detector in terms of larger amount of suppressed texture and more effective detection of low-contrast contours...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows a new {{approach}} to significantly improve the runtime behaviour of existing object pose detection algorithms. The idea of anticipation-preprocessing is to reduce possible object poses up to a minimum by limiting the solution space. The assumption is that a smaller solution space comes along with a much faster evaluation. Anticipation-preprocessing starts with the most obvious features of sensory input. The treatment of features takes <b>gestalt</b> <b>law</b> of organization into account. Based on that, the procedure is to find new features and to keep recombining them. With the aid of the achieved feature sets a conclusion about a solution subspace can be drawn. Anticipation-preprocessing is inspired by human visual perception, whereof several theories exist.

Using a computer-controlled self-testing procedure, we trained baboons (Papio papio) to discriminate open versus closed shapes presented on a touch screen with a two-alternative forced choice procedure. Ten baboons (OPEN + group) were trained with the open shapes serving as the positive stimulus (S+), and nine others (CLOSE + group) were trained with the closed shape serving as S+. The OPEN + group obtained higher discrimination performance than the CLOSE + group (Exp 1), but its scores declined when new line segments {{were added to the}} stimuli (Exp 2) and after smoothing the end points of the open shapes (Exp 3). The CLOSE + group was less affected by the above manipulations of local stimulus dimension, but its performance was disrupted when the collinearity end points was reduced (Exp 3). Use of a visual search task revealed that the search for an open shape among closed distractors was less attention demanding in baboons than the search for a closed shape among open ones (Exp 4). It is concluded that (1) end lines rather than closeness per se are perceptual primitives for the open versus closed discrimination in baboons, and (2) the relative emphasis on local or configural cues when processing contour closure depends on experiential factors in baboons and is thus subject to interindividual variations...|$|R

Both approaches are configurable and provide means of modeling SCD in a scalar and directional way.
