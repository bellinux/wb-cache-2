The string will almost always be fixed in place {{by at least one}} production packer. If the packer is retrievable it can be released easily enough and pulled out with the completion string. If it is permanent, then it is common to cut the tubing just above it and pull out the upper portion of the string. If necessary, the packer and the tubing left in hole can be milled out, though more commonly, the new completion will make use of it by setting a new packer just above it and running new tubing down {{to the top of the}} old.|$|E
40|$|Liquid loading is {{a problem}} in many gas wells {{especially}} older and depleted type reservoirs. If steps are not taken to minimize this effect, it will severely limit the production or even "kill" the well. This is the result of insufficient transport energy in the gas phase to carry the liquid that will accumulate around the well bore. This accumulation exerts a backpressure that restricts reservoir inflow performance. Reducing the flow area of a gas well's existing production string increases flow velocity and improves the ability to unload liquids. The most economical method is to install coiled tubing inside the existing tubing string that can be done without <b>killing</b> <b>the</b> <b>well...</b>|$|E

40|$|Oil and gas {{continue}} to be widely used worldwide as energy resources, because new sources of safe energy {{have not yet been}} well developed. These conditions have motivated researchers in the area of oil and gas production to investigate new approaches to the application of optimization methods to maximize gas or oil production rates and to minimize production costs. This PhD research investigates production optimization of conventional and unconventional reservoirs by considering compositional and black-oil reservoir fluid properties and presents economic evaluation in terms of a net present value (NPV) formulation. In general, unconventional reservoirs are characterized by large volumes that are difficult to develop since the permeability is low (< 0. 1 mD). A new approach to NPV calculation is introduced in which NPV is taken as the maximum cumulative NPV and not always the value {{at the end of the}} simulation. The maximum cumulative NPV has correlation with optimum field operation time using current production and/or injection strategy. The proposed method provides an advantage in determining when a new production strategy and/or management decision should be applied after the optimum field operation time is reached. Three new approaches related to oil and gas production performance will be presented in this thesis: (i) a cyclic shut-in strategy for liquid-loading gas wells, (ii) production optimization using an integrated model from subsurface to surface facilities, which is then linked to an economic analysis, and (iii) an optimal injection strategy for oil reservoirs when water and gas injection are available. A framework for decision support tools, based on available software, is implemented and a derivative-free optimization method, the Nelder-Mead Simplex, is applied. A cyclic shut-in strategy for liquid-loading gas wells in unconventional gas reservoirs has been studied. An unconventional reservoir is a potential future energy resource offered by new methods of exploration and production. One of the characteristics of an unconventional gas reservoir is low permeability, in which a gas well producing reservoir fluids usually experiences a liquid-loading condition during production. This condition is caused by accumulation of liquid at the bottom of the well, where an increasing liquid column in the well results in hydrostatic back-pressure to the reservoir, destabilizing the multiphase flow in the well, decreasing the gas production rate, and finally <b>killing</b> <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> A cyclic shut-in strategy is introduced to reduce the loss of gas production by increasing the reservoir pressure and gas production thereby will able to push the liquid column up to the surface. The simulation results show consistently that ultimate recovery increases, for both vertical and horizontal fractured wells. An integrated field model and optimization may play an important role during production because an integrated model may produce comprehensive operational recommendations. An integrated field model combined with optimization presents many technological challenges in terms efficient algorithms to couple models, as well as models with optimization, and sufficient hardware capability to run the complex model. A benchmark case which consists of three different reservoirs that are linked to a surface facility model has been developed. The surface process model interacts with the three reservoir models through the distribution of available produced gas for reinjection into the three reservoirs. The reservoir and surface process variables are optimized in terms of maximizing asset value. The integrated model and corresponding optimization results provide a benchmark that contributes to academic and industrial knowledge on the potential value of joint optimization of the upstream and downstream parts of the production chain. The benchmark should be valuable as a tool for assessing future alternative methods for production chain optimization. An optimal injection strategy for miscible water alternating gas injection is presented as a mixed-integer non-linear problem formulation. A heuristic approach is chosen to solve the problem. The injection strategies include gas injection, water injection, WAG, and a combination of the above injection strategies. The injection strategies are optimized to find the best injection strategy for a particular reservoir. The optimization was conducted for two production strategies: artificial lift and natural flow. The study concluded that a gas-water injection strategy with long-time gas injection and artificial lift was the best scenario for the example used in this study. The artificial lift economic value was significantly better than natural flow optimization scenarios, with an NPV increase of 8 - 31 %. Moreover, the injection optimization method presented in this study should have significance potential for other miscible oil reservoirs. PhD i teknisk kybernetikkPhD in Engineering Cybernetic...|$|E
40|$|Well control can {{in short}} words be {{described}} as the core for human safety on board a platform or a rig. It includes a variety of elements that go under the name barrier elements that are in place to prevent an unwanted inflow of formation fluids. They need to be functional in order to fulfil their purpose. Elements are made, controlled and replaced by people, it is therefore vital that the people working with them knows how they work in order to detect failure so they can be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. It is also important that everyone working in a drilling operation knows what well control is and the different scenarios that can develop if one should emerge. On the Norwegian Continental Shelf the number one priority from the authorities are safety, this is what the industry chases in pursuit for black gold and high rewards. To secure their investment guidelines, procedures and standards are provided to the industry and it is required that the people working there knows what they say, understand them and work according to them. In this way everything is done {{to make sure that all}} operations are successful operations. This high safety focus ensures that workers can go home from work in the same physical condition as when they went to work in the morning, or when they left for their offshore period 14 days earlier. The different well control methods are used for different situations depending on a variety of factors. This might be what depth the incident happened at, drill string position, personnel competence, and platform capacities to mention a few. For the Driller`s method (DM) and Weight and Wait (W&W) method, in many ways they use the same operational procedures when <b>killing</b> <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> but the thing that separates them from each other are when kill mud gets introduced into the system. Time consumption are also another aspect that separates them, where W&W uses less time compare to DM. W&W can also have an positive advantage, if the kill mud enters the annulus before the kick reaches the casing shoe, then it will be able to reduce the pressure from the kick acting on the casing shoe due to its heavier weight. The Volumetric method and Bullheading method may be the best choice if the drill string is high up or out of the well, if the competence among the personnel is too low to perform a conventional kill method (DM and W&W), or if there are limitation within the equipment to handle the kick on surface etc. In these cases the Volumetric or Bullheading method may be the best choice when killing a well. The selection of mud in the system is also an element related to well control, and knowing the different behaviour between WBM and OBM in the event of a kick is crucial and very important. To know the behaviour increases the chances of detecting a kick early and before it escalates into a large kick. In WBM, when a gas kick enter the wellbore it will occupy annulus space which can be observed at surface as pit gain. However, there is another process developing in the OBM, here the gas gets dissolved into the OBM and the chances of detecting this at surface are small. Also, also if the mud is stationary the kick will also be stationary until circulation starts up again. When the circulation starts up the dissolved gas moves upwards in the annulus together with the mud, nothing happens, not until the well pressure gets reduced to the extent that it reaches the boiling pressure of the gas, or the flash point. What happen is that gas goes out of suspension and back into free gas, this will lead to a rapid displacement of mud, and the result can lead to, if they are unable to trap it in the well and it moves past the BOP, a surface blowout with unpleasant consequences. With today`s search for more and remote black gold, drilling gets deeper along with more complex well paths which reduces the margins for errors. This increases focus and requirements to personnel`s experience and knowledge, and are one of the most important factor in terms of reducing the risk and consequence if an incident should happen. One intention with this thesis is to shed light on different elements related to well control, in this way it is possible to increase the overall understanding a bit more. The second intention with the thesis is to give a broader understanding of four well control methods used today. Two of them will have a higher focus than the rest. Also the importance of knowing and understanding well control calculations is elaborated by calculation examples for several different well scenarios. Also different platform types are used for distinguishing between the different methods. Hopefully the thesis will contribute to a broader understanding of well control...|$|E
