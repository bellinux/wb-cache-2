2500|$|The AE75 engine, a [...] {{inverted}} three-cylinder water-cooled two-stroke {{unit with}} <b>dual</b> <b>ignition</b> and a 2.7:1 reduction gearbox, was specially {{developed for the}} ARV by Hewland from their existing two-cylinder microlight engine.

Three ARVs were originally manufactured with the MidWest twin-rotor wankel engine.|$|E
2500|$|One {{solution}} to this problem was re-engining with a more reliable engine, and Robin developed a version for the German market powered by a 52.5kW (70hp) Limbach. While the Limbach was also a modified VW car engine, crucially, it had <b>dual</b> <b>ignition</b> instead of the single ignition on the JPX-modified engines normally used, this being certified in 1989. [...] This came too late, however, and production ended in 1991 after the completion of 132 aircraft, of which 10 were powered by the Limbach engine.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{application}} of lean homogeneous combustion in SI engines using a passive SCR after treatment system. By implementing this concept a decrease in fuel consumption and engine out NOx is expected. The data and results are obtained through engine experiments. Under lean conditions the ignition system faces harder conditions, in order to reliably ignite a lean fuel/air mixture an advanced ignition system is necessary. A literature study revealed that among, standard <b>ignition,</b> <b>dual</b> coil <b>ignition,</b> laser ignition, corona ignition and pre-chamber ignition the pre-chamber ignition system was capable of igniting the highest diluted mixture. The corona system however was second best and {{does not require a}} modification to the engine. The <b>dual</b> coil <b>ignition</b> system was installed on a multi-cylinder engine. This system uses a standard spark plug but by firing two coils in consecutive order a long duration spark is created. By applying this system and optimizing the timing of the existing adjustable cam shafts for lean conditions, substantial decreases in fuel consumption and NOx were achieved. Another part of this thesis {{is about the}} after treatment system. An ammonia formation catalyst produces ammonia under rich engine conditions and stores it. The ammonia in its turn reacts with NOx when the engine operates lean. The ammonia formation catalyst was tested under lab-scale and real engine conditions. It was shown that taken the differences in set-up into account the lab-scale tested catalysts showed good similarities with the engine-scale tests...|$|R
2500|$|The Praga B2 was a <b>dual</b> <b>ignition,</b> {{air-cooled}} horizontal twin producing 40 horsepower (30kW) {{aimed at}} lightweight aircraft. [...] It was a higher compression version (6.7:1 {{from the earlier}} 5.72:1) of the original and otherwise very similar Praga B, which provided 36hp (27kW). [...] Its cylinders were machined from alloy steel forgings and had aluminium alloy heads. The pistons were of aluminium alloy, with three compression rings and one scraper ring. The connecting rods were of nitrided steel, with divided big ends and bronze bushes at the little ends. The one piece crankshaft was also formed from nitrided steel and had two main roller bearings and a single ball thrust bearing. The single piece crankcase was cast from an aluminium alloy.|$|E
2500|$|E.N.V.'s V-8 engines {{appeared}} in six different models. [...] Most {{of these were}} identified by a letter, though contemporary sources often refer to them by power. [...] The assignment of the letters C, D, F and T is known from contemporary sources. The one type known to have pre-dated the C has been assigned the letter A by a later historian, a notation followed here. [...] The last engine is usually known as the 1914 100hp E.N.V. [...] The physical details of all the engines, such as bore and stroke etc. are known from both contemporary records and surviving examples. [...] There were also variations within types, as development proceeded. Nonetheless, all the V-8s had much in common. [...] They all had their cylinder banks separated by 90°, leaving space within the V for inlet manifolds and valvegear. [...] All were water-cooled; each cylinder was enclosed with an electrolytically formed copper jacket. Initially these were produced with {{a variant of the}} lost wax process. [...] The cylinders were coated with wax, which was then coated with black lead to make it electrically conductive and copper plated. [...] Afterwards the wax was removed by heating. [...] Later, the insulating wax was replaced with electrically conducting, low melting point white metal, simplifying the process. [...] Pistons were made of steel, with cast iron rings, and the crankcases were cast aluminium. [...] There was one plug per cylinder, supplied by a gear-driven magneto alone or with an additional battery-driven ignition coil and distributor for <b>dual</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|E

2500|$|To {{simplify the}} engine and reduce costs, the V-twin {{ignition}} was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor.
