5000|$|The {{fixed jaw}} is {{attached}} to the shaft with a pivot pin so that the entire <b>jaw</b> <b>assembly</b> can rotate about an axis perpendicular to the shaft. This permits the jaws to be rotated over the end of the shaft {{so that they can be}} [...] "flipped" [...] over, to allow the tool to be used to either tighten or loosen a fastener. Mechanical stops limit this rotation to 180° so that when the jaws assembly is resting at a stop, the jaws will be perpendicular to the shaft and thus aligned to the fastener. When the shaft is held in a vertical orientation, the jaws are automatically held against the stop by gravity. Basin wrenches are available with both fixed-length and telescopic handles.|$|E
40|$|A self-latching <b>jaw</b> <b>assembly</b> is {{described}} {{which includes a}} pair of jaws for latching a fitting of an associated structure such as the keel fitting of a space telescope. The <b>jaw</b> <b>assembly</b> automatically locates the fitting received on a positioning pedestal and latches it in its original location on the pedestal without need of precision alignment. The first jaw is actuated {{and moved to the}} right whereupon a reciprocating plunger, extended from the nose of the jaw senses the hub of the spool. A jaw position responsive switch is then actuated to terminate the drive motor of the jaw. The astronaut will then actuate the drive motor of the jaw and the jaw will move to the left, whereupon the standoff will engage the face of the jaw in a latching position. In the latching position, the noses of the jaws will be under the flanges of the spool...|$|E
40|$|Phase II collimators will {{complement}} {{the existing system}} to improve the expected high RF impedance and limited efficiency of Phase I jaws. An international collaborative effort has been launched to identify novel advanced materials responding to the very challenging requirements of the new collimators. Complex numerical calculations simulating extreme conditions and experimental tests are in progress. In parallel, an innovative modular design concept of the <b>jaw</b> <b>assembly</b> is being developed to allow fitting in alternative materials, minimizing the thermally induced deformations, withstanding accidents and accepting high radiation doses. Phase II <b>jaw</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is made up of}} a molybdenum back-stiffener ensuring high geometrical stability and a modular jaw split in threes sectors. Each sector is equipped with a high-efficiency independent cooling circuit. Beam position monitors (BPM) are embedded in the jaws to fasten setup time and improve beam monitoring. An adjustment system will permit to fine-tune the jaw flatness just before commissioning the system. A full scale collimator prototype is being manufactured by CERN workshops to validate each feature of the new design...|$|E
40|$|A pair of <b>jaw</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{simultaneously}} {{driven in}} opposed reciprocation {{by a single}} shaft has oppositely threaded sections to automatically center delicate or brittle workpieces such as lithium fluoride crystal beneath the blade of a crystal cleaving machine. Both <b>jaw</b> <b>assemblies</b> are suspended above the vise bed {{by a pair of}} parallel guide shafts attached to the vise bed. Linear rolling bearings, fitted around the guide shafts and firmly held by opposite ends of the <b>jaw</b> <b>assemblies,</b> provide rolling friction between the guide shafts and the <b>jaw</b> <b>assemblies.</b> A belleville washer {{at one end of the}} drive shaft and thrust bearings at both drive shaft ends hold the shaft in compression between the vise bed, thereby preventing wobble of the <b>jaw</b> <b>assemblies</b> due to wear between the shaft and vise bed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a robot periphery prototyped for the six-degrees-of-freedom robotic dental testing simulator, simulating the wear of materials on dental components, such as individual teeth, crowns, bridges, or {{a full set}} of teeth. The robot periphery consists of the artificial jaws and compliance module. The jaws have been reverse engineered and represent a human-like mandible and maxilla with artificial teeth. Each clinically fabricated tooth consists of a crown and glass ceramic roots which are connected using resin cement. Normal clinical occlusion of the artificial <b>jaws</b> <b>assembly</b> was emulated by a dental articulator based on ‘Andrew’s six keys to occlusion’. The radii of the von Spee curve, the Monson curve, and the Wilson curve were also measured as important jaw characteristic indicators to aid normal occlusion. A compliance module had to be built between the lower jaw and the robot platform to sustain the fluctuating forces that occur during normal chewing in the occlusal contact areas, where these high bite forces are major causes of dental component failure. A strain gauge force transducer has been integrated into the machined lower jaw, underneath the second molars, to measure axial biting forces applied to the posterior teeth. The experiments conducted have shown that the sensor is able to sense small changes in the compression force satisfactorily, when applied perpendicular to the occlusal surfaces of the teeth...|$|R
50|$|A {{basin wrench}} {{consists}} of a long shaft {{with a pair of}} asymmetrical jaws at one end and a transverse handle at the other end. The two <b>jaws</b> form an <b>assembly</b> in which the jaws are joined with a pivot pin. One of the jaws is fixed relative to the shaft, and the other is curved and spring-loaded relative to the fixed jaw so that it will automatically close and grip the fastener. When the shaft is turned in the direction that causes the curved jaw to trail the pivot pin, the jaws will increase their grip on the fastener as shaft torque increases, thereby allowing the operator to apply torque to the fastener without slippage. The transverse handle passes through a loosely fitting hole in the shaft {{so that it can be}} shifted to conform to tight spaces or to elongate it so as to increase leverage.|$|R
40|$|A {{power saw}} is {{disclosed}} for space or robotic operations with jaw members for clamping to {{a work piece}} by an operation of a lever arm. The saw assembly is slidably mounted on the <b>jaw</b> <b>assembly</b> and fed into the work piece by a hand operated feed screw. The saw assembly includes a motor and gear belt. A current sensing circuit provides a current signal which actuates colored lights to visually depict the load on the saw blade during the cutting operations...|$|E
40|$|Assembly devices {{fitted with}} {{industrial}} robots for assembling tubes are known. The robots handle individual tube parts; in a further work step, fittings are mounted onto the assembled tube parts and secured. With the new tube assembly device, the tube will be automatically assembled in one work step and secured in its position. Since a magazine for fittings is integrated {{in the assembly}} device, and the tube {{in the form of}} an endless tube is fed to the gripper <b>jaws</b> of the <b>assembly</b> device and can be separated at the required length by means of a separating device, the tube can be fully assembled in one work step by one single tool. As a result, the tube connection can be simply positioned and secured in its position without difficulty. This step is performed fully automatically by one single tool after the tube jointing process. The tube assembly device is used for automatic assembly of unshaped, endless tubes without a branch...|$|R
