40|$|Since 1977, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) has {{required}} that federally insured banking institutions be evaluated on their records of helping {{to meet the}} credit needs of their local communities. In 1995, the agencies responsible for bank supervision substantially revised the regulations that implement the CRA. The revisions were intended to emphasize performance rather than process, to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, and to increase consistency in CRA evaluations. Since 1995, "large" institutions, generally those with assets of $ 250 million or more, have been evaluated under a three-part test, whereas "small" institutions, generally those with assets of less than $ 250 million, {{have been subject to}} comparatively streamlined evaluations.; In 2004 and 2005, the agencies put forth several proposals to extend the <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> streamlined <b>examinations</b> and an exemption from data reporting to more institutions by raising the asset-size threshold from $ 250 million to $ 500 million or $ 1 billion. A related issue that the agencies raised was how to define which bank activities in rural areas should be considered community development in CRA evaluations. In this article, the authors, having evaluated data to gain insight into the potential effects of these proposals, report the findings of their research. Community Reinvestment Act of 1977...|$|R

30|$|Globally, {{the number}} of {{patients}} with diabetes has been increasing rapidly and become a significant health care burden to each country. As a result of the complex nature of this disease process, patients with diabetes require comprehensive management and support. However, limited numbers of physicians alone cannot cope with the significant increase in {{the number of}} diabetic patients in recent years. Therefore, developing health care professionals who apply detailed knowledge and skills in diabetes care and can be members of interprofessional teams, such as certified diabetes educators (CDEs), is a pressing need. The certified diabetes educator of Japan (CDEJ) is a qualification awarded to a nurse, dietitian, pharmacist, clinical laboratory technician, or physical therapist possessing wide specialist knowledge on diabetes. CDEJs have passed the required examinations and been approved by the Japanese Certification Board for Diabetes Educators established in 2000 (Kawaguchi 2007). Currently, there are nearly 18, 400 CDEJs, mostly nurses (47.8 %), dietitians (23.6 %), and pharmacists (15.0 %) (Certification Board for Diabetes Educators in Japan 2014). In addition, there are CDEs who play active roles in local areas, called local certified diabetes educators (LCDE). LCDEs are developed and qualified in a manner befitting the conditions of an individual local area. Compared to CDEJ, the LCDE qualification has less stringent <b>eligibility</b> requirements <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> and a wide range of medical professions can apply for it; therefore, the number of LCDEs has been increasing and contributing to improvement in diabetes care in local areas. Although incorporating diabetes educators into clinical services is expected to improve clinical and quality of life outcomes for persons with diabetes (Burke et al. 2014) and many healthcare professionals recognize the need for more diabetes educators such as diabetes specialist nurses (Peyrot et al. 2013), levels of perception and satisfaction of CDEs themselves for their activities are unclear and often unexpressed. To clarify these points, a questionnaire survey was conducted.|$|R
