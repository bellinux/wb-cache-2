40|$|<b>Get</b> 3, <b>Get</b> 4, and <b>Get</b> 5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{participate}} in the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

We further demonstrate that <b>Get</b> 3 specifically binds to a conserved surface on <b>Get</b> 4 in a nucleotide dependent manner.

40|$|Tail-anchored (TA) proteins, {{defined as}} having a single transmembrane helix at their C terminus, are post-translationally {{targeted}} to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the guided entry of TA proteins (<b>GET)</b> pathway. In yeast, the handover of TA substrates is mediated by the heterotetrameric <b>Get</b> 4 /Get 5 complex (<b>Get</b> 4 / 5), which tethers the co-chaperone Sgt 2 to the targeting factor, the <b>Get</b> 3 ATPase. Binding of <b>Get</b> 4 / 5 to <b>Get</b> 3 is critical for efficient TA targeting; however, questions remain about {{the formation of the}} <b>Get</b> 3 ·Get 4 / 5 complex. Here we report crystal structures of a <b>Get</b> 3 ·Get 4 / 5 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 2. 8 and 6. 0 Å that reveal a novel interface between <b>Get</b> 3 and <b>Get</b> 4 dominated by electrostatic interactions. Kinetic and mutational analyses strongly suggest that these structures represent an on-pathway intermediate that rapidly assembles and then rearranges to the final <b>Get</b> 3 ·Get 4 / 5 complex. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the <b>Get</b> 3 ·Get 4 / 5 complex is dominated by a single <b>Get</b> 4 / 5 heterotetramer bound to one monomer of a <b>Get</b> 3 dimer, uncovering an intriguing asymmetry in the <b>Get</b> 4 / 5 heterotetramer upon <b>Get</b> 3 binding.
