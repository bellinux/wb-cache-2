This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity.

25|$|Agriculture is the {{cultivation}} and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants {{and other products}} used to sustain and enhance human life.

The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science.

25|$|The Earth's {{carrying}} capacity {{is a central}} issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as Thomas Malthus pointed out the finite {{carrying capacity}} of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study Limits to Growth. Diminishing returns suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as erosion, an impending water crisis, and soil salinity (from irrigation) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that <b>industrial</b> <b>agriculture,</b> which exacerbates these problems, is not sustainable agriculture, and are generally inclined favorably to organic farming, which also reduces the output of carbon.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{causes of}} the late-2006 price spikes {{included}} droughts in grain-producing nations and rising oil prices. Oil price increases also caused general escalations in the costs of fertilizers, food transportation, and <b>industrial</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Root causes may be {{the increasing use of}} biofuels in developed countries (see also food vs fuel), and an increasing demand for a more varied diet across the expanding middle-class populations of Asia. The Food and Agriculture Organization also raised concerns about the role of hedge funds speculating on prices leading to major shifts in prices. These factors, coupled with falling world-food stockpiles, all contributed to the worldwide rise in food prices.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{addresses}} the contradictory consequences of expanding agrofuels production on crop land (inflating food prices) and forestland (increasing carbon emissions). Whereas {{the energy crisis}} has strong roots in <b>industrial</b> <b>agriculture’s</b> fossil-fuel dependence, responses to the energy crisis follow a typ-ical capital accumulation script – that is, attempting to overcome barriers to profitability by extending the realm of value creation, even as this intensifies capitalism’s contradictions. The ‘agrofuels project’ is central to this attempt to maintain profit, and to legitimize the state/capital nexus. The rush to agrofuels, {{under the guise of}} policies geared to alternative energy and reducing carbon emissions, opens up new profit frontiers for agribusiness, energy and biotechnology corporations...|$|R
25|$|Green {{biotechnology}} is biotechnology {{applied to}} agricultural processes. An {{example would be}} the selection and domestication of plants via micropropagation.

An example of this would be Bt corn. Whether or not green biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally friendly is a topic of considerable debate.|$|E
25|$|The diet of the {{inhabitants}} of El Paraíso consisted of a mix of domesticated and gathered resources. El Paraíso had a rather simple subsistence economy. There is a high amount of non-domesticated foods found in the archaeological record, which supports that there were sufficient resources that could be hunted or collected. Wild plants such as the roots of sedges, groundcherry and cat tails may have accounted for {{a substantial portion of}} the diet. More than 90% of their protein came from marine resources, predominantly bony fishes and molluscs. Based on minimum number of individuals (MNI) results, the bony fishes mainly consisted of anchovies and the most common molluscs were mussels. There is almost a complete absence of terrestrial fauna found at El Paraíso. The predominance of marine resources may have prevented any need for a complex agricultural subsistence economy. Cotton was cultivated to provide nets for fishing as well as clothing for {{the inhabitants}} of El Paraíso showing a prominence in <b>industrial</b> <b>agriculture</b> in subsistence strategies.|$|E
25|$|Soil management, {{or direct}} human {{interaction}} with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have {{both positive and negative}} effects on local biodiversity. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, <b>industrial</b> <b>agriculture</b> has led to a loss in topsoil. Salinization of the Euphrates River has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria. Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape.|$|E

25|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>agriculture</b> also {{produces}} undesirable environmental effects. Large scale growing operations of commodity crops {{rely on the}} use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Modified corn is a greedy plant that consumes more fertilizer that any other crop. Without either of these, the soil alone could not have supported the large number of hybrid corn plants that helped America’s food industry explode. The production of both synthetic pesticides and fertilizers requires the use of natural gas and petroleum. Currently, it is relatively inexpensive to produce fertilizers and pesticides in this fashion, since the product is efficient and can be produced in huge quantities. Petrochemical fertilizers are preferred over sustainable options (manure) for these reasons. Fossil fuels are also crucial for transportation of product, manufacturing, and for running tractors and harvesting equipment. It is estimated that every bushel of corn requires the equivalent of between one quarter and one third of a U.S. gallon of petroleum to grow (37 to 50 liters per metric ton). For every acre of corn, about 50 U.S. gallons of petroleum are needed (470 L/ha). The use of fossil fuel in farming is standard; without this relatively affordable and convenient fuel source aiding in the fertilization, pest resistance, harvesting and manufacturing corn crops would not meet a high enough yield to satisfy the needs of the farmer or the demands of the consumer.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the river}} basin water data {{available}} from the year 1934 to 1971 (44 years back data), the tribunal estimated the average water yield in the total river basin as 767 TMC which corresponds to 47% dependability. The live storage capacity available in the river basin is nearly 310 TMC which is 40.5% of the average yield. The water used in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is nearly 280 TMC which is the tail end water use in the river basin and its regenerated water either goes to sea or outside the Cauvery basin. The total dissolved salt load generated in the basin is nearly 3.5 million metric tons per year. The estimated salinity or total dissolved salts (TDS) for the water available in Cauvery delta is 441 ppm which {{is close to the}} safe maximum permissible 500 ppm. There is no limit imposed by the tribunal for the ground water use in the river basin. The tribunal has also permitted the basin states to use all the excess water available in above normal water years. Moreover, the river basin population has reached 40 million in the year 2015 and the increasing per capita inorganic salts used/consumed in <b>industrial,</b> <b>agriculture</b> and residential sectors are enhancing the salt export requirements. When adequate salt export from the river basin is not taking place to the sea by forcing Cauvery delta to face water shortage, the water quality (salinity, pH, alkalinity, sodicity, etc.) available for Cauvery delta would deteriorate beyond the permissible limits impeding its sustainable productivity and its aquatic ecosystem conservation. Ultimately salt export criteria is the limitation for the water resources development in a river basin.|$|E
