40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} the structural determinants underlying transport by the glutamate transporter EAAT 1, we mutated each of 24 highly conserved residues (P 392 to Q 415) to cysteine. A {{majority of these}} substituted cysteines react with the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent MTSEA, suggesting that they reside in an aqueous environment. The impermeant reagents MTSES and MTSET react with residues {{at each end of}} the domain (A 395 C and A 414 C), supporting a model that places these residues near the extracellular surface. Substrates and inhibitors block the reaction between MTS derivatives and A 395 C, and the cosubstrate, sodium, slows reaction of MTSEA with Y 405 C and <b>E</b> <b>406</b> C. From these results, we propose that this domain forms a reentrant membrane loop at the cell surface and may comprise part of the translocation pore for substrates and cotransported ions...|$|E

Three amino acid fragments of CSFV NS 5 A, 137 – 172, 224 – 268 and 390 – 414 individually were shown to be essential to NS 5 B binding. The former two fragments were independently necessary for regulation of viral RNA replication and correlated with NS 5 B and 3 ′UTR binding activity. We also found that amino acids W 143, V 145, P 227, T 246, P 257, K 399, T 401, <b>E</b> <b>406</b> and L 413 of CSFV NS 5 A were essential to NS 5 B binding activity. Furthermore, these amino acids were shown to be necessary for viral RNA replication and infection and conserved in NS 5 A proteins of CSFV, BDV, BVDV and HCV. These results indicated that NS 5 A may regulate viral RNA replication by binding to NS 5 B and 3 ′UTR.

To help with discovery of PDE 9 inhibitors, we performed mutagenesis, kinetic, crystallographic, and molecular dynamics analyses on the active site residues of Gln 453 and its stabilizing partner Glu 406. The crystal structures of the PDE 9 Q 453 E mutant (PDE 9 Q 453 E) in complex with inhibitors IBMX and (S) -BAY 73 - 6691 showed asymmetric binding of the inhibitors in two subunits of the PDE 9 Q 453 E dimer and also the significant positional change of the M-loop at the active site.

The {{objective of}} this study was to compare the relative competitive abilities between two rice cultivars and a red rice biotype. Greenhouse experiments were carried out at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, in the 2001 / 2002 growing season, in a completely randomized design, with four replications. The treatments were arranged in a replacement series assay, with five plant proportions of rice cultivars and competitor biotype being established: 100 : 0; 75 : 25; 50 : 50; 25 : 75 and 0 : 100, respectively. Rice was represented by the cultivars IRGA 417 and EEA 406, and the competitors by a red rice genotype as well as by EEA 406 cultivar, mimicking red rice. Competitive analysis was accomplished through diagrams usually applied to replacement series studies, plus use of relative competitive indices. The plant variables evaluated were: tillering, plant height, leaf area, and shoot dry mass. Red rice negatively modified plant tillering, plant height, leaf area, and shoot dry mass of both rice cultivars, proving superior competitive ability.

Continuum removal, or baseline normalization, is a numerical method to estimate the absorptions not due to the band of interest and to remove their effects. The aim was to analyze the impact of different treatments of nitrogen and different irrigation levels on spectral parameters gotten with continuum removal method (band depth and band area) of bean crop. The continuum removal consist in normalize absorption bands. The absorption band, on visible region centered on 665 nm, was studied in terms of band depth and band wide. Field canopy reflectance measurements were acquired at six bean growth stages over 48 plots with the SPECTRON SE- 590 spectroradiometer. The experimental design was the randomized blocks, with split plots, with 12 treatments, 4 irrigation levels (179, 5; 256, 5; 357, 5 <b>e</b> <b>406,</b> 2 mm) and 3 nitrogen doses (0; 80 e 160 kg ha- 1), and four replicates.

Hyperspectral crop reflectance data are useful for several remote sensing applications in agriculture and can be transformed into vegetation indices that are related with crop biophysical parameters. There is a need for studies to define optimal wavebands to estimate crop biophysical parameters. Among the several developed indices distinguished the narrow+band normalized difference vegetation index (NB_NDVI). The aim was to analyze the NB_NDVI to estimate bean grain yield and plant height. Field canopy reflectance measurements were acquired at six bean growth stages over 48 plots with the SPECTRON SE+ 590 spectroradiometer. Two hundred and fifty two narrow bands between 350 and 1. 100 nm with bandwidth of 2, 7 nm were used.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is an {{opportunistic}} {{bacterial pathogen}} responsible for causing several human diseases including pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media. Pneumococcus {{is also a}} major cause of human ocular infections and is commonly isolated in cases of bacterial keratitis, an infection of the cornea. The ocular pathology that occurs during pneumococcal keratitis is partly due to the actions of pneumolysin (Ply), a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by pneumococcus. The lytic mechanism of Ply is a three step process beginning with surface binding to cholesterol. Multiple Ply monomers then oligomerize to form a prepore. The prepore then undergoes a conformational change that creates a large pore in the host cell membrane, resulting in cell lysis. We engineered a collection of single amino acid substitution mutants at residues (A 370, A 406, W 433, and L 460) that are crucial to the progression of the lytic mechanism and determined the effects that these mutations had on lytic function. Both Ply(WT) and the mutant Ply molecules (Ply(A 370 G), Ply(A 370 <b>E),</b> Ply(A <b>406</b> G), Ply(A <b>406</b> <b>E),</b> Ply(W 433 G), Ply(W 433 E), Ply(W 433 F), Ply(L 460 G), and Ply(L 460 E)) were able to bind to the surface of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) with similar efficiency. Additionally, Ply(WT) localized to cholesterol-rich microdomains on the HCEC surface, however, only one mutant (Ply(A 370 G)) was able to duplicate this behavior. Four of the 9 mutant Ply molecules (Ply(A 370 E), Ply(W 433 G), Ply(W 433 E), and Ply(L 460 E)) were deficient in oligomer formation. Lastly, all of the mutant Ply molecules, except Ply(A 370 G), exhibited significantly impaired lytic activity on HCECs. The other 8 mutants all experienced a reduction in lytic activity, but 4 of the 8 retained the ability to oligomerize. A thorough understanding of the molecular interactions that occur between Ply and the target cell, could lead to targeted treatments aimed to reduce the pathology observed during pneumococcal keratitis...|$|R

In two consecutive reproductive seasons, the spawning results, the lipid classes and the fatty acid composition of the eggs were studied. No differences in the absolute content of lipids or in the percentage of different lipid classes were observed between the eggs from the three groups. Both experimental groups fed with the artificial diets produced eggs of poor quality, with low percentages of buoyancy and hatching. Those observed in the eggs from the Control Group were significantly higher (p> 0. 01) than those of the experimental groups.

We now show that Escherichia coli YidC complements for acid tolerance, and partially for salt tolerance, in S. mutans lacking yidC 2 and that S. mutans YidC 1 or YidC 2 complements growth in liquid medium, restores the proton motive force, and functions to assemble the F 1 Fo ATPase in a previously engineered E. coli YidC depletion strain (J.

Both YidC 1 and YidC 2 also promote membrane insertion of known YidC substrates in E. coli; however, complete membrane integrity is not fully replicated, as evidenced by induction of phage shock protein A.

For example, K 341 A and Y 226 A both reduced the Smad 3 -mediated activation of the reporter gene by ∼ 50 % but K 341 A only reduced the TGF-β inducibilty of Olfm 2 in contrast to Y 226 A which reduced the TGF-β inducibility of all six endogenous genes as severely as the W <b>406</b> A mutation. <b>E</b> 267 A had increased protein binding but reduced TGF-β inducibility because it caused higher basal levels of expression. Y 297 A had increased TGF-β inducibility because it caused lower Smad 3 -induced basal levels of gene expression. Mutations in protein binding hot-spots on Smad 3 reduced the binding to different subsets of interacting proteins and caused a range of quantitative changes in the expression of genes induced by Smad 3. This approach should be useful for unraveling which Smad 3 protein complexes are critical for specific biological responses...|$|R
40|$|O pequi é um dos frutos mais abundantes no Cerrado, sendo sua polpa muito apreciada na culinária regional, porém, sua amêndoa (também comestível) é pouco aproveitada. O consumo da amêndoa crua pode acarretar em problemas digestivos, devido à possível presença de fatores antinutricionais, assim como a torra pode alterar, nutricionalmente, a amêndoa. Este trabalho objetivou verificar a composição {{centesimal}}, o perfil de ácidos graxos e os fatores antinutricionais, em amêndoas de pequi crua e torrada (a 270 ºC, por 15 minutos), oriundas do Estado de Goiás e submetidas às análises de composição centesimal (umidade, proteínas, lipídeos, cinzas, carboidratos e valor energético), perfil de ácidos graxos e fatores antinutricionais (inibidores de tripsina, tanino e fitatos). A composição centesimal e os fatores antinutricionais, respectivamente para as amêndoas crua e torrada, apresentaram os seguintes teores: umidade: 25, 40 % e 1, 70 %; cinzas: 3, 90 % e 4, 60 %; proteínas: 13, 40 % e 14, 70 %; lipídeos: 24, 70 % e 25, 70 %; carboidratos: 32, 50 % e 53, 30 %; <b>e</b> valor energético: <b>406,</b> 20 kcal/ 100 g e 503, 00 kcal/ 100 g, com ausência de inibidores de tripsina e taninos com 1, 21 % e 1, 17 % e fitatos com 2, 64 % e 1, 86 %. No perfil de ácidos graxos, respectivamente para as amêndoas crua e torrada, foram obtidos 86, 90 % e 84, 61 % de ácidos saturados e 10, 57 % e 10, 40 % de insaturados. A torra das amêndoas não influenciou, significativamente (p > 0, 05), somente a variável proteína, interferindo, assim, nas características nutricionais e antinutricionais. Caryocar brasiliense Camb. {{is one of}} {{the most}} abundant fruits in the Brazilian Savannah. Its pulp is highly appreciated in the regional cuisine, but its almond (also edible) is little used. The consumption of raw almond can cause digestive problems, due to the possible presence of anti-nutritional factors, as well as roasting can nutritionally change it. This study aimed at evaluating the centesimal composition, fatty acids profile and anti-nutritional factors, in raw and roasted (at 270 ºC, for 15 minutes) Caryocar brasiliense almonds from the Goiás State, Brazil, submitted to analyses of centesimal composition (moisture, proteins, lipids, ashes, carbohydrates and energy value), fatty acids profile and anti-nutritional factors (trypsin, tannin and phytate inhibitors). The centesimal composition and anti-nutritional factors, respectively for raw and roasted almonds, showed the following values: moisture: 25. 40 % and 1. 70 %; ashes: 3. 90 % and 4. 60 %; proteins: 13. 40 % and 14. 70 %; lipids: 24. 70 % and 25. 70 %; carbohydrates: 32. 50 % and 53. 30 %; and energy value: 406. 20 kcal/ 100 g and 503. 00 kcal/ 100 g, with absence of trypsin inhibitors and tannins with 1. 21 % and 1. 17 % and phytates with 2. 64 % and 1. 86 %. In the fatty acids profile, respectively for raw and roasted almonds, 86. 90 % and 84. 61 % of saturated acids and 10. 57 % and 10. 40 % of unsaturated acids were observed. The roasting of almonds did not significantly affect (p > 0. 05) only the protein, thus interfering both in the nutritional and anti-nutritional characteristics...|$|R

40|$|RESUMO: Brotos de soja são vegetais de consumo direto, obtidos de grãos germinados, que são utilizados há séculos nos países orientais. Suas características nutritivas e a facilidade de produção têm chamado a atenção de consumidores do Ocidente. Sementes pequenas com alto poder germinativo e vigor são qualidades inerentes para produção de brotos. Na Embrapa, essas características têm sido contempladas no programa de melhoramento genético para obtenção de {{cultivar}}es de soja especiais para o consumo humano. O objetivo deste trabalho foi produzir e caracterizar a qualidade de brotos de soja obtidos a partir das linhagens BRM 09 - 10505, BRM 10 - 60599 e PF 133002, em comparação com a cultivar BRS 216, desenvolvida para ser utilizada como brotos ou natto. Os brotos foram produzidos em bandejas dispostas em câmara de germinação (25 °C e 99 % de umidade relativa). Sementes e brotos foram avaliados nos seguintes aspectos: teor de proteínas, lipídios, cinzas, isoflavonas, inibidor de tripsina Kunitz, ácido fítico, comprimento e peso dos brotos. As sementes da BRM 09 - 10505 apresentaram 95 % de poder germinativo, seguida pela BRS 216 (93 %) e pelas outras linhagens (88 %, em média). A germinação pela mobilização dos compostos químicos aumentou os teores de proteínas (8, 96 %) e de isoflavonas (56, 00 %) e reduziu os teores de inibidor de tripsina Kunitz (26, 91 %) e de ácido fítico (13, 78 %). A cultivar BRS 216 apresentou o maior teor de proteína nas sementes (41, 96 g. 100 g- 1) e nos brotos (47, 70 g. 100 g- 1). A linhagem BRM 09 - 10505 apresentou maior teor de inibidor de tripsina nas sementes (27, 56 mg IT g- 1) e nos brotos (19, 62 mg. IT g- 1); maior concentração de isoflavonas totais nas sementes (340, 10 mg. 100 g- 1) <b>e</b> nos brotos (<b>406,</b> 38 mg. 100 g- 1), e menor teor de ácido fítico nos brotos (1, 13 g. 100 g- 1). Após quatro dias de germinação, destacaram-se, quanto ao comprimento e ao peso, a linhagem BRM 09 - 10505 (8, 03 cm e 214, 36 g) e a cultivar BRS 216 (7, 31 cm e 140, 93 g). Entre as linhagens testadas, a linhagem BRM 09 - 10505 apresentou bom potencial para produção de brotos. ABSTRACT: Soybean sprouts are {{vegetables for}} direct consumption obtained from germinated grains, which {{have been used for}} centuries in Eastern countries. Their nutritional characteristics and ease of production have attracted the attention of consumers from Western countries. Small seeds with high germinating power and vigour are inherent qualities for shoot production. At the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation - Embrapa, these characteristics have been considered in the genetic breeding program to obtain special soybean cultivars for human consumption. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce and characterize the quality of soybean sprouts from the genetic lines BRM 09 - 10505, BRM 10 - 60599 and PF 133002, in comparison with the cultivar BRS 216, which was developed for use as sprouts and natto. Trays placed in a growth chamber (25 °C and 99 % relative humidity) were used for produce the sprouts. The protein, lipid, ash, isoflavones, Kunitz trypsin inhibitor and phytic acid contents were analysed in the seeds and sprouts. The length and weight of the sprouts were also determined. Seeds of the line BRM 09 - 10505 showed 95 % germinating power followed by BRS 216 (93 %) and the other lines (88 % on average). Germination, by mobilizing chemical compounds, increased the protein (8. 96 %) and isoflavone (56. 00 %) contents, and reduced the concentrations of the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (26. 91 %) and phytic acid (13. 78 %). The cultivar BRS 216 presented the highest protein content in the seeds (41. 96 g. 100 g- 1) and sprouts (47. 70 g. 100 g- 1). The line BRM 09 - 10505 had the highest trypsin inhibitor content in the seeds (27. 56 mg IT g- 1) and in the sprouts (19. 62 mg IT g- 1); the highest total isoflavone contents in the seeds (340. 10 mg. 100 g - 1) and in the sprouts (406. 38 mg. 100 g- 1); and the lowest phytic acid content in the sprouts (1. 13 g. 100 g- 1). After four days of germination, the length and weight of the sprouts were, respectively, 8. 03 cm and 214. 36 g for line BRM 09 - 10505 and 7. 31 cm and 140. 93 g for BRS 216. Of the lines tested, BRM 09 - 10505 showed good potential for sprout production...|$|R
