40|$|Aquaculture practised in Thailand is in {{the form}} of pond culture and cage culture in {{freshwater}}, brackishwater and coastal areas. The main species cultured include <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns,</b> brackishwater <b>shrimp,</b> cockles, mussels, and various freshwater and marine finfishes. There is good potential for increased production from freshwater, brackishwater and marine aquaculture. However, the 1983 production of 145 000 mt represents only about 6 % of Thailand's total fish production and production in this subsector has fluctuated widely. It will be several years before aquaculture production will contribute substantially to total production. Nonetheless, the culture of high value species of shrimp and fish could contribute significantly to export earnings during the next 5 to 10 years. Conducted primarily by government agencies, research and development are along the lines of increasing seed supply, establishing new culture techniques or improving older ones. The Department of Fisheries (DOF) together with some private companies have ventured into the development and testing of artificial diets for the various cultured species using a variety of indigenous feed stuffs. It is estimated that with adequate investments and appropriate support, aquaculture production will increase from 145 000 mt in 1983 to 378 000 mt in 1991, showing an annual increase of about 13 % over this period. Major increases would come from bivalve mariculture (131 000 mt), brackishwater ponds (36 000 mt) freshwater ponds (46 000 mt) and brackishwater cage culture (20 000 mt) ...|$|R

40|$|Aquaculture is the fastest‐growing food‐producing sector worldwide. The giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn,</b> Macrobrachium rosenbergii, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cultured species. However, diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio spp. constitute a significant obstacle for the further expansion of M. rosenbergii cultivation. Some novel strategies to control diseases have been suggested, and in this thesis, we investigated the impact of host‐pathogen signaling and of quorum sensing, bacterial cell‐to‐cell communication, on the virulence of pathogenic bacteria towards giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> larvae. Vibrio campbellii {{is one of the}} major pathogens of aquatic organisms, and virulence gene expression of this bacterium is regulated by a three channel quorum sensing system. In this thesis, first it is shown that this quorum sensing system is required for full virulence of the bacterium towards giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> larvae. Secondly, the quorum sensing‐disrupting compounds cinnamaldehyde, brominated furanone, and brominated thiophenone are shown to increase the survival of giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> larvae when challenged to Vibrio campbellii. Third, quorum sensing signal molecule‐degrading bacteria isolated from microalgae are shown to degrade signal molecules produced by various aquaculture pathogens and to protect giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> larvae from vibriosis. Further, it is shown that catecholamines (stress hormones produced by higher organisms) significantly induce the growth in an iron‐limited environment and the swimming motility of vibrios. Finally, catecholamines are shown to significantly increase the virulence of V. campbellii towards giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> larvae. In conclusion, the results presented in this study showed that pathogen‐pathogen signaling and host‐pathogen signaling play an important role in the virulence of vibrios in giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> larvae. Quorum sensing‐disrupting compounds and quorum sensing signal molecule‐degrading bacteria are promising novel tools to control bacterial disease, and the interference with catecholamine sensing in order to control disease needs further research...|$|R
