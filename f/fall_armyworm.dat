In most cases, observed frequency, population, or leaf area damage caused by insects or pathogens on bmr 6 or bmr 12 plants were not greater than those observed on WT plants in the field or laboratory assays. European corn borers [Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) ] often caused lower amounts of leaf damage to bmr 6 leaves compared to bmr 12 and sometimes WT leaves in the field study. Leaf damage by corn earworms [Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) ] and <b>fall</b> <b>armyworms</b> [Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E.

40|$|The {{presence}} of lignin within biomass impedes {{the production of}} liquid fuels. Plants with altered lignin content and composition are more amenable to lignocellulosic conversion to ethanol and other biofuels but may be more susceptible to insect damage where lignin is an important resistance factor. However, reduced lignin lines of switchgrasses still retained insect resistance in prior studies. Therefore, we hypothesized that sorghum lines with lowered lignin content will also retain insect resistance. Sorghum excised leaves and stalk pith Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench (Poales: Poaceae) from near isogenic brown midrib (bmr) 6 and 12 mutants lines, which have lowered lignin content and increased lignocellulosic ethanol conversion efficiency, were examined for insect resistance relative to wild-type (normal BTx 623). Greenhouse and growth chamber grown plant tissues were fed to first-instar larvae of corn earworms, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and <b>fall</b> <b>armyworms</b> Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), two sorghum major pests. Younger bmr leaves had significantly greater feeding damage in some assays than wild-type leaves, but older bmr 6 leaves generally had significantly less damage than wild-type leaves. Caterpillars feeding on the bmr 6 leaves often weighed significantly less than those feeding on wild-type leaves, especially in the S. frugiperda assays. Larvae fed the pith from bmr stalks had significantly higher mortality compared with those larvae fed on wild-type pith, which suggested that bmr pith was more toxic. Thus, reducing lignin content or changing subunit composition of bioenergy grasses does not necessarily increase their susceptibility to insects and may result in increased resistance, which would contribute to sustainable production...|$|R

In one of the earliest studies, Shepard et al., (1968) reported that the flight of 3 to 4 -day-old adult <b>fall</b> <b>armyworms,</b> Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), treated with 40 krad as 6 -day-old pupae, was reduced in regard to sustained and total flight times, distances, and peak velocities; also males flew less readily than females. Likewise, Noblet et al., (1968) found that 2 -, 5 -, and 10 -day-old secondary screwworm flies, Cochliomyia macellaria (F.), irradiated with 25 krad as 5 -day-old pupae (ca. 5. 6 X greater than the normal dose required to produce 100 % sterility) had reduced total and sustained flight distances and spent less time in flight. In contrast, White et al., (unpublished data) reported enhanced (but not significantly different) flight by male codling moths, Laspeyresia pomonella (L.), treated with 30 krad. Also, the flight of house flies,Musca domestica L., treated as 5 -day-old pupae with 4. 5 and 7. 0 R was not adversely affected when they were tested 2, 5, and 10 days after eclosion (Shepardet al., 1972). Moreover, flight mill research with irradiated oriental fruit flies, Dacus dorsalis Hendel, treated with 10 krad (the sterilizing dose) revealed reduced flight velocities by 16 -day-old males but enhanced flight times and distances by 12 -day-old females (Sharp, unpublished data). We therefore made a more intensive study of the potential effects of irradia tion on fruit flies by doubling the dose applied to D. dorsalis and by studying the effect of 10 krad (sterilizing dose) on Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). !Diptera: Tephritidae. 2 Published with the approval of the Director of the Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Statio...|$|R

50|$|The protein Sf caspase-1 is {{the insect}} {{ortholog}} {{of the human}} effector caspases CASP3 (CPP32) and CASP7 (MCH3) in the species Spodoptera frugiperda (<b>Fall</b> <b>armyworm).</b> It was identified as {{the target of the}} baculoviral caspase inhibitor protein P35, which it cleaves and by which it is inhibited. Like other caspases, Sf caspase-1 is an aspartate-specific cysteine protease that is produced as an inactive proenzyme and becomes activated by autocatalytic cleavage. The Sf caspase-1 proenzyme is cleaved after the amino acid residues Asp-28 and Asp-195, resulting in a smaller 12 kDa fragment and a larger 19 kDa fragment. Just like with human caspases CASP3 or CASP7, the two cleavage fragments form heterodimers, which again form biologically active dimers-of-heterodimers consisting of two smaller and two larger fragments. Some experiments also showed cleavage of Sf caspase-1 at the residue Asp-184, resulting in a 18 kDa instead of 19 kDa fragment, however this result is likely an in vitro artefact. The insect immunophilin FKBP46 is a substrate of Sf caspase-1, which cleaves full length FKBP46 (~46 kDa) resulting in a ~25 kDa fragment.|$|E
50|$|This insect is a generalist {{predator}} {{with a broad}} host range, reportedly attacking 90 insect species, {{which includes}} several important economic pests. Reported prey include the larvae of Mexican bean beetle, European corn borer, diamondback moth, corn earworm, beet armyworm, <b>fall</b> <b>armyworm,</b> cabbage looper, imported cabbageworm, Colorado potato beetle, velvetbean caterpillar, and flea beetles. When prey are scarce, the spined soldier bug may feed on plant juices, but this feeding is not reported to cause plant damage. Podisus maculiventris is associated with several crops including alfalfa, apples, asparagus, beans, celery, cotton, crucifers, cucurbits, eggplant, potatoes, onions, soybeans, sweet corn and tomatoes. The effectiveness of this species in preying on economic pests resulted in its use in classical biological control programs in other countries, including Eastern Europe and Russia. However, {{this has not been}} successful in colder climates, perhaps due to an inability of overwinter. Podisus maculiventris eggs are also sold commercially for use in control programs and this has proven successful in controlling pests in European and North American heated greenhouses. Use in large area field crops is often not economically viable due to the production costs of raising the bug. In addition, naturally occurring populations often are not numerous enough to overpower large populations of pests in the spring. Pheromones have been used to draw naturally occurring and newly emerging populations of this stink bug to target crops in the spring.|$|E

An often overlooked aspect of <b>fall</b> <b>armyworm</b> biology is the existence of two host strains, the “rice” and “corn” strains. Despite knowledge of <b>fall</b> <b>armyworm</b> host strains for thirty years, {{there has been little}} research devoted to their characterization. Here the Bt tolerances, oviposition preferences, and host plant tissue feeding of one rice strain, two corn strain, and one rice-corn hybrid population <b>fall</b> <b>armyworm</b> were compared. Bt tolerance was assessed using diet-based bioassays were conducted for each population to Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, and Cry 1 F, and Cry 1 F again using tissue-based bioassays. Oviposition preferences of one rice strain and one corn strain population were compared using no-choice and two-choice greenhouse experiments, and host plant tissue feeding was compared between one rice strain, two corn strains, and one rice-corn hybrid population. Results from diet-based bioassays indicated that the corn strain and hybrid populations were more tolerant to the Bt toxins, especially to Cry 1 F, than the rice strain population. This was corroborated by the tissue-based bioassays, though the results were narrowly non-significant. The greenhouse oviposition experiments indicated that corn was a preferred oviposition host for both rice and corn strain fall armyworm; this was supported by the host plant tissue feeding experiments that indicated that corn is suitable larval host plant {{for each of the four}} <b>fall</b> <b>armyworm</b> populations tested.
