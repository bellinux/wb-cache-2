40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 67 - 72) Precision gravity {{surveys were}} conducted in the northern Mississippi Embayment area on an irregular basis between 1975 and 1978. Three <b>gravity</b> <b>station</b> pairs in the network {{have been reported to}} exhibit anomalous gravity changes between surveys. The statistically significant temporal change in gravity is due to a change in mass, a change in elevation, or both. This suggests that either tectonic activity or a change in river stage may be the responsible mechanism. The <b>gravity</b> <b>station</b> pairs all had one station in close proximity to the Mississippi River, suggesting a river stage-gravity change relationship. Changes in groundwater level induced by river stage changes were calculated by an equation analogous to heat flow. Gravity changes due to a change in river stage inducing a change in ground water level (bank storage) were calculated and found insufficient to produce the observed difference. However, correlation studies between calculated groundwater levels and observed gravity changes show a significant correlation and indicate that the gravity change is at least partly the result of bank storage, coupled with a possible river induced elevation change.

40|$|We {{collected}} all {{the data}} of gravity measurements carried out over the last 40 years by Institute Geofisico del Peru (IGP). Because of the long time since data collection, {{some of the information}} needed for data reduction were lost over the years. This loss made it difficult for us to determine all of the gravity values unambiguously and consistently from the presently available IGP data alone. Accordingly, there was a need for independently determined <b>gravity</b> <b>stations</b> to which the measurements done by IGP may be compared. In order to provide reference gravity values, we utilized Japanese survey data collected between 1980 and 1984, and conducted more surveys in various parts of Peru in the period between 1995 and 1998. These <b>gravity</b> <b>stations</b> number more than 800, and provide three or more reference points for each of the IGP survey routes. Using these references, the gravity values were calculated for the IGP dataset and Bouguer corrections were applied. Finally, a Bouguer anomaly map of Peru was produced based on these data. This paper reports all the procedures involved in the data reduction, discusses the reliability of the reduced data, and points out the main features of the Bouguer anomaly map...|$|R

The results of the AGRVP gave two solutions which differ by about 2. 3 × 10 ^ ms^ (230 μGals).

40|$|Temporal {{variations}} of atmospheric density distribution induce {{changes in the}} gravitational air mass attraction at a spe cific observation site. Additionally, the load of the atmospheric masses deforms the Earth ’ s crust and the sea surface. Variations in the local gravity acceleration and atmospheric pressure {{are known to be}} corrected with an admittance of about 3 nm/s 2 per hPa as a standard factor, which is in accordance with the IAG Resolution No. 9, 1983. A more accu rate admittance factor for a <b>gravity</b> <b>station</b> is varying with time and depends on the total global mass distribution within the atmosphere. The Institut für Erdmessung (IfE) performed absolute gravity observations in the Fennoscandian land uplift area nearly every year from 2003 to 2008. The objective is to ensure a reduction with 3 nm/s 2 accuracy. Therefore, atmospheric gravity changes are modeled using globally distributed ECMWF data. The attraction effect from the local zone around the <b>gravity</b> <b>station</b> is calculated with ECMWF 3 D weather data describing different pressure levels up to a height of 50 km. To model the regional and global attraction, and all deformation components the Green ’ s functions method and surface ECMWF 2 D weather data are used.

40|$|Glacier ice stores about 75 % of {{the worlds}} freshwater, a basic {{resource}} for life, and a primary medium through which climate change affects the Earth's ecosystem and its habitants. Glaciers are sensitive climate change indicators, and in Norway research on glacier mass balance is of interest e. g. in the scientific field of glaciology {{as well as for}} hydro power production companies. This thesis presents a method for observing mass change of glacier ice on Engabreen drainage basin, a part of Western Svartisen ice cap, Norway. The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate operates a subglacial laboratory situated below 200 m of ice. The laboratory area is a part of a long system of water tunnels leading melt water from the glacier bed to hydro power production. The site gives opportunities for measuring very precise gravity values in laboratory conditions with an absolute gravimeter. Relative gravity measurements were conducted in the water tunnel leading {{from one side of the}} glacier outlet tongue to the other. Field work was conducted during March 2014 in order to establish <b>gravity</b> <b>stations</b> for facilitating later missions and develop a time series for the given conditions. Twenty one <b>gravity</b> <b>stations</b> were surveyed and marked through the specified part of the tunnel system. An absolute gravity value of 982202709. 74 μGal with an uncertainty of ± 3. 47 μGal was measured at the laboratory site and the relative measurements showed uncertainties of around 10 μgal. Modelled effects of different ice surface changes, and the uncertainties of the gravity measurements, give an opportunity to detect changes of ± 0. 05 m on the glacier surface. Temporal masses in the tunnel system were measured during the field work and the effect on nearby <b>gravity</b> <b>stations</b> was modelled. For forthcoming missions, these effects can be reduced if other conditions occur. The present work describes a method for determining a more precise bedrock topography, which may give more accurate results of the gravity effects. With the results presented additional data can be combined with established methods for mass measurements and give more precise results in interest of hydro power production and for scientific purposes related to climatic change.

There are now 109 <b>gravity</b> <b>stations</b> in the area with a relative accuracy of better than 0. 1 mgal, and an accuracy of about 0. 5 mgal relative to the Potsdam system. The net was primarily intended to provide control for a regional gravity survey of Tanganyika, but has also served to connect several other formerly isolated gravity surveys to the international system. Most of the pendulum and <b>gravity</b> meter <b>stations</b> established by other observers before 1958 were reoccupied. When these sets of measurements are compared with the Overseas Geological Survey net individually there are slight differences of datum and calibration, but the mean discrepancies are negligible. The linearity of the cali-bration factors of the O. G. S. gravity meters was confirmed {{by a series of}} tilt-table calibrations. Before 1954 the Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique Outre-Mer had established several im-portant chains of <b>gravity</b> meter <b>stations</b> from Europe, through North, West and East Africa to Madagascar. The O. R. S. T. O. M. values now appear to have been computed with an incorrect calibration factor but otherwise had a high relative accuracy. I.
