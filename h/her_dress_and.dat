5|$|The {{film is a}} {{partially}} fictionalised account {{of the relationship between}} Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren. In 1961, Hitchcock notices Hedren in a television commercial for a diet drink. He wants to turn her into the next Grace Kelly, with whom he had worked extensively during the 1950s. Hedren passes her screen test and is groomed for the starring role in Hitchcock's latest film, The Birds; the director instructs her about <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance.|$|E
5|$|The scenes set in Egypt were {{filmed in}} Tunisia, and the canyon where Indiana threatens {{to blow up}} the Ark was shot in Sidi Bouhlel, just outside Tozeur. The canyon {{location}} had been used for the Tatooine scenes from 1977's Star Wars (many of the location crew members were the same for both films) where R2-D2 was attacked by Jawas. The Tanis scenes were filmed in nearby Sedala, a harsh place due to heat and disease. Several cast and crew members fell ill and Rhys-Davies defecated in his costume during one shot. Spielberg averted disease by eating only canned foods from England, but did not like the area and quickly condensed the scheduled six-week shoot to four-and-a-half weeks. Much was improvised: the scene where Marion puts on <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> attempts to leave Belloq's tent was improvised as was the entire plane fight. During that scene's shooting, a wheel went over Ford's knee and tore his left leg's cruciate ligament, but he refused local medical help and simply put ice on it.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the war ended in 1945, {{a fifth of the}} Polish {{population}} had been killed, with {{the vast majority of the}} victims being civilians. Of those deaths, 3 million were of Polish Jews, which accounted for 90% of the country's Jewish population. According to Sandford, Polanski would use the memory of his mother, <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> makeup style, as a physical model for Faye Dunaway's character in his film Chinatown (1974).|$|E

25|$|Most historians {{believe that}} a {{portrait}} miniature (shown here)—which exists in two versions by Holbein (Royal Collection and Duke of Buccleuch)—is the only surviving image of Catherine painted from life (in {{the case of the}} Windsor version). The historian David Starkey dated it (from details of <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> the technique of the miniature) to the short period when Catherine was queen. In it, she wears the same large jewel as Jane Seymour in Holbein's panel portrait in Vienna. Records show that these jewels belonged to the Crown, not to any queen personally, and there is no record that they were removed from the treasury and given to anyone else.|$|E
25|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred at}} the tour's second stop at the PNE Coliseum on March 2, 1999 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After Manson made a lewd remark about Love during his band's performance, Love ran onstage, hiked <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> jumped on Manson's back while he sang. Later in the show, Manson suffered from dizziness and fainted onstage, injuring his hand on a monitor as he fell. Initially he pretended {{it was part of}} the show, but left the stage after performing their signature song to seek medical attention. When he returned onstage, he pulled the plugs off of their instrument amplifiers and stormed offstage without performing an encore. The rest of the band left the stage afterward.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{months after}} the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, Chikatilo {{travelled}} by bus to the Bagayevsky District of Rostov to purchase vegetables. Having to change buses {{in the village of}} Donskoi, he decided to continue his journey on foot. Walking away from the bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, named Lyubov Biryuk, who was herself walking home from a shopping trip. Once the path both were taking together was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, Chikatilo pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off <b>her</b> <b>dress,</b> <b>and</b> killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death. When her body was found on 27 June, the medical examiner discovered evidence of 22 knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region. Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with the handle and blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk's eye sockets.|$|E

500|$|Pankhurst {{made their}} Russell Square home into a centre for grieving sisters, {{attracting}} activists of many types. She took pleasure in decorating the house – especially with furnishings from Asia – and clothing {{the family in}} tasteful apparel. Her daughter Sylvia later wrote: [...] "Beauty and appropriateness in <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> household appointments seemed to her at all times an indispensable setting to public work." [...] The Pankhursts hosted a variety of guests including US abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, Indian MP Dadabhai Naoroji, socialist activists Herbert Burrows and Annie Besant, and French anarchist Louise Michel.|$|E
500|$|That afternoon, Cole {{attended}} the rally, wearing <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> holding her sign. The Nixon train pulled in, {{and the police}} lowered the rope which kept the crowd clear of the tracks. In interviews, Cole related that as the crowd surged forward, she dropped her sign amidst the pushing and shoving. Cole stated, [...] "I wanted a sign to wave. I had lost my own placard and as the crowd moved forward as the train approached I saw this sign lying {{in the street and}} I just picked it up and held it high, hoping Mr. Nixon would see it." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{included}} many references such as to James Brown and Donna Summer {{as well as}} routines inspired by Sweet Charity and Marilyn Monroe.

Her background band started playing the music to the funk song and while singing, Knowles walked up a huge staircase which moved forward in two places where her all-female band and three backup singers were positioned. At the top of the staircase/mini-stage, she tore off the bottom of <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> walked back down to the main stage.

500|$|Onstage Beyoncé had an all-female band, and {{the show}} used men only as dancers for the female {{audience}} as noted by Pareles of The New York Times.

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Madonna was {{dismissed}} by some critics. They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going up slowly. She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on them like a star. For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue, silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom. The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather jacket over <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> walked around the stage while singing. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song. She dedicated the song to the Pope, marking her first conflict with the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts.|$|E
