The studied clay taken from residuals of a constructing dam, called “Mirzakhanloo”, located in Zanjan province, northwest of Iran. Dispersion potential of this soil and its modifiability were evaluated using single and double hydrometric, chemistry tests.

40|$|Use of <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> as {{construction}} material requires treatment such as by chemical addition. Treatments to <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> using pozzolan and Portland cement, singly and simultaneously, {{were carried out}} in this study. When used alone, the optimum amount of pozzolan required to treat a fully <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> sample was 5 %, but the curing time to reduce dispersion potential, from 100 % to 30 % or less, was 3 month long. On the other hand, also when used alone, a 3 % cement content was capable of reducing dispersion potential to almost zero percent in only 7 days; and a 2 % cement content was capable of achieving similar result in 14 days. However, treatment by cement alone is costly and could jeopardize the long term performance. Thus, a combined 5 % pozzolan and 1. 5 % cement content was found capable of reducing dispersion potential from 100 % to zero percent in 14 days. The results indicate that although simultaneous treatment with pozzolan and cement would extend the required curing time in comparison to treatment by cement alone of a higher content, the task could still be carried out in a reasonable period of curing time while avoiding the drawbacks of using either pozzolan or cement alone...|$|E
40|$|Dispersive soils which {{occur in}} many parts of the world are easily {{erodible}} and segregate in water pose serious problems of stability of earth and earth retaining structures. The mechanism of dispersivity of soils is reasonably well understood. However there is simple method to identify the dispersivity of the soils and even more difficult to quantify the dispersivity. Visual classification, Atterberg’s limits and particle size analysis do not provide sufficient basis to differentiate between <b>dispersive</b> <b>clays</b> and ordinary erosion resistant clays. Pinhole test and double hydrometer test are the only two tests that are in vogue to identify the dispersive soils. This paper explores the possibility of using other standard tests such as shrinkage limit and unconfined compressive strength tests to quantify the dispersivity of the soils. The rationale of using the methods and correlation between the dispersivity determined by various methods has been explained. It has been concluded that dispersivity ascertained from strength tests is more reliable...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{controls on}} long-term management of borrow pits in the Pilbara region of north-western Australia typically require a &# 039;free-draining&# 039; final configuration. This requirement is not {{compatible with the}} many soils in the Pilbara region which are highly susceptible to erosion. As the region continues to develop as a focus of iron ore mining and construction of related infrastructure, environmental management of local earthworks excavations {{will need to be}} appropriate to the erosional characteristics of the local soils and sediments. In particular, railway lines used to transport ore to port require the excavation of extensive borrow pits which must withstand an environment which includes extremes of wet and dry seasons including being located {{in one of the most}} cyclone-prone areas of Australia. The coastal alluvial sediments are dominated by the silty &# 039;pindan&# 039; sand which is highly prone to erosion. Field observations and laboratory testing shows that the pindan sand contains <b>dispersive</b> <b>clays,</b> even where clay content and sodicity is low.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} very little {{research}} available on nonpoint source pollution from rural watersheds. Government regulatory agencies are desperate for information regarding the causes of nonpoint source pollution, which includes the relationship between suspended soil particles and dispersion. Since soil dispersion is dependent on clay mineralogy, knowing the clay mineralogy of the soil in an area can help predict sediment loads entering the surrounding surface waters. This information is necessary to protect the resource value of our rivers, lakes, and estuaries, as well as to protect recreational activities such as fishing or hunting; but most importantly, this information is necessary {{to ensure the safety of}} our drinking water supply. Clay mineralogy and its influence on dispersion, as well as dispersion and its relation to water quality are the focus of this study. Soil mineralogy affects water quality in several ways: soil mineralogy determines the dispersivity of the clay portion of the soil and <b>dispersive</b> <b>clays</b> are likely to end up as suspended sediment in surface waters; weathering reactions contribute elements to water as dissolved load, and the sorption properties of clay minerals contribute to soils 2 ̆ 7 ability to filter and carry pollutants. Through the use of X-ray diffraction, dispersivity, atomic absorption spectrometry, cation exchange capacity, and petrographic microscopy, this study shows that the clay mineral fraction of a soil determines the dispersivity, and that dispersed clay minerals contribute excess nutrients and metals as nonpoint source pollutants to surface waters...|$|R

Results showed that the increase in the critical shear stress of the silty sand with only 0. 6 % lignosulfonate treatment was equivalent to that with around 2. 5 % cement treatment. However, the stabilisation of the <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> with 0. 6 % cement was more effective than 0. 6 % lignosulfonate.

40|$|Internal erosional {{behaviour}} of a lignosulfonate-treated dispersive soil {{has been}} studied using apparatus designed and built at University of Wollongong. The effectiveness of lignosulfonate-treated <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> on its erosion resistance has been investigated and its advantages over traditional admixtures (cement) have been presented. Lignosulfonate is a non-toxic admixture that can stabilise certain erodible and dispersive soils effectively, without causing any adverse environmental impact on the ground unlike some traditional stabilisers. Test {{results show that the}} erosional parameters such as critical shear stress and coefficient of soil erosion are improved with the increase in the amount of lignosulfonate. Knowledge about the clay particles and lignosulfonate interaction mechanisms is pertinent for long-term environmental sustainability of treated soils, a factor which is poorly understood at microscopic level. Considering this, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were carried out on representative samples to understand the stabilisation mechanism at the particle scale level. The improvement of performance exhibited by the lignosulfonate-treated soil can be mainly attributed to the reduction of the doublelayer thickness by the neutralisation of surface charges of the clay particles and the formation of more stable particle clusters by polymer bridging...|$|E
40|$|Soft subgrades are {{not strong}} enough to provide the {{required}} degree of compaction for a pavement embankment’s foundation. Therefore, it is required to treat the subgrade soil or construct a working platform on top of the soft subgrade to ensure proper compaction of the subsequent layers. The constriction sizes of the granular materials used for a working platform are comparatively higher to restrict the erosion of overlying embankment materials. This condition would lead to severe material loss in the embankment layer in cases where the embankment is constructed with dispersive soil, which becomes structurally unstable in wet conditions and appears to disperse in water. This paper investigates the contact erosion failure at the foundation of a pavement embankment constructed with dispersive soil as a result of groundwater fluctuation. Experimental studies were conducted on a laboratory model test apparatus designed to simulate the conditions in the pavement embankment’s foundation. The experimental studies revealed that the magnesium dominant clayey soils also susceptible to contact erosion failure due to soil dispersion. Also, the experimental results show that even a small percentage of <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> particles present in the embankment soil would influence the contact erosion failure...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{an experimental}} investigation of hydraulic fracturing {{when the water}} pressure is increased rapidly in a borehole and development of a possible simple method for identifying erodible clayey soils. Case histories of hydraulic fracturing in embankment dams and boreholes are reviewed. It is found that hydraulic fracturing in dams {{is often associated with}} rapid reservoir filling and zones of low stresses. Previously proposed criteria for hydraulic fracturing are outlined. It is found that no existing theory adequately explains fracturing observed in laboratory tests. Characteristics of <b>dispersive</b> <b>clays</b> and the methods of identifying them are reviewed. It is found that no single test provides results that have a satisfactory level of reliability. Hydraulic fracture was examined in the laboratory on samples of puddle clay from the core of Cwmernderi Dam in modified Bishop and Wesley triaxial cells. Various sets of tests examined the effects of sample geometry, loading rate and overconsolidation on the initial fracturing pressure and examined the effects of subsequent reconsolidation time on refracturing pressures. For the analysis of these tests results, simple criteria for hydraulic fracturing are proposed. The test results suggest that hydraulic fracturing for undrained conditions occurs when the drained strength of the soil element {{at the edge of a}} borehole is reached. For fully drained conditions, fracturing occurs when the soil element at the edge of the borehole reaches the no-tension cut-off. A new test, the cylinder dispersion test, was developed and a series of tests were carried on samples of puddle clay from several British dams and on various other soils. The results of these tests demonstrate the major influence of pore water chemistry on the true cohesion and dispersion properties of the soils...|$|R
40|$|Potassium (K) is a {{macro element}} in plant, animal and human {{nutrition}} and is regularly applied to agricultural land as a fertiliser or {{as a component}} of nutrients in irrigation wastewater. Soils contain variable quantities of potassium-bearing minerals and differ in their inherent K supplying capacity. Improving knowledge of the potassium cycle in soils is considered to be important for {{a better understanding of the}} productivity and sustainability of many ecosystems. This work combines soil analysis and mineralogical methods for characterising and quantifying the movement of different forms of potassium in Australian soils. Dispersion of clay particles is one of the major processes responsible for the degradation of soil structure. Adsorbed sodium is traditionally considered to be a primary cause for poor soil structural stability. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the effect of adsorbed monovalent potassium on soil structure. Mixed results from the literature point to more research being required to explore the potential effect of applied K⁺ on soil dispersive properties and the role of clay minerals in it. Potassium is common in a wide variety of wastewaters and in some wastewaters is present at several hundred to several thousand mg/L. Potassium is taken up by expandable clays leading to its fixation and illitisation of smectitic and vermiculitic layers. Clays have a major effect on soil physico-chemical properties, and hence the addition of wastewaters to soils may lead to mineralogical changes in the soils that affect these properties. The aim of this work was to improve our understanding of potassium dynamics in Australian soils with emphasis on soil clay mineralogical properties. Soils from different regions of Southern Australia were used. Studies on pure clays have been included to understand the fundamental processes involved in potassium cycle in soils. The results show that applied potassium can cause dispersion of soil but to a lesser extent than sodium. Potassium cations also could increase soil hydraulic conductivity to some extent when applied to a soil with high sodium content by substituting the Na⁺ on exchange sites. Exchangeable potassium can cause dispersion of soil even if it is present in relatively small amounts (Exchangeable Potassium Percentage < 4 %), particularly in soils with dominant illite/kaolinite mineralogy. The use of Exchangeable Cation Ratio is tested as an indicator of soil dispersion because it reflects the combined effects of potassium and sodium as dispersive agents. Illitic and illitic-kaolinitic soils are more prone to dispersion than soils with dominant smectitic clay. This is due to their differences in clay microstructure and fabric when interacting with water. Turbidity and zeta potential could effectively reflect soil <b>clay</b> <b>dispersive</b> properties. But to understand the meaning of zeta potential for dispersive properties of soils we should have prior knowledge of the mineralogy of the soil studied. TEM and XRD methods could assist in providing a better understanding of the processes occurring in soil. Application of potassium rich wastewater on four clayey soils from Southern Australia induced changes in the 2 : 1 clay assemblages of the soils. XRD diagrams and chemical composition of clays extracted from untreated and treated soils were determined. Characterisation of the effect of wastewater treatment on clay fraction either by decomposition of XRD patterns into their component phases or chemical analysis of the mineral content of the studied clays gave consistent results. In 3 of the 4 soils, shifts in peak positions occurred towards more illitic components along with increases in K and sometimes also Mg and Na contents of soil clays. Peak decomposition showed trends towards the formation of interstratifications of illite with smectite at the expense of smectite and an alteration of poorly-crystallised illite into its more well-ordered forms. The results show that illitisation may occur as a result of the addition of K-rich wastewaters to clayey soils. Growers and agricultural managers should consider soil clay mineralogy before irrigating with potassium-rich wastewater. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract — Water {{infiltration}} {{into the}} ground can change its characteristics when small particles are picked up and hence its porosity (permeability) changes. This phenomenon {{is well known in}} the literature as the internal erosion. This problem is quite important in regions of water storage where the interstitial pressures are very important. However, the erosion process is highly dependent on soil susceptibility to dispersion. According to the International Commission On Large Dams (ICOLD), dams can be built with <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> if certain precautions are taken (Fell, 1992). Several solutions have been suggested in order to lower the soil sensitivity to dispersion, or even prevent the internal erosion by the use of lime, fly ash [...] This technique is effective but can only be used for new constructions, as it requires a qualified workforce for its implementation. In this paper, some experimental results on the effect of addition of milk of lime to dispersive soils are reported. This can easily be carried out in practice and responds positively and equally for both new and old constructions. The treatment results are shown using classical erosion tests: crumble test, pinhole test and double hydrometer test. This study clearly shows that adding a small percentage of milk of lime slightly increases the soil strength and significantly reduces its dispersion. The authors provide a practical explanation of this technique about the decrease of the dispersive nature of clays...|$|E
40|$|There {{is no one}} {{definitive}} test to determine the dispersivity of a soil. The ones that are available carry some uncertainty {{and need to be}} compared against one another. Even so, clays may be misclassified. This error can produce hazardous results if these clays are used, for example, in levee or dam systems. However, if there was a feature characteristic of all dispersive clays, some doubt could be eliminated and clays could be used without fear of dispersivity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are able to look at soil surfaces on microscopic levels and note distinct particle associations. In viewing clays of various dispersivity classifications with an SEM, samples with the same dispersivity classifications can be compared and common features can be recorded. This could eliminate some of the uncertainty that arises from any single dispersion test and minimize the time needed to make an accurate classification. The report includes a discussion of the factors influencing the formation of a <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay,</b> the tests used to detect dispersivity, the technology behind an SEM, and the results and images obtained from the analyses.

However, aluminum sulfate {{can be used to}} stabilize <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay.</b> Tests were done to consider the effects of alum and lime additions on shear strength parameters of clay as secondary effects. Clay for samples was taken from the Mirzakhanluo Dam, located in Tarom County, northwestern Zanjan Province of Iran. In this research, the clay sample was subjected to direct shear testing; the clay was tested with optimum moisture under varying percentages of alum (0, 0. 3, 0. 6, 1, 3, and 5 as percentage of dry soil weight) for 28 days. Also, unconfined tests were conducted on samples with equal amounts of moisture, alum and lime under the different treatment durations of 7, 14, and 21 and 28 days, separately. Results for the direct shear test indicated that the maximum cohesion was recorded in the sample with 1 % alum. Results also showed that the internal friction angle decreased in samples with alum percentage up to the level of 0. 6 % and at levels higher than that it showed an increase. Generally, results showed that soil shear strength was higher in soil stabilized by alum than in unstabilized soil. Results of the uniaxial test, determined that alum and lime additions to dispersive soil and its treatment, compression strength was not limited and elastic modulus showed an increase.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to flood protection, the {{established}} method is to use impermeable material in dikes, to prevent seepage. This material is usually some kind of clay soil which is considered as impermeable and erosion-resistant. Dispite that, in many occasions not only seepage, but {{the failure of the}} dam occured due to surface erosion, because these kinds of irregular soils are barely investigated, and their presence are not considered during the phase of designing. In geotechnics these soils are called dispersive clays, and their greatest hazard is that they are not distinguishable at sight or by the standard geotechnical tests from the regular erosion-resistant clays, therfore many dams are built by these kind of materials, causing extra risk when {{it comes to}} evaluating the probability of failure. The reason for this kind of behavior {{can be found in the}} structure and the distribution of the clay minerals which are building up the soil. Based on earlier experiences and papers it is possible to reduce the magnitude of erosion by mixing the soil with slaked lime. First to evince the dispersive nature of the soils we developed a testing program. Therefore we collected samlpes from the Great Hungarian Plane, and identified them by the pinhole test after Sherard. If the soil was identified as a <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay,</b> slaked lime was mixed to it, and the test was performed again to see if the soil became less dispersive, therefore more erosion-resistant or not. The main goal was to find an optimal value of the added lime. The main chapters the paper present the background of the dispersive soils, and the mechanism of failure, the tunnel erosion.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) export by erosion, surface runoff, {{throughflow}} and leaching {{are considered}} the main sources of P loss from agricultural land. The present study {{was conducted on the}} upper Fitzgerald River Catchment in the South coast region of Western Australia (WA) to examine the process of P mobilization at different P rates (0, 20 and 40 kg P/ha). Intact column leaching, packed box and field runoff plot studies were conducted on contrasting soils from the catchment. Soil solution was collected at 5, 10 and 15 cm by installing Rhizon soil solution samplers, and leachate collected at 30 cm. Runoff and soil solutions were analysed for particulate P (PP), dissolved reactive P (DRP), and total dissolved P (TDP) and dissolved organic P (DOP) was calculated by difference (TDP-DRP). Overall, DRP comprised < 35 % of TP in runoff while about 90 % or more of relative P losses via runoff, throughflow and leachate were in DOP and PP forms. The DOP and soluble organic carbon (SOC) in soil solution were well correlated in sand (R 2 = 0. 78, P < 0. 05) and clay soils (R 2 = 0. 56, P < 0. 05) at 0 - 5 cm suggesting that amounts of organic matter dissolved in soil solution influences P sorption and mobility. The higher PP concentration for the clay soil at the interface of clay and sandy layers indicates subsurface lateral flow is exacerbated by <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> which might be an additional concern regarding P mobility in clay and duplex soils of the catchment. Ponding of water at the surface or lateral movement of water at the interface of sand and clay layers in the profile would increase the risk of P losses in the form of DP or PP in dispersion-prone sodic soils...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{associated}} with erodible soils {{have been reported}} in Australia and {{many parts of the world}} since the early 1970 s. Significant soil loss from embankments, internal erosion and piping are some of the problems that practicing engineers face during the construction and maintenance phase of earth structures constructed with erodible soils. It is therefore necessary to identify appropriate stabilisation techniques to control erosion. This study considers chemical stabilisation as an erosion control method and a rigorous testing program has been conducted to investigate how effectively two chemical agents (general purpose Portland cement and lignosulfonate) control the erosion rate of two natural erodible soils (a silty sand and <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay).</b> In this study, a Process Simulation Apparatus for Internal Crack Erosion (PSAICE) has been designed and built to conduct tests on chemically treated and untreated soil samples. The effect of the degree of compaction and moulding water content on erosional behaviour of soils has also been addressed. In addition, the tensile stress-deformation characteristics of chemically treated soil samples have been investigated using a uniaxial tensile testing apparatus, designed and built at University of Wollongong for this current research study. One of the main objectives was to develop an analytical model for the erosion rate that incorporates the tensile stress-deformation characteristics of the soil. The model has been developed based on the law of the conservation of energy and validated using the results of erosion and uniaxial tensile tests conducted on chemically stabilised soil samples. The results of the tests indicated that the erosion rate changes linearly with the hydraulic shear stress; slope of the line that represents the coefficient of soil erosion. The coefficient of soil erosion decreases, while the critical shear stress increases with an increasing amount of stabiliser, irrespective of the soil type. It was also found that the coefficient of soil erosion of chemically treated soil has a strong relationship with its critical shear stress. Uniaxial tensile tests on chemically treated saturated samples showed that both stabilisers increase the tensile strength with a decrease in the displacement at failure. Model validation demonstrated that only a fraction of flow energy (i. e. efficiency index) is used for the erosion process, and it depends on the hydraulic conditions of flow. Moreover, the proposed model can be used to predict the erosion rate of chemically treated erodible soils, if the tensile stress-deformation characteristics, mean particle diameter, dry density, and mean flow velocity through the crack are known...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{is to improve the}} geotechnical properties of dispersive soil by reducing their dispersivity after elucidating the important mechanisms controlling the dispersivity of the soils. Dispersive soils have unique properties, which under certain conditions deflocculate and are rapidly eroded and carried away by water flow. These soils are found extensively in the United States, Australia, Greece, India, Latin America, South Africa and Thailand. The mechanism of dispersivity of soils is a subject matter of great interest for geotechnical engineers. In the earlier days clays were considered to be non erosive and highly resistant to water erosion. However, recently it was found that highly erosive clay soils do exist in nature. Apart from clayey soil, dispersivity is also observed in silty soils. The tendency of the clays to disperse or deflocculate depends upon the mineralogy and soil chemistry and also on the dissolved salts in the pore water and the eroding water. Such natural dispersive soils are problematic for geotechnical engineers. They are clayey soils which are highly susceptible to erosion in nature and contain a high percentage of exchangeable sodium ions, (Na+). It is considered that the soil dispersivity is mainly due to the presence of exchangeable sodium present in the structure. When <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> soil is immersed in water, the clay fraction behaves like single-grained particles; that is, the clay particles have a minimum of electrochemical attraction and fail to closely adhere to, or bond with, other soil particles. This implies that the attractive forces are less than the repulsive forces thus leading to deflocculation (in saturated condition). This weakens the aggregates in the soil causing structural collapse. Such erosion may start in a drying crack, settlement crack, hydraulic fracture crack, or other channel of high permeability in a soil mass. Total failure of slopes in natural deposits is initiated by dispersion of clay particles along cracks, fissures and root holes, accelerated by seepage water. For <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> soils to erode, a concentrated leakage channel such as a crack (even a very small crack) must exist through an earth embankment. Erosion of the walls of the channel then occurs along the entire length at the same time. Many slope and earth dam failures have occurred due to the presence of dispersive soils. Unlike erosion in cohesionless soils, erosion in <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> is not a result of seepage through the pores of clay mass. However, the role of type of clay and its Cation exchange capacity in the dispersion of soil is not well understood. Data on the presence, properties, and tests for identification of dispersive clays is scarce. Hence, an attempt is made, in this thesis, to develop reliable methods to identify these soils and understand the extent of their dispersivity as well as to develop methods to control their dispersivity. The present study deals with the characterization of a local dispersive soil collected from southern part of Karnataka State. This study has focused on comprehensive tests to assess the dispersivity of the soils by different methods and to methods to improve geotechnical properties by reducing the dispersivity of the soil. An attempt is made to reduce the dispersivity of soil by using calcium based stabilizers such as lime, cement and fly ash. The mechanism of improvement in reducing the dispersivity of the soil with calcium based stabilizers has been studied. One of the important mechanism by which the dispersivity of the soil is reduced is by inducing cementation of soil particles. The differences in effectiveness of different additives are due to their differences in abilities to produce cementitious compounds. Although all the additives increased the strength of the soil and reduced the dispersivity of the soil, cement was found to significantly reduce the dispersivity of the soil, compared to the other two additives lime and fly ash. Cement is more effective as sufficient cementitious compounds are produced on hydration without depending on their formation. A detailed review of literature on all aspects connected with the present study is given in Chapter 2. A comprehensive description of dispersive soils present worldwide has been brought out in this section. Based on this survey, the scope of the present investigation has been elaborated {{at the end of the}} chapter. To understand the reasons for dispersivity of the soil and to estimate its degree of dispersivity, it is essential to assess standard methods to characterize the soil. Chapter 3 presents a summary of material properties and testing programs. The results of geotechnical characterization of the soil, the index properties of the soilspecific gravity, sieve analysis, Atterberg’s limits are discussed in Chapter 4. The physico chemical characteristics play an important role in determining the amount of dispersivity of the soil. Dispersive soils have two main characteristics which define its dispersivity chemically. These are Sodium Adsorption Ratio (S. A. R) and Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (E. S. P). The two characteristics are determined from the Cation exchange capacity of the soil. Exchangeable Sodium Percentage is defined as the concentration of sodium ions present in the soil with respect to the Cat ion exchange capacity of the soil. And Sodium Adsorption Ratio is used to quantify the free salts present in the pore water. Since Atterberg’s limits and grain size analysis do not help in identifying dispersive soils or in quantifying its dispersivity, two other tests- Emerson Crumb test and double hydrometer test were carried out on the soil. Emerson crumb test is a simple way for identification of dispersive soils. In this test, a crumb of soil measuring about 1 mm diameter is immersed in a beaker containing distilled water and the subsequent reaction is observed for 5 minutes. It is solely based on direct qualitative observations. Depending on the degree of turbidity of the cloud formed in the beaker, the soil is classified in one of the four levels of dispersion in accordance with ASTM-D 6572. Since this test is mainly a qualitative test and does not help in quantifying the dispersivity, it cannot be depended upon completely in identifying a dispersive soil. Another test double hydrometer test, which helps in quantifying the dispersivity of the soil, was also conducted on the soil. This test involves in conducting the particle size distribution using the standard hydrometer test in which the soil specimen was dispersed in distilled water with a chemical dispersant. A parallel hydrometer test was conducted on another soil specimen, but without a chemical dispersant. The dispersing agent used for the experiment was sodium hexametaphosphate. The percent dispersion is the ratio of the dry mass of particles smaller than 0. 005 mm diameter of the test without dispersing agent to the test with dispersing agent expressed as a percentage. The double hydrometer test was carried out according to Double Hydrometer Test (ASTM D 4221). Apart from the conventional tests, attempts are made to consider shrinkage limit test and unconfined compression test to determine the dispersivity of the soil. For this purpose, the shrinkage limit of the soil was determined with and without dispersing agent. The initial shrinkage limit of the untreated soil reduced on treating it with dispersing agent, thus indicating that the soil had further dispersed on addition of dispersing agent. In order to carry out the unconfined compression strength, the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content was determined through the compaction test. The soil was then treated with dispersing agent and compacted at the optimum moisture content. The soil exhibited high degree of dispersion through the strength test. Hence it is necessary to stabilize the soil with additives. Detailed experimental program has been drawn to find methods to improve the geotechnical properties and to reduce the dispersivity of the soil. Chapter 5 presents the investigations carried out on the dispersive soil with lime. The importance of lime stabilization and the mechanism of lime stabilization have been discussed initially. Commercially obtained hydrated lime was used in the present study. The soil was treated with three different percentages of lime 3, 5 and 8. The curing period was varied from one day to twenty eight days. The effect of addition of lime on various properties of the soil such as pH, Atterberg’s limits, compaction test and unconfined compression test is elaborated in chapter 5. The pH of the soil was maximum on addition of 3 % lime. On further addition, the pH decreased and remained constant. The liquid limit of the soil increased on adding 3 % lime and decreased with further lime content. The compaction test conducted on the soil showed an increase in maximum dry density of the soil and reduction in optimum moisture content with 3 % lime content. On further increase in the lime content, the soil showed a decrease in the maximum dry density and increase in optimum moisture content. The unconfined compressive strength of the soil also increased on increasing lime content upto 5 %. The variation in strength of the soil with respect to curing period was also compared. Optimum lime content arrived at based on the above conducted tests was 3 %. The effect of lime in reducing the dispersivity of the soil through shrinkage limit test and unconfined compression test is also presented in this chapter. Details of the efforts made on the soil with fly ash are presented in Chapter 6. The fly ash used for stabilization of Suddha soil was of Class F type. This type of fly ash contains low reactive silica and lime. The effect of varying fly ash content on the properties of Suddha soil by varying the percentage of fly ash from 3 to 10 percentages is discussed in this chapter. The tests conducted on fly ash treated Suddha soil were pH test, compaction test, Atterberg’s limits and unconfined compression test with varying curing period. The fly ash treated Suddha soil was cured from one day to twenty eight days for the unconfined compressive strength analysis. The pH of the soil system increased with increasing percentage of fly ash. The increase in liquid limit was marginal on addition of fly ash. The maximum dry density of fly ash treated Suddha soil decreased continuously and the optimum moisture content of the treated soil increased with increasing fly ash content. The unconfined compressive strength of Suddha soil increased with increase in fly ash content upto 8 % and then decreased for fly ash content of 10 %. For all the percentages of fly ash added, the strength of the soil increased with increase in the curing period. The effect of fly ash in reducing the dispersivity of the soil was carried out using shrinkage limit and unconfined compression test. It was seen that on increasing the fly ash content, the soil treated with dispersing agent showed an increase in the shrinkage limit. Also, the same trend was observed for the unconfined compression strength to determine dispersivity. Optimum fly ash was determined as 8 % with the help of all the tests conducted on the soil. Since the improvement in the properties of the soil with lime and fly ash was not very high, Cement was also considered as another additive used for stabilization of Suddha soil. It is known that soil with lesser amount of clay content will respond well with cement. The effect of cement addition on various properties of Suddha soil has been brought out in Chapter 7. It was found that addition of cement had positive effects on all the properties of Suddha soil. The pH of the soil increased for all the percentages of cement addition. The liquid limit of the soil increased on increasing the cement content. The shrinkage limit also showed a similar trend. The optimum moisture content of the soil decreased on increasing the cement content for Suddha soil and the maximum dry density increased for cement treated Suddha soil. The soil showed the maximum dry density at 8 % cement content. The unconfined compression strength conducted on cement treated Suddha soil increased significantly for higher cement contents and also with curing period. Suddha soil when treated with 8 % cement content exhibited maximum strength in comparison to other percentages. Also, the effect of cement in reducing the dispersivity of the soil was carried out using shrinkage limit and unconfined compression test. The shrinkage limit of the soil increased for all percentages of cement content, even in the presence of dispersing agent. Through the unconfined compression strength for dispersivity, it could be seen that 8 % cement treated Suddha soil had the least dispersion. Optimum cement content was derived as 8 % with the help of the tests conducted on the soil. A comparison of effect of all the additives on the strength of the soil as well as effect of the additives in reducing the dispersivity of the soil is discussed in Chapter 8. The effect of additives on the shrinkage limit of the soil with and without dispersing agent has been compared. The variation in shrinkage limit of the soil when treated with the additives was due to the different mechanisms involved in reducing the dispersivity by each additive. The effect on the unconfined compression strength of the soil treated with the additives with and without dispersing agent is also brought out in this chapter. It was noted that the dispersion exhibited through shrinkage limit test was lesser as compared to the percentage dispersivity exhibited through unconfined compression test. Hence it could be said that dispersion of the soil is due to loss of cohesion than volume change behavior. Also, the unconfined compression strength of the soils with respect to curing period is compared. The percentage dispersivity calculated through these tests is summarized and compared. With the help of this it could be said that to control the dispersivity of the soil, it is necessary to enhance the strength of the soil. The general summary and major conclusions drawn from the thesis are presented in Chapter 9...|$|E
40|$|Following over 100 {{years of}} {{agriculture}} and continuous phosphorus (P) fertilizer application in the south west of Western Australia, {{there is a growing}} risk of P transport from cropping and pasture land to streams. However, soil and landscape factors affecting the likelihood of P losses and of stream water contamination have not yet been assessed for the South coast region of Western Australia. The present investigation was conducted in the Fitzgerald River catchment located 400 km south east of Perth, to identify risk of P losses from agricultural land to streams, through an understanding of how P is retained within complex landscapes and released via surface and subsurface flow paths. The 104, 000 ha catchment is in a moderately dissected landscape (average annual rainfall 450 mm) and discharges into the World Heritage listed Fitzgerald Biosphere. The main use of cleared land in the catchment is broad-scale agriculture, primarily winter grain cropping and pasture for livestock. The aim of an initial study was to identify the areas with high soil P concentrations and their relationship to factors such as soil type, topography, management (e. g. fertilizer and manure inputs, and uptake by crops or forage) and how variations in soil P concentrations were related to soil physico-chemical properties, P fertilizer management and landscape position. A wide variation in P concentrations was observed across the catchment, but few of the samples exceeded Colwell extractable P levels of 30 mg/kg in the 0 - 10 cm layer which is regarded as a critical level for crop and pasture productivity. The western area of the catchment, which was cleared earlier (before 1966) than the eastern area had a greater prevalence of loam soils, and higher Colwell-extractable P concentrations (average) 22 mg/kg vs. 13 mg P/kg) due to soil type effects and higher P accumulation over time. Risk of P loss from the east and west of the catchment is expected to vary due to textural and topographic differences and P history (P fertilizer input and uptake by crops). The CaCl 2 -extractable P in the catchment was negatively correlated with oxalate extractable Fe (Feox) in soils. This suggests that P may be transported as particulate P (PP) on loam and clay soils due to sorption of P on oxides surfaces, while on sand soil leaching losses may be more likely. On loam and clay soils, higher sodicity and the dispersive nature of subsoils may increase the risk of both dissolved P (DP) and PP loss due to the effects on hydraulic conductivity of the profile. Hedley's fractionation scheme was used to quantify P fractions in the order of decreasing lability, viz: resin-P > NaOH-Pi > NaOH-Po > acid-P (H 2 SO 4 -P) > residual-P. Surface soil had higher resin and NaOH-Pi, which are regarded as water-soluble and readily exchangeable P forms, respectively and expected to contribute to DP in the runoff losses. The residual P was the largest fraction followed by the hydroxide extractable organic-P fraction (NaOH-Po) : the former was positively correlated (r) with clay content, organic carbon (OC) and pyrophosphate extractable Fe and Al (0. 48 **, 0. 61 **, 0. 69 ** and 0. 58 **, P < 0. 01). A relatively higher value of NaOH-Po in the subsurface layer and positive correlation with OC (r = 0. 45 **, P < 0. 01) suggests potential mobility of P as soluble organic P in run-off, throughflow and leachate. Phosphorus sorption and its relationship to soil properties was used to assess the potential P release from the catchment soils. Values of P sorption maxima varied from 1111 - 3333 mg/kg for surface soils and 1010 - 2917 mg/kg for subsoils. The P sorption isotherms conformed better to the Freundlich equation than the Langmuir equation. A highly significant negative correlation between CaCl 2 extractable P and Feox in surface soils (r = - 0. 65 **, P < 0. 01) suggests that P was bound to hydrated Fe oxide surfaces and this may determine the concentration and dynamics of loosely bound P equilibrating with leachates and eroded particulate materials. On the other hand, high surface organic matter and the high proportion of total dissolved P in organically bound form may inhibit P sorption on clays and sesquioxides, which would increase P mobility through leaching or runoff losses. The relationship between soil P concentration and degree of P stratification in the top 0 - 10 cm of soils along five toposequences was examined to predict the effect on runoff P losses. The total Colwell-P content of the 0 - 10 cm layer of soils in the catchment was very low in comparison to other studies on P losses from agricultural soils, but soils showed higher P concentration at 0 - 1 cm depth compared to 5 - 10 cm (average 37 mg/kg vs. 19 mg/kg). The higher extractable P concentration in the 0 - 1 cm layer will create a greater P mobilization risk in surface runoff and leachate than analysis of the 0 - 10 cm layer might suggest. Assessment of P risk using the 0 - 10 cm data would still be reliable as P concentration in the 0 - 1 cm layer was linearly related (R 2 = 0. 59) with concentration in the 0 - 10 cm layer. The sampling at varied soil depths will result in different critical P levels for estimating the risk of P enrichment in runoff. In a glasshouse study with intact soil columns, initial high P concentrations in leachate decreased with leaching events suggesting that macropore flow dominated in initial leaching events changing later to matrix flow. The hydraulic behavior of clay and loam soil below 10 cm depends largely on structure and the type of clay minerals and exchangeable Na. Higher levels of exchangeable Na in the subsoil might increase dispersion of clay particles resulting in low permeability leading to ponding of surface water or lateral movement of water at the interface of sand A and clay B horizons. Lateral water movements increase the risk of P losses in the form of DP, dissolved organic P (DOP) or PP. The P concentration in all the P forms (DRP, DOP and TDP) increased significantly with P rates of application (P < 0. 01). The DRP concentration was < 2 mg/l in unfertilized columns but an increase to 11 mg/l was observed with P application at 40 kg P/ha. The higher proportion of DOP relative to DRP and its correlation with TDP indicates that the DOP was the major form of P in leachate. However, the estimation of DOP which was by subtraction of DRP from TDP generally overestimates OP concentration. The TDP load from unfertilized soil was < 0. 20 mg/l in runoff and < 2. 40 mg/l in throughflow but increased with P application (20, 40 kg P/ha) for both packed box and field studies. Under field conditions, higher P loss was found with broadcast P application compared to drill placement. The higher load of DOP as a proportion of TDP and its significant relationship with TDP in runoff (R 2 sand = 0. 81; R 2 clay = 0. 79) and throughflow (R 2 sand = 0. 94; R 2 clay = 0. 98) in field and box studies also suggests DOP was the major form of P loss from soil. Dissolved OP concentration increased significantly with increase in soluble organic carbon (SOC) in soil solution at 5 cm depth (P < 0. 05). Consequently, the amount of organic matter dissolved in soil solution may influence P sorption and mobility. Relatively higher affinity of soil for sorption of DRP compared to DOP might allow DOP to be more mobile through the profile. Higher PP load in clay soil in throughflow indicates subsurface lateral flow along the interface with the horizon of <b>dispersive</b> <b>clay</b> might be an additional risk factor regarding P mobility in clay soils of the catchment. The runoff, throughflow and leachate were dominated by eroded particles of clay and colloidal organic materials. However, the soil solution collected though 0. 1 m pores in the Rhizon samplers had a similar dominance of DOP to the < 0. 45 jum filtered samples in runoff and throughflow. This reduces the likelihood that the so-called DOP fraction was mostly P associated with PP in the 0. 1 to 0. 45 jum size fraction. The composition of DOP in soil solution collected through Rhizon samplers (< 0. 1 jum) might provide important insights for P mobility since this more effectively excluded PP than in the < 0. 45 jum filtrate used for runoff and throughflow samples. The DOP in soil solution (< 0. 1 jum) might be associated with fine colloidal compound such as silicates, metallic hydroxides, humic acids, polysaccharides, fulvic acids and proteins. If so, then most, but not all of the DOP fraction would be organically bound. However, this requires verification. In conclusion, soil P levels across the catchment were never very high when assessed in the 0 - 10 cm layer, but levels in the 0 - 1 cm layer were more than twice as high. Overall, 30 mg/kg (0 - 10 cm) and hydrological connection to streams. In addition, another 7...|$|E
