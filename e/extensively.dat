5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed <b>extensively</b> above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} <b>extensively</b> by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E

5|$|Subfamilies exhibit {{different}} feeding strategies. While Bovinae species graze <b>extensively</b> {{on fresh}} grass and diffused forage, Cephalophinae species (with {{the exception of}} Sylvicapra) primarily consume fruits. Reduncinae and Hippotraginae species depend on unstable food sources, but the latter are specially adapted to arid areas. Members of Caprinae, being flexible feeders, forage even in areas with low productivity. Tribes Alcelaphini, Hippotragini, and Reduncini have high proportions of monocots in their diets. On the contrary, Tragelaphini and Neotragini (with the exception of Ourebia) feed <b>extensively</b> on dicots. No conspicuous relationship exists between body size and consumption of monocots.|$|E
