40|$|The low-aspect ratio, low {{magnetic}} field and {{wide range of}} plasma beta of NSTX plasmas provide new insight into the origins and effects of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>errors.</b> An extensive array of magnetic sensors {{has been used to}} analyse <b>error</b> <b>fields,</b> to measure error-field amplification and to detect resistive wall modes (RWMs) in real time. The measured normalized error-field threshold for the onset of locked modes shows a linear scaling with plasma density, a weak to inverse dependence on toroidal field and a positive scaling with magnetic shear. These results extrapolate to a favourable error-field threshold for ITER. For these low-beta locked-mode plasmas, perturbed equilibrium calculations find that the plasma response must be included to explain the empirically determined optimal correction of NSTX <b>error</b> <b>fields.</b> In high-beta NSTX plasmas exceeding the n = 1 no-wall stability limit where the RWM is stabilized by plasma rotation, active suppression of n = 1 amplified <b>error</b> <b>fields</b> and the correction of recently discovered intrinsic n = 3 <b>error</b> <b>fields</b> have led to sustained high rotation and record durations free of low-frequency core MHD activity. For sustained rotational stabilization of the n = 1 RWM, both the rotation threshold and the magnitude of the amplification are important. At fixed normalized dissipation, kinetic damping models predict rotation thresholds for RWM stabilization to scale nearly linearly with particle orbit frequency. Studies for NSTX find that orbit frequencies computed in general geometry can deviate significantly from those computed in the high-aspect ratio and circular plasma cross-section limit, and these differences can strongly influence the predicted RWM stability. The measured and predicted RWM stability is found to be very sensitive to the E × B rotation profile near the plasma edge, and the measured critical rotation for the RWM is approximately a factor of two higher than predicted by the MARS-F code using the semi-kinetic damping model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{methods of}} the <b>error</b> <b>field</b> {{diagnostics}} are discussed and compared {{from the viewpoint of}} possible application in ITER. The analyzed methods rely on measuring the plasma dynamic response to the finite-amplitude external magnetic perturbations, the error fields and probing pulses. In ITER, such pulses can be created by the coils designed for the static <b>error</b> <b>field</b> correction and for stabilization of the resistive wall modes (RWM), the technique used now in several tokamaks, including DIII-D and JET. Here the estimates for ITER diagnostics are based on the theory predictions for the resonant field amplification (RFA). To achieve the desired level of the <b>error</b> <b>field</b> correction in ITER, the diagnostics must be sensitive to signals of several Gauss. Therefore the measurements should be performed near the plasma stability boundary, where the RFA effect is stronger. While the proximity to the marginal stability is important, the absolute values of plasma parameters are not. This can be used by lowering the stability threshold in diagnostic discharges below the nominal level. The discussed diagnostics is an extension of the ‘active MHD spectroscopy ’ used recently in the DIII-D tokamak and the EXTRAP T 2 R reversed-field pinch...|$|E
