5000|$|As Tom {{arrives at}} the theater, his friend Norman (conductor for the evening) offers Tom {{assurance}} that he will perform well. Shortly thereafter, a house usher hands Tom a <b>folder</b> of <b>sheet</b> music. Within, he finds the manuscript to [...] "La Cinquette" [...] and discards it. During the concert, Tom finds a note written on his sheet music that reads [...] "Play one wrong note and you DIE". Believing {{it to be a}} prank, he ignores it, only to find further notes that threaten Emma, as well as a laser dot that tracks his movement. Disturbed, Tom leaves the stage, shocking the audience. He returns to his dressing room, where he receives a text that instructs him to locate and wear an earpiece, allowing communication with the would-be assassin, Clem. When Tom returns to the stage, Clem demonstrates the stealth and range of his silenced rifle by firing a shot into the floor to Tom's left; no one else notices.|$|R

Three types of documentation must be filled in order for pay to be received: a class book that must be signed, a homework <b>folder,</b> and a <b>sheet</b> which must be filled in with the specific number of hours taught per class level. In addition, there is a timecard which validates that the instructor has shown up at least twenty minutes before the beginning of every class (for the purposes of class preparation).|$|R

40|$|This Thesis {{consists}} of two parts theoretical and practical. The theoretical part forms an integrated theoretical conception that seeks inspiration from Greek myths and offers creative starting points for the practical part which is the creative project of realization of an artist book. There are also described the origins {{and development of the}} mythical tradition in Greece. The main source of inspiration is found in the myths of origin by the epic poet Hésiodos. The mythical perspective on the origin in chaos is enhanced by the views of Pre-Socratic philosophers who influenced by the mythical tradition sought the rational origin, the primaeval existence. The artist book inspired by the myth of origin is produced in a shape of a <b>folder</b> of ten <b>sheets</b> in A 2 format...|$|R
2500|$|The {{highest value}} of a {{miniature}} sheet with a single stamp was Lm2/€4.66. It was issued in 2007 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Caravaggio in Malta. On 30 July 2010 this miniature sheet was overprinted [...] "4TH CENTENARY OF THE DEATH OF CARAVAGGIO 1610–2010" [...] in gold lettering on the margin and with a serial number. This is considered as Malta's rarest miniature sheet, as most were issued in a commemorative folder (of which only 2000 were issued). The remainder of the sheets were sold on first day covers and limited numbers were available at a premium from Castille Square BPO (Valletta), Victoria BPO (Gozo) and the Philatelic Bureau (Marsa). In fact, very few examples are known postally used. Both the <b>folders</b> and the <b>sheets</b> were withdrawn one day later, on 1 August.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about how (automatic) speech {{recognition}} could be used at the ACT Magistrates Court (the Court) in the courtroom. To explore how speech recognition could be used at the Court {{it was necessary to}} understand the work process into which a potential speech recognition system would be integrated. The potential speech recognition system was to aid magistrates at the bench and replace the time-consuming act of writing sentences in long-hand with simply being able to speak them aloud. The magistrates write sentences on a "bench sheet" which is one of many documents in the "defendant's folder". The goal of the speech recognition system was {{to do away with the}} handwritten bench sheet. The first fieldwork that was done was to interview the Chief Magistrate about his work and use of the defendant's folder and observe several magistrates at their work in Court. The Chief Magistrate viewed his work in writing down sentences as "simple". Based on this fieldwork, a proof-of-concept prototype was constructed. A cognitive walk-through of the prototype revealed that it was deficient in a number of areas, particularly in an understanding of the wider work process of the Court. This prompted further fieldwork. Additional fieldwork was done focussing on the use of the defendant's folder and the bench sheet in by other workers in the court. This fieldwork revealed that the defendant's <b>folder</b> and bench <b>sheet</b> were artefacts that embodied the wider work process of the Court. The defendant's folder also acted to support communication and maintain the work process in space and time through out the court. Further, the bench sheet was an essential part of the work process of the Court and was essential to the work of many people in the court. Even the magistrates, who found writing on the bench sheet time consuming, used their notes on the bench sheet from as an aid to their decisions. Eliminating the bench sheet, as the Chief Magistrate had asked, would have necessitated a complete re-structuring of work on the bench as well as in the "back room" of the Court. The final part of this paper describes how a speech recognition system was imagined that could fulfil the requirements to remove the handwritten bench sheet while maintaining as much of the existing work process as possible. This was achieved by working with the errorful nature of speech recognition technology rather than seeking to eliminate it...|$|R
