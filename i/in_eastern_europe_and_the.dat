It was felt across an area of more than two million square kilometers <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, from Saint Petersburg to the Aegean Sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of {{psychiatry}} for political purposes {{was reported to have}} been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease. In many countries political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.|$|E

25|$|From 1958-59 the USA {{surpassed the}} United Kingdom as the {{principal}} market for Australian beef exports. Worldwide demand for beef caused Australian cattle prices to increase by 40% between 1969 and 1974. However, by 1975 world overproduction and political decisions in the USA and Japan led {{to the collapse of}} world beef prices and the decline of beef exports from Australia. Prices remained low until 1979, when new markets were established <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> USSR, and new quotas were negotiated with the USA.|$|E

25|$|The new Russian Ground Forces {{inherited}} {{an increasing}} crime problem from their Soviet predecessors. As draft resistance {{grew in the}} last years of the Soviet Union, the authorities tried to compensate by enlisting men with criminal records and who spoke little or no Russian. Crime rates soared, with the military procurator in Moscow in September 1990 reporting a 40-percent increase in crime over the previous six months, including a 41-percent rise in serious bodily injuries. Disappearances of weapons rose to rampant levels, especially <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Caucasus.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{it all the}} National Guardian {{maintained}} friendly {{ties with}} the Communist Party USA, generally advancing a similar pro-Soviet and anti-militarist political line. The paper differed with the Communist Party primarily {{on the question of}} independent political action, which the CPUSA had abandoned as futile during the 1950s but which the National Guardian continued to support. Additional separation took place after Khrushchev's Secret Speech of 1956, including support of Yugoslav independence from the Soviet bloc and efforts at honest coverage of purges <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Revolution.|$|E

Sobhraj and André quickly became partners in crime, participating in various criminal activities in both Turkey and Greece. The duo were eventually arrested in Athens. After an identity-switch plan went awry, he escaped, but his brother was left behind. André was turned over to the Turkish police by Greek authorities, and served an 18-year sentence.|$|E

25|$|German historians Hans Henning Hahn and Eva Hahn {{have raised}} the issue of the German {{minority}} <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust. They point out that German historians of the expulsions have hardly covered the fate of the German-speaking Jews in the Holocaust. There were many Jews in Eastern Europe who spoke German as a primary language and identified with the German nationality prior to the war, and many others spoke German as a second language. In Czechoslovakia there 46,000 Jews that identified with the German nationality in 1930.|$|E
25|$|The current {{government}} has stated {{its goal of}} strengthening ties with and helping other countries (in particular Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia) {{with the process of}} integration {{with the rest of the}} West.

Romania also declared its public support for Turkey, and Croatia joining the European Union. Because it has a large Hungarian minority, Romania has also developed strong relations with Hungary. Romania opted on 1 January 2007, to adhere the Schengen Area, and its bid to join was approved by the European Parliament in June 2011, but was rejected by the EU Council in September 2011.|$|E
25|$|In 1393 the Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman {{had lost}} Nicopolis— his {{temporary}} capital— to the Ottomans, while his brother, Ivan Stratsimir, still held Vidin {{but had been}} reduced to an Ottoman vassal. In the eyes of the Bulgarian boyars, despots and other independent Balkan rulers, the crusade was a great chance to reverse the course of the Ottoman conquest and free the Balkans from Islamic rule. In addition, the frontline between Islam and Christianity had been moving slowly towards the Kingdom of Hungary. The Kingdom of Hungary was now the frontier between the two religions <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hungarians were in danger of being attacked themselves. The Republic of Venice feared that an Ottoman control of the Balkan peninsula, which included Venetian territories like parts of Morea and Dalmatia, would reduce their influence over the Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea and Aegean Sea. The Republic of Genoa, on the other hand, feared that if the Ottomans were to gain control over River Danube and the Turkish Straits, they would eventually obtain a monopoly over the trade routes between Europe and the Black Sea, where the Genoese had many important colonies like Caffa, Sinop and Amasra. The Genoese also owned the citadel of Galata, located at the north of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, to which Bayezid had laid siege in 1395.|$|E

500|$|Marine Le Pen {{described}} Russian President Vladimir Putin as a [...] "defender of the Christian {{heritage of}} European civilisation." [...] The National Front considers that Ukraine has been subjugated by the United States, through the Ukrainian crisis. The National Front denounces anti-Russian feelings <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> submission of Western Europe to NATO's {{interests in the}} region. Marine Le Pen is very critical against the threats of sanctions directed {{by the international community}} against Russia: [...] "European countries should seek a solution through diplomacy rather than making threats that could lead to an escalation." [...] She argues that the United States is leading a new Cold War against Russia. She sees no other solution for peace in Ukraine than to organize a kind of federation that would allow each region to have a large degree of autonomy. She thinks Ukraine should be sovereign and free as any other nations.|$|E
500|$|Further {{allegations}} of [...] "Bolshevization" [...] were made after Lithuania signed the Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Treaty of 28 September 1926. The treaty was conceived {{by the previous}} government, which had been dominated by the Christian Democrats. However, Christian Democrats voted against the treaty, while Antanas Smetona strongly supported it. It drew sharp criticism as Lithuania exchanged Soviet recognition of its rights to the Vilnius Region for international isolation, as the treaty demanded that Lithuania make no other alliances with other countries. At the time, the Soviet Union was {{not a member of}} the League of Nations; France and the United Kingdom were looking for reliable partners <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Baltic states were contemplating a union on their own. On 21 November, a student demonstration against [...] "Bolshevization" [...] was forcibly dispersed by the police. About 600 Lithuanian students gathered near a communist-led workers' union. The police, fearing armed clashes between the two groups, intervened and attempted to stop the demonstration. Seven police officers were injured and thirteen students were arrested. In an attempt to overthrow the government legally, the Christian Democrats suggested a motion of no confidence in response to the incident, but it was rejected.|$|E
