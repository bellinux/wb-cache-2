5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} architectural {{styles are}} {{visible in the}} Estate. Originally constructed in the Federal style for Henry Bates Grubb between 1800 and 1805, Mount Hope Estate was the most formal ironmaster's mansion built in the area between 1750 and 1850. In 1895, Daisy Grubb oversaw significant changes, adding a Victorian ballroom, a billiard room, chandeliers, and parquet floors, and converting original <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> to sliding doors, while still maintaining much of the original construction, including the original facade and fireplace mantels.|$|E
25|$|Most {{species of}} Ctenizidae live in burrows rather than webs. They live in warm {{places such as}} China, North America, South America, Africa and Japan. They make silk <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> that blend with their habitat. Not {{all members of the}} family use trapdoors.|$|E

On the upstairs galleries they face the opposite wall. Metal and marble memorial plaques line the walls, and a door on the northwest side leads to the tower vestibule.|$|E
25|$|A selfbolting door {{has special}} hinges that permit the panel leaf to move laterally, {{so that the}} door itself becomes a giant bolt for better security. The selfbolting door {{principle}} can be used both for <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> as for rotating doors, as well as up-and-over doors (in the latter case, the bolts are then placed at top and bottom {{rather than at the}} sides).|$|E
25|$|Later {{production}} was Hitachi's standard Type-M steam ship modified (Type-MA) to carry twelve Toku-Daihatsu class landing craft. The landing craft were launched from rails which {{ran along the}} main deck (between port and starboard funnels for those carried forward of the superstructure) down to the waterline through large <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> at the stern. Settsu Maru survived {{for use as a}} repatriation ship, but her sister-ships were sunk in air raids on Japanese ports.|$|E

25|$|The {{suggested}} minimum noise take-off {{technique for}} the HS.141 {{was to use}} full power from the lift engines in a vertical climb to 250ft(76m) then reducing power to 83% to continue this climb to 1,000ft (300m). At this height the aircraft would transition into forward flight using vectored thrust from the lift engines and then accelerate and climb to 2,000ft (600m) using increasing thrust from the cruise engines. By this stage the aircraft would have reached an airspeed of 168knots (310km/h) and would be fully supported by its wings alone, the lift engines being shut down and covered by <b>hinged</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2003 Saturn Ion quad coupe {{production}} car first {{appeared at the}} 2002 New York International Auto Show. The 2003 Ion came standard with a 2.2 L 140hp (104kW) DOHC Ecotec I4 engine. The Ion's instrument panel was mounted on the top center of the dashboard, rather than behind the steering wheel. The Ion is available in sedan level 1, 2, or 3; level three signified a more user friendly setup with power windows and power locks, while lower levels included crank windows and plastic wheel covers. Other extras included fog lights, sunroof, and spoiler. The Saturn Ion Quad Coupe has half-sized rear suicide doors while the sedan has conventionally <b>hinged</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
25|$|The B-57B {{introduced}} {{several other}} major changes. In terms of armaments, {{a total of}} four hardpoints attached to the outer wing panels were installed on this variant, capable of mounting external bombs and rockets; the B-57B was also furnished with a gun armament for strafing attacks, the first 90 aircraft to be produced were equipped with a total of eight 0.50 cal (12.7mm) Browning machine guns installed within the wings, on later aircraft these were substituted for by an arrangement of four 20mm M39 cannon. A new rotary bomb door was adopted on the B-57B, which had originally been designed for the XB-51, replacing the <b>hinged</b> <b>doors,</b> this proved to be faster to open/close as well to reduce buffeting, which in turn improved accuracy and allowed for faster attack speeds. The redesigned bomb bay also enabled faster turnaround times on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Charging {{is through}} an Avcon {{conductive}} connector, provided beneath a <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> {{to the right}} side of the grille. A NiMH pack would take six to eight hours to charge, storing about 30 kW·h, and the charging and discharging is regulated through passive control devices.|$|R

50|$|These spiders live in burrows. Some finish {{these with}} a <b>hinged</b> <b>door.</b> They often push this door up {{and wait for}} passing prey. When they catch it they try not to leave their burrow. Sometimes a burrow has a side tube. It is not certain whether Sinopesa builds burrows.|$|R
25|$|Internal seating {{is made up}} of two pilot {{seats and}} {{additional}} seating for up to 13 passengers or crew in the cabin. The maximum seating arrangement consists of a four-man bench seat facing rearwards behind the pilot seats, facing a five-man bench seat in front of the transmission structure, with two, two-man bench seats facing outwards from the transmission structure {{on either side of the}} aircraft. All passenger seats are constructed of aluminum tube frames with canvas material seats, and are quickly removable and reconfigurable. The cabin may also be configured with up to six stretchers, an internal rescue hoist, auxiliary fuel tanks, spotlights, or many other mission kits. Access to the cabin is via two aft-sliding doors and two small, forward-hinged panels. The doors and hinged panels may be removed for flight or the doors may be pinned open. Pilot access is via individual <b>hinged</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
25|$|The LCA {{had a long}} central {{well section}} fitted with three benches, one centre, one each port and starboard, for seating troops. The side benches were covered by the top deck. The well was divided from the bow by a {{bulkhead}} fitted with two vertically <b>hinged</b> <b>doors.</b> This pair of forward-opening armour-plate doors led to the ramp, which was lowered and raised by a simple arrangement of pulleys and wire. Two rollers on the leading outboard edge providing some freedom of movement for the ramp when it was grounded. Over this ramp troops could come ashore {{in two to three}} minutes, or less if the soldiers and crews were well trained. Immediately behind the bulkhead were the steering shelter on the starboard, and the Lewis gun shelter on the port. The steering shelter was fitted with a telegraph and voice pipe for communication with the stoker, a featherspray control lever, and a fold-up seat. The shelter was protected on all four sides by non-magnetic bulletproof plate surmounted by a hinged double-door roof. Most LCAs were fitted with a compass.|$|E
500|$|To provide {{services}} over the [...] extension, the CLR ordered 24 additional driving motor carriages from the Brush Company, which, when delivered in 1917, were first borrowed by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway {{for use in}} place of carriages ordered for its extension to Watford Junction. The new carriages were the first for tube-sized trains that were fully enclosed, without gated platforms at the rear, and were provided with <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> in the sides to speed-up passenger loading times. To operate with the new stock the CLR converted 48 existing carriages, providing a total of 72 carriages for twelve six-car trains. Modifications made while in use on the Watford extension meant that the new carriages were not compatible {{with the rest of}} the CLR's fleet and they became known as the Ealing stock.|$|E
50|$|Early tonneaus {{normally}} had a rear-facing <b>hinged</b> <b>door,</b> but {{single and}} dual side doors were soon introduced. The first US side-door tonneau {{was made by}} Peerless, and others quickly followed. This {{led to the development}} of the modern sedan/saloon, with Cadillac manufacturing the first US production closed-body four-door car in 1910.|$|R
5000|$|Many flexure {{bearings}} {{are made}} of a single part; two rigid structures joined by a thin [...] "hinge" [...] area. A <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> can be created by implementing a flexible element between a door and the door frame, such that the flexible element bends allowing the door to pivot open.|$|R
50|$|This design {{places the}} {{clothes in a}} {{vertically}} mounted perforated basket that is contained within a water-retaining tub, with a finned water-pumping agitator {{in the center of}} the bottom of the basket.

2500|$|In 1960 the {{corrugated}} Citroën H Van style [...] "ripple bonnet" [...] of convex swages {{was replaced}} (except for the Sahara), with one using six larger concave swages and looked similar {{until the end}} of production. The 2CV had suicide doors in front from 1948 to 1964, replaced with front <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> from 1965 to 1990.|$|E

The aircraft can be equipped with engines ranging from [...] The standard engine used is the [...] Continental IO-520 four-stroke powerplant. The design includes improvements over the Cessna, including vertically <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> and longer span flaps combined with shorter span ailerons, {{in a similar manner}} to the Cessna 206.|$|E
2500|$|The 8750 Class, or 87xx class, {{were first}} built in 1933, using an updated design which {{included}} an improved cab {{with a higher}} roof, rectangular windows and grills (as opposed to the round windows, or [...] "spectacles", of the initial design), and sliding shutters and <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> for more protection from the elements. The new style cab {{was derived from the}} sister 5400 class, the first of which were built in 1931. Vacuum brakes, steam heating, and ATC were fitted as standard (except for Nos. 6750–79, built between 1946 and 1950, which were fitted with steam brakes and three link couplings only). The locomotive weight increased to , and the axle load increased to [...]|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} NES, meanwhile, {{featured a}} front-loading cartridge {{covered by a}} small, <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> that can be opened to insert or remove a cartridge and closed at other times.

50|$|The term Nader bolt is a {{nickname}} for the bolt on vehicles {{that allows a}} <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> to remain safely latched and closed. It is named after consumer rights advocate and politician Ralph Nader, who in 1965 released the book Unsafe at Any Speed which claimed that American cars were fundamentally flawed with respect to operator safety.|$|R
50|$|It had an {{electrically}} actuated tricycle undercarriage, {{the main}} wheels retracting inwards into the wings. The cabin had seats {{for four or}} five, two at the front and a bench seat behind. In a proposed air ambulance configuration, the Antilope would have carried two stretchers and a medic. Access to the cabin was via a large rear <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> on the starboard side.|$|R
2500|$|The Wiscasset car shop {{completed}} {{a number of}} rebuilding projects starting with conversion of six of the original flatcars to boxcars {{during the first year}} of railroad stations. [...] The shop then rebuilt one end of smoking car #4 into a baggage compartment. [...] After the smoking car burst into flame in 1904, its trucks were used under the caboose. [...] The caboose was renumbered from 26 to 301 after its cupola was removed. [...] Excursion car #7 was converted to a replacement combination RPO-smoking car in 1906. [...] The 28-foot gondolas were rebuilt as flatcars when the 30-foot gondolas were delivered, and the 30-foot gondolas were rebuilt as simple flatcars within a year. [...] Box cars #65, 72 and 73 were rebuilt with <b>hinged</b> <b>doors,</b> insulated walls, and 2 windows for use as cream cars carrying an attendant to load and record milk cans. [...] As the 28-foot boxcars needed repair, they were rebuilt to the full height of the 30-foot boxcars and renumbered in the 300 series with special purpose modifications. [...] Cars #302-304 had end doors and six windows on each side for use as express cars in passenger train service. [...] Many later cars of the 300 series contained stoves to keep potatoes from freezing during winter shipment. [...] Ten of the 28-foot flatcars were rebuilt in 1910 as heated insulated boxcars #501-510 for potato loading. [...] Boxcars #509 was rebuilt with <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> for cream car service after car #73 was destroyed in 1913. [...] Flatcar #10 was rebuilt in 1913 with a derrick for placing riprap. [...] The remaining three 28-foot flatcars were rebuilt in 1916 into express cars #80-82 with end doors and 6-foot-wide side doors. [...] Combination #6 was converted to an express car by removing interior features and placing protective bars across the windows.|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the engine}} the cabin, under the wing, is {{accessed}} via top <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> on both sides. [...] There is a separate, port side door for baggage. The flat {{sides of the}} fuselage taper to the tail. [...] Several undercarriage configurations are available; for land based operations the Tundra builder can choose between tricycle and tailwheel gear. Both use spring cantilever main legs, with large, low pressure tires for work off soft ground; these legs are positioned at the attachment point of the wing struts for the conventional arrangement and further aft for the tricycle gear. Floats can also be fitted, with their main attachment {{at the base of}} the struts and with secondary float struts further aft. [...] Amphibious floats (Montana 2800) may be used. [...] The Tundra may also be equipped with skis. [...] Takeoff roll distances with wheels, skis, and floats are respectively 125 m, 200 m, and 400 m (400ft, 650ft, and 1300ft).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> open to vividly colored {{interior}} panels. The central {{focal point}} is the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints; the left panel depicts the decapitation of John the Baptist with John the Evangelist opposite on the right. As a devotional piece it presents a narrative, meant to emulate a vision the donors or viewers would experience when viewing the inside panels. Unlike most altarpieces of these types, Memling's fails to present a single unifying iconographical focus and is quite generalized with themes that seem unsuited for its specific location, according to Blum. She speculates the donors may have chosen the specific iconography, which [...] "celebrated intercessory saints on the interior". It is an unusual painting in {{that it seems to}} [...] "have served a double function: that of personal propitiation and that of public altarpiece, which portrayed the role of the religious community within the hospital and venerated the saints who might particularly favor the sick". The iconography reflects the hospital's brothers' and sisters' existence, with quiet devotion juxtaposed against the active battle against illness, borne out in the choice of patron saints. [...] John the Evangelist with book in hand, represents the quiet, contemplative life; John the Baptist's beheading is a scene of action, and, according to Blum, [...] "the final dramatic end {{to one of the most}} active lives of any Christian saint".|$|E
