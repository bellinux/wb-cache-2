5|$|Still, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, {{as well as}} {{a number}} of other pro-Soviet Russian {{politicians}} and commentators, continue to deny all Soviet guilt, call the released documents fakes, <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original Soviet version—Polish prisoners were shot by Germans in August 1941—is the correct one, and call on the Russian government to start a new investigation that would revise the findings of the one concluded in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} {{what is going}} on with Michael. They both see it as a coping mechanism, and both <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E
5|$|More tornadic {{damage was}} {{reported}} in southern Durham and Killingworth, with some homes severely damaged, {{but there were some}} minor injuries, one young woman in Killingworth was injured by shards of glass from a breaking window. Some sources <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wallingford tornado dissipated a few miles west of the town, and this was an entirely separate tornado, but without a modern damage survey it is impossible to tell. The parent storm finally moved out over the ocean around 8 PM.|$|E
50|$|Several {{hours later}} the Man in Grey meets M. Moulin {{to discuss the}} situation.

5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any {{notion that the}} German Empire has any place in dictating the terms of peace. The authors also <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German populace must accept some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} the German government. The authors maintain that immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as the German state would potentially dictate the process from a position of diplomatic and military power. Instead, the manifesto proclaims that the war must be continued so that the German state loses its military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Under hypnosis, Scully {{recalls the}} Rebels burning her fellow abductees, {{as well as}} a Colonist {{spacecraft}} killing the Rebels and abducting Cassandra. During a meeting with Walter Skinner, Mulder continues to <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> events have been orchestrated by the military and not by aliens. Meanwhile, the Russian vaccine seems to have no effect on Marita. The First Elder tells the Well-Manicured Man that they have already decided to turn the Rebel over to the Colonists. Jeffrey shows Scully a video of him talking about aliens while under hypnosis while he was a child, claiming his mother had forced him to make those statements.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E

Petraeus <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> problems in Afghanistan were {{more complicated than}} the ones he had faced in Iraq during his tour and required removing widespread sanctuaries and strongholds.|$|R

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{of how to}} end the first season, two things were clear to Alfred Gough and Miles Millar: the final episode would have the school prom, {{and there would be}} tornadoes. Although Jeph Loeb's Superman For All Seasons, which inspired Gough and Millar when they created the show, contains an event where a tornado hits Smallville, the pair <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tornado idea came from a story they overheard on the radio about a tornado that hit a high school during their prom night. The episode would mark the departure of Eric Johnson as series star Whitney Fordman, though he would return as a special guest in seasons two and four.|$|E

5|$|Cardinal de Bernis {{entered the}} {{conclave}} {{at the end}} of March and took the leadership of the anti-Jesuit faction from the hands of Cardinal Orsini, who could have blocked Zelanti’s actions only with the great difficulties. Bernis immediately established a regular correspondence with French ambassador Marquis d'Aubeterre, which was in violation of the fundamental law of the conclave. Ambassadors of France and Spain urged Bernis to <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the Jesuits. Bernis refused, answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the Society of Jesus would be in violation of the canon law. In spite of this refusal, during the next few weeks Bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by Zelanti as too devoted to the Jesuits. In this way twenty-three out of twenty-eight papabile were eliminated, among them strongly pro-Jesuit Cardinal Fantuzzi, who at some point was very close to achieving election to the papal throne, as well as Cavalchini, Colonna, Stoppani, Pozzobonelli, Sersale, and several others.|$|E
5|$|In the fourth-season premiere, Ross and Rachel briefly {{reconcile}} after Ross {{pretends to}} read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him, but continues to <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two were on a break so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey forgives Chandler only after he spends a day in a box as punishment. Phoebe becomes a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp). Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between the girls. Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and the season finale features their wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel decides to attend Ross and Emily's wedding. While saying his vows, Ross uses the wrong name at the altar (Rachel's), to the shock of his bride and the guests.|$|E
5|$|Universal Pictures {{reported}} that it greenlit American Gangster with a budget of $80million, which escalated to $93million, with $10million for development costs and $3million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> budget was $93million from the beginning. The studio also sought for American Gangster to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production {{was moved to the}} city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.|$|E
50|$|The date of {{the text}} may have been early 2nd century. By the late 2nd century, Irenaeus and 2nd Timothy 2:18 had come to {{dominate}} Catholic and Orthodox thinking. Irenaeus <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resurrection was not simply spiritual, but rather a literal restoration of the flesh, and Timothy <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resurrection was still in <b>the</b> future, and <b>that</b> those who believed otherwise were heretics.|$|R

5|$|In Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the appellants {{had been}} {{detained}} without trial under section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act ("ISA") for alleged {{involvement in a}} Marxist conspiracy to subvert and destabilize the country. The detention orders were subsequently suspended under section 10 of the Act, but the suspensions were revoked following {{the release of a}} press statement by the appellants in which they denied being Marxist conspirators. Having applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for writs of habeas corpus to be issued, the appellants appealed against the ruling. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the narrow ground that the Government had not adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proving the President was satisfied that the appellants' detention was necessary to prevent them from endangering, among other things, Singapore's security or public order, which was required by section 8(1) of the ISA before the Minister for Home Affairs could make detention orders against them. However, in a lengthy obiter discussion, the Court held that an objective rather than a subjective test should apply to the exercise of discretion by the authorities under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. In other words, the executive could not <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exercise of the discretion was unchallengeable. The exercise of discretion could be reviewed by the court, and the executive had to satisfy the court that there were objective facts justifying its decision.|$|E
