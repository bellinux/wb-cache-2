Mary Smallwood {{wrote that}} good {{relations}} with the diaspora community did not mean that the Jews of Palestine were content with Zenobia's reign, and her rule was apparently opposed in that region. The Terumot tells the story of Rabbi [...] "Ammi" [...] and Rabbi [...] "Samuel bar Nahmani", who visited Zenobia's court and asked for the release of a Jew ("Zeir bar Hinena") detained on her orders. The queen refused, saying: [...] "Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to save him? He teaches that your creator performs miracles for you. Why not let God save him?" [...] During Aurelian's destruction of Palmyra, Palestinian conscripts with [...] "clubs and cudgels" [...] (who may have been Jews) played a vital role in Zenobia's defeat and the destruction of her city.|$|E

The {{instrumental}} {{portion of the}} song {{is based on the}} end credits theme of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), a video game which Jackson and his tour keyboardist Brad Buxer were brought in to compose music for. Conflicting accounts state that Jackson either dropped out of the project after scandals involving him arose around this time or because of his own personal dissatisfaction with the limitations of the Sega Genesis's sound chip. The lyrics for the song are based upon a poem written by Jackson. A background guitar was played by Steve Lukather while keyboards, synthesizers and bass are credited to David Paich and Steve Porcaro. Originally, HIStory was planned as a greatest hits release, with a few new tracks. However, Jackson and his collaborators were so pleased with the result of [...] "Stranger in Moscow" [...] that they decided to give HIStory a full studio album as the second disc. Jackson used elements of Russian imagery and symbolism to help promote the concept of fear and alienation in the track, in a similar fashion to Simply Red's album Love and the Russian Winter several years later. It concludes with a narrative, spoken in Russian, by a KGB interrogator (Ed Wiesnieski). The narrative, translated into English is, [...] "Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> from the west? Confess! To steal the great achievements of the people, the accomplishments of the workers...".|$|E
