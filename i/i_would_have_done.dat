500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always seems to me that, were I in their places, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better. But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does not occur to me. Every time I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> or said.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{limitations}} of devising the album's musical direction {{on a tour}} bus forced Reznor to work differently from usual. Reznor said, [...] "I didn't have guitars around {{because it was too}} much hassle... It was another creative limitation...

500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it {{and no one else}} would. Unable to find other writing work, he later said that, [...] "If they had asked me to write Barbie, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that, too." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. The club won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th {{official}} trophy. During {{the last week}} of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key in the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision from the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, [...] "If I was in charge, maybe <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> things differently," [...] while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, [...] "We must start again from zero." ...|$|E

500|$|Einstein did {{not work}} on the Manhattan Project. The Army denied him the work {{clearance}} needed in July 1940, saying his pacifist leanings made him a security risk, although {{he was allowed to}} work as a consultant to the United States Navy's Bureau of Ordnance. He had no knowledge of the atomic bomb's development, and no influence on the decision for the bomb to be dropped. [...] According to Linus Pauling, Einstein later regretted signing the letter because it led to the development and use of the atomic bomb in combat, adding that Einstein had justified his decision because of the greater danger that Nazi Germany would develop the bomb first. [...] In 1947 Einstein told Newsweek magazine that [...] "had I known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography she wrote, [...] "It {{was a unique}} feeling that I had for [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> anything for him." [...] Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how [...] "blindingly" [...] in love Hepburn was with the actor. The relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs. Meeting when she was 34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting {{that she was a}} lesbian, but Hepburn said she [...] "knew right away that I found him irresistible." [...] Tracy remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Hepburn did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous {{influence}} inclined {{his grandson}} toward the Democratic Party. Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, {{was from a}} Democratic family. In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge {{that by the time}} they opened their practice in Burlington, Iowa, [...] "you were two-thirds of a Democrat"; living in heavily Democratic Iowa Territory further distanced him from Whiggery. He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor, and in February 1843, he was named to the Des Moines County Democratic committee. A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had [...] "become loco-foco", he said, [...] "I felt as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." [...] On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married Mary Cyrene Burch, ending his time in Iowa.|$|E

500|$|Breckinridge {{remained}} in Lexington while deciding {{where to begin}} practice, borrowing law books from the library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden's father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, {{but was unable to}} find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, he and former classmate Thomas W. Bullock departed for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841 seeking better opportunities. Journeying westward, they considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in Jacksonville, Illinois, but they found the bar stocked with able men like Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They continued on to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842–1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of Des Moines County. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew's party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, [...] "I felt as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E

500|$|Giving {{evidence}} [...] to the tribunal, S. O. Davies said he {{had long}} suspected that the Aberfan tips were unstable, but had kept quiet for fear that if tipping was stopped on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery. Davies added: [...] "But if I {{had been asked to}} do so, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it". His testimony was strongly challenged by the NUM, whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that [...] "f Mr Davies is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster". However, Gibbens found it incredible that a man in Davies's unique local position of authority and influence would not have mentioned his fears to any of the formal bodies—borough council, Coal Board, union or local Labour Party: [...] "If anyone could have exercised influence to overcome an obdurate or ignorant monolith like the Coal Board, [...] was well placed to do so." [...] Gibbens submitted that Davies's testimony should be rejected, on the grounds that he [...] "never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words". The tribunal concurred, accepting that Davies had not fully understood the gravity of his admission, and adding that had they been convinced otherwise, he could not have escaped censure. The tribunal's findings, published in July 1967, placed responsibility for the disaster firmly on the National Coal Board, specifically on the absence of any tipping policy.|$|E
500|$|In early {{planning}} stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith {{was to be}} one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E
500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them to ask me to come on and act—then they just wanted me to come on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E

500|$|With Rolling Stone, Clemons {{described}} how he recorded the saxophone solo with Gaga. In January 2011, Clemons was putting together an exercise machine in his Florida house {{when his wife}} told him that Gaga's representatives were on the phone, and {{they wanted him to}} play on her upcoming album. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that {{he would be able to}} record it on the coming week, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. After accepting her request, Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "Hair". Before Clemons started work on the song, she explained the lyrics to him. [...] "It made so much sense," [...] he said. [...] "It's a story about growing up." [...] She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song, saying [...] "'We'll put the tape on and you just play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.'". The recording was finished by 3:00 am, after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised for [...] "getting paid for this. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." [...] According to the sheet music [...] published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time. It is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals span from F3 to F5, and the song follows a basic sequence of F–C–Dm–B as its chord progression.|$|E
