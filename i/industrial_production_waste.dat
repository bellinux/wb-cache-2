40|$|Prevention and recycling, {{instead of}} dumping, of {{industrial}} wastes {{is the primary}} goal of recent West German environmental laws (Abfallgesetz and BundesImissionsSchutzGesetz). Current levels of industrial waste generation are unacceptable and the management of production facilities will be forced by law to use all possibilities for reducing their waste output and for recycling. This study presents a general view of amount, origin and environmental relevance of the most significant hazardous and nonhazardous wastes in the West German state of Baden-Würtemberg. The investigation deals not only with <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> <b>wastes,</b> but also discarded consumer goods (washing machines, computers, etc.) Several wastes, which represent serious disposal problems and for which recycling or prevention technologies are available, are selected for further investigation. Included in the study is a brief description of such technologies as well as an economic method to compare them based on annual cost and optimal investment time estimation.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} an asphalt mixture is largely {{dependent on the}} properties of its constituents {{and by the way}} they reciprocally interact in the bituminous layer. In particular, the stress-strain response of the road pavements is closely related to the rheological behavior of the bituminous binder and of its interaction with the finest part of the lytic skeleton. Therefore, it is important to study in the laboratory by means of advanced rheological tests, how mastics (Bitumen-Filler Systems) and mortars (Bitumen-Filler-Sand Systems) react to dynamic loads and thermal stresses. Moreover, the understanding of the contacts mechanisms within the bitumen-filler system, through 3 D micro-mechanical models, should allow for a deeper analysis of the mastic rheological behavior. Based on these considerations, in a socio-economic context in which it is necessary to reduce the environmental impact caused by the construction and maintenance of transportation infrastructures, bituminous mastics containing different reclaimed fillers from the <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> <b>wastes</b> were studied. For this purpose, advanced rheological tests have been first validated and then implemented and combined with the 3 D DEM models development. Results showed that the methods used to study the bituminous mastics and mortars allowed to understand the effects due to the addition of innovative and recycled fillers within the mixtures blend, highlighting as these can increase the asphalt mixture performance during its service life...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of Taguchi Robust Design to Lean Production System to analyse <b>Industrial</b> <b>production</b> <b>wastes.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to present robust design approach that reduces and possibly eliminate losses to the society that arise due to variations leading to <b>wastes</b> in <b>production</b> processes. Past literatures were reviewed and applied to case study Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company (IVM) for the purpose of this study. The application of the Taguchi robust design approach to IVM motor production processes revealed that over-production, excess inventory, defects, and over-processing are the major wastes that are impeding their progress and profitability. The successful application of Taguchi robust design using Design Expert software to analyse two production periods produced varying results, and also revealed Over-production and Excess inventory as the highest forms of wastes in the firm. In IVM’s first three months of production, over-production had the highest percentage of waste contribution of 87. 96, followed by excess inventory, defects, and over-processing with 5. 57, 4. 77, and 1. 71 respectively, although the same findings were made in the last modelling, but the values of their percentage waste contributions varied.

By looking at the soprum[2] is possible to see estrange combinations for instance baby pap packages with liquor bottles, political propaganda together with brochures advertising winter sports, a table with beer cans and a painting it. It is a composition in itself is a sort of collage where all possible come together. I found inspiring how waste could be classified from one criterion but mixed in other criteria like the cultural and semiotic one. Although there are differences between neighborhoods and municipalities, the half-ton of garbage produced by a Swedish citizen per year is classified by if the material could be recycled, composted, burn, landfilled or if it is hazardous for the environment or humans[3]. I put the waste together in order to create structures that further on could be used to build either furniture or spaces. I worked only with materials that were classified in the same category for instance newspapers or uncolored glass, keeping as much as possible the original form of the existing material {{in order to be able}} to see their original meaning or purpose. I noticed that the material transform to something new while keeping some of their form and semiotic properties when it is covered with a sort of layer. Something that reminds me the landfill, where the material is buried and then it is a new beginning but there is some transformation in the landscape that never would be the same. This is more an intervention in the materials in their way to their following step either landfill, recycling, burn or compost. The form and statement is the result of consumption from Stockholm where the material was collected and my own aesthetic intentions.

The carbon (ZN-AC 600) produced from pyrolysis of ZnCl 2 -FPW at 600 degrees C is essentially microporous carbon whose BET surface area and pore volume could reach 1143 m 2 /g and 0. 61 mL/g, respectively.

The {{article is}} aimed: 1) {{to develop the}} coal coating {{solution}} in open railway cars or to cover coal piles to minimize the coal dust losses; 2) creating a mathematical model {{of the process of}} the solution feeding to the surface of coal. Methodology. To solve this problem, it was developed a special solution containing cheap industrial wastes and semiproducts of chemical industries. It was conducted a physical experiment to assess the intensity of coal dust loss when using the developed solution. A mathematical model based {{on the use of the}} motion equations of the ideal fluid and mass transfer was developed. The developed numerical models are the basis of the application program package created for assessing the quality of processing the coal surface by special solution. Findings. The results of the conducted physical experiment to assess the magnitude of the coal dust loss on the model of the coal pile in the processing of its surface with a special solution and without processing are presented in the article. It is shown that the application of the proposed solution for surface processing of coal can significantly reduce the coal dust loss. This makes it possible to reduce the amount of economic losses and reduce the level of air dust pollution in work areas. The results of computational experiments carried out on the basis of the constructed numerical models are presented in the article. Originality. Authors proposed a new solution for the coal surface processing in order to minimize the removal of pulverized coal from the coal pile, which substantially reduces the coal losses. There were created numerical models to take into account the relevant factors influencing the solution dispersion process in the atmosphere from coal processing in gondola cars. Practical value. Solution, proposed in the article has a low price, because it can be created on the basis of <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> <b>wastes.</b> Application of this solution can significantly reduce the intensity of coal dust losses from the surface of the coal pile. There were considered effective numerical models «diagnostic models» for rapid calculation of cargo processing in gondola cars with the solution.

The constructed numerical models can be used for scientific substantiation of the parameters of cargo processing with various forms of its surfaces in the gondola car...|$|R

Because of the large delay which may lead to serious disasters [8, 11, 18, 24, 36, 47], such as monitoring of industrial boiler temperature and industrial furnace metallurgy, if the control is not timely, may lead to explosion of the boiler, the product quality {{does not meet the}} requirements and results in <b>waste.</b> It affects <b>production</b> schedule, <b>wastes</b> <b>production</b> material, destroys <b>industrial</b> <b>production</b> equipment, and seriously causes death to people.
