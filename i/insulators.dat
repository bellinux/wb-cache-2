Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond.

40|$|Nuclear foci of {{chromatin}} binding factors are, in many cases, {{discussed as}} sites of long-range chromatin interaction in the three-dimensional nuclear space. <b>Insulator</b> binding proteins {{have been shown}} to aggregate into <b>insulator</b> bodies, which are large structures not involved in insulation; however, the more diffusely distributed <b>insulator</b> speckles have not been analysed in this respect.

They differ in number and three-dimensional location with only 26 % of the Polycomb bodies overlapping with CP 190. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes to identify long-range interaction (kissing) of the Hox gene clusters Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) and Bithorax complex (BX-C), we found the frequency of interaction to be very low. However, these rare kissing events were associated with <b>insulator</b> speckles at a significantly shorter distance and an increased speckle number.

5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent <b>insulators</b> during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good <b>insulators</b> of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E
5|$|Some of astatine's {{reported}} {{properties are}} nonmetallic. It has the narrow liquid range ordinarily associated with nonmetals (mp 302°C; bp 337°C). Batsanov gives a calculated band gap energy for astatine of 0.7eV; {{this is consistent}} with nonmetals (in physics) having separated valence and conduction bands and thereby being either semiconductors or <b>insulators.</b> The chemistry of astatine in aqueous solution is mainly characterised by the formation of various anionic species. Most of its known compounds resemble those of iodine, which is a halogen and a nonmetal. Such compounds include astatides (XAt), astatates (XAtO3), and monovalent interhalogen compounds.|$|E

This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped <b>insulators.</b> The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} and dense form of {{selenium}} is gray {{and has a}} hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se-Se distance is 237.3pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1°. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are <b>insulators,</b> gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic <b>insulators</b> are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E
40|$|We study a {{model of}} a {{covalent}} band <b>insulator</b> with on-site Coulomb repulsion at half-filling using dynamical mean-field theory. Upon increasing the interaction strength the system undergoes a discontinuous transition from a correlated band <b>insulator</b> to a Mott <b>insulator</b> with hysteretic behavior at low temperatures. Increasing the temperature in the band <b>insulator</b> close to the insulator-insulator transition we find a crossover to a Mott <b>insulator</b> at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, correlations decrease the energy gap in the correlated band <b>insulator.</b> The gap renormalization {{can be traced to the}} low-frequency behavior of the self-energy, analogously to the quasiparticle renormalization in a Fermi liquid.

5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} <b>insulators,</b> diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering.

Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal conductivity of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} power-related {{incident}} than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services {{on both the}} North South and East West lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. The disruption lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 250,000 commuters. This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into {{the cause of the}} disruption. The cause was identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station. Consequently, a program was implemented to replace <b>insulators</b> liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 disruption, LTA imposed a higher penalty of S$5.4 million on SMRT.|$|E

In the presence of disorder, the bulk of the topological phase is either a band <b>insulator</b> or an Anderson <b>insulator.</b> Both of them can protect edge states from backscattering.
