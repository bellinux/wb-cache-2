5000|$|Reflecting the {{increasing}} American influence, {{a new set}} of distinctive uniforms was introduced for the MRL in the early 1960s. Laotian naval senior officers and petty officers adopted a Navy Blue overseas service uniform, which consisted of a double-breasted reefer jacket (French: Vareuse) with open collar and lapels, and featuring two <b>internal</b> <b>skirt</b> pockets with external flaps. The jacket had a double row of six gilt metal buttons bearing the Royal Lao Armed Forces (FAR) wreathed [...] "Vishnu" [...] trident, and was worn with a white shirt and black tie, completed with matching blue trousers. Enlisted personnel also received a Navy Blue service uniform, consisting of a Navy jumper and trousers flared as [...] "bell bottoms"; the jumper was worn with a black silk neckerchief rolled diagonally under the collar, with the ends tied in a square knot {{in the center of the}} chest.For formal occasions, Laotian Navy officers retained the earlier ANL white summer cotton full dress, which consisted of a French-style eight-buttoned tunic with a standing collar and two built-in side pockets closed by straight flaps, worn with matching white slacks. The tunic's front fly was secured by gilt metal buttons initially bearing the ANL Airavata crest, replaced after 1959-60 by a FAR wreathed [...] "Vishnu" [...] trident motif.|$|E
5000|$|MRK senior {{officers}} and petty officers adopted a Navy Blue overseas service uniform, {{which consisted of}} a double-breasted reefer jacket (link=no) with open collar and lapels, and featuring two <b>internal</b> <b>skirt</b> pockets with external flaps. The jacket had a narrow double row of four gilt metal anchor motif buttons, and was worn with {{a white shirt and}} black tie, completed with matching blue trousers. This uniform was seldom seen in Cambodia, being worn only by officers or officer candidate students attending courses overseas, e.g. when in France or in the US.Instead, MRK Officers serving in-country received the standard FARK summer dress uniform in white cotton, which was patterned after the French Army M1946/56 khaki dress uniform (link=no). The jacket had two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps and two unpleated at the side closed by straight ones whilst the sleeves had false turnbacks; the front fly and pocket flaps were secured by gilt buttons bearing the royal coat-of-arms. It was worn with a white shirt and black tie on formal occasions.For parades and honor guards, Naval Infantry officers and enlisted men were given a special full dress white cotton uniform, which consisted of a tunic with standing collar featuring a five-buttoned front secured by gilt buttons, worn with matching white slacks. [...] Cambodian Marine officers and enlisted men were issued the same French all-arms M1947 drab green fatigues (link=no) as their Royal Army counterparts.|$|E
40|$|Two- and {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} analyses are performed {{to identify the}} optimal <b>internal</b> <b>skirt</b> spacing for the maximum undrained capacity of subsea skirted mudmats. Fully three-dimensional loading (vertical, biaxial horizontal, biaxial moment and torsion) is considered for subsea mudmats with skirt embedment ranging from 5 % to 20 % of the foundation breadth in soil {{with a range of}} linearly increasing strength with depth. The results have identified the governing case for determining the optimal skirt spacing for mudmats subjected to fully three-dimensional loading. It is also shown that optimal skirt spacing for rectangular or square mudmats can be determined in plane strain conditions using the equivalent foundation embedment ratio. The number of internal skirts required to ensure soil plug rigidity under fully three-dimensional loading is presented as a function of skirt embedment ratio, soil heterogeneity index and vertical load mobilisation. Results also indicate that effects of skirt roughness become negligible as foundation embedment ratio increases in terms of determining the optimal skirt spacing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. </p...|$|E
40|$|The CLVSTATE {{engineering}} code {{is being}} used to predict Ares-I launch vehicle first stage reentry aerodynamic heating. An engineering analysis is developed which yields reasonable predictions for the timing of the first stage aft skirt thermal curtain failure and the resulting internal gas temperatures. The analysis is based on correlations of the Ares I-X <b>internal</b> aft <b>skirt</b> gas temperatures and has been implemented into CLVSTATE. Validation of the thermal curtain opening models has been accomplished using additional Ares I-X thermocouple, calorimeter and pressure flight data. In addition, a technique which accounts for radiation losses at high altitudes has been developed which improves the gas temperature measurements obtained by the gas temperature probes (GTP). Updates to the CLVSTATE models are shown to improve the accuracy of the <b>internal</b> aft <b>skirt</b> heating predictions which will result in increased confidence in future vehicle design...|$|R
40|$|Water impact drop {{tests were}} {{performed}} on the space shuttle solid rocket boosters (SRB). Peak water impact pressures and pressure/time traces were measured for various impact velocities using a two-dimensional, full-scale SRB aft <b>skirt</b> <b>internal</b> ring model. Passive burst disc-type pressure transducers were calibrated for use on flight SRB's. The effects on impact pressure of small ring configuration changes and application of thermal protection system cork layers {{were found to be}} negligible...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to utilize and expand the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) orbital flight test data base for better predictions of future flight environments. There were five tasks associated with this effort: analyze the <b>internal</b> aft <b>skirt</b> wind tunnel data and incorporate it into a data base for generating design and preflight reeentry thermal environments; generate reentry design thermal environments for the SRB steel case with the nozzle extension off; generate reentry design thermal environments for the SRB Filament Wound Case with the nozzle extension off; develop an engineering tool to analyze the 3 -D flowfield around the SRB aft skirt during reentry {{for the purpose of}} obtaining the frequency and severity of the belching gas intrusion internal to the aft skirt; and perform SRM transient joint flow analysis for subscale and full scale motor firing as well as determine the effects of debonds of the insulation on the fill time and heating within the field joint insulation. In addition, this work was extended to provide support for the 51 L Shuttle SRB failure analysis...|$|R
40|$|Finite-element limit {{analysis}} {{is used to}} identify the critical <b>internal</b> <b>skirt</b> spacing for the undrained failure of shallow skirted foundations under conditions of plane strain based on the criterion that the confined soil plug should ideally displace as a rigid block, such that optimal bearing capacity is realized. General loading (vertical, horizontal, and moment) is considered for foundations with skirt embedments ranging from 5 to 50 % of the foundation breadth in soil having either uniform strength or strength proportional to depth. The results explicitly identify the number of internal skirts required to ensure soil plug rigidity under arbitrary combinations of horizontal and moment loading expressed {{as a function of}} the normalized skirt embedment and the maximum expected level of vertical loading as a fraction of the ultimate vertical bearing capacity. It is shown that fewer internal skirts are required with increasing normalized foundation embedment, butmore internal skirts are required with increasing soil strength heterogeneity. The results also indicate the potential for a significant reduction in capacity if insufficient skirts are provided, such that plastic deformation is permitted to occur within the soil plug. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers. </p...|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has four rooms with fireplaces to both north rooms and a central entry {{to the east and}} west. The northeast room has cedar cupboards either side of the fireplace and the northwest room has an early timber staircase to the attic. The floor consists of a recent 20mm concrete slab laid over sand on a bed of original brick bats. Walls are lime plastered with horse hair, and have original concrete <b>skirting.</b> <b>Internal</b> timber doors are not original. The attic has a recent ensuite at the north end, and a single Velux roof window has been inserted on the southwestern side.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{increased}} {{investment in}} flood defences, {{it is not}} economically viable to protect all at risk properties {{from the threat of}} flooding. This has led to a move towards encouraging property owners to take their own steps in making their homes or businesses less vulnerable to flooding. For example, the UK Government has introduced a grant aid scheme to encourage property level flood protection and has called for the development of new innovative flood approaches and products. Examining the effectiveness of current flood protection products including both resistance and resilience measures, with regard to water ingress, installation cost and acceptance by homeowners, reveals shortcomings with the existing measures. To address this issue, a novel solution is proposed that combines resistance and resilience adapted basement waterproofing, using an <b>internal</b> hollow <b>skirting</b> system (patent protected GB- 2449777 and GB- 2452423) to address the ingress of floodwaters into properties with solid floors. The method does not attempt to resist floodwaters but manages the water using ways that homeowners can appreciate. It is easy to install and is affordable in line with current grant aid. Furthermore, the new system can be installed in both existing and new build properties and, in doing so, offers complete property flood level protection. It is concluded that the new system may provide a practical solution towards the uptake of property level flood adaptation measures...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{rocket booster}} cavity {{collapse}} flight measurements included external {{pressures on the}} motor case and aft <b>skirt,</b> <b>internal</b> motor case pressures, accelerometers located in the forward skirt, mid-body area, and aft skirt, as well as strain gages located on {{the skin of the}} motor case. This flight data yielded applied pressure longitudinal and circumferential distributions which compare well with model test predictions. The internal motor case ullage pressure, which is below atmospheric due to the rapid cooling of the hot internal gas, was more severe (lower) than anticipated due to the ullage gas being hotter than predicted. The structural dynamic response characteristics were as expected. Structural ring and wall damage are detailed and are considered to be attributable to the direct application of cavity collapse pressure combined with the structurally destabilizing, low internal motor case pressure...|$|R
40|$|Water {{impact tests}} using a 12. 5 inch {{diameter}} model representing a 8. 56 percent {{scale of the}} Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster configuration were conducted. The two primary objectives of this SRB scale model water impact test program were: 1. Obtain cavity collapse applied pressure distributions for the 8. 56 percent rigid body scale model FWC pressure magnitudes {{as a function of}} full-scale initial impact conditions at vertical velocities from 65 to 85 ft/sec, horizontal velocities from 0 to 45 ft/sec, and angles from - 10 to + 10 degrees. 2. Obtain rigid body applied pressures on the TVC pod and aft <b>skirt</b> <b>internal</b> stiffener rings at initial impact and cavity collapse loading events. In addition, nozzle loads were measured. Full scale vertical velocities of 65 to 85 ft/sec, horizontal velocities of 0 to 45 ft/sec, and impact angles from - 10 to + 10 degrees simulated...|$|R
2500|$|The skirt {{material}} may {{be almost}} transparent, translucent or opaque. A nearly transparent skirt provides a greater peripheral vision, though somewhat distorted, and {{may reduce the}} feeling of claustrophobia in some divers, {{but in some cases}} the light entering through the sides may cause distracting <b>internal</b> reflections. The <b>skirt</b> also encloses the nose, usually by means of a nose pocket, so that air can be exhaled through the nose into the mask to equalise the internal pressure during descent and thereby avoid possible barotrauma of the enclosed area of the face. [...] The section of the mask covering the nose must allow the wearer to block the nostrils while equalising pressure in the middle ear. All diving masks have means to keep them in position, usually an elastomer strap of similar material to the skirt, but occasionally an expanded neoprene pad with velcro straps is used. Mask straps are usually wider at the back or split into an upper and lower strap {{at the back of the}} head for stability and comfort.|$|R
5000|$|Diving masks {{may have}} a single, durable, {{tempered}} glass faceplate, or two lenses {{in front of the}} eyes. These may be supported by a relatively rigid plastic or metal frame, or they may be permanently bonded to the rim of the skirt, in a construction known as [...] "frameless". In the case of freediving masks, which need to have a low internal volume to minimize the amount of breath needed to equalize the change of pressure that occurs with depth, the lenses may be made of polycarbonate plastic. There is usually a [...] "skirt" [...] of synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer to support the frame and lenses and create a watertight seal with the diver's face.The skirt material may be almost transparent, translucent or opaque.
