40|$|A finite {{elements}} method (FEM) -analysis {{has been carried}} out with the purpose to study dynamics of carrying system in a machine tool of unique height. This is a one-off machine with high traveling column and a support with horizontal slide can move vertically along the column. Spindle milling and boring units are mounted telescopically at slide butt end. The FEM-analysis of the machine tool has been made due to its renovation. Machine resonances, responses to cutting force, static and dynamic rigidity in spindles have been estimated in the paper. The machine carrying system is subtle, heavy and structurally complicated. Its structural chain includes a carriage, a column, a support, a slide, spindle units interconnected with the help of hydro-static guides. While varying main parameters their influence on rigidity has been investigated in the paper. Height of  support lifting, column material and rigidity of longitudinal drive have been changed during the investigations. Static, modal and harmonic MEF-analyses have been executed in the paper. <b>Frequency-response</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the machine has been constructed in the process of the investigations. Two support bending resonances have been detected in the column at low frequency. Such Due to this there are limits for usage of the machine in sub-resonance and static frequency range. The most powerful resonance has been observed at frequency of 27. 8 Hz. The resonance has manifested itself as torsional oscillations of the column together with the support and the slide. Slide bending resonances have been revealed at higher frequencies 65 – 105 Hz. Three intervals which are fit for machine operation have been determined between resonance ranges. There is a prospective usage of the machine in inter-resonance (32 – 65 Hz) and super-resonance (more than 105 Hz) intervals. It has been shown that rigidity in spindle is a sequence higher in dynamic intervals than in a static interval. Machine subtility can be compensated by its transition to high-speed machining. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{response of}} a piezoelectric thick axisymmetric hollow cylinder in plane strain under boundary stochastic excitations is analyzed and calculated.

The equation for electric potential is integrated radially to obtain the electric potential {{as a function of}} displacement, and the displacement is expanded as a series in terms of the Legendre polynomials. The partial differential equation for displacement is further converted into ordinary differential equations by using the Galerkin method, which represent a stochastic multi-degree-of-freedom system with asymmetric stiffness matrix due to the asymmetric electrical and mechanical coupling and the transformed boundary conditions.

40|$|Differences in the {{mechanism}} of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory responses to preganglionic- and post-ganglionic nerve stimulation were investigated in the guinea-pig isolated trachea. Stimulation of the vagus nerve at frequencies above 4 [*]Hz elicited NANC relaxation of the trachealis muscle. Responses to low frequencies of stimulation (4 – 8 [*]Hz) were abolished by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NOARG (10 [*]μM), while a L-NOARG resistant component was observed at higher stimulus frequencies. The L-NOARG-resistant component of NANC inhibitory responses to higher frequencies of vagus nerve stimulation were significantly attenuated by the proteinase α-chymotrypsin (2 [*]U/ml), suggesting that a neuropeptide such as VIP may contribute to NANC responses. When postganglionic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS), responses were readily elicited at frequencies below 4 [*]Hz. Like responses to vagus nerve stimulation, responses to low frequency (< 4 [*]Hz) EFS were abolished by L-NOARG while a L-NOARG-resistant component was apparent at higher stimulus frequencies. The L-NOARG-resistant component of NANC inhibitory responses to EFS was sensitive to α-chymotrypsin only if stimuli were delivered in either long trains at a low frequency (4 [*]Hz for 10 – 30 [*]s) or short trains of high frequency (16 [*]Hz for 2. 5 – 7. 5 [*]s). Responses to preganglionic nerve stimulation were approximately 35 % of the amplitude of responses to EFS in the same preparations.

40|$|Virtual {{testing of}} portal machine tool {{has been carried}} out with the help of finite {{elements}} method (FEM). Static, modal and harmonic analyses have been made for a heavy planer. The paper reveals influence of concrete filler on machine tool dynamic flexibility. A peculiar feature of the simulation is concrete filling of a high-level transverse beam. Such approach oes look a typical one for machine-tool industry. Concrete has been considered as generalized material in two variants. It has been established that concrete application provides approximately 3 -fold increase in machine tool rigidity per each coordinate. In this regard it is necessary to arrange closure of rigidity contour by filling all the cavities inside of the portal. Modal FEA makes it possible to determine that concrete increases comparatively weakly (1. 3 – 1. 4 -fold) frequencies of resonance modes. Frequency of the lowest mode rises only from 30. 25 to 42. 86 Hz. The following most active whole-machine eigenmodes have been revealed in the paper: “Portal pecking”, “Parallelogram” and “Traverse pecking”. In order to restrain the last mode it is necessary to carry out concrete filling of the traverse, in particular. <b>Frequency-response</b> <b>characteristics</b> and curves of dynamic rigidity for a spindle have been plotted for 0 – 150 Hz interval while using harmonic FEM. It has been determined that concrete increases dynamic machine tool rigidity by 2. 5 – 3. 5 -fold. The effect is obtained even in the case when weakly damping concrete (2 %) is used. This is due to distribution of vibrational energy flow along concrete and along cast iron as well. Thus energy density and vibration amplitudes must decrease. The paper shows acceptability for internal reinforcement of high-level machine tool parts (for example, portal traverses) and fillers are applied for this purpose. Traverse weighting is compensated by additional torsional, shear and bending rigidity. The machine tool obtains the possibility for rough intermittent cutting even at resonance frequencies. Complete concrete filling of portal cavities is definitely a positive action for static and dynamic properties of the machine tool. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite rapid {{development}} of marine renewable energy, relatively {{little is known}} of the immediate and future impacts on the surrounding ecosystems. Quantifying the behavior and distribution of animals around marine renewable energy devices is crucial for understanding, predicting, and potentially mitigating any threats posed by these installations. The Flow and Benthic Ecology 4 D (FLOWBEC) autonomous seabed platform integrated an Imagenex multibeam echosounder and a Simrad EK 60 multifrequency echosounder to monitor marine life in a 120 ◦ sector over ranges up to 50 m, seven to eight times per second. Established target detection algorithms fail within MRE sites, due {{to high levels of}} backscatter generated by the turbulent physical dynamics, limiting and biasing analysis to only periods of low current speed. This study presents novel algorithms to extract diving seabirds, fish, and fish schools from the intense backscatter caused by turbulent dynamics in flows of 4 m s− 1. Filtering, detection, and tracking using a modified nearest neighbor algorithm provide robust tracking of animal behavior using the multibeam echosounder. Independent multifrequency target detection is demonstrated using the EK 60 with optimally calculated thresholds, scale-sensitive filters, morphological exclusion, and <b>frequency-response</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This provides sensitive and reliable detection throughout the entire water column and at all flow speeds. Dive profiles, depth preferences, predator–prey interactions, and fish schooling behavior can be analyzed, in conjunction with the hydrodynamic impacts of marine renewable energy devices.

The analyses draw on deployments at a tidal energy site in Scotland to compare the presence and absence of renewable energy structures across a range of physical and trophic levels over complete spring-neap tidal cycles. These results can be used to inform how animals forage in these sites and whether individuals face collision risks.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) mediates {{control of}} reproduction. It is {{secreted}} in pulses and acts via intracellular effectors to activate gonadotrophin secretion and gene expression. Sub-maximal GnRH pulse frequency can elicit maximal responses, yielding bell-shaped <b>frequency-response</b> curves <b>characteristic</b> of genuine frequency decoders. GnRH frequency decoding is therapeutically important (pulsatile GnRH can drive ovulation in assisted reproduction whereas sustained activation can treat breast and prostate cancers), but the mechanisms are unknown.

We develop a model that mirrors wet-laboratory data for activation and nuclear translocation of GnRH effectors (extracellular signal regulated kinase and nuclear factors of activated T-cells) and incorporates transcription. The model predicts genuine frequency decoding when two transcription factors (TFs) converge at a cooperative gate, and shows how optimal pulse frequency could reflect TF activation kinetics and affinities.

40|$|FEM-analysis of {{dynamics}} in the bearing system of a heavy-duty machine tool {{has been carried}} out in the paper. This is a prospective variant for a large-size multi-purpose machine tool with a horizontal sliding ram. A saddle and a ram are moving vertically along a subtle mono-column. A rigid double-column is used in the existing analog machine tool. A static, modal and harmonic analysis of the bearing system with the mono-column has been made in the paper. It has been done with the help of FEM-simulation prior to fabrication of a prototype sample. Previously conducted calculations for the analog machine tool have shown good compatibility of FEM-calculation with experiments. Six common machine tool resonances have been revealed for the bearing system. Their oscillating cutting forces are actively exciting three-four resonance modes. Ranges of a flexure-torsion resonance (20 – 40 Hz) and nose-diving resonances (70 – 90 Hz) have been determined in the paper. The paper shows that the range of multi-wave resonances starts significantly higher from 140 Hz. These resonances are interconnected with bending oscillations of the ram and bucklings of the column walls which are matched with the oscillations. The paper demonstrates stability in resonance pattern. The torsional resonance of the column on the frequency of nearly 40 Hz is considered as the more dangerous one. Spindle rigidity goes down up to 3. 8 Н/μm. It is possible to observe self-stabilization of the torsional resonance. Frequency of the torsional oscillations is practically unchangeable when there is a lifting or lowering down of the saddle and the ram. It is related to the migration of dynamical axis of torsion. <b>Frequency-response</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the bearing system have been constructed for various saddle positions on the column. Three frequency intervals that make it possible to carry out machining operation have been determined in the paper. The first interval is a static one. The machine tool with a mono-column comes short of the analog machine tool in this interval. The main reason of it is low static rigidity of the subtle column. The second interval is narrow and it is located between flexure-torsion and nose-diving resonances. The third interval is considered as the most efficient one. The interval contains a section of inter-range pause between general machine tool and multi-wave resonances. In this case it is possible to observe a significant increase of the dynamic rigidity on the spindle that compensates the column subtility. High potential of the dynamic rigidity has been revealed {{in the direction of the}} ram axis (> 2000 Н/μm). The paper shows liability of the machine tool to displacement crossings during oscillations. Peculiar features of this effect have been discussed in the paper. The diagram with a mono-column is recommended for practical application. The main condition is a transition to high-speed drive within the framework of concept on high-speed machining. It is necessary to ensure rigidity of the axial feed drive system. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sounds are amplified and {{frequency}} analyzed in the cochlea {{and the resulting}} signals are sent to the brain through the auditory nerve (AN). AN fiber threshold vs. <b>frequency-response</b> <b>characteristics</b> are band-pass shaped, with a sensitive, sharply-tuned tip centered at the "characteristic frequency" (CF) of the fiber. It is now well established that the sharp frequency tuning and high sensitivity of the tip is produced by mechanical feedback amplification from cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs). Specifically, sound vibrates the cochlear basilar membrane and this motion is transmitted to the OHC mechano-electric transduction function which produces a voltage change in the OHCs. This voltage change, through OHC electromotility, feeds back energy that amplifies basilar-membrane motion. For AN fibers with CF > 5 kHz (high-CF fibers), the sharp tuning-curve tip region is flanked on its low-frequency side with a broadly-tuned, less-sensitive "tailfrequency" region where the role of OHC motility has been thought as not significant. Contrary to this prevailing view, it has been experimentally found that the electromotility of OHCs is involved in generating AN responses in a narrow band of frequencies near 2. 5 kHz in the tail. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate whether and how the mechano-electric transduction function of OHCs is involved in generating AN responses to tail-frequency tone at 2. 5 kHz, and to determine any differences {{in the details of}} the mechano-electric transduction function in the tail-frequency responses versus in low-level CF-tone responses. The experimental strategy was to use the suppressive effects of a low-frequency bias-tone on AN responses driven by the active motility of OHCs. AN responses are affected by the mechano-electric transduction function of OHCs such that AN responses to low-level CF-tones are suppressed twice per bias-tone period by high-level bias-tones. This suppression is due to the saturation of the mechano-electric transduction as the bias-tone moves the operating point of OHC mechano-electric transduction into the nonlinear saturation regions twice per period of the bias-tone. Specifically, a bias-tone at 50 Hz was applied together with a second probe-tone, which was either a low-level CF-tone or a nearthreshold tail-frequency tone at 2. 5 kHz, in order to characterize and compare the suppressive effects on these two response types. Single AN fiber recordings were made from 27 fibers from 6 cats. As expected, the characteristic pattern of twice-per-bias-tone-period suppression was found from the low-level CF-tone responses from all of the recorded fibers. As for the tail-frequency tone responses, significant suppression was found on 10 of the 27 fibers recorded. Among those 10 fibers, the twice-per-biastone- period suppression pattern associated with the non-linearity of the mechano-electric transduction function of OHCs was found for fibers with CF 15 kHz {{may be due to the}} bias-tone sound levels not being high enough. These results directly show that the mechano-electric transduction function of OHCs is involved in generation of AN responses to 2. 5 kHz tones for fibers with CF < 15 kHz in a similar way to how it is involved in producing cochlear amplification for low-level CF-tones. Further, comparisons of the details of the suppression pattern, e. g., most importantly the phase of major suppression, did not reveal any significant differences between the two response types. Overall these results indicate the detailed mechanisms of the OHC mechano-electric transduction function that are involved in producing the two responses types are similar. Additionally, the effects of a low-frequency bias-tone on the phase of AN responses to tailfrequency tones were compared with previous work on the effects of medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent stimulation on the phase of AN responses to tail-frequency tones. Suppression of the gain of the OHC mechano-electric transduction function by a low-frequency bias-tone may affect the phase as well as the rate of AN responses driven by OHCs; however, effects of a low-frequency bias-tone on the phase of AN responses have not been reported in the literature. Bias-tone induced phase shifts were quantified as the difference in the phase of excitation to 2. 5 kHz tones between bias-tone levels below and above the suppression threshold. Results were collected from five fibers. The shift in the phase of AN responses to 2. 5 kHz tail-frequency tones induced by a bias-tone ranged from - 45 * (phase lag) to + 5 * (phase lead). A phase lag was found from 4 of the 5 fibers. These results are in general agreement with the MOC efferent effects on the phase of AN responses which ranged from - 80 * to + 60 * with an average of - 15 *, a phase lag. These results suggest that a lowfrequency bias-tone and MOC efferent stimulation affect the phase of AN responses to a tail-frequency tone through a similar mechanism by lowering the gain of the OHCs. by Hui S.
