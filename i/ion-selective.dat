All these reactions occur inside a special membrane which covers the true <b>ion-selective</b> electrode, which is why enzyme electrodes sometimes are considered as <b>ion-selective.</b> An example is glucose selective electrodes.|$|E

[...] For example, a potassium <b>ion-selective</b> membrane electrode utilizes the naturally occurring macrocyclic antibiotic valinomycin.
