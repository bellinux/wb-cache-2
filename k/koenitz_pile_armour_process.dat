Hydraulic parameters of armoured layer forming can be described on basis of stochastic nature of bed load movement proposed by Gessler. Due to sheltering effect the Wang hiding factor can be implemented. Change of sieve curve after Bartnik described flood on the basis of data gathered in Carpathian Rivers and streams. The purpose of laboratory experiment was to describe the change of velocity profile and basic hydraulic parameters during <b>armouring</b> <b>process.</b> The calculation was verified in Krzczonowka and Tenczynski streams. The <b>armouring</b> <b>process</b> influences the conditions of flow. Velocity profile in Mountain Rivers depends on change of bed roughness, which causes rating curve change. Characteristics of bed load sieve curve and roughness Mean diameter, which characterizes bed load, varies during formation of an armoured layer. This process may be described by two curves: an initial curve for non-heterogeneous material and a final curve for heterogeneous material, in which the standard deviation of the sieve curve reaches δ= 1. 3 [Sentürk 1977].

40|$|Two {{elements}} {{affect the}} efficacy of the numerical models of mobile-bed evolution: the prediction of the hydraulic roughness, related with both sediment distribution on the bed and flow depth, and the prediction of the hydraulic sorting, when the distribution of sediments on the bed is not uniform. In this work the bed profile variation is simulated, by using a numerical model proposed in previous works, in function of the variation of the friction factor, that reflects the coarsening of median sediment diameter, due to <b>armouring</b> <b>process,</b> and the variation of flow conditions. The variation of grains-size distribution of the bed material is predicted by using a probabilistic approach and the median sediment diameter and the dimensions of bed forms are estimated at each time step. The paper is devoted to show, by means of computer-based numerical experiments, the sensitivity of the numerical results with respect to the initial hydraulic roughness used. The choice of the numerical space and time steps is discussed and the relation with the initial roughness coefficient is reported...|$|R

This study {{is focused on the}} chemically induced precipitates formed in the calcite-base first alkaline reactive tank, (T 1), of the treatment after one year of operation. For this purpose all the reactive material and precipitates from the first tank were extracted, and samples at different depths were collected. Solid samples were analyzed using conventional methods, including XRD and differential XRD (DXRD), calcimetry, SEM-EDS, sequential extractions and wet chemical analysis by ICP-OES. The study reveals the existence of three mineralogical zones in the precipitates that were formed in the first upper 30 cm of the tank’s reactive material.

40|$|Hillslope surface <b>armouring</b> and {{weathering}} <b>processes</b> {{have been}} largely ignored in geomorphic and hydrological models due to their complexity and the uncertainty associated with them. However, their importance {{in a wide range}} of spatial processes is well recognised. An armouring and weathering computer model (ARMOUR) has previously been used to successfully simulate the effect of these processes on erosion and soil grading at a hillslope scale. In order to apply such a model across larger and more complex environments we used a Markov process conceptualisation to reduce the complexity of ARMOUR's numerics. This new armouring-weathering model (named MrARM) is now capable of large-scale two- dimensional simulations. In this paper we describe the calibration and evaluation of MrARM as well as the results of multiple hillslope-scale simulations for varying weathering rates. The MrARM armouring component was calibrated against ARMOUR results, while its weathering component was validated against recently published laboratory results. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate model predictions under various conditions. The results described here demonstrate that the modelling approach used is effective and that the simulation of the <b>armouring</b> and weathering <b>processes</b> corresponds well with previous experience with ARMOUR and with generally accepted field understanding...|$|R

5000|$|The {{collection}} of the Museum of Military History, Vienna holds a 'guardroom scene' by Jan van Helmont. A guardroom scene typically depicts a scene with officers and soldiers engaged in merrymaking. Guardroom scenes often included mercenaries and prostitutes dividing booty, harassing captives or indulging in other forms of reprehensible activities. [...] The genre became popular in the mid-17th century, particularly in the Dutch Republic. In Flanders there were also a few practitioners of the genre including David Teniers the Younger, Abraham Teniers, Anton Goubau, Cornelis Mahu, Jan Baptist Tijssens the Younger and Jan van Helmont's father Mattheus. Van Helmont's composition depicts soldiers {{in front of a}} gate. On the left there is a soldier holding up a flag over a cannon, a <b>pile</b> of weapons, <b>armour</b> and a drum. [...] The armour depicted in the picture was already out of date {{at the time it was}} painted since metal armours, breast plates and helmets fell out of use from the 1620s. It is possible that in line with the moralizing intent of the genre, the armour is a reference to the vanitas motif of the transience of power and fame.|$|R
40|$|Hillslope surface <b>armouring</b> and {{weathering}} <b>processes</b> {{have received}} little attention in geomorphologic and hydrologic models {{due to their}} complexity and the uncertainty associated with them. Their importance, however, {{in a wide range}} of spatial processes is well recognized. A physically based armouring and weathering computer model (ARMOUR) has previously been used to successfully simulate the effect of these processes on erosion and soil grading at a hillslope scale. This model is, however, computationally complex and cannot realistically be applied over large areas or over long periods of time. A simplified process conceptualization approach is presented (named mARM) which uses a novel approach of modeling physical processes using transition matrices, which is orders of magnitude faster. We describe in detail the modeling framework. We calibrate and evaluate the model against ARMOUR simulations and show it matches ARMOUR for a range of conditions. The computational efficiency of mARM allowed us to easily examine time- and space-varying relationships between erosion and physical weathering rates at the hillslope scale. For erosion-dominated slopes the surface coarsens over time, while for weathering domination the surface fines over time. When erosion and weathering are comparable in scale a slope can be weathering-dominated upslope (where runoff and therefore erosion is low) and armouring-dominated downslope. In all cases, for a constant gradient slope the surface armour coarsens downslope as a result of a balance between erosion and weathering. Thus even for weathering-dominated slopes the surface grading catena is dependent on armouring through the balance between weathering and armouring. We also observed that for many slopes the surface initially armours but, after some period of time (space- and rate-dependent), weathering begins to dominate and the surface subsequently fines. Depending on the relative magnitude of armouring and weathering the final equilibrium grading of the slope may be finer or coarser than the initial conditions. The results demonstrate the complexity of the evolution of surface grading and the balance between the <b>armouring</b> and weathering <b>processes.</b> They also point toward inherent organization of surface grading on the hillslope driven by erosion even for extremely high weathering rates. The implications for natural landforms are discussed. We also plot and quantify, for the first time, a log-log relationship between surface grading, contributing area and slope for a range of weathering rates. The results show that this log-log relationship is robust, the log-log scaling is constant in space, and true even for extreme weathering rates. This has potentially important implications for soil geomorphology. It suggests that an analytical solution can be found for soil grading catena. This might allow us to more easily map soil distribution as a function of topographic characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of large woody debris (LWD) within a river channel has a complex, but influential, relationship with channel morphology. This study examines the {{spatial distribution}} of LWD, present as both jams and singular logs, and {{its relationship with the}} channel morphology of the Bitterroot River in western Montana. Using basic GIS digitising methods, the {{spatial distribution of}} LWD was assessed along a ten kilometre stretch of the river, spanning from Victor Crossing in the south to Crystal Lane in the north. The location of LWD was then evaluated in relation to certain channel features, including point bars, meander bends, midchannel bars and the flood plain. The most common area of LWD accumulations was on point bars, with 35 % and 28 % of jams and logs respectively, occurring here. Jams also commonly occurred on bare parts of islands; however a higher percentage of singular logs were located on the flood plain. Analysis of the size and orientation of LWD showed consistency with previous studies; the dominant orientation of individual logs was parallel to flow direction and larger LWD deposits were more likely to influence channel morphology. Based on the observed primary influence of LWD on flow deflection, sediment storage, pool formation and bank <b>armouring,</b> the secondary <b>processes</b> of stabilisation of planform morphology, meander cutoff and formation of depositional features were inferred. 1...|$|R

6000|$|Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion. He used {{to wonder}} at the shallow {{psychology}} of those who conceive the Ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.

Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his [...] "Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James," [...] as one who was [...] "caressed by the Court for his handsome face, which kept him not long company." [...] Was it young Herbert's life that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wrist-bands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silver-and-black <b>armour</b> <b>piled</b> at his feet. What had this man's legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realise?

A flower was in her right hand, and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of her temperament in him? These oval heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain. Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so over-laden with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose! What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady Hamilton face, and her moist wine-dashed lips--he knew what he had got from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress. There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she was holding.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} an increase of the packing density of armour blocks on a slope usually leads to an increased stability. This {{is also the case}} for cubes. Test on slopes with cube armour units with different values for the porosity yield an increase of stability until a certain optimum packing density. As a first conclusion this would imply that breakwaters with cubes should be designed using this optimum packing density. However, the various packing densities of the cubes in the laboratory were realised by placing the cubes carefully by hand in the model breakwater. In reality these cubes will be placed by dropping them from and above the water surface. The exact position for dropping the blocks (either from a crane or from a side dumping vessel) can be determined easily, also in a real work under execution using standard GPS equipment. However, during the dropping process the blocks will not arrive exactly below the point of release. When touching the slope the cubes will tend to slide down towards the already placed blocks. Consequently at that moment the blocks will tend to be placed as a revetment. On the other hand, in case the block hits the blocks already placed, the new block will either turn the other way or it will jump away on the impact. In the most "unfortunate" case, the block will stand on one of the corner points which differs 45 from the slope of the secondary armour. This will result in a considerably higher porosity of the <b>armour</b> layer. The <b>process</b> of falling is a stochastic one. The average "landing-location" is exactly below the point of release, but there is a considerable standard deviation. In the past research has been done to find this standard deviation for rock, blocks and other elements to be dropped on a horizontal bed. However this was done for relatively deep water (where block reached the stationary falling velocity). In order to investigate this effect, in a basin model cubes (DN = 0. 15 m) have been dropped according to various patterns on a 2 : 3 slope. The result is a rather "random" placement of the cubes on the slope. The scale was chosen to avoid scale effects due to impacts. The results depend very much on the initial position of the blocks at the toe of the breakwater. Also we concluded that the packing density depends much on the distance between the individual release points. In case the drop-distance is too small (with as purpose to achieve a very high packing density), the result was in many cases a considerably lower packing density because of an increased layer thickness. Basically two test series have been done, one series had the main axis of the blocks parallel to the crest of the breakwater, while the other series had a shift of 45. In both cases the distance between the blocks is quite sensitive. The results of all test are being analysed and result in an "optimum" drop distance both in x as well as in y direction (x is parallel to the crest line, y is perpendicular to the crest line, both measured in a horizontal plane). A small drop distance in some cases will result in a dense packing, but there is a considerable risk that the packing becomes much less dense then anticipated.
