5|$|Tony Gardner ({{designer}}) and {{his company}} Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on <b>John</b> <b>Travolta.</b> Costume designer Rita Ryack wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits, so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics.

5|$|Divine was an {{inspiration}} for Ursula the Sea Witch, the villain in the 1989 Disney animated film The Little Mermaid.

5|$|<b>John</b> <b>Travolta</b> as Edna Turnblad, Tracy's {{mother and}} laundry {{business}} owner, who is agoraphobic and ashamed of her obesity. Travolta's casting as Edna continued {{the tradition of}} having a man in drag portray the character, {{going back to the}} original 1988 film, which featured drag queen Divine as Edna and at Hairspray's Broadway version, which featured Harvey Fierstein as Edna. Executives at New Line Cinema originally expected the part to be filled by an actor accustomed to playing comic roles, tossing around names such as Robin Williams, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks. However, Travolta was aggressively sought after by producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron for this role because he had starred as Danny Zuko in Grease, the second most successful movie musical to date, beaten only by Mamma Mia!.|$|E

As a reward, <b>John</b> <b>Travolta,</b> Joaquin Phoenix, and Robert Patrick visited the department in 2004 to promote the release of the film Ladder 49. In May 2011, Lewisville residents approved a sales tax increase to create two public safety districts.

In the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Hairspray, she starred with <b>John</b> <b>Travolta,</b> Christopher Walken, Zac Efron and Queen Latifah, portraying the role of Velma Von Tussle, the racist and sizeist manager of a music station. Travolta requested that Pfeiffer play {{the part of the}} villainess, which was her first film role in five years. A widely positive reception greeted the film upon its release, while it made an impressive US$118.9 million and US$202.5 million worldwide. The cast of Hairspray was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture, but won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast, the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Ensemble of the Year and the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Ensemble Cast. Her next film release, the fantasy adventure Stardust, opposite Claire Danes, Charlie Cox and Robert De Niro, saw her play the ancient witch Lamia. Filmed before Hairspray, the film premiered three weeks afterwards; it garnered largely positive reviews but, budgeted at US70 million, it made a modest US$135.5 million globally.|$|E
5|$|Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump: Though at {{an early}} age he is deemed to have a below average IQ of 75, he has an endearing {{character}} and shows devotion to his loved ones and duties, character traits which bring him into many life-changing situations. Along the way, he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. Tom's younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the movie for the scenes when Forrest runs across the U.S. Tom's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school bus who refuses to let young Forrest (Michael Conner Humphreys) sit next to her. <b>John</b> <b>Travolta</b> was the original choice to play the title role, and admits passing on the role was a mistake. Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were also considered for the role. Sean Penn stated in an interview having been second choice for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after {{an hour and a half}} of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel. Hanks agreed to take the role only on the condition that the film was historically accurate.|$|E
