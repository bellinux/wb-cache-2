5|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Lindwall {{came the}} closest to a hat-trick in his entire Test career. He {{finished}} England's innings by clean bowling three batsmen in four deliveries, with the unsuccessful ball barely missing Doug Wright's stumps to end with 4/52. Lindwall took the last four wickets in two overs, conceding two runs. He took 2/60 and scored 20 in another drawn match. Lindwall came into the final Test on his home ground in Sydney with a match haul of 10/73 in a Shield match. He continued his productive series with 7/63 in the first innings on a <b>flat</b> <b>pitch,</b> managing to generate enough pace to knock the bat out of Denis Compton's hands. Lindwall took two further wickets in the second innings as Australia took a 3–0 series win with another innings victory. Lindwall topped the bowling averages on either side with 18 wickets at 20.38, {{in addition to his}} 160 runs at 32.00.|$|E
5|$|Pathan {{made his}} Test {{debut in the}} Second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in December 2003. At the age of 19, he opened the bowling {{following}} an injury to the Baroda left-armer Zaheer Khan in the First Test. In a high scoring match, he took the wicket of Matthew Hayden while giving away 160 runs at almost five runs an over. He scored one in his only innings as India took a four-wicket victory. He was dropped for the following Test upon the return of Zaheer, but was recalled for the Fourth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Zaheer broke down in his only spell in the Third Test. On another <b>flat</b> <b>pitch,</b> Pathan took the wickets of Steve Waugh, Adam Gilchrist in the first innings in a spell of reverse swing bowling. He had Waugh caught behind from an outswinger and then bowled Gilchrist with an inswinging yorker. He ended with 2/80 in the first innings and dismissed Ricky Ponting in the second innings to end with match figures of 3/106.|$|E
5|$|On {{a sticky}} wicket, Toshack {{initially}} struggled, bowling his characteristic leg stump line. England struggled to 117 {{runs for the}} loss of five wickets (5/117) {{at the end of the}} fourth day despite many interruptions caused by rain. Norman Yardley and captain Wally Hammond had defied the Australian bowlers since coming together at 5/66. On the fifth and final morning, captain Don Bradman advised him to pitch straighter and at a slower pace. Before play began Bradman took him down the pitch and showed him exactly where he wanted him to bowl and even make him bowl a practice over alongside to make sure he got it right. Having started the day wicketless, Toshack dismissed Yardley and Hammond in the space of 13 runs to break the English resistance and finished with an economical 3/17 from 17 overs as England were bowled out for 141. Bradman enforced the follow-on, and with Lindwall indisposed, Toshack took the new ball with Miller. He continued where he finished in the first innings, taking four of the first six wickets (Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, Hammond and Yardley) as the English top order were reduced to 6/65. He ended the innings with 6/82 as England were bowled out twice in a day to lose by an innings and 332 runs. The remaining four Tests were less successful: only in one innings did he take more than one wicket. In the Second Test at Sydney the pitch favoured spin bowling and Toshack only bowled 13 overs without taking a wicket as Australia claimed another innings victory. He took match figures of 2/127 on a <b>flat</b> <b>pitch</b> in the Third Test in Melbourne, removing Len Hutton and Compton. During the match, Toshack came in to bat in the second innings with Australia nine wickets down. He defended stubbornly and ended unbeaten on two as his partner Lindwall went from 81 to 100 to score the fastest Test century by an Australian, in 88 balls. Toshack was more productive in the drawn Fourth Test in Adelaide, where he took match figures of 5/135 from 66 eight ball overs in extreme heat, including the wicket of Hammond twice, Edrich and Joe Hardstaff junior. Ahead of the final Test, Toshack removed Compton, Edrich and Godfrey Evans in a drawn match for Victoria against the tourists. He took only one wicket in the Fifth Test as Australia sealed the series 3–0 with a five-wicket win. Toshack finished the series with 17 wickets at a bowling average of 25.71. His first-class season was not as productive as in his debut year; he took 33 wickets at an average of 30.93 in eleven matches, making him the sixth highest wicket-taker for the season. Toshack had a particularly unsuccessful time in the two Sheffield Shield matches against arch-rivals Victoria, which were lost by heavy margins of an innings and 114 runs, and 288 runs respectively. In the first match he took 0/133 after Australian team-mate Miller hit three sixes from his opening over. In the second match he took a total of 3/144. Victoria went on to win the title.|$|E

25|$|Durham won the toss against Leicestershire {{and elected}} to bat first at Grace Road, Leicester. The first day was {{dominated}} by Durham's Australian left-handed opener, Mike Hussey.

25|$|After 105 overs, Essex {{declared}} {{with the}} score 502 for 4, giving Australia the turn to exploit bad bowling and a <b>flat</b> <b>pitch.</b> Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden added 213 {{for the first}} wicket, Hayden went on to make a 118-ball 150 before retiring, while Brad Hodge was allowed to top score with 166 from number 4, including a 161-run fifth-wicket partnership with Brad Haddin. For Essex, James Middlebrook got the best bowling figures with two for 110, including Adam Gilchrist for 8, as Australia finished the day's batting practice with the score 561 for 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{sluggish}} Adelaide pitch {{had been}} rendered even more toothless by its new wicket, the fresh soil removing its tendency to take spin {{after the second}} day. With five fast bowlers in the touring team there were bouncers aplenty as they vied for a Test place, which slowed down the over-rate to 10 or 11 an hour. Mike Hendrick did best with his 5/68 in the second innings and Derek Underwood took 7/127 in the match with his carefully placed spin. By coincidence the South Australian wicketkeeper was Mike Hendricks and he made 57 in the home side's first innings. The South Australian captain Ian Chappell top-scored with 78 in the second despite hooking early and often, {{but in the end}} the over-rate and <b>flat</b> <b>pitch</b> ensured a draw.|$|E
25|$|The Adelaide Oval was {{a ground}} {{which had a}} <b>flat</b> <b>pitch</b> unhelpful for bowlers, and short square boundaries, which helped the Australian Batsmen, who were benefitted by their captain Steve Waugh's {{decision}} to bat first. Langer and Hayden gave their side a quick start, stitching 22 runs from 5 overs, with Hayden scoring a fast 12 off 13 balls, but the 19-year-old fast-bowler Irfan Pathan, making his debut after Zaheer Khan was nursing a strained hamstring, took Hayden's wicket for a dream start to his debut, and he took his first test wicket in only the second ball of his third over. During their relatively short stay, the two Australian openers {{set the tone for}} the day by driving along the line, exploiting a pitch, whose lack of bounce, a fast outfield, and lack of movement, proved to be frustratingly unhelpful for the Indians.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of a roof is to resist water. Two broad categories of roofs are <b>flat</b> and <b>pitched.</b> <b>Flat</b> roofs actually slope up to 10° or 15° but are built to resist standing water. Pitched roofs are designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or ice damming. Typically residential, pitched roofs are covered with an underlayment material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense. Domestic roof construction may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation.|$|R

25|$|In Qualifier 1, Chennai {{chose to}} bat first. Both captains wished to bat first and {{believed}} the <b>flat</b> <b>pitch</b> and quick outfield would favour batsmen {{and produce a}} high-scoring match. Chennai's innings began steady before a 140-run partnership between Raina and Hussey boosted their total to 192 for 1. They scored 123 runs from the last 10 overs against Mumbai's formidable bowling attack. Malinga and Johnson, two of Mumbai's key bowlers, conceded 45 and 40 runs each without taking a wicket. Harbhajan, with figures of 0 for 26, was the only bowler to concede less than 9 runs an over. The chase started promisingly as Smith propelled them to 86 for 1 after 8 overs. Jadeja was then introduced into the attack and took the wickets of Smith, Karthik and Pollard. Mumbai did not recover as Bravo helped remove the remaining batsmen, finishing with figures of 3 for 9. Mumbai was bowled out in 18.4 overs and lost the match by 48 runs.|$|E
25|$|After a short break, the County Championship {{returned}} to {{action in the}} second week of July. Hampshire's 41 run first innings lead against Glamorgan proved to be crucial, as they won the game by just 43 runs. Lancashire's victory against title rivals Northamptonshire at Northampton promoted the visitors to the top spot in the Division Two standings, ahead of their hosts for that game. Kent chased 411 in the fourth innings of their game against Gloucestershire to claim their first Championship victory of the season. However, a <b>flat</b> <b>pitch</b> in their match against Hampshire prevented any chance of a second consecutive win—the contest ended as a high-scoring draw. Despite a twelve-wicket match haul for Simon Kerrigan, division leaders Lancashire could also only manage a draw against Glamorgan. Leicestershire continued to struggle for Championship form, falling to an innings defeat against Essex. Worcestershire's chances of promotion were dented when Gloucestershire completed a six wicket victory over them. At the end of July all nine counties had completed ten games apiece, and Lancashire, the only unbeaten team in the division, led Northamptonshire by eight points, while Essex were a further eighteen points adrift in third. Leicestershire, the only winless team at this stage, were eighteen points behind their nearest rivals, Glamorgan.|$|E
25|$|The Third Test in Delhi saw a <b>flat</b> <b>pitch,</b> where India scored 7/613 in {{its first}} innings in which Ponting resorted to bowling himself for two overs. Ponting amassed 87 in Australia's first innings score of 577. The match ended in a draw and Australia needed {{to win in the}} Fourth Test in Nagpur to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. On the fourth {{afternoon}} of the Fourth Test, the Indian batting collapsed, and Australia had an opportunity to bowl them out and chase a target of around 250–300 after the tea break. However, the Australians were a long way behind on their over rate, so in order to avoid a one match suspension, Ponting chose to bowl their part-time spinners and medium pacers such as Michael Clarke, Cameron White and Mike Hussey (who were all unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), as they took less time. In the meantime, captain MS Dhoni and Harbhajan both added half centuries. This drew strong criticism from many commentators, who suggested that their faster bowlers, who had been responsible for the collapse, could have bowled from a shorter run-up. When the fast bowlers were reintroduced, the last four wickets fell quickly. This left Australia chasing 382 runs for victory and they lost by 172 runs to cede the series 2–0. In the first innings, Ponting became Harbhajan's 300th Test wicket and the Australian captain ended the series with 264 runs at 37.71. While below his career standards, it was substantially better than his previous Test efforts in India.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire won the toss and batted {{first on}} a slow but <b>flat</b> <b>pitch.</b> They had lost five wickets for 175 by mid {{afternoon}} but a sixth wicket stand of 94 between Bradley Parker and Peter Hartley (61) boosted the total. Parker's innings was a career best and contained eight fours. Debutant Alex Wharf claimed Brian Lara as his maiden wicket in first-class cricket, to leave Warwickshire on 44/2. Opener Andy Moles (65) and Dominic Ostler put on 191 in 67 overs {{for the third}} wicket, building the platform for a significant first innings lead. Twose innings included 21 fours and a six and fell six runs short of a career best score. The visitors closed day two with a lead of 36 and five wickets remaining. Welch scored a third fifty in consecutive matches and aided by contributions from the lower order the lead was increased to 149. Yorkshire began well in response, openers Martyn Moxon and Michael Vaughan (49) put on 93 before the latter was bowled by Richard Davis. Davis took two further wickets in quick succession to reduce them to 109/3. Moxton reached a third century {{of the season and}} alongside Richard Blakey put on 92 before play ended. Moxton added 10 to his overnight score but a fluent 77 from Blakey and a spirited 46 by Wharf saw the innings well into the final afternoon. Davis took three further wickets, finishing with his first five wicket haul for the club. The target for Warwickshire was 199 in 49 overs and an opening stand of 89 in 16 overs between Moles (48) and Twose ensured it was a comfortable chase, achieved with eight and a half overs in hand.|$|E
25|$|Panesar {{was called}} up to the 16-man squad for the winter tour of India which started on 30 October. A three-day {{training}} camp was held from 26 October to 29 October with the first Test starting on 15 November. Panesar played {{in two of the}} three tour matches taking 3–64 against Mumbai 'A' and 2–70 for the match against Haryana. However, he was not picked for the first Test, which England eventually lost by nine wickets. After the match, coach Andy Flower and captain Alastair Cook both said they had misjudged the pitch, and changes were made to the team ahead of the second Test. Panesar was selected for the second test replacing Tim Bresnan, and he took 5–129 in the first innings, and 6–81 in the second, career best match figures of 11–210, and only the second time he has taken ten wickets in a match. This was also the first time since Hedley Verity in 1934 that an English spinner had taken 10 wickets in a match in India. England went on to level the series at one all by winning the match by ten wickets. In the third test as he took five wickets in the match, including 4–90 in the first Innings. England {{went on to win the}} match by seven wickets and lead the series 2–1 with one test remaining. In the final test in Nagpur, Panesar was not as successful with the ball only taking 1–81 on a <b>flat</b> <b>pitch.</b> The match ended in a draw and England won the series 2–1. By winning the series England became the first team since 2004 to beat India on their home soil, and the first England team since the 1984–85 tour to beat India in India. Panesar ended the series with 17 wickets.|$|E
500|$|Although Marcus Trescothick had {{a season}} which David Foot {{described}} as [...] "imperiously assured", Somerset {{failed to win}} enough matches to pose a real challenge in the 2009 County Championship. The <b>flat</b> <b>pitch</b> at the County Ground, Taunton did not help their efforts; the imbalance in favour of the batsmen meant that all but one match at the ground was drawn. Sussexs total of 742/5 declared was the fifteenth highest total {{in the history of}} the County Championship, while Murray Goodwins innings of 344 not out in that match was the sixth highest score by a batsman {{in the history of the}} competition. In total, six of Somerset's eight home matches contained scores of 500 or over in a single innings. In contrast, 500 was reached in only one of their away matches, by Hampshire at The Rose Bowl. The home conditions helped three of Somerset's batsmen pass 1,000 first-class runs in the season, including Craig Kieswetter and Arul Suppiah, who were both awarded their county caps after passing the landmark. Trescothick's 1,817 runs were the most by any batsman in the 2009 competition, finishing over 200 runs ahead of the next most prolific batsman, and he was named as both PCA Player of the Year and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year for 2009. He was also selected as part of the team of the year, along with wicket-keeper Kieswetter.|$|E
25|$|The arm ball {{has also}} been {{employed}} {{with a great deal}} of success over the years by left arm orthodox bowlers. In this case, the stock ball will turn away from the right handed batsman and the arm-ball would swing in, allowing the bowler to beat the inside edge of the bat and attack the stumps. Hedley Verity in particular was well known for his fast inswinging arm-ball, often bowled at yorker length. Ravindra Jadeja provided an amazing display of arm balls against England and Australia during India's 2016-17 home season. His arm balls were hugely effective on some of the <b>flat</b> <b>pitches</b> where there were little turn, and while playing for that little turn, batsmen got deceived and edged it, In spinning pitches he utilised the rough for his spinning deliveries, occasionally getting an arm ball in to disturb the batsman.|$|R

50|$|The English home {{season of}} 1992 saw Botham and Pringle play {{together}} in the test side initially but both did not last long. Botham played his last test at Lord's and Pringle was dropped until the Leeds test match. Again Pringle was instrumental in England's win versus Pakistan but the selectors persisted with him for The Oval. By this stage, Pringle was beginning to be easier to play on <b>flat</b> <b>pitches</b> but an excellent opponent when there was anything in the pitch. On a very true fast bouncy surface at The Oval Pringle looked highly playable and his final bow on a test match field saw him having his off stump flattened by Wasim Akram. He was not chosen to tour India in 1992-93 but did make the Texaco Trophy side for 1993 against Australia. Failing to make the Test side, he retired shortly after.|$|R
