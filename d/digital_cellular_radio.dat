40|$|The symbol error {{performance}} of CD 900 -like <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> mobile <b>radio</b> systems over narrowband and urban wideband transmission channels was investigated. The basic performance is presented for Gaussian, flat-fading Rayleigh, and log-normal channels {{in the presence}} of selection and ratio combining space diversity schemes. For wideband channels having more than one resolvable fading path, a CD 900 -like system without diversity reception suffers from large residual symbol error probabilities PR(≈ 10 - 1). The introduction of adaptive correlation diversity (ACD) mitigates the effects of multipath, yielding a PR of 6 × 10 - 5. Although this PR value is relatively low, the probability of symbol error (Pe) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is significantly poorer than for the Gaussian channel. By combining the ACD scheme with space diversity, the PR is eliminated by Pe > 10 - 5, and the channel SNR is within 5 dB of the Gaussian channel performance when Pe is 10 - 10. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of maximal ratio combining for space diversity reception in <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> mobile <b>radio</b> systems is studied for communications {{in the presence}} of multiple cochannel interference (CCI) sources and is compared to optimum com-bining. The main contribution of the paper is that the analysis accounts for fading of the signal of interest (SOI) as well as the cochannel interference (CCI). The paper considers BPSK signalling in flat, quasi-static channels. Rayleigh or Rice fading is assumed for the SOI, while CCI is assumed subject to Rayleigh fading. Channels associated with interference sources are assumed independent and identically distributed. Using a multivariate statistical analysis approach and assuming equal-power interfer-ence sources, analytical expressions are derived for the density function of the array output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), the outage probability, and the average probability of bit error with maximal ratio combining. Earlier results obtained for optimum combining and Rayleigh fading are extended to the case when the SOI is subject to Rice fading. A limited analysis of the equal gain combiner is also presented.

40|$|Spread -spectrum {{modulation}} techniques, {{which are}} traditionally applied to military systems {{to enhance their}} Electronic Counter Counter Measures (ECCM) capabilities, are beginning {{to appear in the}} commercial secular. Specifically, spread-spectrum technology is being employed in <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>radio</b> systems. These systems are identical to the military systems except that they employ much simpler spreading code design and have less security incorporated. However, due to the economies of scale, they can be produced at a much lower cost than their military counterparts. The jamming vulnerability of such commercial products in tactical situations is analyzed in this thesis. The mobile cellular network developed by Qualcomm Inc. is used to illustrate the methodology in analyzing the effects of jamming on the mobile cellular network. With a single mobile station and jammer, the probability of jamming and the optimal jammer trajectory are derived. Next, the effective probabilities of detection and false alarm under the jamming conditions are derived and the mean acquisition times are compared to that without jamming. Our results show that intelligence jamming can cause devastating effects even with very small power. Commercial products are therefore much more vulnerable due to the simplicity in design.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} and quantifies {{the performance of}} a range of important diversity combining receivers operating in a <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>radio</b> environment with linear modulation, frequency-selective Rayleigh multipath fading, and co-channel interference (CO). The following three types of diversity receiver are treated: (i) the maximum likelihood receiver (the best-possible receiver); (U) optimum linear receivers; and (iii) memoryless linear combining receivers with and without post-combiner equalization. The frequency-selective multipath fading channels are statistically characterized by a delay spectrum with an associated root-mean-square delay spread. The co-channel interference on each diversity branch is assumed to be composed of (i) a small number (possibly zero) of dominant interferers; and (ii) a large number of weak interferer; the sum of which is modelled as independent gaussian noise, or noise-like CCI. The potential bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the maxim likelihood receiver is analysed in the case of noise-like CCI alone (i. e., no dominant interferers), using the matched filter bound. The thesis presents a general. exact, and totally analytical solution of the matched filter bound on BER performance taken over the ensemble of multipath channel responses. The key to the solution is the application of the Karhunen-Loeve representation of these channel responses. The BER performance of an optimum linear receiver. optimized according to the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion, is estimated using (i) a range of BER computation methods, including Metzger's algorithm and Saltzberg's bound; and (ii) random generation of the channel responses, using the efficient Karhunen-Loeve method. Five sub-classes of the memoryless linear combining receiver, with and without post-combiner equalization, are studied. They include arrangements of the following combining and equalization schemes: maximal ratio combining, maximal power combining, MMSE combining, MMSE linear equalization, and ideal intersymbol interference (lSI) cancellation. The BER performances of the five receiver sub-classes are estimated using similar techniques to those used for the optimum (MMSE) linear receiver. For quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) and all the above receivers, the thesis presents a set of numerical results that show the influence of the diversity order. the number of dominant interferers (set to zero for matched filter bounds), the delay spectrum shape, the delay spread, and the signal-to-interference ratio. This extensive set of data shows the power of diversity and equalization at combating lSI and eel in frequency-selective fading environments, and important tradeoffs between receiver performance and complexity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{application}} of artificial neural networks to two important problems encountered in cellular communications, namely, location estimation and co-channel interference suppression. The prediction of a mobile location using propagation path loss (signal strength) {{is a very difficult}} and complex task. Several techniques have been proposed recently mostly based on linearized, geometrical and maximum likelihood methods. An alternative approach based on artificial neural networks is proposed in this thesis which offers the advantages of increased flexibility to adapt to different environments and high speed parallel processing. Location estimation provides users of cellular telephones with information about their location. Some of the existing location estimation techniques such as those used in GPS satellite navigation systems require non-standard features, either from the cellular phone or the cellular network. However, it is possible to use the existing GSM technology for location estimation by taking advantage of the signals transmitted between the phone and the network. This thesis proposes the application of neural networks to predict the location coordinates from signal strength data. New multi-layered perceptron and radial basis function based neural networks are employed for the prediction of mobile locations using signal strength measurements in a simulated COST- 231 metropolitan environment. In addition, initial preliminary results using limited available real signal-strength measurements in a metropolitan environment are also reported comparing the performance of the neural predictors with a conventional linear technique. The results indicate that the neural predictors can be trained to provide a near perfect mapping using signal strength measurements from two or more base stations. The second application of neural networks addressed in this thesis, is concerned with adaptive equalization, which is known to be an important technique for combating distortion and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) in digital communication channels. However, many communication systems are also impaired by what is known as co-channel interference (CCI). Many digital communications systems such as <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>radio</b> (DCR) and dual polarized micro-wave radio, for example, employ frequency re-usage and often exhibit performance limitation due to co-channel interference. The degradation in performance due to CCI is more severe than due to ISI. Therefore, simple and effective interference suppression techniques are required to mitigate the interference for a high-quality signal reception. The current work briefly reviews the application of neural network based non-linear adaptive equalizers to the problem of combating co-channel interference, without a priori knowledge of the channel or co-channel orders. A realistic co-channel system is used as a case study to demonstrate the superior equalization capability of the functional-link neural network based Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) compared to other conventional linear and neural network based non-linear adaptive equalizers.
