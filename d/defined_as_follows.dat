500|$|In {{electrical}} systems it {{is often}} the case that the distinction between input and output variables is ambiguous. [...] They can be either, depending on circumstance and point of view. [...] In such cases the concept of port (a place where energy is transferred from one system to another) can be more useful than input and output. [...] It is customary to define two variables for each port (...) : the voltage across it (...) and the current entering it (...) [...] [...] For instance, the transfer matrix of a two-port network can be <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows,</b> ...|$|E
500|$|The {{boundary}} maps ∂* {{lowering the}} dimension may be <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> An element in Hn(X) is the homology class of an n-cycle x which, by barycentric subdivision for example, {{can be written}} as the sum of two n-chains u and v whose images lie wholly in A and B, respectively. Thus ∂x = ∂(u + v) = 0 so that ∂u = ∂v. This implies that the images of both these boundary (n [...] 1)-cycles are contained in the intersection A∩B. Then ∂* (...) can be defined to be the class of ∂u in Hn1(A∩B). Choosing another decomposition x = u′ + v′ does not affect , since ∂u + ∂v = ∂x = ∂u′ + ∂v′, which implies ∂u [...] ∂u′ = ∂(v′ [...] v), and therefore ∂u and ∂u′ lie in the same Homology class; nor does choosing a different representative x′, since then ∂x′ = ∂x = 0. Notice that the maps in the Mayer–Vietoris sequence depend on choosing an order for A and B. In particular, the boundary map changes sign if A and B are swapped.|$|E
500|$|The {{property}} of tangency is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> First, a point, line or circle {{is assumed to}} be tangent to itself; hence, if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects, it is counted as a solution to Apollonius' problem. Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they have a point in common. By definition, a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them, that is, if it lies on them; thus, two distinct points cannot be tangent. If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero, they are said to be tangent; the intersection point is called a tangent point or a point of tangency. (The word [...] "tangent" [...] derives from the Latin present participle, tangens, meaning [...] "touching".) In practice, two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point; if they intersect at zero or two points, they are not tangent. The same holds true for a line and a circle. Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane, although two parallel lines can be considered as tangent at a point at infinity in inversive geometry (see below).|$|E
