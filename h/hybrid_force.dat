Ensemble land data assimilation methods rely on stochastic perturbations of input forcing and model prognostic fields for developing representations of input model error covariances. This article examines the limitations of using a single forcing dataset for specifying forcing uncertainty inputs for assimilating snow depth retrievals. Using an idealized data assimilation experiment, the article demonstrates {{that the use of}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>forcing</b> input strategies (either {{through the use of a}}n ensemble of forcing products or through the added use of the forcing climatology) provide a better characterization of the background model error, which leads to improved data assimilation results, especially during the snow accumulation and melt-time periods. The use of <b>hybrid</b> <b>forcing</b> ensembles is then employed for assimilating snow depth retrievals from the AMSR 2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) instrument over two domains in the continental USA with different snow evolution characteristics. Over a region near the Great Lakes, where the snow evolution tends to be ephemeral, the use of <b>hybrid</b> <b>forcing</b> ensembles provides significant improvements relative to the use of a single forcing dataset. Over the Colorado headwaters characterized by large snow accumulation, the impact of using the forcing ensemble is less prominent and is largely limited to the snow transition time periods. The results of the article demonstrate that improving the background model error through the use of a forcing ensemble enables the assimilation system to better incorporate the observational information...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to examine the}} performance of hybrid forces - forces containing both irregular and regular components - in protracted, theater-level campaigns. It seeks to determine how the <b>hybrid</b> <b>force</b> commander should employ his force to achieve the highest probability of operational success. Accepting that force efficiency is the critical path to operational success, this research focuses on the role of two variables which are often in "tension" in hybrid forces: coordinating the efforts of the two components, and decentralizing the, operations of the irregulars. It explores the influence of these variables in four historical hybrid campaigns. This study demonstrates that the most efficient <b>hybrid</b> <b>force</b> is created by high degrees of both coordination and decentralization. Hybrid forces shaped by these variables maximize costs inflicted on the enemy, while minimizing costs incurred by themselves, by exploiting the enemy's dilemma over whether to disperse to quell the hybrid irregulars, or to concentrate to defeat the hybrid regulars. This research also suggests, however, that coordination and decentralization will only produce the most efficient <b>hybrid</b> <b>force</b> possible when that force enjoys two preconditions in the theater of war: local popular support, and minimum strategic vulnerability for the regulars[URL] United States Arm...|$|E

ART, a typical passive force servo system, can help astronauts to bench press in a microgravity environment.

The simulation results show that the hybrid control method based on the structure invariance principle can inhibit the surplus force and that ICMAC can improve the dynamic performance of the passive force servo system.

40|$|Abstract. Drying of Cashew nut {{to remove}} testa {{is one of}} the most {{energy-intensive}} processes of cashew nut process industry. For this reason a hybrid dryer consisting of a solar flat plate collector, a biomass heater and a drying chamber is designed and fabricated. 40 kg of Cashew nut with initial moisture of 9 % is used in the experiment. The performance test of the dryer is carried out in two modes of operation: hybrid-forced convection and hybrid-natural convection. Drying time and drying efficiency during these two modes of operation are estimated and compared with the sun drying. The system is capable of attaining drying temperature between 50 º and 70 ºC. In the <b>hybrid</b> <b>forced</b> drying, the required moisture content of 3 % is achieved within 7 hours and the average system efficiency is estimated as 5. 08 %. In the hybrid natural drying, the required moisture content is obtained in 9 hours and the average system efficiency is 3. 17 %. The fuel consumption during the drying process is 0. 5 kg/hr and 0. 75 kg/hr for forced mode and natural mode, respectively. The drying process in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>forced</b> mode of operation is twice faster than the sun drying. The dryer can be operated in any climatic conditions: as a solar dryer on normal sunny days, as a biomass dryer at night time and as a hybrid dryer on cloudy days.
