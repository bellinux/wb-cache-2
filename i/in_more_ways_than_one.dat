5|$|Scott's {{influence}} is felt throughout the novel. Lengthy {{descriptions of the}} countryside are interrupted constantly by tangents explaining the history of Brittany and its people. The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author. Like the Mahicans of Cooper's novel, the Chouan insurgents are skilled at using their surroundings, {{coming out of the}} woods <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> <b>one,</b> for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in}} the Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, Taranaki's Andrew Hore was sin-binned for holding the ball, and the Lions took control.

500|$|Kyle Anderson of MTV said he [...] "was {{surprised}} <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> [...] "with {{his first}} listening of ...Baby One More Time, commenting he [...] "expected {{there to be}} a lot of filler (there sort of is), though I didn't expect it to be as odd (at least sonically) as it ended up being. There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone gave the album two stars out of five, and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and Samantha Fox. Walters also said that [...] "while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', are pure spam." [...] A NME reviewer rated ...Baby One More Time 1 out of 10, saying that [...] "we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career". He also found the album premature, commenting, [...] "hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched life that we all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking so fucking smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the more happier for it. Now grow up, girl. Quick!" [...] Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic felt that, [...] "with the exception of the terrific title track, ...Baby One More Time is a collection of either competent pop songs underwhelmingly executed or underwhelmingly written pop songs competently executed." ...|$|E
500|$|The girdle's {{symbolic}} meaning, in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, {{has been}} construed {{in a variety}} of ways. Interpretations range from sexual in nature to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a [...] "trophy". However, it is not entirely clear who the [...] "winner" [...] is: Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak in order to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak returns home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host but, instead, hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain’s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death. To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In Sir Gawain, the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one’s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either–or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> <b>one.</b> [...] While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak’s wife’s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of Sir Gawain, Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away).|$|E

[...] But 1993 opened on a sour note with Allison finishing 28th at Daytona. [...] That finish was followed by a 16th at Rockingham, but Davey rebounded to win at Richmond the following week. The next race at Atlanta was delayed a week by a blizzard that blanketed much of the Southeast. [...] Morgan Shepherd won the race and Davey finished 13th. [...] He then posted an 11th at Darlington. Despite the early season struggles, Davey was sixth in the Winston Cup standings, while defending series champ Kulwicki was ninth.|$|E
2500|$|... 1997 was {{the last}} year of the Tucson Toros, <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> <b>one.</b> In a {{complicated}} [...] "swap", the team was sold to the owner of the Phoenix Firebirds, so that the Phoenix AAA team technically moved to Tucson while retaining the Tucson club's staff and facilities. The long affiliation with the Houston Astros was suddenly over, as Tucson signed a one-year agreement with the Milwaukee Brewers. The one major league prospect with the Toros who {{was not part of the}} Brewers' organization was Travis Lee of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The new franchise did not yet have a AAA team of its own, so Lee was assigned to the nearby Tucson team for part of the season. Although Travis Lee personally had a good year, the transitional Toros only managed a 64–78 record. It was the Tucson team's last season at Hi Corbett Field, and their last season with the Toros name.|$|E

A well-organised society is one in which we know the truth about ourselves collectively, not one in which we tell pleasant lies about ourselves". Mark Levine, {{a professor of history at}} the University of California at Irvine, said that Judt's [...] "writings on European history and the need for a new social contract between rulers and ruled can inspire a new generation of scholars and activists in other cultures".

2500|$|David Cronenberg, one of {{the leading}} B-movie auteurs of the , had stepped up in {{financial}} grade with Scanners (1980), a $3.5 million production that Time critic Richard Corliss associated with his earlier, low-budget films as well as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978) and John Carpenter's The Fog (1980) as [...] "hip parables of contemporary moral malaise." [...] Cronenberg's crowning achievement in that vein would come {{a decade and a half}} later: Like that of Scanners in 1980, the budget of Crash, $10 million, wasn't comfortably A-grade by 1996, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: [...] "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick," [...] is how Janet Maslin's New York Times review begins. The review ends with an explanation of the film's rating: [...] "Crash has the NC-17 rating (No one under 17 admitted) that it fully deserves. It includes frontal nudity, many sexual encounters and coolly grotesque situations linking sex and violence in graphic, sickening ways." [...] Financed, like King of New York, by a consortium of production companies, it was ultimately picked up for U.S. distribution by Fine Line Features. <b>In</b> <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> <b>one,</b> this result resonated perfectly with the way the film scrambled definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division.|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} review and said, [...] "Scott {{did a great}} job reviving the Roman sand-and-sandals epic when he made the Oscar-winning Gladiator.

[...] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "It’s impossible not to feel some awe at the spectacle, but more shocks would have helped see you through the two-and-a-half hour running time." [...] Phillips Hawker of The Sydney Morning Herald gave a mixed review and awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying, [...] "Exodus: Gods And Kings... lacks Gladiator's full-on intensity and committed central performances, however; it's a mixture of the grand and the bland, and when it's not spectacular it's a little plodding." [...] Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "Some may well desire a purer, fuller version of the story, one more faithful to the text and less clearly shaped by the demands of the Hollywood blockbuster. But on its own grand, imperfect terms, [...] "Exodus: Gods and Kings" [...] is undeniably transporting, marked by a free-flowing visual splendor that plays to its creator’s unique strengths: Given how many faith-based movies are content to tell their audiences what to think or feel, it’s satisfying to see one whose images alone are enough to compel awestruck belief." [...] Jim Vejvoda of IGN said, [...] "Director Ridley Scott gets lost in the desert at times in Exodus: Gods and Kings, his epic, but not entirely effective take on the story of Moses' journey from Prince of Egypt to Hebrew leader." ...|$|E
