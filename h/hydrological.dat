5|$|It has {{interfered}} with the <b>hydrological</b> cycle by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a cooling effect that may have partially counteracted the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E
5|$|The main soils in the {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil. The watershed's soils are in mostly the hydrologic soil groups B and C. However, the <b>hydrological</b> soil group D is also present.|$|E
5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} <b>hydrological</b> role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter {{the paths of}} streams and rivers and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats. One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent {{increase in the number of}} herbaceous plant species in riparian areas. Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated <b>hydrological</b> phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, <b>hydrological</b> runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E
5|$|The {{unprecedented}} rainfall {{turned the}} Chena River into a torrent. On August 14, it passed flood stage {{and continued to}} rise. Because no <b>hydrological</b> equipment had been installed upstream of Fairbanks, residents were unaware of the flood's scale. All day and night on August 14, the water rose. It inundated the A-67 site and volunteers allowed water to fill the hold of the SS Nenana {{to keep it from}} floating on the rising waters and damaging buildings. In downtown Fairbanks, hundreds of volunteers built a sandbag dike around St. Joseph's Hospital to no avail. As the water crested the emergency dike, doctors, nurses, and patients evacuated to the University of Alaska on College Hill.|$|E
5|$|Within the Western Pacific, RSMC Tokyo-Typhoon Center, {{part of the}} Japan Meteorological Agency has had the {{official}} warning responsibility {{for the whole of}} the Western Pacific since 1989, and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000. However each National Meteorological and <b>Hydrological</b> Service within the western Pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country, such as the Joint Typhoon Warning Center for United States agencies, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for interests in the island archipelago nation, and the Hong Kong Observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of warning signals.|$|E

25|$|The Amazon basin has a {{high flow}} of water and it is prone to floods. The Parana basin {{represents}} approximately 42% of the total area of Bolivia and it is prone to droughts and desertification. The {{quantity and quality of}} <b>hydrological</b> information is very poor.|$|E

25|$|The {{summit of}} the range is {{considered}} as a divide between two <b>hydrological</b> systems because {{of the difference between}} the two slopes of the mountain. The eastern slope is much steeper and favors surface stream flows, whereas the western slope is less steep and favors ground water aquifers.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 the {{construction}} of a rock rubble weir on the Whangamarino River was commissioned by the Department of Conservation and the Auckland/Waikato Fish and Game Council. The weir maintains minimum summer water levels in approximately 1,400 hectares of the mineralised wetland and helps recreate a seasonal <b>hydrological</b> cycle.|$|E
25|$|These {{relations}} vary to a {{great extent}} from place to place and are not easy to measure.

25|$|Throughout the Great Western Woodlands {{there are}} both native and exotic species of weeds.

25|$|Several notable {{droughts}} in the United Kingdom {{have occurred}} in recorded history, some of these in the 21st century. They {{can be divided into}} two categories, the meteorological drought where little or no rain fell over a relatively short period and the <b>hydrological</b> drought, where below average rainfall has occurred over an extended period.|$|E
25|$|The country's <b>hydrological</b> {{resources}} are relatively small. The longest rivers {{of the country}} include the White Drin, the South Morava and the Ibar. Sitnica, a tributary of Ibar, is the largest river lying completely within the country's territory. River Nerodimka represents Europe's only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into the Black Sea and Aegean Sea.|$|E
25|$|The hydrologic soil group C is {{predominant}} along most of Hicks Creek's upper reaches, {{though its}} headwaters {{are near the}} hydrologic soil group D. Hydrologic soil group A occurs in a large patch in the creek's middle reaches and <b>hydrological</b> soil group B occurs in two patches along the creek, {{one of which is}} near its mouth.|$|E
25|$|A <b>hydrological</b> drought can occur, after a {{relatively}} dry winter whereby the soil moisture storage, reservoirs and water table have not risen sufficiently {{to counteract the}} warm summer weather. These sort of conditions can go over several years, even with above average rainfall {{at the time as}} the rainfall only slowly percolates through the water stores and replenishes them.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrological</b> {{resources}} (see Geography above) {{are also}} lacking: {{the demand for}} water exceeds the supply, with this imbalance especially serious in Alicante province. In particularly severe drought years, the problem is managed through occasional nocturnal restrictions during summer and exploitation of aquifers. Valencia's water needs result in harsh contention with neighbouring regions such as Castilla–La Mancha and Catalonia.|$|E
