It made the heart ache to see the groups of men, women and children, with weary, blood-shot eyes and smoke begrimed faces, standing over their scraps of furniture and clothing -- some of them asleep on the ground from utter exhaustion -- all with despondency depicted on their faces.

5000|$|My foreman and I went {{directly}} to the pits. Nobody bothered us. Now I heard rifle shots in quick succession from behind one of the earth mounds. The people who had got off the trucks - men, women and children of all ages - had to undress upon the order of an SS man who carried a riding or dog whip. They had to put down their clothes in fixed places, sorted according to shoes, top clothing and undergarments. I saw heaps of shoes of about 800 to 1000 pairs, great piles of under-linen and clothing. Without screaming or weeping these people undressed, stood around in family groups, kissed each other, said farewells, and waited for a sign from another SS man, who stood near the pit, also with a whip in his hand. During the fifteen minutes I stood near, I heard no complaint or plea for mercy. I watched a family of about eight persons, {{a man and a woman}} both of about fifty, with their children of about twenty to twenty-four, and two grown-up daughters about twenty-eight or twenty-nine. An old woman with snow white hair was holding a one-year-old child in her arms and singing to it and tickling it. The child was cooing with delight. The parents were looking on with tears in their eyes. The father was holding the hand of a boy about ten years old and speaking to him softly; the boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed to the sky, stroked his head and seemed to explain something to him. At that moment the SS man at the pit started shouting something to his comrade. The latter counted off about twenty persons and instructed them to go behind the earth mound. Among them was the family I have just mentioned. I well remember a girl, slim with black hair, who, as she passed me, pointed to herself and said, [...] "twenty-three years old." [...] <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mound and found myself confronted by a tremendous grave. People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that only their heads were visible. Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads. Some of the people shot were still moving. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was nearly two-thirds full. I estimated that it already contained about a thousand people. I looked for the man who did the shooting. He was an SS man, who sat at the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet dangling into the pit. He had a tommy-gun on his knees and was smoking a cigarette. The people, completely naked, went down some steps which were cut in the clay wall of the pit and clambered over the heads of the people lying there to the place to which the SS man directed them. They lay down in front of the dead or wounded people; some caressed those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice. Then I heard a series of shots. I looked into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching or the heads lying already motionless on top of the bodies that lay beneath them. Blood was running from their necks. The next batch was approaching already. They went down into the pit, lined themselves up against the previous victims and were shot.|$|E
5000|$|Sunny Afternoon {{was made}} very quickly, in the morning, {{it was one}} of our most {{atmospheric}} sessions. I still like to keep tapes of the few minutes before the final take, things that happen before the session. Maybe it's superstitious, but I believe if I had done things differently—if <b>I</b> had <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> studio or gone out—it wouldn't have turned out that way. The bass player went off and started playing funny little classical things on the bass, more like a lead guitar: and Nicky Hopkins, who was playing piano on that session, was playing [...] "Liza"—we always used to play that song—little things like that helped us get into the feeling of the song.At the time I wrote Sunny Afternoon I couldn't listen to anything. I was only playing The Greatest Hits of Frank Sinatra and Dylan's Maggie's Farm—I just liked its whole presence, I was playing the Bringing It All Back Home LP along with my Frank Sinatra and Glenn Miller and Bach—it was a strange time. I thought they all helped one another, they went into the chromatic part that's {{in the back of the}} song. I once made a drawing of my voice on Sunny Afternoon. It was a leaf with a very thick outline—a big blob in the background—the leaf just cutting through it.|$|R
50|$|During the story, {{the theme}} of dealing with grief overcomes the narrator, the {{landlord}} and Frank. Premature death grief results from the guilt that they {{try to deal with}} because of the AIDS epidemic. Many of their friends, for example one named Nick is overcome by the disease. When told about his HIV, Nick “looked like a deer caught in a car’s headlights for weeks... he even chased the doctor who had given him the news into a grocery store...one day and stood there in Produce screaming at him that he was wrong” (115). The idea of dealing with someone who should not have died is something that all of the homosexual men have to deal with because of AIDS. Along with not wanting to deal with the actual past events, they also become angered and depressed. The narrator explains the idea of trying to accept the death of someone who was not supposed to die. “Our age, our solitary status, {{the fact that we had}} survived something so many friends of ours had not... was one reason no doubt <b>I</b> simply <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> halls but never touched a human being: the presence of the dead” (73). The sense of grief that they feel is one in which they are guilty, bearing down the weight of something that should have happened to them, but rather it did not. In that way, their grief remains constant, unable to be forgotten or to be accepted fully.|$|R
5000|$|As he {{explained}} {{in an interview}} late in life, Tames took the photograph {{through the door of}} the Oval Office, after Kennedy thought he had left: [...] President Kennedy's back was broken during the war, when that torpedo boat of his was hit by the Japanese destroyer. As a result of that injury he wore a brace on his back most of his life. Quite a few people didn't realize that. Also he could never sit for any length of time, more than thirty or forty minutes in a chair without having to get up and <b>walk</b> <b>around.</b> Particularly when it felt bad he had a habit, in the House, and the Senate, and into the Presidency, of carrying his weight on his shoulders, literally, by leaning over a desk, putting down his palms out flat, and leaning over and carrying the weight of his upper body by his shoulder muscles, and sort of stretching or easing his back. He would read and work that way, which was something I had seen him do many times. When I saw him doing that, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> in, stood by his rocking chair, and then I looked down and framed him between the two windows, and I shot that picture. I only made two exposures on it--we were very conservative with our film. Then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{out of the room and}} stood there for a while, then I saw him straighten up. I went in again and I photographed him straight up, for a different shot, from <b>the</b> back, then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> to <b>the</b> side and photographed him profile, right and left. He had a copy of the New York Times, he was reading the editorial page--and I have that print right here, I was looking at it just the other day. He looked over and he saw me. He hadn't been aware that I took that picture from back, but he saw me when I moved to the side there. He glanced over at me, and he said: [...] "I wonder where Mr. Krock gets all the crap he puts in this horseshit column of his." [...] Apparently he was much upset about Mr. Krock's column that day. So that was the occasion of that picture.|$|R

40|$|Australian artist Patricia Piccinini {{is famous}} for her life-like sculptures and images of fantastical but {{possible}} humans, animals, objects and their hybrid combinations. Her work {{raises questions about the}} environment, animal ethics and genetic manipulation, whilst confounding the boundary between human and animal. In 2011, the Art Gallery of South Australia staged the largest collection of Piccinini’s work, accompanied by a series of public talks where academics were invited to comment from the perspective of their own disciplinary background and research. I was invited to contribute the perspective of an anthropologist specialising in the study of human-animal relations. As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> gallery, Piccinini’s art evoked sensations and responses in me that I immediately recalled from my research on mounted bullfighting. In that research, I used the metaphor of the part human- part horse centaur from classical Greek mythology to symbolise {{the ways in which the}} human-animal boundary was confounded in mounted bullfighting. In so doing, I adapted a mythology of the past to explain an art form of the present. This paper describes how I saw the same human-animal boundary blurring occurring in the Piccinini exhibition. As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> exhibition and wrote reflective notes, I was struck by the thought that Piccinini’s art revealed a mythology of the present. Her work is commonly interpreted as suspending for critique the medico-scientific developments of the present historical period referred to as the anthropocene. However, by embodying those developments and their possibilities in her work and sculpture, Piccinini can also be understood to be presenting an overlooked mythology of the present. She challenges the human-animal boundary in a hybrid move that Bruno Latour considers characteristic of the modern human condition. By collapsing art and science into one another, her work can be seen to fulfil another distinction of the contemporary human which, according to Alfred Gell is the sacralisation of art. In Picinnini’s work, however, art equates with religion in an iconic modern mythology. Through the enchanting magic of science, this is a mythology that no matter how fantastical it may appear, is wholly within the realm of possibility...|$|E
40|$|When I {{began my}} {{doctoral}} {{studies in the}} fall of 2002, I found myself engaged in a difficult balancing act. If two {{children under the age of}} six, a husband, a part-time job, and aging parents were not enough to manage, adding serious graduate work to this already heavy load seemed impossible to handle. Initially, I was unsteady – losing my footing and balance on the thin beam upon which <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> each day. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> same time, I also came across an aphorism that encouraged slow but steady work towards the realization of a goal. It read something like this: Plant one flower a year and in ten years you shall have a beautiful garden. I decided to make this one of my mantras. And so, I began to work slowly but consistently towards my doctorate, taking two or three courses per academic year (or planting a couple of flowers at a time). Over the years, my decision to limit my course load has kept me from falling off the balance beam of life and has thus enabled me to juggle my family and academic demands with a good degree of dexterity. In retrospect, any other route to my doctorate may have yielded either sloppy work or neglect in many aspects of my life. Each year, then, I progress slowly but consistently through my doctoral studies. I keep adding beautiful flowers to my garden (i. e., by completing doctoral hurdles) and am still able t...|$|R
40|$|Principles of aging-in-place {{emphasize}} the importance of creating sustainable environments that enable older people to maintain a sense of belonging, autonomy, independence, safety and security. Simply altering the built environment is insufficient for creating more inclusive environments for older persons, as creating ‘meaningful’ places for aging involves consideration of psychosocial and cultural issues that go beyond issues of physical space. This paper illustrates how applications of community-based participatory research methods, in particular participatory community mapping workshops (PCMWs), can be used to access experiences of place, identify facilitators and barriers to accessing the built environment and co-create place-based solutions among older people and service providers in a new affordable housing development in Western Canada. Founded on tenets of empowerment and relationship building, four PCMWs were undertaken with 54 participants (N= 38 older people; N= 16 local service providers). PCMWs comprised (<b>i)</b> experiential group <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> community to access understandings of place and community and (ii) mapping exercises, whereby participants articulated their place-based needs {{within the context of the}} new affordable housing development and surrounding neighbourhood. Dialogues were digitally recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Visual data, including photographs taken during experiential group walks were categorized and integrated into the narrative to illustrate place meanings. PCMWs enabled senior housing and social care professionals and decision-makers to co-construct knowledge with older tenants that facilitated place action and change. Key themes identified by participants included: identifying services and needs for health and wellbeing, having opportunities for social participation and overcoming cross-cultural challenges.

40|$|Many {{people choose}} to live in urban environments. Since {{everyday}} life in many cities {{is characterized by a}} high pace it is important that good recreational areas, with the possibility of recovery, are available to the population. This paper is based on a case study of Växjö city park, which is the area surrounding the lake Växjösjön. The park and the lake are of great importance to the citizens.

Through a survey among the users of the park, I study how people use and perceive <b>the</b> environment <b>around</b> <b>the</b> lake. The aim is to identify the recreational and social values such an environment can offer the inhabitants of the city. <b>I</b> describe a <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> lake to give an idea of how the city park is designed, and how the environment can provide the conditions for recreation and social activities. The eight park characters, developed by Patrik Grahn have significance for the use of parks. These characters are presented briefly in this paper and applied to the survey to study whether some of them {{can be found in the}} park. According to my appraisal, Växjö city park has several areas with characteristics matching the park characters. With several characters represented, the park creates possibilities to provide for the recreational needs of a greater number of people. Moreover, it contributes to the park being appreciated by many, and thus also creates social values...|$|R
