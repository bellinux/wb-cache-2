This paper considers the application of the method of median indicator kriging to post-accident deposition data, in order to produce results in a form suitable for use by decision makers. The method is tested on various datasets generated from a gaussian plume atmospheric dispersal model. The results show that the method can be customised to include <b>intervention</b> <b>levels,</b> which are used in determining countermeasures to be implemented following a release of radiation to the environment. Incorporating <b>intervention</b> <b>levels</b> into the method is shown to reduce the uncertainty of the estimates produced.

40|$|When {{compared}} to most corporal discipline practices (i. e., spanking, beating, or burning), Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) {{is a particularly}} lethal form of child abuse, killing as many as 40 % of its victims. Unlike other corporal discipline practices, shaking an infant {{is thought to be}} a failure in caregiver impulse control and in managing fatigue, frustration, and anger. However, SBS is rarely deemed as accidental; the injuries that result from shaking an infant are most often classified as non-accidental head injuries. Common perception of these perpetrators is that, at a minimum, they are criminally negligent and, maximally, they are guilty of premeditation. Societal response to this crime favors punishment of the guilty, rather than education or treatment for those at risk. In the current study, approximately 260 participants completed an original survey on attitudes about infant care practices. Participants were then {{randomly assigned to one of}} three <b>intervention</b> <b>levels</b> designed to raise awareness of the practices that may pose a risk to infants.

50|$|External <b>interventions</b> see {{different}} <b>levels</b> {{of democratization}} success {{depending on the}} type of intervener, type of <b>intervention,</b> and <b>level</b> of elite cooperation prior to the <b>intervention.</b> The <b>level</b> of neutrality and geopolitical disinterest the intervener possesses is important, as is the severity of the intervention's infringement on sovereignty. The differences can be highlighted with three examples: a neutral, mostly unobtrusive monitor missions like UN election observers in Nicaragua in 1989; the multilateral NATO IFOR mission in Yugoslavia to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1031 in 1995; and the unilateral, destabilizing intervention represented by the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. All three missions aimed on some level to promote democracy, with varying degrees of success. Michael Doyle and Nicholas Sambanis have found that the peacekeeping missions most successful at producing fledgling democracies have strong mandates backing them up, but tend not to revolve around military enforcement. Successful democratizing interventions consist of monitoring factions' adherence to their negotiated settlement, while the most successful ones include extensive state-building (such as improving government efficiency and professionalism, or classical infrastructure assistance).|$|R

We accomplish this through consideration of a design pattern language for collaboration processes drawn from the Collaboration Engineering literature. We conclude by discussing how this model of structuring tactics advances theory and practice in the GSS domain...|$|E

This paper argues for a more appropriate balance of "downstream" efforts with a more appropriate whole population public health approach to health policy -what may be termed a social policy approach to healthy lifestyles rather than the current lifestyle approach to health policy.
