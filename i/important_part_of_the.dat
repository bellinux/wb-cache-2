5|$|Originally {{separated}} by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elizabethan exploration. Queen Elizabeth I visited the royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake. As {{well as for}} exploration, Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 {{until late in the}} 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was also connected with the slave trade, John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, the slave who became an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abolition of the slave trade, was sold from one ship's captain to another in Deptford around 1760.|$|E

In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} is an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis, {{it is often}} not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions {{to show up on}} a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E

The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues {{to serve a}} heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day. The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal. There have been various proposals {{over the years to}} add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.|$|E
5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew's {{schedule}} was regular exercise. They had {{three pieces of}} equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned {{near the end of}} February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E
5|$|Annual Carnival {{celebrations}} are an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{culture of}} all the Lesser Antillean islands.

5|$|Buses are an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern {{transport}} mix, with bus ridership {{above the}} England and Wales average {{in all three}} Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England, and the region saw intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car ownership in the same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher than in most areas of the South.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{production}} in the East Texas Oil Field and oil prices stabilized. Though the major urban areas continued to grow, the extreme growth patterns {{of the first three}} decades began to slow.

Though independent oil companies were still an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industry for some time, the major new strikes were increasingly made by established companies. World War II helped complete the state's transition to an industrialized and urbanized state with oil facilitating the transition.|$|E
