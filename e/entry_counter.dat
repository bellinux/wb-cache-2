This hospital provides number of patient services and it Is mainly responsible for delivering a comprehensive range of secondary and tertiary specialist care. This research was conducted to analyze current situation of waiting and overcrowding at National Hospital {{and to find out}} ways to provide efficient service to patients. This research is mainly focused on two areas, out patient management and inpatient management. // Out Patient Department of National Hospital comprises of General OPD section, Admission section and Emergency Treatment Unit (ETU). In this study, only the General OPD section was considered. Data collection was done through hospital records, observations and a questionnaire survey. Descriptive techniques, queuing theory techniques and simulation techniques were used in data analysis. Using GPSS/PC simulation language, existing queuing situation at General OPD was simulated. Long queues and high waiting times were found at <b>Entry</b> <b>Counter,</b> Room 15, Room 2 and Room 5. OPD is overcrowded due to increased demand, unnecessary arrivals, lack of resources and ignorance of patients on OPD procedures. Most of the facilities for staff and patients are inadequate. To avoid unnecessary visits to OPD, are feral system should be enforced. To reduce queuing at some rooms alternativeoptions were suggested. Proper inquiry counter should be implemented and proper directions should be given to patients in order to have efficient management at General OPD. // Inpatient section of National Hospital, also provides a large number of patient services. Patient admissions were high for Medical, Surgical, Accidents, Cardiology and Orthopedic wards. The bed capacity of National Hospital is around 2900. This hospital has high bed occupancy rate, high throughput and very low bed emptiness. In some wards a considerable number of floor patients can be seen. These wards are overcrowded due to unnecessary admissions, lack of resources and improper utilization of available resources. By providing more resources, avoiding unnecessary arrivals and irregularities of staff and using computerization, services can be much improved at National Hospital of Sri Lanka...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Counter</b> <b>entries.</b> An IBM tabulating machine, {{such as the}} 402 or 407 series {{would have}} several {{counters}} available in different sizes. (For example, the IBM 402/403 had four sets each of 2, 4, 6 and 8 digit counters, labeled 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 4A, 4B etc.) Each counter had two <b>counter</b> control <b>entries</b> to specify either addition (plus) or subtraction (minus). If neither were pulsed, no operation was performed. If addition was commanded, a digit impulse wired from a column to a <b>counter</b> <b>entry</b> hub started the counter wheel turning. It stopped automatically at zero time. Thus a pulse at 8 time caused the wheel to advance 8 steps, adding the value 8 to that counter position. Carries within a group were performed automatically. Carry in and carry out hubs allowed counters to be coupled, permitting longer numbers to be accumulated. Subtraction was more complicated and used nines complement arithmetic.|$|R

Specialized DC subsets differ depending on their origin, tissue location {{and the influence of}} trophic factors, the latter remain to be fully understood. Myeloid-associated lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbetaR) signaling is required for the local proliferation of lymphoid tissue DC. This review focuses on the LTbetaR signaling cascade as a crucial positive trophic signal in the homeostasis of DC subsets.

We supplement these six isometric operations by further ten transformations that have a metamorphic (altering) effect on the underlying geometry. When grouped together, four different linear combinations of the metamorphic generators form a previously obtained third-rank tensor. This is shown to describe four different types of mutually commuting ''shifting'' operations in fundamental measure space. The relevance for fundamental measures density functional theory is discussed briefly...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{contracting}} problem between {{a shopping mall}} and potential anchors (large stores) in a market where consumers with high search costs must choose shopping destinations prior to learning prices. Our model incorporates the interaction between contracting and asymmetric firm sizes into a framework of competing platforms. The mall {{is but one of}} three potential destinations in the market, complemented by a stand-alone location for a large store, and a competitive ‘downtown’ centre occupied by small retailers. As in Dudey’s (1990) homogeneousgood framework, consumers choose to visit only one of these locations, based on expected prices at each site. A game of sequential contracting for slots at the mall determines the equilibrium distribution of firms across locations based on their costs and relative bargaining power. We analyze the effects of three policies. First, prohibition of the stand-alone site can increase social welfare, by alleviating excess <b>entry</b> and <b>countering</b> inefficiencies in contracting between the mall owner and potential anchors. Second, subsidies for downtown may push prices at the mall closer to socially efficient levels, but can never increase welfare if the market is initially dominated by a stand-alone big store. A subsidy’s effect on the equilibrium size distribution of mall tenants depends on the concavity of demand. Third, a merger between two big stores can increase social welfare, in part by ameliorating a problem of externalities on non-traders in the contracting with the mall owner. Merged anchor stores that operate at stand-alone sites may retain occupancy of mall space for purely strategic reasons, in order to deter entry. ...|$|R

50|$|The DT {{contains}} the network {{view of the}} neighbors of a node. It contains a matrix where each element {{contains the}} distance and the penultimate node reported by a neighbor for a particular destination. The RT contains the up-to-date view of the network for all known destinations. It keeps the shortest distance, the predecessor node (penultimate node), the successor node (the next node to reach the destination), and a flag indicating {{the status of the}} path. The path status may be a simple path (correct), or a loop (error), or the destination node not marked (null). The LCT contains the cost (e.g., the number of hops to reach the destination) of relaying messages through each link. The cost of a broken link is infinity. It also contains the number of update periods (intervals between two successive periodic updates) passed since the last successful update was received from that link. This is done to detect links breaks. The MRL contains an entry for every update message that is to be retransmitted and maintains a <b>counter</b> for each <b>entry.</b> This <b>counter</b> is decremented after every retransmission of an update message. Each update message contains a list of updates. A node also marks each node in the RT that has to acknowledge the update message it transmitted. Once the counter reaches zero, the entries in the update message for which no acknowledgments have been received are to be retransmitted and the update message is deleted. Thus, a node detects a link break by the number of update periods missed since the last successful transmission. After receiving an update message, a node not only updates the distance for transmission neighbors but also checks the other neighbors’ distance, hence convergence is much faster than DSDV.|$|R
40|$|So far little {{empirical}} evidence exists on how real wages of newly hired workers react to business cycle conditions. This paper aims at filling this gap for Germany {{by analyzing the}} cyclical behavior of real wages of newly hired workers while controlling for 'cyclical upgrading' and 'cyclical downgrading' in employee/employer matches over the cycle. The analysis is undertaken for the 1977 to 2009 period using administrative longitudinal matched employer-employee wage data. I find that {{an increase in the}} unemployment rate of one percentage point decreases the real wages of job entries within given firm-jobs by about 1. 27 percent. In light of the magnitude of the entry-wage cyclicality it seems that introducing wage rigidity in the Mortensen-Pissarides model in order to amplify realistic volatility of unemployment is not supported by the data. Further I show that the procyclicality of the employment/population ratio is identical to the procyclicality of real <b>entry</b> wages. This <b>counters</b> the view of many macroeconomists that wages are much less cyclical than employment and unemployment.
