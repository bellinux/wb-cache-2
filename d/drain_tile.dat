Attention {{has been focused on}} P in surface runoff, but agricultural <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> also can be a source. Lake Macatawa is a hypereutrophic lake located in west Michigan, and the watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture. Further research is needed to understand the influence of bioavailable P originating from <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> on water quality in Lake Macatawa. The objectives of this study were to 1) conduct a <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> effluent sampling survey to assess their importance as a source of P in the Macatawa Watershed; 2) investigate the change in <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> P concentrations spatially and temporally over a one-year period; and 3) use growth chamber algal bioassays and the ratio of soluble reactive phosphorus to total phosphorus (SRP:TP) to assess <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> P bioavailability.

40|$|PURPOSE: An {{essential}} nutrient for plant growth, phosphorus (P) is often implicated as {{a contributing factor}} to algal blooms. Lake Macatawa is a hypereutrophic lake located in west Michigan, and the watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess agricultural <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> as a source of P in the Macatawa Watershed. SUBJECTS: Nine <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> outlets in the Macatawa Watershed from March 2015 – February 2016. METHODS: 1) Conduct a <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> effluent survey by measuring soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) once per month; 2) investigate the change in <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> P concentrations temporally over a one-year period; and 3) use seasonal algal bioassays to measure the bioavailability of P found within the <b>tile</b> <b>drains.</b> ANALYSIS: Kruskal-Wallis tests with a Holm’s adjustment compared P concentrations between sample sites and between sample dates. Linear regression was used to relate SRP concentration to algal growth after the bioassays. RESULTS: <b>Tile</b> <b>drain</b> outlet SRP and TP concentrations varied temporally and spatially. The SRP:TP ratio measured at the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> outlets had a significant, positive correlation with acreage <b>drained</b> by the <b>tile</b> system.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Contamination {{events at}} Oak Creek, which runs through Oregon State University Research lands, {{prompted}} investigations into alternate transport mechanisms for moving liquid effluent from OSU Diary lands to Oak Creek. Magnetometer surveys {{conducted at the}} Diary identified magnetic signatures spatially associated with sub-surface locations of <b>drain</b> <b>tiles,</b> a 12 -inch pipe, and other features. These pipes may provide alternate methods of transporting effluent to Oak Creek. Magnetometer surveys {{in support of the}} contamination study identified an interesting variability in the Earth's local magnetic field. Magnetic signatures spatially associated with <b>drain</b> <b>tiles</b> appear strong in the western portion of the site, but fade out {{in the eastern part of}} the site. The cause of this variability was investigated by examining soil iron distributions. The Field-scale soil iron distribution was determined using a colorimetric analysis of extractions obtained from soil core samples. This study shows larger concentrations of iron in the western portion of the site where the magnetic signal is strong and lower concentrations of iron where the magnetic signal is lower. Tile-scale iron distribution over the <b>drain</b> <b>tiles</b> and in control units were analyzed using the same colorimetric technique. This study identified a disturbance to the natural iron distribution over the tile in the western part of the site due to soil mixing in the back-filled tile trench resulting in a contrast in the magnetic data. In the eastern part of the site, where there is no magnetic signature associated with the tile, the iron distribution over the tile looks similar to the control unit results. Analysis of the soils determined that excavating during tile installation disturbed soil horizons, but the iron has redistributed itself to the pre-tile configuration effectively erasing the magnetic contrast that existed shortly after tile installation. This project has shown that iron redistribution can adversely affect the ability of magnetometer surveys to identify <b>drain</b> <b>tiles.</b> This project also demonstrates that soils must be looked at as dynamic systems rather than the more common static system approach when evaluating the success of magnetometer surveys. Applying a dynamic view of soils can help ground-based remote sensing surveyors avoid costly, unproductive surveys...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTile {{drainage}} systems are sometimes {{not sufficient to}} provide favorable unsaturated conditions in the rootzone. These {{drainage systems}} then need to be supplemented with an additional high conductivity material in the trenches above the tiles or by implementing mole drainage. The HYDRUS (2 D/ 3 D) model {{was used to evaluate}} the impact of such additional measures for heavy clay soil. Three types of drainage systems were simulated: (i) <b>tile</b> <b>drains,</b> (ii) <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> with gravel trenches, and (iii) <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> with gravel trenches and mole drains, using either two-dimensional (the former two systems) or three-dimensional (the latter one) transport domains. Three scenarios were considered to test the efficiency of each system: (i) time to drain an initially saturated system, (ii) high intensity rainfall, and (iii) a real case scenario. Different horizontal spacings between <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> with or without gravel trenches were also compared with the system which included mole drainage. The results showed that the drainage system that included mole drains and gravel trenches was the most efficient. This system provided the largest drainage rate, was the first to reach steady-state in the time to drain scenario, and also efficiently reduced surface runoff. Adding mole drains to a system with <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> and gravel trenches resulted in a large reduction of surface runoff (75 %). Simulations showed that the spacing of <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> with or without gravel trenches would have to be 40 % or 55 % smaller, respectively, in order to reproduce the same water table levels as those observed for the drainage system with mole drains. Therefore, introducing mole drains in drainage systems is an efficient practice for reducing waterlogging and runoff...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} tests whether an {{explicit}} treatment of worm burrows and <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> as connected structures is feasible for simulating water flow, bromide and pesticide transport in structured heterogeneous soils at hillslope scale. The essence is to represent worm burrows as morphologically connected paths of low flow resistance in a hillslope model.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{allowing the}} rapid release of stored water to streams are poorly understood. Here {{we use a}} <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> field site to combine naturally structured soils at the hillslope scale with the advantage of at least partly controlled lower boundary conditions. We performed {{a series of three}} irrigation experiments combining hydrometric measurements with stable isotope and bromide tracers to better understand macropore-matrix interactions and stored water release processes at the hillslope scale. Stable isotope concentrations were monitored in the irrigation water, the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> discharge and the soil water before and after the experiment. Bromide was measured at mainly every 5 – 15 min in the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> hydrograph. Different initial conditions for each experiment were used to examine how pre-event soil moisture conditions influenced flow and transport. Different amounts of irrigation water were necessary to increase <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> discharge above the base flow level.

40|$|Modelling {{the impact}} of climate change on the water from {{agricultural}} areas on a regional scale over a 40 year time period {{is the subject of}} this thesis. The Grand River watershed spans approximately 290 km with an area of approximately 6, 800 km². Approximately 90 % of the watershed is agricultural land some of which is <b>tile</b> <b>drained.</b> These <b>tile</b> <b>drains,</b> which cover approximately 15 % of the total land of the watershed, are installed to augment field drainage. The <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> usually outlet somewhere along the perimeter of a property; the discharge then typically moves along the surface until it discharges into a surface water body such as a river, pond, or lake. Investigating {{the impact of}} climate change on agricultural tile drainage at a watershed scale can be achieved using modelling. The <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> can affect both the water quality and the water quantity of a watershed. With the potential climatic changes, the storm intensity, and growing season also could change. Spatial data for the Grand River watershed was gathered to allow for further simulation. The data for <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> areas was added to land use/land class and soil data for the watershed to produce a map of <b>tile</b> <b>drained</b> agricultural areas. Climate change scenarios were then simulated for each cell. Three climate change scenarios were investigated to determine the impact on <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> discharge and the hydrological process for the watershed. The climate change scenarios that were chosen were the A 2, A 1 B, and the B 1 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Soil development among several members of a toposequence consisting of a Typic Hapludoll, Aquic Hapludoll, Typic Haplaquoll, Calcic Haplaquoll, Typic Calciaquoll, and Cumulic Haplaquoll in a closed drainage system was either directly or indirectly influenced by water table fluctuations. Time of the year in conjunction with meterological variables of antecedent and cumulative precipitation, evapotranspiration, and net water were used to develop regression models. Water table inflections decreased as percent slope decreased and distance from watershed edge increased.
