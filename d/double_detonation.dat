40|$|The double-detonation {{explosion}} {{model has}} been considered a candidate for explaining astrophysical transients {{with a wide range}} of luminosities. In this model, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star explodes following detonation of a surface layer of helium. One potential signature of this explosion mechanism is the presence of unburned helium in the outer ejecta, left over from the surface helium layer. In this paper we present simple approximations to estimate the optical depths of important He I lines in the ejecta of double-detonation models. We use these approximations to compute synthetic spectra, including the He I lines, for double-detonation models obtained from hydrodynamical explosion simulations. Specifically, we focus on photospheric-phase predictions for the near-infrared 10830 Å and 2 μm lines of He I. We first consider a <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> model with a luminosity corresponding roughly to normal SNe Ia. This model has a post-explosion unburned He mass of 0. 03 M_ and our calculations suggest that the 2 μm feature is expected to be very weak but that the 10830 Å feature may have modest opacity in the outer ejecta. Consequently, we suggest that a moderate-to-weak He I 10830 Å feature may be expected to form in double-detonation explosions at epochs around maximum light. However, the high velocities of unburned helium predicted by the model (∼ 19, 000 km s^- 1) mean that the He I 10830 Å feature may be confused or blended with the C I 10690 Å line forming at lower velocities. We also present calculations for the He I 10830 Å and 2 μm lines for a lower mass (low luminosity) <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> model, which has a post-explosion He mass of 0. 077 M_.

40|$|We present {{optical and}} {{infrared}} monitoring data of SN 2012 hn {{collected by the}} Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects (PESSTO). We show that SN 2012 hn has a faint peak magnitude (MR ~ - 15. 7) and shows no hydrogen and no clear evidence for helium in its spectral evolution. Instead, we detect prominent Ca II lines at all epochs, which relates this transient to previously described 'Ca-rich' or 'gap' transients. However, the photospheric spectra (from - 3 to + 32 d with respect to peak) of SN 2012 hn show a series of absorption lines which are unique, and a red continuum that is likely intrinsic rather than due to extinction. Lines of Ti II and Cr II are visible. This may be a temperature effect, which could also explain the red photospheric colour. A nebular spectrum at + 150 d shows prominent CaII, OI, CI and possibly MgI lines which appear similar in strength to those displayed by core-collapse SNe. To add to the puzzle, SN 2012 hn is located at a projected distance of 6 kpc from an E/S 0 host and is not close to any obvious starforming region. Overall SN 2012 hn resembles a group of faint H-poor SNe that have been discovered recently and for which a convincing and consistent physical explanation is still missing. They all appear to explode preferentially in remote locations offset from a massive host galaxy with deep limits on any dwarf host galaxies, favouring old progenitor systems.

40|$|Using 2 D and 3 D simulation, {{we study}} the "robustness" of the <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> {{scenario}} for Type Ia supernovae, {{in which a}} detonation in the helium shell of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf induces a secondary detonation in the underlying core. We find that a helium detonation cannot easily descend into the core unless it commences (artificially) well above the hottest layer calculated for the helium shell in current presupernova models. Compressional waves induced by the sliding helium detonation, however, robustly generate hot spots which trigger a detonation in the core. Our simulations show that {{this is true even}} for non-axisymmetric initial conditions. If the helium is ignited at multiple points, the internal waves can pass through one another or be reflected, but this added complexity does not defeat the generation of the hot spot.

40|$|The {{progenitor}} channel {{responsible for}} the majority of Type Ia supernovae is still uncertain. One emergent scenario involves the detonation of a He-rich layer surrounding a C/O white dwarf, which sends a shock wave into the core. The quasi-spherical shock wave converges and strengthens at an off-center location, forming a second, C-burning, detonation that disrupts the whole star. In this paper, we examine this second detonation of the <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> scenario using a combination of analytic and numeric techniques. We perform a spatially resolved study of the imploding shock wave and outgoing detonation and calculate the critical imploding shock strengths needed to achieve a core C detonation. We find that He detonations in recent two-dimensional simula-tions yield converging shock waves that are strong enough to ignite C detonations in C/O cores, with the caveat that a truly robust answer requires multi-dimensional detonation initiation calculations. We also find that, due to the greatly increased difficulty of igniting O-burning, convergence-driven detonations in O/Ne cores are far harder to achieve and are perhaps unrealized in standard binary evolution.

40|$|An {{attractive}} {{scenario for}} producing Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is a <b>double</b> <b>detonation,</b> where detonation of an accreted helium layer triggers ignition of a C/O core. Whether or {{not such a}} mechanism can explain some or most SNe Ia depends on {{the properties of the}} helium burning, which in turn is set by the composition of the surface material. Using a combination of semi-analytic and simple numerical models, I explore when turbulent mixing due to hydrodynamic instabilities during the accretion process can mix C/O core material up into the accreted helium. Mixing is strongest at high accretion rates, large white dwarf (WD) masses, and slow spin rates. The mixing would result in subsequent helium burning that better matches the observed properties of SNe Ia. In some cases, there is considerable mixing that can lead to more than 50 % C/O in the accreted layer at the time of ignition. These results will hopefully motivate future theoretical studies of such strongly mixed conditions. Mixing also has implications for other types of WD surface explosions, including the so-called.

40|$|Detonations in helium-rich {{envelopes}} surrounding white dwarfs have garnered {{attention as}} triggers of faint thermonuclear ". Ia" supernovae and <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> Type Ia supernovae. However, {{recent studies have}} found that the minimum size of a hotspot that can lead to a helium detonation is comparable to, or even larger than, the white dwarf's pressure scale height, casting doubt on the successful ignition of helium detonations in these systems. In this paper, we examine the previously neglected effects of C/O pollution and a full nuclear reaction network, and we consider hotspots with spatially constant pressure in addition to constant density hotspots. We find that the inclusion of these effects significantly decreases the minimum hotspot size for helium-rich detonation ignition, making detonations far more plausible during turbulent shell convection or during double white dwarf mergers. The increase in burning rate also decreases the minimum shell mass in which a helium detonation can successfully propagate and alters the composition of the shell's burning products. The ashes of these low mass shells consist primarily of silicon, calcium, and unburned helium and metals and may explain the high-velocity spectral features observed in most Type Ia supernovae.

40|$|The {{merger of}} two white dwarfs (WDs) creates a {{differentially}} rotating remnant which is unstable to magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. These instabilities {{can lead to}} vis-cous evolution on a time-scale short compared to the thermal evolution of the rem-nant.

We initialize our calculations us-ing the output of eight WD merger simulations from Dan et al. (2011), which span a range of mass ratios and total masses. We generically find that the merger remnants evolve towards spherical states on time-scales of hours, even though a significant frac-tion of the mass is initially rotationally supported. The viscous evolution unbinds only a very small amount of mass (. 10 − 5 M). Viscous heating causes some of the systems we study with He WD secondaries to reach conditions of nearly dynamical burning.

40|$|Some {{explosion}} {{models for}} Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), {{such as the}} gravitationally confined detonation (GCD) or the <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> sub-Chandrasekhar (DDSC) models, rely on the spontaneous initiation of a detonation in the degenerate C/O material of a white dwarf. The length scales pertinent to the initiation of the detonation are notoriously unresolved in multi-dimensional stellar simulations, prompting the use of results of 1 D simulations at higher resolution, {{such as the ones}} performed for this work, as guidelines for deciding whether or not conditions reached in the higher dimensional full star simulations successfully would lead to the onset of a detonation. Spontaneous initiation relies on the existence of a suitable gradient in self-ignition (induction) times of the fuel, which we set up with a spatially localized non-uniformity of temperature [...] a hot spot. We determine the critical (smallest) sizes of such hot spots that still marginally result in a detonation in white dwarf matter by integrating the reactive Euler equations with the hydrodynamics code FLASH. We quantify the dependences of the critical sizes of such hot spots on composition, background temperature, peak temperature, geometry, and functional form of the temperature disturbance, many of which were hitherto largely unexplored in the literature.

40|$|The {{explosion}} of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs via the <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> scenario {{is a potential}} explanation for type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in the underlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. For a given core mass, a lower bound has been determined on {{the mass of the}} helium shell required for dynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for detonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses, we investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of triggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We carried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two dimensions assuming rotational symmetry. The detonations are propagated using the level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that has been calibrated with a large nuclear network. The same network is used to determine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. Based on approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find that secondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models, ranging in core mass from 0. 810 up to 1. 385 M_solar with corresponding shell masses from 0. 126 down to 0. 0035 M_solar.

40|$|Accreted helium layers {{on white}} dwarfs have been {{highlighted}} {{for many decades}} as a possible site for a det-onation triggered by a thermonuclear runaway. In this paper, we find the minimum helium layer thickness that will sustain a steady laterally propagating detonation and show that {{it depends on the}} density and composition of the helium layer, specifically 12 C and 16 O. Detonations in these thin helium layers have speeds slower than the Chapman-Jouget (CJ) speed from complete helium burning, vCJ = 1. 5 × 109 cm/s. Though gravitationally unbound, the ashes still have unburned helium (≈ 80 % in the thinnest cases) and only reach up to heavy el-ements such as 40 Ca, 44 Ti, 48 Cr, and 52 Fe. It is rare for these thin shells to generate large amounts of 56 Ni. We also find a new set of solutions that can propagate in even thinner helium layers when 16 O is present at a minimum mass fraction of ≈ 0. 07. Driven by energy release from α captures on 16 O and subsequent elements, these slow detonations only create ashes up to 28 Si in the outer detonated He shell.

40|$|Abridged. In the <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> {{scenario}} for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) a detonation initiates in {{a shell of}} He-rich material accreted from a companion star by a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass White Dwarf (WD). This shell detonation drives a shock front into the carbon-oxygen (C/O) WD that triggers a secondary detonation in the core. The core detonation results in a complete disruption of the WD. Earlier studies concluded that this scenario has difficulties in accounting for the observed properties of SNe Ia since the explosion ejecta are surrounded by the products of explosive He burning in the shell. Recently, it was proposed that detonations might be possible for much less massive He shells than previously assumed. Moreover, it was shown that even detonations of these minimum He shell masses robustly trigger detonations of the C/O core. Here we present time-dependent multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations for models with minimum He shell mass and derive synthetic observables for both the optical and γ-ray spectral regions. These differ strongly from those found in earlier simulations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions in which more massive He shells were considered. Our models predict light curves which cover both the range of brightnesses and the rise and decline times of observed SNe Ia. However, their colours and spectra do not match the observations. In particular, their B-V colours are generally too red. We show that this discrepancy is mainly due to {{the composition of the}} burning products of the He shell of our models which contain significant amounts of Ti and Cr. Using a toy model, we also show that the burning products of the He shell depend crucially on its initial composition. This leads us to conclude that good agreement between sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and observed SNe Ia may still be feasible but further study of the shell properties is required.

Reaching a peak magnitude of M_R = - 17. 3 and decaying by ~ 3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, SN 2005 ek is among the fastest Type I supernovae observed to date. The spectra of SN 2005 ek closely resemble those of normal SN Ic, but with an accelerated evolution. There is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine days post-maximum. Spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~ 0. 3 Msun that is dominated by oxygen (~ 80 %), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve is consistent with an explosion powered by ~ 0. 03 Msun of radioactive Ni- 56. Although previous rapidly evolving events (e. g., SN 1885 A, SN 1939 B, SN 2002 bj, SN 2010 X) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shell on a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with this proposed mechanism.

40|$|The {{detonation}} of a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass {{white dwarf}} (WD) {{has emerged as}} one of the most promising Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor scenarios. Recent studies have suggested that the rapid transfer of a very small amount of helium from one WD to another is sufficient to ignite a helium shell detonation that subsequently triggers a carbon core detonation, yielding a "dynamically-driven double degenerate double detonation" SN Ia. Because the helium shell that surrounds the core explosion is so minimal, this scenario approaches the limiting case of a bare C/O WD detonation. Motivated by discrepancies in previous literature and by a recent need for detailed nucleosynthetic data, we revisit simulations of naked C/O WD detonations in this paper. We disagree to some extent with the nucleosynthetic results of previous work on sub-Chandrasekhar-mass bare C/O WD detonations; e. g., we find that a median-brightness SN Ia is produced by the detonation of a 1. 0 Msol WD instead of a more massive and rarer 1. 1 Msol WD. The neutron-rich nucleosynthesis in our simulations agrees broadly with some observational constraints, although tensions remain with others. There are also discrepancies related to the velocities of the outer ejecta and light curve shapes, but overall our synthetic light curves and spectra are roughly consistent with observations. We are hopeful that future multi-dimensional simulations will resolve these issues and further bolster the dynamically-driven double degenerate <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> scenario's potential to explain most SNe Ia.

40|$|A {{currently}} favored {{model for}} Type Ia supernovae {{consists of a}} carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (0. 6 – 1. 0 M), surrounded by {{a thick layer of}} helium (0. 2 – 0. 3 M), which explodes as a consequence of successive detonations in the helium layer and the CO core. Previous studies, carried out in one and two dimensions, have shown that this model is capable of providing light curves and late-time spectra in agreement with observations, though the peak light spectrum may be problematic. These same studies also highlighted a key uncertainty in the model. When properly considered in three dimensions, will the helium detonation actually succeed in igniting a corresponding detonation in the carbon core? In this paper we follow the hydrodynamic evolution of a representative case calculated in three dimensions using the smoothed particle (SPH) approach to multi-dimensional hydrodynamical modeling. Several ﬁne zoned simulations are also carried out in one dimension to elucidate shock hydrodynamics that cannot be resolved in a calculation that carries the whole star. Consistent with the previous results by Benz (1997) and Livne & Arnett (1995), our calculations show that the initial stages of helium ignition strongly inﬂuence the development of the explosion. In particular, the altitude above the core boundary at which the ﬁrst hot spots appear will determine the character of detonation in the core. This altitude is sensitive to the carbon mass fraction in the CO core and to the pre-explosive mixing between the CO core and helium layer. We also ﬁnd, for a given helium layer and CO core mass, that the number and geometrical distribution of these hot spots inﬂuences the evolution of the explosion and the nucleosynthetic yield. A model in which the ignition begins at ﬁve distinct points produces more intermediate mass elements than another model in which the ignition commences at a single point. Nevertheless, given that a successful <b>double</b> <b>detonation</b> occurs, the energetics and gross features of the explosion are not very different from what is seen in one- or two-dimensional simulations.
