For example, C-H bonds adjacent to ketonic carbonyl groups can be replaced by C-D bonds, using acid or base catalysis. Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide, made from dimethyl sulfoxide and methyl iodide can be recrystallized from deuterium oxide, and then dissociated to regenerate methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, both deuterium labelled.

He has made adventurous use of new microanatomical methods, invented or improved by himself, in order to examine descending pathways in the brainstem, such as the <b>double</b> <b>labelling</b> of cortical neurones by fluorescent dyes with different excitation wavelengths and chemical affinities, transported by axoplasmic flow in a retrograde direction from separately injected termini.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and reliable method, PCR-PHFA (polymerase chain reaction dependent preferential homoduplex formation assay), for detection of single base substitutions within PCR amplicons. This technique is based upon strand competition during hybridization between a <b>double</b> <b>labeled</b> amplicon, prepared from biotin and DNP labeled primers, and an unlabeled amplicon. Under the precisely controlled temperature gradient, the preferential formation of a homoduplex over a heteroduplex occurs. After annealing, the identical sequence of the <b>double</b> <b>labeled</b> and unlabeled amplicon resulted in a low population of regenerated <b>double</b> <b>labeled</b> dsDNA due to strand exchange between them. Even when the two differed by only a single base substitution, <b>double</b> <b>labeled</b> molecule was regenerated efficiently because of preferential homoduplex formation.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of silver grain content in both single and <b>double</b> <b>label</b> autoradiographs is presented. The total grain area is calculated by counting the number of pixels at which the recorded light intensity in transmission dark field illumination exceeds a selected threshold. The calibration tests included autoradiographs with low (3 H- thymidin) and high (3 H-desoxyuridin) silver grain density. The results are proportional to the customary visual grain count. For the range of visibly countable grain densities in single labeled specimens, the correlation coefficient between the computed values and the visual grain counts is better than 0. 96. In the first emulsion of the two emulsion layer autoradiographs of <b>double</b> <b>labeled</b> specimens (3 H- 14 C- thymidin) the correlation coefficient is 0. 919 and 0. 906. The method provides a statistical correction for the background grains not due to the isotope. The possibility to record 14 C tracks by shifting the focus through the second emulsion of the <b>double</b> <b>labeled</b> specimens is also demonstrated. The reported technique is essentially independent of size, shape and density of the grains. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{originally}} {{set up to}} measure accurate cell kinetic parameters in two murine squamous cell carcinomas (scc) for comparison with radiobiological data on proliferation during radiotherapy. The tumours, AT 84 and AT 478, were both moderately well differentiated aneuploid scc. In {{the course of the}} study, several comparisons of techniques were made in two different centres. This paper reports on the results of those comparisons involving two different detection methods (flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry), single vs <b>double</b> <b>labelling,</b> and in vivo and in vitro labelling, the latter using tissue slices incubated under high pressure oxygen. Pulse labelling studies with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) showed that the labelling indices (LI) were not significantly different after in vitro or in vivo labelling. In addition, the flow cytometry (FCM) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods also gave labelling indices which were not significantly different. Only tumour cells were analysed in these studies by selecting cells on the basis of aneuploidy (FCM) or morphology (IHC). The DNA synthesis time of the tumour cells were analysed by both techniques. For FCM, the Relative Movement method was used (Begg et al., 1985). For IHC, a <b>double</b> <b>labelling</b> method was used, employing BrdUrd and triated thymidine (3 H-TdR) administered several hours apart, detected simultaneously using immunoperoxidase and autoradiography, respectively. When both labels were administered in vivo, there was good agreement for Ts between the FCM and IHC methods. Attempts were also made to measure Ts in vitro using both techniques. With <b>double</b> <b>labelling,</b> it was found that cells did not take up the second label, implying a failure of cycle progression. This was confirmed by FCM results, showing no movement of labelled cells through the S-phase, despite an initially high uptake. This could not be influenced by lowering the DNA precursor concentration or by adding foetal calf serum. This indicates that DNA synthesis times are difficult or impossible to measure in vitro in fresh tumour explants. Finally, the <b>double</b> <b>labelling</b> IHC method allowed intratumoural variations of both LI and Ts to be studied. Both parameters were found to vary markedly throughout the tumour volume, particularly for larger tumours (600 mg), giving calculated local potential doubling time values (Tpot) ranging from 1 - 7 days...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Bone remodelling {{is carried}} out by ‘bone {{multicellular}} units ’ (BMUs) in which active osteoclasts and active osteoblasts are spatially and temporally coupled. Bone gain or bone loss from remodelling {{is directly related to}} the bone balance of individual BMUs. Whilst tetracycline <b>double</b> <b>labelling</b> experiments can reveal part of the dynamics of the refilling process taking place in the ‘closing cone ’ of a BMU, less is known about how bone refilling is regulated in a BMU. Here, we extend our previous mathematical model of cell development within a single BMU to investigate the dynamics of refilling in the BMU and help elucidate the contributions to the refilling rate of osteoblast number and osteoblast secretory activity at various positions along the BMU’s length. The mathematical model is based on biochemical coupling between osteoclasts and osteoblasts of various maturity, and includes the differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes and bone lining cells, as well as the influence of BMU cavity shrinkage on osteoblast development and activity. The model is calibrated against experimental data on cell densities and cell numbers in a BMU, and compared with other sources of experimental data for validation, such as tetracycline <b>double</b> <b>labelling</b> data. Our model shows that tetracycline <b>double</b> <b>labelling</b> does not reveal the start and the end of the refilling process in a BMU. This suggests that at a particular bone site undergoing remodelling, bone formation starts and ends rapidly, supporting the hypothesis that osteoblasts behave synchronously. Our model also suggests that part of the observed cross-sectional variability in tetracycline data may be due to different bone sites being remodelled by BMUs at differen...|$|E

Endometrial stromal granulocytes were identified by their labelling with NKH 1, Dako T 11, UCHL 1 or Dako-LC. The percentage of cases in which endometrial stromal granulocytes showed mitosis was 25 %, 75 %, 86 %, and 93 %, respectively in proliferative, early secretory, mid secretory, and late secretory phases, and 14 % in early decidua.

Transiliac bone biopsy specimens were taken after <b>double</b> <b>labelling</b> with tetracycline, and metabolic calcium balance was studied almost simultaneously. Many of the patients showed poor <b>double</b> <b>labelling</b> of their otherwise unremarkable trabecular osteoid, suggesting impaired formation of bone at many of these surfaces. This phenomenon was not accompanied by increased width of osteoid seams (as seen in osteomalacia), indicating that formation of the matrix and its mineralisation were in equilibrium. For the first time, highly significant positive correlations (p less than 0. 01) were found between indices of bone formation, determined by labelling with tetracycline, and calcium balance. Thus some patients with osteoporosis who are rapidly losing bone have low rates of formation of trabecular bone both by individual osteoblasts and in relation to available bone surfaces. As histological indices of bone resorption also independently correlated strongly and inversely (p less than 0. 01) with calcium balance the rate of initiation of new basic multicellular units by osteoclastic resorption of trabecular surfaces (or the depth of resorption at these surfaces) {{also appears to be}} an important determinant of mineral balance.
