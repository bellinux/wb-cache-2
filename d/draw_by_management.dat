50|$|Three {{points are}} awarded for a win, and one {{point for a}} draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Points can be deducted for {{breaches}} of rules e.g. fielding an ineligible player. The teams are first and foremost ranked by number of points. The team with the most points {{at the end of}} the season wins the championship. If two or more teams finish level on points, four tiebreakers are used to separate them: highest overall goal difference, most goals scored, most points gained in the head-to-head meetings, and finally, highest goal difference in the head-to-head meetings. In the highly unlikely event that teams are still tied in a key position after these tiebreakers e.g. determining the league champions, European qualification, or relegation, lots will be <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> the <b>Management</b> Committee. A tiebreaker other than goal difference has not been required since the 1961-62 season, but this was prior to the introduction of goal difference as a tiebreaker.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} from a study of ‘Transform’, a Bank’s strategic change program. The study {{was carried out by}} developing and applying a discursive model of strategic change to Transform. Findings are presented about how Transform was constructed from ‘grand discourses’ of business and science that were <b>drawn</b> on <b>by</b> senior <b>management,</b> and how a ‘local discourse’ of the self was formed at the intersection of these grand discourses. This paper is concerned with how senior management has attempted to govern employee identity and practices through the construction of Transform. In this respect Transform can be understood as a discourse which was designed to regulate identity and influence employee practices by constructing and disseminating a particular reality for the Bank and its employees. <br /...|$|R
30|$|In {{line with}} the DevOps {{principles}} of rapid and continuous deployment, we require that CAMEL application models be automatically deployable. We achieve this <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> Chef <b>management</b> procedures for each software component of the CAMEL application model from Chef Supermarket and orchestrating them to achieve full application deployment. The use of Chef Supermarket adds important new value: through analysis of information mined from Chef Supermarket on components and their interrelationships, we can aid DevOps engineers in understanding and adapting the structure of their applications and in answering questions such as “which relational databases are alternatives and can replace MySQL?” or “what other components MySQL depends on?”.|$|R
