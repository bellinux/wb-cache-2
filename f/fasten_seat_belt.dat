This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger.

50|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found a potential issue {{that could have}} prevented the death and many injuries. Nobody could remember hearing the typical <b>fasten</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> chime when the <b>fasten</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> light came on about two minutes before the turbulence event and no announcements of the <b>fasten</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> light being on were made in either English or Japanese.|$|E
50|$|About an {{hour later}} after calm conditions, the <b>fasten</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> sign came on again without any announcement. After about two minutes of not very strong turbulence, {{suddenly}} the 747 dropped slightly then shot back up and then back down at such a velocity that a purser, who was hanging on to a fixed countertop, found himself hanging upside down holding the countertop with his feet in the air. The airplane then pitched up and steeply climbed before heavily falling again, this occurring when the right wing dropped sharply. After another moderate climb, the flight returned to normal.|$|E

5000|$|The Dolomite 1300 {{used the}} [...] engine {{developed}} from the Herald and Spitfire, and replaced the Toledo as the basic model in the range. [...] The body was identical except for the lengthened body giving the larger boot of the original Dolomites. The 1300 retained simplified fittings, including single square headlamps, basic instrumentation and seats, with the wooden dashboard and carpeting of the Toledo. There was no two-door option as there had been for the Toledo, and the shorter-boot bodyshell of the Toledo ceased production. Standard equipment included a reclining front seats, cigar lighter, <b>fasten</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> warning light, driver's door mirror, twin reversing lights and a dipping rear view mirror. The dashboard design {{was the same as}} that fitted to the facelifted Toledo of 1975. There was no overdrive or automatic transmission option with the 1300.|$|E
50|$|In March 1975 the two-door {{version was}} dropped: the four-door model {{continued}} in production for another year, but in improved specification form. The existing Triumph Herald three-rail type gearbox {{was replaced with}} a Triumph Spitfire 1500 type single-rail gearbox and the car was fitted with a new clutch. The new look Toledo was also fitted with side body trims, new look black type front grille (replacing the silver type front grille) and a stainless trim {{was added to the}} side roof guttering. The specification again improved; standard equipment now included a rear-view dipping mirror, <b>fasten</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> warning light, reclining front seats (previously an option), twin reversing lights (also previously an option), cigar lighter, hazard warning lights and a driver's exterior door mirror. A laminated windscreen, front head rests and brushed nylon seat facings were optional extras. The Toledo was finally replaced by the Dolomite 1300 and 1500 in March 1976. Total production was 119,182 cars, making it one of Triumph's best-selling small saloon cars.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{cars have}} at least one [...] "dome light" [...] (or [...] "courtesy light") located in or near the ceiling of the {{passenger}} compartment, to provide illumination by which to fasten seatbelts and enter or exit the car. These often have an option to switch on when the front (or any) passenger doors are opened. Many vehicles have expanded this feature, causing the overhead interior light to remain on after all doors are closed, allowing passengers to <b>fasten</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> with added illumination. The extended lighting cycle usually ends when the vehicle's ignition has begun, or a gradual reduction in light emitted after a couple of minutes if the car isn't started, called [...] "theater" [...] lighting. Interior lighting has been added on some vehicles at the bottom edge of the dashboard, which illuminates the floor for front passengers, or underneath the front seats at the rear, to illuminate the floor for rear seat passengers. This type of convenience lighting approach is also sometimes used to illuminate interior or exterior door handles, exterior step running boards, or electric window switches.|$|R

2500|$|Similar {{in style}} and content to the 1940s serials, Batman and Robin would arrive {{at the bottom of}} the Batpoles in the Batcave in full costume (reference is made later in the series to some sort of costuming device that {{functions}} on the way down the poles). They then jump into the Batmobile. Robin checks the gauges and reports, [...] "Atomic batteries to power...turbines to speed." [...] Batman responds, [...] "Roger, ready to move out." [...] With that, the two would drive out of the cave at high speed. As the Batmobile approached the mouth of the cave (actually a tunnel entrance in Los Angeles's Bronson Canyon), a camouflaged door would swing open and a hinged road barrier outside the Batcave would drop down to allow the car to exit onto the road. The duo then speeds to police headquarters to meet with Gordon and be briefed on the criminal they must thwart. Most of the footage following the opening title sequence from Batman and Robin sliding down the Batpoles through their arrival at police headquarters was reused in each episode. After the National Safety Council complained that Batman and Robin should set a good example, the repeated sequence was changed to show them <b>fastening</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> before starting out.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{considerable}} {{social and economic}} burden traffic accidents imposed on societies, strategies to reduce crash severity and potential for crash (frequency) are of interest to transportation agencies. As injury-severity data are generally represented by discrete categories such as injury and property damage only, a variety of discrete choice methodological techniques {{can be applied to}} analyze crash-severity data. This paper presents a binary model for predicting severity of Tehran urban car-car collisions which can be used in safety planning and enforcements. Human impact and collision type variables are employed to act as surrogates for point of impact. Results indicate that <b>fastening</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> decreases the probability of accidents resulting in injury. Furthermore, disregarding regulations, as a human reason of an accident, results in the most severe consequence (injury/fatality) compared to other human reasons. On the other extreme, as a consequence of accidents occurring due to non-human reasons, property damage only is the most probable outcome. Finally, drivers involved in front to front collision types are most prone to injury. Other factors in decreasing order are: front to rear, front to side, other types of collision, rear to side, and side to side.
