40|$|In October 2003 a {{campaign}} {{on board the}} Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis had the objective to validate standard Aqua Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) sea-ice products. Additionally, the satellite laser altimeter on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) was in operation. To capture the large-scale information on the sea-ice conditions necessary for satellite validation, the measurement strategy was to obtain large-scale sea-ice statistics using extensive sea-ice measurements in a Lagrangian approach. A drifting buoy array, spanning initially 50 km 100 km, was surveyed during the campaign. In situ measurements consisted of 12 transects, 50 500 m, with detailed snow and ice measurements as well as random snow depth sampling of floes within the buoy array using helicopters. In order {{to increase the amount}} of coincident in situ and satellite data an approach has been developed to extrapolate measurements in time and in space. Assuming no change in snow depth and freeboard occurred during the period of the campaign on the floes surveyed, we use buoy ice-drift information as well as daily estimates of thin-ice fraction and rough-ice vs smooth-ice fractions from AMSR-E and QuikSCAT, respectively, to estimate kilometer-scale snow <b>depth</b> and <b>freeboard</b> <b>for</b> other days. The results show that ICESat freeboard estimates have a mean difference of 1. 8 cm when compared with the in situ data and a correlation coefficient of 0. 6. Furthermore, incorporating ICESat roughness information into the AMSR-E snow depth algorithm significantly improves snow depth retrievals. Snow depth retrievals using a combination of AMSR-E and ICESat data agree with in situ data with a mean difference of 2. 3 cm and a correlation coefficient of 0. 84 with a negligible bias...|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{study was}} carried out for the lowest-level elevation method to retrieve total (sea ice+snow) freeboard from Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) elevation measurements in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Varying the percentage (P) of elevations used to approximate the instantaneous sea-surface height can cause widespread changes of a few to > 10 cm in the total freeboard obtained. Other input parameters have a smaller influence on the overall mean total freeboard but can cause large regional differences. These results, together with published ICESat elevation precision and accuracy, suggest that three times the mean per gridcell single-laser-shot error budget {{can be used as}} an estimate <b>for</b> <b>freeboard</b> uncertainty. Theoretical relative ice thickness uncertainty ranges between 20 % and 80 % <b>for</b> typical <b>freeboard</b> and snow properties. Ice thickness is computed from total freeboard using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) snow depth data. Average ice thickness for the Weddell Sea is 1. 73 0. 38 m for ICESat measurements from 2004 to 2006, in agreement with previous work. The mean uncertainty is 0. 72 0. 09 m. Our comparison with data of an alternative approach, which assumes that sea-ice freeboard is zero and that total freeboard equals snow depth, reveals an average sea-ice thickness difference of 0. 77 m...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the video content, {{the impact of the}} subtitle’s depth on 3 D visual quality should be also concerned. Though some commercial software [33] provides the capability of manually adding external subtitles to video and assigning <b>depths</b> <b>for</b> them simultaneously, it is however our focuses to automatically detect subtitles embedded in frames and assign the <b>depths</b> <b>for</b> them (to the best of the authors’ knowledge, few works discussed this issue). Flickering or depth fluctuation of the subtitles will certainly lower down the perceived visual quality and make viewers uncomfortable, which motivates us to assign a constant <b>depth</b> <b>for</b> the detected subtitles along the whole sequence. However, we still face a problem of maintaining a constant <b>depth</b> <b>for</b> the whole subtitle area or for individual characters in subtitles. Since the later alternative necessitates precise and stable character segmentation for the same subtitle that endures several frames, the former one is selected in our system in considering stable quality.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{analysis}} by synthesis computational framework for stereo vision. It is designed to achieve the following goals: (1) enforcing global visibility constraints, (2) obtaining reliable <b>depth</b> <b>for</b> <b>depth</b> boundaries and thin structures, (3) obtaining correct <b>depth</b> <b>for</b> textureless regions, and (4) hypothesizing correct <b>depth</b> <b>for</b> unmatched regions. The framework employs depth and visibility based rendering within a global matching criterion to compute depth in contrast with approaches that rely on local matching measures and relaxation. A color segmentation based depth representation guarantees smoothness in textureless regions. Hypothesizing depth from neighboring segments enables propagation of correct depth and produces reasonable <b>depth</b> values <b>for</b> unmatched region. A practical algorithm that integrates all these aspects is presented in this paper. Comparative experimental results are shown for real images.
