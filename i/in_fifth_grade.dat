5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school <b>in</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>grade</b> and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan.

30|$|Differences {{between the}} third (total group) and <b>fifth</b> <b>grade</b> (total group) of this {{research}} were found for the dyslexic children. Probably, the DST has a better screening effect <b>in</b> the <b>fifth</b> <b>grade,</b> because there are more significant dyslexia indications with a larger effect found <b>in</b> the <b>fifth</b> <b>grade.</b> Screening of dyslexia seems easier <b>in</b> the <b>fifth</b> <b>grade,</b> differences are clearer, maybe because differences in phonemic awareness, verbal memory and rapid naming are clearer. Dyslexic children show a slower development than their non-dyslexic peers. Further research can show the effect of screening for dyslexia with the DST in a higher grade, for example the seventh or eighth grade.|$|R

However, her father thought it would help if she had ball handling skills and a perimeter shooting ability. Stewart started a routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones. She completed enough loops to cover a mile. She continued the routine almost every day, improving her ball handling to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or between her legs. Even after heading off to college, she still did the routine at home.|$|E

Ko is described by several other characters, including Ichiyo, Yuhei Azuma, and Junpei Azuma, as very like Aoba.

After a sandlot game against Aoba's team in elementary school, Ko is inspired by her pitching form to become a pitcher himself, and at Wakaba's urging secretly adopts Aoba's daily training regimen. Although he does not play baseball in junior high school, Akaishi and Nakanishi convince him to join the high school baseball team.

Ko describes himself as having no self-confidence and an excellent liar. Despite being at odds with one another, Ko and Aoba share a deep bond through their love for Wakaba. Ko takes to heart what Aoba has to say and values her opinion more than others.|$|E
