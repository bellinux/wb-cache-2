40|$|This {{research}} {{is about a}} study on factors that influence people to involve <b>in</b> <b>drug</b> mule: A case study In IPK Melaka. The researchers used judgment sampling techniques of 47 respondents of police officers at Ibu Pejabat Polis Kontinjen Melaka were answered questionnaire given. The objective of this {{research is}} to determine the relationship between factors and people involvement <b>in</b> <b>drug</b> mule. There are three factors that influence people to involve <b>in</b> <b>drug</b> mule which are money, family’s influence, and peer’s influence. These factors as independent variable while people involvement <b>in</b> <b>drug</b> mule as dependent variable on this study. The all factors have association significant relationship with people involvement <b>in</b> <b>drug</b> mule. This is due to result of chi-square that has been used. The most factors that influence people to involve <b>in</b> <b>drug</b> mule are peer’s influence followed by money and family’s influence. In conclusion, peer’s influence, money, and family’s influence can influence people to involve <b>in</b> <b>drug</b> mule...|$|R

5|$|Scripps began {{trafficking}} <b>in</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{and carried}} heroin between Asia and Europe for a syndicate. Singapore authorities first encountered {{his name in}} 1987, {{when he was arrested}} at Heathrow Airport for possessing drugs. Police found a key on him that belonged to a safe deposit box in a bank in Orchard Road in Singapore, from which officers from Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau seized 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb) of heroin worth about US$1 million. For this and another drug offence, Southwark Crown Court in January 1988 sentenced him to seven years in jail. He escaped while on home leave but was later re-arrested. In July 1992, Winchester Crown Court added another six years to the original sentence, which would have kept him behind bars until 2001 had he not escaped again.|$|E
5|$|Dot is {{introduced}} to EastEnders soon after its launch as the gossiping, chain smoking, Christian friend of Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Lou Beale (Anna Wing) {{who works with}} Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) at the Walford launderette. She has a difficult life with a criminal husband, Charlie, and their son Nick, who appeared in the first episode. Charlie comes and goes, always treating Dot badly and stealing from her, until he dies in a lorry accident. Nick is also a criminal; he is involved <b>in</b> <b>drugs,</b> robberies and murder, and tries to cheat Dot out of her money. He attempts to poison her to inherit her bingo winnings, but is unsuccessful. Despite Nick's deeds, Dot believes he can be redeemed. Dot also associates herself as Walford's Good Samaritan, often taking in residents when they are homeless. Amongst these include Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) and Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), who becomes addicted to drugs. Dot believes that she can help Donna change for the better, but comes home one day to find Donna dead in her lounge. It is concluded that she died after choking on her own vomit, and Dot is devastated.|$|E
5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking <b>in</b> <b>drugs</b> is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E

5|$|While Noriega {{was out of}} the country, Díaz Herrera {{considered}} {{using the}} uproar around Spadafora to seize power, but despite mobilizing some troops, eventually decided against following through with the coup, realizing he could not count on sufficient support. Furthermore, Noriega had made a deal with his deputy, to the effect that he would step down as military leader in 1987 and allow Díaz Herrera to succeed him. In 1987, however, Noriega went back on this agreement, announced he would be heading the military for the next five years, and assigned Herrera to a diplomatic post. Díaz Herrera retaliated by making public statements accusing Noriega of rigging the 1984 election, murdering Spadafora, and of trafficking <b>in</b> <b>drugs,</b> as well as of assassinating Torrijo with a bomb on his plane. These statements provoked huge protests against Noriega, with 100,000 people, approximately 25% of the population of Panama City, marching in protest on June 26, 1987. Noriega charged Herrera with treason, and cracked down hard on the protesters. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution asking Noriega to step down until Herrera could be tried; in response Noriega sent government workers to protest outside the U.S. embassy, a protest which quickly turned into a riot. As a result, the U.S. suspended all military assistance to Panama, and the CIA stopped paying Noriega a salary. The Senate resolution had the effect of identifying the U.S. with the effort to remove Noriega; Noriega exploited the rising anti-American sentiment to strengthen his own position. Without the support of the U.S., Panama defaulted on its international debt, and that year the country's economy shrunk by 20%. However, though the U.S. considered not recognizing the new president, the state department decided not to do so, as that would amount to breaking relations with Noriega.|$|E

25|$|Modern prisoners {{occupy the}} lowest rungs {{on the social}} class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a {{collection}} of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} differences between the two countries is the much higher cost of drugs in the United States. In the U.S., $728 per capita is spent each year on drugs, while in Canada it is $509. At the same time, consumption is higher in Canada, with about 12 prescriptions being filled per person each year in Canada and 10.6 in the United States. The main difference is that patented drug prices in Canada average between 35% and 45% lower than in the United States, though generic prices are higher. The price differential for brand-name drugs between the two countries has led Americans to purchase upward of $1 billion US <b>in</b> <b>drugs</b> per year from Canadian pharmacies.|$|E

Yabrán was found dead in 1998, a supposed suicide – although some observers questioned whether he had in fact killed himself, and some raised doubts as to whether the body was even his.

25|$|Plaa's primary area of {{research}} was hepatotoxicity, in which his successes where achieved primarily by the investigation of mechanistic toxicology. His primary contributions were {{in the areas of}} cholestasis and toxic potentiation, in particular potentiation by haloalkanes. Although the use of the isolated perfused liver was already well-known, having been first used in the early 19th century, Plaa was the first to use it for the study of hepatotoxicity. A long-time career goal for him was to elaborate methods to determine human hepatotoxicity (and particularly cholestasis-inducing abilities <b>in</b> <b>drugs)</b> from animal tests; although this endeavour was never a success, it led to a much improved understanding of the mechanisms of cholestasis. According to Plaa, much of his mechanisms- and protocols-oriented research was an effect of his original formation in criminalistics.|$|E
