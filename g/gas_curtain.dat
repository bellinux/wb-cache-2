The air flow and temperature field heterogenity's properties of flow field in refrigerated transport carriage's physical {{model and the}} distributions of flow field and temeprature field in cross sections and longitudinal sections were analyzed. The wind direction of top right adiabatic <b>gas</b> <b>curtain</b> was set perpendicular to isothermal curves to control the <b>gas</b> <b>curtain</b> fan with constant speed intermittently based on coordination principle. The test data of refrigerated transport carriage showed the highest temperature in cross sections dropped from 3. 8 °C to 1. 67 °C, the biggest standard deviation amplitude of temperature values was 0. 387 in three cross sections with length direction.

40|$|The {{control and}} {{minimization}} of non-metallic inclusions {{content in the}} tundish and in the mold of a continuous casting unit is crucial for ensuring the final quality of the steel cast product. Nonmetallic inclusions of sizes smaller than 15 µm are hard to remove, as they are difficult to float. They are easily carried by the flow of steel melt into the mold and adversely affect the steel cleanliness. It is suggested that a <b>gas</b> <b>curtain</b> made of small bubbles of argon {{can be used to}} capture and remove these inclusions in the tundish, thus avoiding their transport into the mold. A 1 : 3 scale physical model of tundish of the continuous casting unit of ArcelorMittal plant, in Vitória, Brazil, was built to investigate the effects of gas flow, shape and positioning of the <b>gas</b> <b>curtain</b> inside the tundish, on the efficiency of removal of inclusions. The results suggest that the gas bubbling inside the tundish can be effective in inclusion removal. The efficiency is dependent upon the location of argon bubbling.

H/D exchange {{was carried out}} by introducing deuterating agent (e. g., d-MeOH) into the <b>curtain</b> <b>gas</b> ﬂow of a commercial triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. In contrast to the widely used H/D exchange techniques, the ions are not trapped in this case. The main advantages of this technique are the ease of use and applicability on most commercial mass spectrometers, including quadrupole-type instruments. Effect of various instrumental parameters was investigated in detail, including spray voltage, spray position, partial pressure of the deuterating agent in the <b>curtain</b> <b>gas,</b> gas ﬂow rates, the oriﬁce-to-skimmer potential and the source temperature. Among these only the partial pressure of the deuterating agent in <b>curtain</b> <b>gas,</b> oriﬁce-to-skimmer potential and source temperature inﬂuenced the efﬁciency of H/D exchange. These suggest that the H/D exchange is likely to occur in the fore-vacuum region of the atmospheric interface.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years we have {{presented}} a less than glowing experimental comparison of hydrodynamic codes with the <b>gas</b> <b>curtain</b> experiment. Here, we discuss {{the manner in which the}} various details of the hydrodynamic integration techniques conspire to produce poor results. This also includes some progress in improving the results and agreement with experimental results. Our results are based upon the <b>gas</b> <b>curtain,</b> Richtmyer-Meshkov experiments conducted by Rightley et al. (Rightley et al. 1999) at Los Alamos. We also examine the results of a gas cylinder experiment conducted more recently by Prestridge and Zoldi which includes velocity data obtained via a PIV technique. Traditionally, the integral width of the mixing layer is used as a yardstick to measure the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. This is also used when investigating the performance of numerical methods. Our focus has been on the details of the mixing below the integral scale. Because the flow is hydrodynamically unstable, we employ statistical measures in our comparisons. This is built upon a parallel effort by the experimentalists investigating the statistical nature of the mixing induced by shock waves. The principle tools we use to measure the spectral structure of the images of these flows are the fractal dimension and the continuous wavelet spectrum. The bottom line is that all the higher order methods used to simulate the <b>gas</b> <b>curtain</b> compare poorly with the experimental data when quantified with these spatial statistics. Moreover, the comparisons degrade under mesh refinement. This occurs despite the fact that the integral scale comparison is acceptable and consistent with the expectations from this class of methods. The most surprising result is that a first-order Godunov method does produce a good comparison relative to the assumed to be higher-order methods. We have examined a broad variety of methodologies associated with the high-order methods to illuminate this problematic result. In the next section we briefly describe the experiments. In Section the quantitative measures applied to the images are detailed; the results of these analyses are discussed in Section refsec:compare. The consideration of the relation between turbulence models and numerical methods was inspired by these results and is discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{methods for}} gas phase hydrogen/deuterium {{exchange}} {{have been developed}} for the analysis of small molecules. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange has been implemented by making simple modifications to the plumbing for the nebulizer and <b>curtain</b> <b>gases</b> on a nebulization-assisted electrospray ion source. The nebulizer gas exchange method has demonstrated deuterium exchange levels of 84 – 97 % for a variety of molecules representing a wide range of structural classes containing up to 51 potentially exchangeable hydrogens; this allowed determination of the number of exchangeable hydrogens for all of the molecules studied containing ≤ 25 labile hydrogens (Mr ≤ 3000). ND 3 gas consumption is minimized in the nebulizer method by toggling the nebulizer from air to ND 3 for only a few scans of the total sample elution period. The <b>curtain</b> <b>gas</b> exchange method is more variable, yielding exchange levels of 32 – 98 % for the same set of molecules; this was still sufficient to allow determination of > 70 % of the molecules studied containing ≤ 25 labile hydrogens.

40|$|Volatile {{reagents}} can be entrained in desolvation gas {{to manipulate}} electrospray generated droplets. These reagent vapors are admitted into the atmospheric interface region of a QqTOF tandem mass spectrometer. The electrospray droplets {{interact with the}} reagent vapors between the curtain and orifice plate for approximately a millisecond, which is the time required for analyte desolvation. A variety of vapors, particularly polar aprotic vapors, {{can be used to}} reduce alkali metal adduction on proteins. This effect is due to the alkali metals interacting with the vapor to form alkali metal adducted reagent vapor cluster ions that are ionized via the ion evaporation model, which reduces the amount of alkali metal in the electrospray droplet available to adduct to proteins that are ionized via the charge residue model. Polar vapors can be used to stabilize noncovalent protein complexes via evaporative cooling of the analyte of interest and lengthening the electrospray ionization desolvation process. These vapors interact with peptide containing ESI droplets to form peptide ions that are adducted to the respective vapor that was doped into the <b>curtain</b> <b>gas.</b> Additionally, these vapors interact with ESI droplets to form unique doubly charged cluster ions of the form [nX+H+Y] 2 + where X is a reagent vapor molecule, n = 5 - 6 and Y is a sodium or potassium ion. ^ Acidic and basic vapors can also be introduced into the desolvation gas to alter the ESI response of analytes derived from a mixture in the positive and negative polarities. In general, in the positive polarity, the ESI response of acidic bioanalytes in a mixture is enhanced by introducing acidic vapor into the <b>curtain</b> <b>gas.</b> In the negative polarity, the ESI response of basic analytes in a mixture is enhanced by doping basic vapor into the <b>curtain</b> <b>gas.</b> The ESI response is most universal when acidic vapor is entrained in the <b>curtain</b> <b>gas</b> in the positive polarity and when basic vapor is entrained in the <b>curtain</b> <b>gas</b> in the negative polarity. Acidic and basic vapors shift the ESI selectivity via changing the droplet pH during the ESI process. The main variables in the ability of acidic or basic vapors to enhance ESI response for analytes depends on the ionization polarity, the analyte isoelectric point, and the reagent vapor pKa and vapor pressure. For protein mixtures, the propensity of proteins to ionize via the chain ejection model versus the charge residue model may also influence the ESI response observed upon exposing the electrospray droplets to acidic or basic vapors. ...|$|R

30|$|By {{referring}} to LOQ values shown in Table 2, two observations were made: the LOQ values for (C) and (G) were both pinned; the LOQ values {{were significantly higher}} than the detection limit of the QTrap 5500 MS instrument, reported previously (Lim et al. [2011 a]). Indeed, owing to the direct flow injection strategy applied in the entirety of the method validation, we observed severe precipitation (technical difficulties) occurring on the cone surface. This enhanced precipitation contributed to severe random arcing at the source tip, thereby rendering data (integrity) obtained at lower concentration levels to be compromised. For this reason, the ANN models constructed using these compromised data only achieve r 2 values of 0.7 or poorer at high RMSE values (> 50 %). To achieve a fine balance between the integrity of the LIT (protect from contamination due to direct flow injection) and reasonable method sensitivity, the <b>curtain</b> <b>gas</b> value used to perform MS analyses was therefore increased from 25 to 30. This increase in <b>curtain</b> <b>gas</b> value (from 25 to 30) gave rise to a resultant 10 times reduction in method sensitivity, which explained the LOQ values pinning phenomena observed for both (C) and (G). Therefore, the LOQ values reported in Table 2 should be interpreted as a conservative representation of the method true capability.|$|R

A plasma outlet plate (3) with openings (3 ') moves in a different, second direction. Its arrangement and motion ensures that plasma is directed towards the substrate surface via the openings. The outlet plate lies between source and carrier and/or {{is part of the}} plasma source, being especially a moveable wall section of the plasma source. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The feed- or first movement, is in translation and/or has components in the direction of advance. Movement in the second direction includes translation and rotary components. Movements at right angles to the feed direction are included. Rectangular movements and/or translation movements back and forth are executed by the plate. There are many outlet openings. The maximum amplitude or stroke of movement in the second direction exceeds the mean spacing between adjacent openings. The mean velocity of motion in the second direction exceeds that in the first direction by preferably up to 1000 %. The outlet is a plane plate and/or numbers of outlet openings are formed in it. These are round- or elliptical nozzles. The outlet plate is held in a sliding or rolling-element bearing which is fixed in position, forming part of the source or its wall. The reaction chamber (4) into which the plasma enters, is designed for the substrate carrier to move through it in the first direction. It is screened from the surroundings (U) by a <b>gas</b> <b>curtain</b> between the wall and the outlet plate, or by gas locks. The plasma source is an arc source or a microwave plasma source.

MS source conditions were set as follows: ion spray voltage, 5500  V; turbo spray temperature, 500  °C; high purity nitrogen was used in all units; nebulizer <b>gas,</b> 25  psi; <b>curtain</b> <b>gas,</b> 20  psi. In this study, the level of ginsenosides observed in positive ion mode was higher than that in negative ion mode, so the positive ion mode was selected. Samples were quantified from positive multiple reactions, monitoring the m/z for Rg 1, Re, Rd, Rb 1, Rb 2, Rf, Rh 1, Rh 2, Rg 3, and Rc that gave 824.0, 970.0, 964.1, 1131.1, 1101.8, 801.7, 639.2, 623.2, 786.1, and 1101.2, respectively. During infusion {{of each of the}} standards, the collision energy was varied from 12 to 83  V to find the optimal collision energy. The most abundant fragment ions for each ginsenoside were chosen for the multiple reaction monitoring. The optimal conditions for the {{mass spectrometry}}, for fragment ions and the main fragment ions of each ginsenoside gave 824.0  →  643.9 for Rg 1, 970.0  →  789.9 for Re, 964.1  →  767.2 for Rd, 1131.1  →  789.2 for Rb 1, 1101.8  →  335.0 for Rb 2, 801.7  →  424.2 for Rf, 639.2  →  621.1 for Rh 1, 623.2  →  605.2 for Rh 2, 786.1  →  325.0 for Rg 3, and 1101.2  →  334.4 for Rc. The declustering potential and collision energy were 70 / 61 for Rg 1, 125 / 67 for Re, 111 / 17 for Rd, 120 / 83 for Rb 1, 90 / 81 for Rb 2, 40 / 26 for Rf, 50 / 12 for Rh 1, 160 / 13 for Rh 2, 60 / 15 for Rg 3 and 149 / 76 for Rc. Data were collected using Analyst 1.4. 2 software (AB SCIEX, Canada).|$|R

A mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 5  mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH  3.6) in the ratio of 90 : 10, v/v, was delivered at a flow rate of 0.7  mL/min. The total analysis run time for each sample was 4.5  min. The ionization and detection were carried out on a triple quadruple mass spectrometer, MDS Sciex API- 4000 (Sciex Division of MDS, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), equipped with electrospray ionization operated in positive polarity using multiple reaction monitoring (+MRM). The compound and source parameters were optimized by infusing individual solution of LS, IS, and LHA into the mass spectrometer. The optimized compound parameters for monitoring LS and IS were set as follows: declustering potential (DP), 38  V; entrance potential (EP), 10  V; collision energy (CE), 20  V; and collision cell exit potential (CXP), 7  V. The optimized compound parameters for monitoring LHA were set as follows: DP 48  V, EP 5  V, CE 20  V, and CXP 8  V. The source parameters of the mass spectrometer were optimized and maintained as follows: collision-activated dissociation (CAD) <b>gas,</b> 6  psi; <b>curtain</b> <b>gas</b> (CUR), 20  psi; nebulizer gas (GS 1), 60  psi; heater gas (GS 2), 40  psi; turbo ion spray voltage, 4500  V; and source temperature, 450  °C. Quadrupole 1 and quadrupole 3 were both maintained at unit resolution, and dwell time was set at 200  ms for all analytes. The mass transitions were selected as 422.1 [*]→[*] 285.4 for LS, 425.4 [*]→[*] 285.4 for IS, and 423.3 [*]→[*] 303.7 for LHA.
