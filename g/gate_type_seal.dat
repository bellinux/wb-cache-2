40|$|A {{detailed}} {{approach for}} {{the selection and}} design of seals for helicopter transmissions is presented. There are two major <b>types</b> of <b>seals</b> presently being used and they are lip <b>type</b> <b>seals</b> and mechanical <b>type</b> <b>seals.</b> Lip <b>type</b> <b>seals</b> can be divided in conventional lip seals and hydrodynamic lip seals. Conventional lip seals {{can be used for}} slow-speed, low-pressure, low-temperature sealing. Hydrodynamic lip seals although they are as pressure and temperature limited as conventional lip seals, can operate at a higher speed. Mechanical <b>types</b> <b>seals</b> are comprised of face seals and circumferential seals. Face seals are capable of high speed, high pressure, and high temperature. Circumferential seals can be used in high-speed and high-temperature applications, but will leak excessively at moderate pressures. The performance goals of transmission seals are a life that is at least equal to the scheduled overhaul interval of the gearbox component and a leakage rate of near zero...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a toll station layout optimisation methodology based on toll plaza circulation safety analysis. Then we propose a mathematical model assessing the expected level of traffic safety associated with the toll station layout, actual or planned, due to a given configuration for toll <b>gate</b> <b>types</b> and positions. The model has been conceived in order to let the planner be able to decide the proper sequence of <b>gate</b> <b>types</b> which minimises the risk of accidents. The decision variables are mainly related to the assignment of a <b>gate</b> <b>type</b> – manual <b>gate</b> with operator, ETC gate, semiautomatic or short stop gate – to each gate position in the station. The resulting multi-toll-type assignment model, or MTTA, takes into account the probability of interaction between pairs of traffic streams originated from the different lanes of the highway and directed to specific gate types; different severity and risk indices are associated both with vehicle types and with destination <b>gate</b> <b>types.</b> The computational tests have been performed on observed data collected during several hours of video-camera images recorded in five different motorway multi-type toll plazas located in Tuscany (Italy). Our results support the evidence that gates associated to higher risk traffic flows, e. g. traffic directed to ETC gates which approaches the toll station at speeds significantly above the average, should be locate in a central position with respect to other <b>gate</b> <b>types.</b> Moreover, the experimental results disagree with the general operations practice of many Italian motorway Agencies, which usually place ETC gates on the far side of the toll plaza...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} a plastic defect in injection molding before it occurs in the process; it {{is known as the}} short shot defect. The evaluation of different parameters which affect the possibility of short shot defect is the aim of this paper. The analysis of short shot possibility is conducted via SolidWorks Plastics and Taguchi method to determine the most significant parameters. Finite Element Method (FEM) is employed to analyze two circular flat polypropylene plates of 1 mm thickness. Filling time, part cooling time, pressure holding time, melt temperature and <b>gate</b> <b>type</b> are chosen as process and geometric parameters, respectively. A methodology is presented herein to predict the possibility of the short-shot occurrence. The analysis determined melt temperature is the most influential parameter affecting the possibility of short shot defect with a contribution of 74. 25 %, and filling time with a contribution of 22 %, followed by <b>gate</b> <b>type</b> with a contribution of 3. 69 %. It was also determined the optimum level of each parameter leading to a reduction in the possibility of short shot are <b>gate</b> <b>type</b> at level 1, filling time at level 3 and melt temperature at level 3.

40|$|The Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) is {{designed}} for computing water surface profiles and inundation maps, {{but it is also}} able to handle flow through gated structures using a variety of equation sand techniques. HEC-RAS has a small selection of built-in <b>gate</b> <b>types,</b> representing some of the more common gates that are used for controlling flow at dams and canal structures. Each <b>gate</b> <b>type</b> in HEC-RAS has a set of empirical equations that are used to compute head loss through the structure for a given flow. There are also two operational schemes that can be chosen for gates: Time Series Gate Openings, and Elevation Controlled Gates. While the built-in <b>gate</b> <b>types</b> and operational schemes in HEC-RAS might be appropriate for some of the more common gate structures, it is quite common to have a gate system or other flow control device that simply does not fit {{within the confines of the}} built-in techniques in HEC-RAS. In these cases, the user has the option to take advantage of some lesser known techniques both within HEC-RAS and by external application. This paper will discuss four gate and operation strategies that can be used with HEC-RAS that allow the user to handle any flow control scheme possible.
