50|$|The Pelton {{turbines}} are horizontal units {{operating at}} 750rpm. The runner buckets {{are made with}} integrally cast stainless cast steel. The runner is directly coupled to the <b>generator</b> <b>shaft.</b> Other equipment associated with the turbine are inlet valve, distributor, power nozzles and needles and the governor and hydraulic systems. Rated voltage of the generators is 6.3kV. The bearings of generators are oil lubricated sleeve type and separate oil lubrication unit is used. Two 6MVA transformers are used to step up the generator voltage to 33KV. These transformers are the outdoor type. A 50kVA transformer operating at 400V is used for station supply.|$|E
50|$|The extreme {{vibration}} in {{this location}} {{leads to a}} considerable load on the pulse generator bearing, which, with this method of installation has to carry not only the relatively small mass of the pulse <b>generator</b> <b>shaft</b> but that of the entire pulse generator.

50|$|The {{main exciter}} is a 3,000 rpm 3-phase machine {{directly}} coupled {{to the main}} <b>generator</b> <b>shaft.</b> Cooling is effected by a closed air ventilation circuit with pannier mounted coolers supplied with cooling water from the condensate system. The exciter output is rectified by a 3-phase bridge-connected group of silicon diodes which are natural air cooled and accommodated in a bank of nine cubicles located on a platform cantilevered {{from the side of}} the foundation block. Mounted adjacent to the rectifiers is the main field suppression circuit-breaker which incorporates a discharge resistance and auxiliary switch to close the discharge circuit. A permanent magnet high frequency generator, directly coupled to the exciter shaft, acts as a pilot exciter and supplies the exciter field via a power stage magnetic amplifier which may be regulated either by manual control or by the automatic voltage regulator. The AVR is a continuously acting regulator including such features as VAR limiting, automatic follow-up of manual control, and protection against over fluxing or over exciting of the main generator.|$|E
50|$|The {{bearings}} {{have to be}} leak-tight. A hermetic seal, {{usually a}} liquid seal, is employed; a turbine oil at pressure higher than the hydrogen inside is typically used. A metal, e.g. brass, ring is pressed by springs onto the <b>generator</b> <b>shaft,</b> the oil is forced under pressure between the ring and the shaft; part of the oil flows into the hydrogen side of the generator, another part to the air side. The oil entrains {{a small amount of}} air; as the oil is recirculated, some of the air is carried over into the generator. This causes a gradual air contamination buildup and requires maintaining hydrogen purity. Scavenging systems are used for this purpose; gas (mixture of entrained air and hydrogen, released from the oil) is collected in the holding tank for the sealing oil, and released into the atmosphere; the hydrogen losses have to be replenished, either from gas cylinders or from on-site hydrogen generators. Degradation of bearings leads to higher oil leaks, which increases the amount of air transferred into the generator; increased oil consumption can be detected by a flow meter associated to each bearing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flex spline}} is {{shaped like a}} shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is {{relatively}} rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, and in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around {{the outside of the}} flex spline. The flex spline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flex spline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse and does not slip over the outer elliptical ring of the ball bearing. The ball bearing lets the flex spine rotate independently to the wave <b>generator's</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{diesel engine}} is an twelve-cylinder, turbocharged, water-cooled, four-cycle, V-type engine usedto provide power. It is {{directly}} connected to the main generator. The traction motors are axle hung and supported on the truck transoms by spring-loaded suspension. One motor is geared to each axle through a single set of gears with a ratio of 14:72. The radiator keeps engine at proper operating temperature between 100 and 1980F (37.7 and 92.2°C). Two externally mounted battery boxes, {{one on each side}} of the locomotive, provide ventilated compartments to house the eight batteries. Two main reservoir tanks, one {{on each side of the}} locomotive, provide a means of storing air for the air system. The main generator furnishes direct-current power over a wide range of voltage at variousspeeds up to 1200 rpm. It is separately excited by the exciter generator mounted on the generator frame. The generator also acts as a starting motor when the start button is pushed and the battery switch is closed. The fuel tank can hold 500 gallons (1892 liters) of diesel fuel for engine operation. Two fill pipes and two sight glasses, one on each side of the locomotive, provide a means of filling the tank and monitoring the level of fuel. The blower provides forced ventilation for the traction motors which require adequate cooling. It is belt driven from the main <b>generator</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kite-power systems {{dedicated}} to operating without its energy-harvesting elements flying to crosswind are not CWKPS. Examples help {{to clarify the}} two branches of kite-power systems. A simple symmetrical two-stick diamond kite let out to downwind flight while the system's tether pulls to turn an at-ground <b>generator</b> <b>shaft</b> is producing energy for use by flying downwind without flying to crosswind; such is a non-CWKPS. Some hefty downwind kite-power systems (DWKPS) are proposed by serious researchers; some DWKPS instruction {{is found in the}} patent literature; one trend involves the opening and closing of pilot-kite-lifted opening-and-closing parachutes to drive generators. Notice that some CWKPS, such as Jalbert parafoil working in figure-8 patterns to turn a ground-stationed generator, could be commissioned to operate fully without flying to crosswind, and the resultant kite-power system would then be a DWKPS. Differently, the CWKPS proposed by users of the autorotating blades stay necessarily as CWKPS. Magenn Power's flip-wing kite-balloon is a DWKPS. [...] Similar flip-wing rotating wings are DWKPS, e.g. that taught in Edwards and Evan patent. Benjamin Franklin's legendary pond-crossing by kite power was a simple DWKPS; he was merely dragged downwind by a downwind-flying kite. A non-CWPKS is historically illustrated by a kite-power harvesting system such as was used by Samuel Franklin Cody for man-lifting with the involved wings set in stable downwind flight without flying to crosswind.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the <b>generator</b> <b>shaft</b> comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E

5000|$|Assume {{that the}} wave {{generator}} is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed {{with those of}} the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the wave <b>generator's</b> <b>shaft.</b> The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|R
