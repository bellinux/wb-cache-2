Leuven - Research group for Work, Organisational and Personnel Psychology 2 Wageningen University - Public Administration and Policy Group This paper is an analysis of a participatory process to define a water management plan for the area between the Kromme Rijn and the Amsterdam-Rijn canal in The Netherlands. The waterboard has initiated an interactive decision-making process, in order to analyze problems, devise solutions and develop the plan in a concerted way with the stakeholders involved. A sequence of stakeholder meetings took place, structured in different ways and thereby allowing for diverse levels {{of participation}} and interaction. The central research question is how the different levels of participation observed in the stakeholder meetings affect the interactional process of framing the issues in the problem domain. We therefore analysed different stakeholder meetings in the abovementioned participatory process and compared the interaction setting and the interactional framing processes. Based on meeting recordings, transcripts, field notes and documents, we identified levels of participation (information, consultation, active involvement) and we analyzed the ongoing interactional process of framing through discourse analysis. We identified three qualitatively different interactional framing processes which we will refer to as frame selling, frame filling and frame negotiation, which emerged in this sequence {{in the course of the}} participatory process. The information meeting was dominated by frame selling. In the consultation meeting frame selling occurred and frame filling was added. Only in the third meeting, characterized by active involvement, after an episode of frame selling and frame <b>filling,</b> <b>frame</b> negotiation occurred, allowing the issue framing to become more differentiated and with more potential for reframing...|$|E

The honey frames are typically harvested in the late summer, when they will be most filled with honey.

He worked as an assistant animator on Sleeping Beauty (1959) and 101 Dalmatians (1961). Mattinson then worked {{as an assistant to}} Eric Larson on The Sword and the Stone (1963), Mary Poppins (1964), The Jungle Book (1967) and The Aristocats (1970), and became a character animator on Robin Hood (1973) and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too (1974).|$|R

40|$|Gesture. Our {{approach}} to pen-based gesture recognition is to decompose pen strokes into sequences of basic shapes such as line, arc, arrow, circle, cross [...] . [5] The same gesture shape may mean different things {{depending on the}} surrounding context, hence each gesture component is augmented by gesture contexts indicating spatial relationships between the gesture and nearby objects in the user interface. Handwriting. Our MS-TDNN-based handwriting recognizer [6] is capable of processing writer-independent, continuous (cursive) handwriting at a recognition rate of 94 % on a 20, 000 -word vocabulary and working on the run-on mode. We employ simple heuristics to decide when to invoke handwriting recognition on pen input, e. g., when the gesture recognizer cannot identify the input strokes as basic shapes. 5. 2. Joint Interpretation In order {{to make sense of}} input from all available sources, we need a multimodal interpreter capable of producing an interpretation of user intent (e. g., a command to execute in the application interface) from the output of the modality processors. In our joint interpretation scheme, the user intent is represented by a frame consisting of slots specifying pieces of information such as the action to carry out or the parameters for that action. Recognition output from the modality processors are parsed into partially <b>filled</b> <b>frames</b> that are merged together to produce the combined interpretation as described in [5]. This technique leads to uniform handling of highlevel information from all input sources, which is very important for modularity and extensibility. To add another input modality we need only provide a module to convert low-level recognizer output to a partially <b>filled</b> <b>frame</b> to be merged with others. In addition, context information can be retained across input events by merging with previous interpretation frames. 6.

The load applied to the floors was the gravity load corresponding to the current useful loading, after which the load was applied horizontally up to the maximum bending imposed in the horizontal plane. Instruments were used to steadily check the deformations and rotations induced by the moving side. The maximum response of the floor to horizontal seismic loads was tested and the possibility to consider such elements as significantly rigid elements in the horizontal plane and their computer design were analyzed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} authors {{analyzed}} how changes {{appear in the}} way stakeholders frame and reframe the issues and their stake in a water area planning process. They took on a discursive perspective and focused on {{what happens in the}} interaction between stakeholders. Three aspects of change were observed: the differentiation of issue framing and stake of the process initiator, the internal differentiation of issue framing and stake of one interest party, and changes in the mode of interaction. With regard to the modes of interaction three different processes were distinguished: <b>frame</b> selling, <b>frame</b> <b>filling</b> and <b>frame</b> negotiation. It was concluded that the differentiation of issues and stakes is an important kind of change in decision-making processes and that multidirectional frame negotiation is helpful to achieve an integrated agreement...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} design and {{detailing}} of monolithic buildings, {{taking into account the}} interaction of the masonry <b>filling</b> and <b>frame</b> members is considered. The results of numerical and experimental researches of the masonry filling behavior at the frame twist and deflection of the supporting structures have been presented. It is shown that the <b>filling</b> at the <b>frame</b> twist causes a redistribution of stresses in the columns and floor slabs, that can both have positive and negative effect on its stress-strain state. The necessity of adjusting the standards concerning the limits of floor deflections, against which the masonry walls and partitions abut, has been noted. It is shown that ignoring the joint action of stone filling and skeleton can lead to excessive consumption of materials in the construction of monolithic reinforced concrete buildings, to the additional energy costs and higher prices of construction or, conversely, to an unexpected limit state of infilling and frame members...|$|R
