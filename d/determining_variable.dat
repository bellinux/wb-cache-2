5000|$|Perspectives on South African social {{mobility}} can vary. The topic of race has dominated South African politics {{for the last}} half century, and therefore, when looking at inequality and {{social mobility}}, people often turn to race as the <b>determining</b> <b>variable.</b> It is possible to argue that social mobility exists in South Africa, {{and it can be}} seen in the fact that the all the wealth and high status within the country was previously held by whites, whereas today, there are many natives who have been able to pull themselves out of oppression and into a status of income security and wealth. [...] However, it is also clear that there is a large gap between those natives who have been able to achieve a level of success and those who have remained in poverty. It is in this gap where social mobility is hardly present, if at all. Statistically, those natives who were born to poor families and poor communities do not have the equality of opportunity to achieve success in South African society.|$|E

In this {{paper we propose a}} novel unifying framework for coordinate gradient learning (MGL) from the perspective of multi-task learning. Our approach relies on multi-task kernels to simulate the structure of gradient learning. This has several appealing properties. Firstly, it allows us to introduce a novel algorithm which appropriately captures the inherent structure of coordinate gradient learning. Secondly, this approach gives rise to a clear algorithmic process: a computational optimization algorithm which is memory and time efficient. Finally, a statistical error analysis ensures convergence of the estimated function and its gradient to the true function and true gradient. We report some preliminary experiments to validate MGL for variable selection as well as <b>determining</b> <b>variable</b> covariation...|$|E

In sol-volysis of sulfonium ions in 80 % aqueous acetonitrile, where acetonitrile is a good cation solvator, the solvation of the reactant ground state is an important rate <b>determining</b> <b>variable</b> since the positive charge is almost entirely located on the leaving group. As a consequence, reaction rates of sulfonium ions are {{more sensitive to the}} substrate structure in 80 % aqueous acetonitrile than in pure and aqueous alcohols, which are less efficient as cation solvators. In solvolysis of pyridinium ions the solvation of the reactant ground state is less important, since the positive charge is considerably distributed between the carbon at the reaction center and the leaving group. In such cases the important rate <b>determining</b> <b>variable</b> is solvation of the transition state. Slower reactions of pyridinium sub-strates progress over later, carbocation-like transition states in which the solvation is more important, so those substrates solvolyze slightly faster in aqueous acetonitrile than in methanol (k 80 AN > kM). Faster reactions proceed over earlier TS in which the solvation is diminished, so those substrates solvolyze somewhat faster in methanol than in aqueous acetonitrile (k 80 AN < kM).
