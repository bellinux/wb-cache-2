The Production Designer, Steve Arnold, also describes in detail {{the use of a}} three-sided green screen to insert street scenes outside car windows, with synchronized LED screens above the car (and out of camera shot), that emit the appropriate light onto the actors and parts of the car, such as window frames: [...] "All the driving in the show, anything inside the vehicle is done on stage, in a room that is a big three-sided green screen space. The car does not move, the actors are in the car, and the cameras are set up around them. We have very long strips of LED monitors hung above the car. We had a camera crew go to Washington, D.C. to drive around and shoot plates for what you see outside when you’re driving. And that is fed into the LED screens above the car. So as the scene is progressing, the LED screens are synched up to emit interactive light to match the light conditions you see in the scenery you’re driving past (that will be added in post). All the reflections on the car windows, the window frames and door jambs is being shot while we’re shooting the actors in the car. Then in post the green screens are replaced with the synced up <b>driving</b> <b>plates,</b> and it works really well. It gives you the sense of light passing over the actors’ faces, matching the lighting that is {{in the image of the}} plate".|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{of a model}} of plane Couette flow focusing on its in-plane spatio-temporal properties are used to study the dynamics of turbulent spots. While {{the core of a}} spot is filled with small scale velocity fluctuations, a large scale flow extending far away and occupying the full gap between the <b>driving</b> <b>plates</b> is revealed upon filtering out small scales. It is characterized by streamwise inflow towards the spot and spanwise outflow from the spot, giving it a quadrupolar shape. A correction to the base flow is present within the spot {{in the form of a}} spanwise vortex with vorticity opposite in sign to that of the base flow. The Reynolds stresses are shown to be at the origin of this recirculation, whereas the quadrupolar shape of the in-plane flow results from the transport of this recirculation by the base flow that pumps it towards the spot in the streamwise direction and flushes it in the spanwise direction to insure mass conservation. These results shed light on earlier observations in plane Couette flow or other wall flows experiencing a direct transition to turbulence by spot nucleation. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the insight}} gained from 2 -D {{particle}} models, {{and given that}} the dynamics of crustal faults occur in 3 -D space, the question remains, how do the 3 -D fault gouge dynamics differ from those in 2 -D? Traditionally, 2 -D modeling has been preferred over 3 -D simulations because of the computational cost of solving 3 -D problems. However, modern high performance computing architectures, combined with a parallel implementation of the Lattice Solid Model (LSM), provide the opportunity to explore 3 -D fault micro-mechanics and to advance understanding of effective constitutive relations of fault gouge layers. In this paper, macroscopic friction values from 2 -D and 3 -D LSM simulations, performed on an SGI Altix 3700 super-cluster, are compared. Two rectangular elastic blocks of bonded particles, with a rough fault plane and separated by a region of randomly sized non-bonded gouge particles, are sheared in opposite directions by normally-loaded <b>driving</b> <b>plates.</b> The results demonstrate that the gouge particles in the 3 -D models undergo significant out-of-plane motion during shear. The 3 -D models also exhibit a higher mean macroscopic friction than the 2 -D models for varying values of interparticle friction. 2 -D LSM gouge models have previously been shown to exhibit accelerating energy release in simulated earthquake cycles, supporting the Critical Point hypothesis. The 3 -D models are shown to also display accelerating energy release, and good fits of power law time-to-failure functions to the cumulative energy release are obtained...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, 2 D Discrete Element Models (DEMs) {{have been}} {{preferred}} over 3 D models, for fault gouge simu-lations, {{because of the}} computational cost of solving 3 D problems. In order to realistically simulate fault gouge processes {{it is important to}} characterise differences between 2 D and 3 D models and be able to assess whether 2 D models are adequate for approximating 3 D gouge dynamics. In this paper, 2 D and 3 D fault gouges are simu-lated as two rectangular elastic blocks of bonded particles, separated by a region of randomly sized non-bonded spherical gouge particles, sheared in opposite directions by normally-loaded <b>driving</b> <b>plates.</b> The dynamic behav-ior of multiple model parameterisations is analysed by examining instantaneous macroscopic fault friction (µI) statistics. The response of the mean macroscopic friction is characterised for varying values of inter-particle (microscopic) friction µP in 2 D and 3 D and for non-rotational and rotational particle dynamics. In the non-rotational models, realistic angular gouge mean macroscopic friction values (E[µI] ≈ 0. 6) are obtained in the simulations for a 2 D inter-particle friction value of µP = 0. 3 and 3 D value of µP = 0. 2. The rotational models exhibit mean macroscopic friction values of E[µI] = 0. 3 (in 2 D) and E[µI] = 0. 38 (in 3 D) for inter-particle friction values µP ≥ 0. 3. The 2 D rotational macroscopic friction values are in close agreement with comparable 2 D glass-rod (E[µI] ≈ 0. 3) laboratory experiments. In the 3 D case, the simulated mean macroscopic friction values are lower than those of 3 D spherical bead laboratory experiments where 0. 4 < E[µI] ≤ 0. 45. ...|$|E
40|$|The Load-Unload Response Ratio (LURR) {{method is}} an intermediate-term {{earthquake}} prediction approach that has shown considerable promise. It involves calculating {{the ratio of}} a specified energy release measure during loading and unloading where loading and unloading periods are determined from the earth tide induced perturbations in the Coulomb Failure Stress on optimally oriented faults. In the lead-up to large earthquakes, high LURR values are frequently observed a few months or {{years prior to the}} event. These signals may have a similar origin to the observed accelerating seismic moment release (AMR) prior to many large earthquakes or may be due to critical sensitivity of the crust when a large earthquake is imminent. As a first step towards studying the underlying physical mechanism for the LURR observations, numerical studies are conducted using the particle based lattice solid model (LSM) to determine whether LURR observations can be reproduced. The model is initialized as a heterogeneous 2 -D block made up of random-sized particles bonded by elastic-brittle links. The system is subjected to uniaxial compression from rigid <b>driving</b> <b>plates</b> on the upper and lower edges of the model. Experiments are conducted using both strain and stress control to load the plates. A sinusoidal stress perturbation is added to the gradual compressional loading to simulate loading and unloading cycles and LURR is calculated. The results reproduce signals similar to those observed in earthquake prediction practice with a high LURR value followed by a sudden drop prior to macroscopic failure of the sample. The results suggest that LURR provides a good predictor for catastrophic failure in elastic-brittle systems and motivate further research to study the underlying physical mechanisms and statistical properties of high LURR values. The results provide encouragement for earthquake prediction research and the use of advanced simulation models to probe the physics of earthquakes...|$|E

In the first model elastic forces were employed and time independent friction to simulate main shock events. The size, length, and time and place of event occurrence were influenced strongly by the magnitude and degree of homogeniety in the elastic and friction parameters of the fault region. Periodically reoccurring similar events were frequently observed in simulations with near homogeneous parameters along the fault, whereas, seismic gaps were a common feature of simulations employing large variations in the fault parameters. The second model incorporated viscoelastic forces and time-dependent friction to account for aftershock sequences. The periods between aftershock events increased with time and the aftershock region was confined to that which moved in the main event...|$|R
40|$|The {{buoyancy}} of lithospheric slabs in subduction zones {{is widely}} thought {{to dominate the}} torques <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics. In late Cretaceous and early Paleogene times, the Indian plate moved more rapidly over the mantle than freely subducting slabs sink within it. This signal event {{has been attributed to}} arrival of the Deccan–Réunion mantle plume beneath the plate, but it is unknown in which proportions the plume acted to alter the balance of existing <b>plate</b> <b>driving</b> torques and to introduce torques of its own. Our plate kinematic analysis of the Mascarene Basin yields a detailed Indian plate motion history for the period 89 – 60 [*]Ma. Plate speed initially increases steadily until a pronounced acceleration in the period 68 – 64 [*]Ma, after which it abruptly returns to values much like those beforehand. This pattern is unlike that suggested to result from the direct introduction of driving forces by the arrival of a thermal plume {{at the base of the}} plate. A simple analysis of the gravitational force related to the Indian plate's thickening away from its boundary with the African plate suggests instead that the sudden acceleration and deceleration may be related to uplift of part of that boundary during a period when it was located over the plume head. In this instance, torques related to plate accretion and subduction may have contributed in similar proportions to drive plate motion...|$|R

40|$|The two {{convective}} {{systems that}} dominate Earth’s internal dynamics {{meet at the}} boundary between the rocky mantle and metallic liquid core. Energy transfer between processes <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics and the geodynamo is controlled by thermal conduction in the lowermost mantle (D′′). We use atomic scale simulations to determine the thermal conductivity of MgSiO 3 perovskite and post-perovskite under D′′ conditions and probe how these two convective systems interact. We show that the thermal conductivity of post-perovskite (~ 12 W/mK) is 50 % larger than that of perovskite under the same conditions (~ 8. 5 W/mK) and is anisotropic, with conductivity along the a-axis being 40 % higher than conductivity along the c-axis. This enhances the high heat flux into cold regions of D′′ where post-perovskite is stable, strengthening the feedback between convection in the core and mantle. Reminiscent of the situation in the lithosphere, there is potential for deformation induced texturing associated with mantle convection to modify how the mantle is heated from below. We test this by coupling our atomic scale results to models of texture in D′′ and suggest that anisotropic thermal conductivity may help to stabilise the roots of mantle plumes over their protracted lifetime...|$|R

40|$|One way or another, {{the mantle}} convects. There is still {{discussion}} {{about whether the}} mode is whole mantle or layered {{and if it is}} driven primarily from the top. Radioactivity, secular cooling and strong plates influence convection and cause upwellings to be broad and migratory. Pressure and compositional effects cause the deep mantle to have very broad features. In any case, broad upwellings exist in the mantle, if only to replace the sinking slabs or to get rid of internal radioactive heat. These upwellings would exist even if the mantle were not heated from below and even if there were no lower thermal boundary layer (TBL). In the fluid dynamic literature buoyant upwellings are called plumes. It was suggested that plate tectonics and normal mantle convection could not explain hotspots, melting anomalies and volcanic chains because normal mantle was too cold. A different small-scale mode of convection was proposed (Morgan, 1971). The defining characteristics of mantle plumes have changed with time but great depth, a TBL origin, high temperatures, rapid ascent rates, and low viscosity are the invariants. Initially, mantle plumes were treated as fixed, whole-mantle, chemically primitive or enriched and responsible for lifting and breaking continents and for <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics.

25|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. The current view, though still {{a matter of some}} debate, asserts that as a consequence, a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the <b>driving</b> force for <b>plate</b> movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is thought to be the strongest force <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted. The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate. The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists. One of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movement itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement, as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism. In short, the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement: mantle dynamics related, gravity related (mostly secondary forces), and earth rotation related.|$|R

2500|$|Several {{forces are}} {{involved}} in the process of slab rollback. Two forces acting against each other at the interface of the two subducting plates exert forces against one another. The subducting plate exerts a bending force (FPB) that supplies pressure during subduction, while the overriding plate exerts a force against the subducting plate (FTS). The slab pull force (FSP) is caused by the negative buoyancy of the <b>plate</b> <b>driving</b> the <b>plate</b> to greater depths. The resisisting force from the surrounding mantle opposes the slab pull forces. Interactions with the 660-km discontinuity cause a deflection due to the buoyancy at the phase transition (F660). [...] The unique interplay of these forces is what generates slab rollback. When the deep slab section obstructs the down-going motion of the shallow slab section, slab rollback occurs. The subducting slab undergoes backward sinking due to the negative buoyancy forces causing a retrogradation of the trench hinge along the surface. Upwelling of the mantle around the slab can create favorable conditions for the formation of a back-arc basin.|$|R
