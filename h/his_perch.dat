25|$|The out-sized {{political}} {{personality of}} Johnson, of course, was the dominating presence at lunch.

25|$|After {{one term}} as mayor, Clark {{narrowly}} defeated incumbent Republican Senator James H. Duff in the 1956 Senate election. Clark {{earned a reputation}} as a strong supporter of civil rights and worked to appoint liberal committee members from <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> on the Democratic Steering Committee. Clark narrowly won re-election in 1962 but was defeated in 1968 by Congressman Richard Schweiker. His defeat is generally credited to his support of gun control and opposition to the Vietnam War. After leaving office, Clark became a professor at Temple University.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} were {{receptive to the}} new mascot and expressed a concern for a larger cage to house War Eagle III. In 1964, {{on the morning of}} the football game against Tennessee, War Eagle III was seen by his trainer, A. Elwyn Hamer Jr., sitting on the ground next to <b>his</b> <b>perch.</b> He had sprung the clip on his leash and escaped. After several days of searching, the bird was found shot to death in a wooded area near Birmingham, Alabama, where the game was being played.|$|E

60|$|He {{took the}} {{offending}} article off and brushed it tenderly with his coat-sleeve, while the furious mate looked {{assault and battery}} at the other three. Tim, whose hat came well down over his eyes, felt comparatively safe; but the cook, conscious that <b>his</b> <b>perched</b> lightly {{on the top of}} his head, drew back a pace. Then he uttered an exclamation as Captain Nibletts, who was officiating as best man, came hurriedly down the cliff.|$|R
60|$|Soon, we {{were once}} more afloat; by our side, Media sociably seated; six of <b>his</b> paddlers, <b>perched</b> upon the gunwale, swiftly urging {{us over the}} lagoon.|$|R
25|$|During {{the summer}} season, males {{can be found}} in female {{foraging}} areas attempting to mate. However, as fall approaches, males will begin to set up leks near female hibernation sites. Fall mating occurs during September and October. Males will choose perch sites near areas frequented by females, sometimes changing sites up to 3 times per day. However, after six to seven days of waiting, the male will then remain at <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> site {{for the rest of the}} 6–7 weeks of mating. Once a site is chosen, the male will drag his abdomen along the surface of the perch site for scent marking.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kampfner, [...] "Wolfowitz used <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies as a {{test-bed}} {{for a new}} conservative world vision." [...] Wolfowitz {{was associated}} with the Project for the New American Century (PNAC); he signed both the PNAC's June 3, 1997 [...] "Statement of Principles", and its January 26, 1998, open letter to President Bill Clinton.|$|E
2500|$|... : The Birdman {{is one of}} Tetsuo's elite psychic shocktroops. He wears a {{blindfold}} and {{is frequently}} standing atop ruined buildings and rafters, observing and reporting on the goings-on within the Empire's turf, and essentially acting as a security system. It is implied that his psychic powers allow him to sense sights and sounds from a great distance, further embodied by the all-seeing eye drawn on his forehead. Birdman dies when Yamada knocks him from <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> causing him to fall to his death.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll ask Uncle Dan'l to {{take him}} home with us," [...] said Toby as he slipped down from <b>his</b> high <b>perch</b> and started towards the tent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{political}} news from below, Bill?" [...] he asked, {{as the latter}} slowly descended from <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch,</b> without, however, any perceptible coming down of mien or manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! ha!" [...] cried Otter {{again from}} <b>his</b> airy <b>perch.</b> [...] "Treachery! treachery! And {{what if the}} slaves are loosed? And what if the gates be barred?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Second, Sibelius's [...] "deeply idiosyncratic" [...] idiom was too [...] "personal" [...] {{to serve}} {{adequately}} as a [...] "foundation" [...] {{upon which to}} build a school of musical thought. That Madetoja's own musical style shows the mark of Sibelius {{is a testament to}} the longer duration and greater depth of his instruction under Sibelius; Kuula, who only briefly studied with Sibelius, shows no such influence. Finally, Sibelius—prone to periods of self-doubt and ever-concerned with his standing in artistic circles—was mistrustful of the next generation of composers, fearing one might displace him from <b>his</b> <b>perch.</b> ("Youth has a right to make its voice heard. One sees oneself as a father figure to them all", Sibelius confided to his diary. [...] " [...] they don't give a damn about you. Perhaps with reason.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Gavan McCormack {{has written}} that Zoellick used <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> as U.S. trade {{representative}} to advocate for Wall Street's policy goals abroad, as during a 2004 intervention in a key privatization issue in Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's re-election campaign. [...] McCormack has written, [...] "The office of the U.S. Trade Representative has played {{an active part in}} drafting the Japan Post privatization law. An October 2004 letter from Robert Zoellick to Japan’s Finance Minister Takenaka Heizo, tabled in the Diet on August 2, 2005, included a handwritten note from Zoellick commending Takenaka. Challenged to explain this apparent U.S. government intervention in a domestic matter, Koizumi merely expressed his satisfaction that Takenaka had been befriended by such an important figure… It is hard to overestimate the scale of the opportunity offered to U.S. and global finance capital by the privatization of the Postal Savings System." ...|$|E
2500|$|But a year later, he {{was knocked}} off <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> {{not by a}} talent raid but by a show on a third rival network, ABC (the former NBC Blue network). The quiz show Stop the Music, hosted by Bert Parks (debuted 1948) {{required}} listeners to participate live by telephone. [...] The show became a big enough hit to break into Allen's grip on that Sunday night time slot. At first, Allen fought fire with his own kind of fire: he offered $5,000 to any listener getting a call from Stop the Music or any similar game show while listening to The Fred Allen Show. He never had to pay up, nor was he shy about lampooning the game show phenomenon (especially a riotous parody of another quiz show Parks hosted, lancing Break the Bank in a routine called [...] "Break the Contestant" [...] in which players didn't receive a thing but were compelled to give up possessions when they blew a question.) ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{the old man}} {{slipped down}} from <b>his</b> uncomfortable <b>perch,</b> stopped {{at the door to}} warn Jim and Dody that they must not stray far away, and {{disappeared}} behind the ruins of the tavern.|$|R
6000|$|He went out, {{and when}} {{afternoon}} came he returned, took a billhook from the woodman's shed, {{and with a}} ladder climbed into {{the lower part of}} the tree, where he began lopping off--"shrouding," [...] as they called it at Hintock--the lowest boughs. Each of these quivered under his attack, bent, cracked, and fell into the hedge. Having cut away the lowest tier, he stepped off the ladder, climbed a few steps higher, and attacked those at the next level. Thus he ascended with the progress of his work far above the top of the ladder, cutting away <b>his</b> <b>perches</b> as he went, and leaving nothing but a bare stem below him.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Phipps, after a faint protest, gave way, and Mr. Digson, smiling broadly, mounted <b>his</b> <b>perch</b> again.|$|E
60|$|Taking pity upon them, a clerk left <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> {{and going}} forward, asked the woman what she wanted.|$|E

60|$|Dave {{had come}} down from <b>his</b> high <b>perch</b> in a hurry, and {{in a very short}} time was ready to leave the spot. Merwell gave a deep sigh, for he did not relish confronting his former schoolmates.|$|R
60|$|Then she sat the egg gently {{upon the}} top of the stone wall, where there was a little hollow; and Humpty was delighted, for from <b>his</b> {{elevated}} <b>perch</b> he could see much better than the Princess herself.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, {{cartoonist}} Charles M. Schulz {{responded to}} {{a request for a}} Peanuts cartoon by drawing Snoopy with <b>his</b> nose <b>perched</b> over the end of his dog house {{in the manner of a}} gargoyle—this became a standard Snoopy pose.|$|R
60|$|That was {{the signal}} for Duane to drop down from <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> yet despite his care {{he made a}} noise.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{they were}} gone, Jerry came down from <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> and off they started once more for the island.|$|E
60|$|In truth, Harrison {{was very}} sick, {{as a person}} is sea-sick; {{and for a long}} time he clung to <b>his</b> {{precarious}} <b>perch</b> without attempting to move. Johansen, however, continued violently to urge him on to the completion of his task.|$|R
50|$|Hal Gurnee's Network Time Killers: Introduced {{during the}} summer of 1988 (after Late Night had {{returned}} from a lengthy hiatus due to a Writers Guild strike), the feature included Hal Gurnee introducing bizarre time-killing features from <b>his</b> director's <b>perch</b> in the control room.|$|R
60|$|So long as Toby {{was willing}} to feed him with {{doughnuts}} he {{was willing to}} remain; but when his companions gathered around in such numbers that the supply of food was quickly exhausted, he went back to <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch,</b> much to the boy's regret.|$|R
60|$|He went out, {{and slammed}} the door with such {{violence}} that the old Board of Trade bird nearly fell off <b>his</b> <b>perch.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'Shall I {{ring for}} ye?' said the cabman, who had descended from <b>his</b> <b>perch,</b> and was {{slapping}} his chest, {{for the night}} was bitter.|$|E
60|$|Not improbably the {{demonstration}} we executed {{under the tree}} would have frightened even an African lion. Tom hesitated, showed his white fangs, returned to <b>his</b> first <b>perch,</b> and from there climbed {{as far as he}} could. The forked branch on which he stood swayed alarmingly.|$|R
60|$|Foolish or not, {{this means}} effectually stopped the descent. He climbed to <b>his</b> first <b>perch.</b> It was then, realizing what I had done, that I would {{certainly}} have made tracks from under the piñon, if I had not heard the faint yelp of a hound.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan of the Apes {{watched them}} for a while from <b>his</b> lofty <b>perch</b> in the great tree. There was much in their {{demeanor}} which he could not understand, for of superstition he was ignorant, and of fear of any kind he had but a vague conception.|$|R
