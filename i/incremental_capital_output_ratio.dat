40|$|The paper assesses {{capital stock}} and <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> for major {{branches}} {{of the economy and}} selected industries. It {{is an important part of}} the research effort to determine historical rates of economic and technological change, especially those related to energy systems and their environmental impacts. The composition of capital stock and its vintage structure are a good measure and determinant of rates of change. Furthermore, the analysis presented in this paper may be useful for estimating the capital input required for production of goods and services at given levels of <b>output.</b> The <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> could also enhance understanding of the selection mechanism operating among industries with varying capital productivity. The first part of the paper analyzes the composition and distribution of capital stock within the economies of the US, UK, and the FRG. It is not surprising that the share of capital stock in different sectors shows the known development of investment and employment. In the last 25 years the share of fixed assets invested in agriculture decreased and the share of the national capital stock invested in services increased. The development in major branches and industries shows that transport (due to the decreased importance of railroads as a means of transportation) declined, whereas public utilities and construction comprised a stable proportion of the capital stock and finance/insurance/real estate and other services, excluding government, absorbed an increasing part of the national capital stock. The second part of the study tries to determine common features of <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> economy wide and for major branches and selected industries. It can be concluded that there are some similarities for the US, UK and the FRG. For example, during the 1980 s, <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> for the economy as a whole but excluding residential were found to be quite similar for the US, UK and the FRG, in that they varied only between 2. 5 and 2. 8. Over a longer time frame, the US <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> was relatively constant whereas the <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> in the FRG increased by 50 percent in less than 30 years (from 1. 8 in 1960 to 2. 7 in 1987). This trend is consistent with an earlier investigation (Doblin, 1978), that showed growing <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> for the 1960 s and 1970 s in the FRG (enterprises, excluding residential) as well as the UK (1964 - 1974). At the major branch level, a constant figure over the entire time frame was found for the US, UK and FRG <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> for manufacturing, construction, trade, and finance/insurance/real estate. For the other branches, no common trend could be established. Furthermore, the ranking of the <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> shows clearly that public utilities have the highest, and construction the lowest, <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios.</b> The absolute level is similar in all three countries for construction (0. 5 - 0. 9) and in the US and the FRG for manufacturing (1. 7 - 2. 0). Another interesting fact is that in the three countries, the deviation from the average was found to be the same for a number of industries. <b>Capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> were above the national average for agriculture, public utilities, transport, and communication; and below the average for manufacturing (with the exception of the UK), construction, trade and finance.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} in the literature that corruption lowers the level of investment and the productivity of capital stock in an economy. This paper extends the literature by presenting evidence that investment allocation decisions are affected in a significant way by corruption. The most commonly used measure of the efficiency of overall investment in an economy is the <b>incremental</b> <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> (ICOR), measured by the ratio of gross investment to {{the change in the}} gross domestic product. The inverse of the ICOR measures the productivity of investment in an economy. When the known explanatory factors for inter-country variation in the ICOR are taken into account, the incidence of corruption has a statistically significant negative effect on the efficiency of investment for a panel of 90 - 140 countries during 1995 - 2004. The strength of this effect increases with the incidence of corruption. The econometric model used is robust to unobserved and time-invariant country fixed effects, feedbacks from current stochastic shocks to subsequent values of the determinants of investment efficiency, and the persistence of efficiency.

It {{attempts to}} present not only a statistical profile of the facts about the mobilization and disbursement of resources, but also tries to provide information about the institutional framework and the policy issues relating to the problem of resource mobilization. SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT Historical profile Domestic savings constitute perhaps the most important single financial resource for economic development. Normally, {{in the early stages of}} development domestic savings are not adequate for the level of investment that is required to realizing a target rate of growth. Total investment required to achieve a desired growth rate of GDP is derived by using the <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> that reflects efficiency in the use of investment resources. The macroeconomic formula for estimating the investment required is as follows: I = β x G x Y, where I is investment, β is <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio,</b> G is growth rate of GDP and Y is the base-year value of GDP. I – S, where S stands for savings, gives the external resources required to realize GDP growth. In India the savings-to-GDP ratio was 10. 4 per cent in 1950 / 51. It rose to 12. 7 per cent in 1960, 15. 7 per cent in 1970, 21. 2 per cent in 1980 and 24. 3 per cent in 1990 (table 1). It declined in the period 1991 - 1993 but again increased to 25. 5 pe...|$|R

This discrepancy is one for one translated into higher prices of equipment goods, which explains that capital is scarce in volume, but not in value terms. This quantifies our interpretation of the Lucas paradox.

We also confirm the standard result that variations in demand are a significant driving force for variations in CU. We find that CU is positively related to the magnitude of labor intensity in production. This holds for both between-industries and within-industries. Empirical results also indicate that traditional measures of CU such as minimum <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> and peak-to-peak are not appropriate proxies for the short-run decision making of the firm regarding CU.

In this context, the present paper assesses {{the impact of the}} historical land ceiling legislations, largely implemented during 1960 - 85 to promote distributional equity, on corporate investment in India. We argue that the implementation of the land ceiling legislations had increased the transaction costs of buying land and also the price premium firms pay when acquiring land, thus inducing firms to invest less in land and capital. The detrimental ceiling effect is more pronounced when the ceiling size is more restrictive as for the most fertile land. Arguing that the variation in land ceiling size across the Indian states over time was largely dependent on choice of crops or soil fertility and as such could be treated as independent of the state authorities, our results support the conjecture that more restrictive land ceiling size has led to lower investment in both fixed and total <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> at the state-level (1960 - 85). Further analysis of firm-level (1996 - 2012) data confirms that the ceiling effect persists in the long run, thus identifying an unintended consequence of land ceilings for investment and economic growth in the Indian states...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{current account}} deficits and foreign debt levels remain {{a source of}} concern for {{international}} financial markets and policymakers. Yet, exactly what constitutes an "excessive" external deficit or liability position for an economy at any time has not been adequately defined. This paper addresses this question by proposing measures of the maximum feasible limits of current account deficits and foreign debt levels based on international macroeconomic relationships. It proposes that investment opportunities essentially define the limit of feasibility for current account deficits, whereas the <b>capital</b> to <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> sets the feasible foreign debt to GDP limit. Benchmark estimates of these limits are presented for advanced economies that have borrowed heavily since 1990. ...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{theoretical}} arguments tell us {{that countries}} with relatively little capital benefit from financial integration as foreign capital flows in and speeds up the process of income convergence. We show in a calibrated neoclassical model that conventionally measured welfare gains from this type of convergence appear relatively limited for developing countries. The welfare gain from switching from financial autarky to perfect capital mobility is roughly equivalent to a 1 percent permanent increase in domestic consumption for the typical non-OECD country. This is negligible relative to the welfare gain from a take-off in domestic productivity of the magnitude observed {{in some of these}} countries.

30|$|Several more {{complications}} {{arise when}} trying to apply I-O analysis to infrastructure failure. Infrastructure assets represent a stock of fixed capital, while I-O tables represent monetary flows occurring over a pre-specified period of time. Damage to infrastructure represents {{a reduction in the}} ‘physical capital stock’. This is different to a reduction in the flow of financial activity. Models attempting to estimate the impact of infrastructure failure are therefore assuming a proportional one-to-one relationship between infrastructure <b>capital</b> and economic <b>output,</b> which may not be correct. In order to estimate the economic effects of infrastructure failure it is therefore necessary to map how damaged capital infrastructure translates into a decrease in the availability of infrastructure services, and then how this is captured as lost revenue. Conversion between damage to capital and losses in economic output must first be made before any I-O calculations are even possible. A crude approximation is usually achieved using <b>capital</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratios</b> where the value of capital is divided by the value-added for each economic sector (Okuyama 2009). This is a crude approximation, as economic output losses will most likely vary non-linearly with damage due to the effect of back-up or redundant systems coming online, substitution effects and inventories being drawn down. Such processes are notoriously difficult to model. The size of the disaster also matters, as indirect revenue losses do not scale linearly with the size of the disaster.|$|R
