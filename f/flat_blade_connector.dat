50|$|A <b>blade</b> <b>connector</b> {{is a type}} {{of single}} wire {{connection}} using a <b>flat</b> conductive <b>blade</b> which is inserted into a blade receptacle. Usually both <b>blade</b> <b>connector</b> and <b>blade</b> receptacle have wires attached to them either through of the wire to the blade or crimping of the blade to the wire. In some cases the blade is an integral manufactured part of a component (such as a switch or a speaker unit), and a blade receptacle is pushed onto the blade to form a connection.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a set of}} experiments concerning the behavior of several types of impellers regarding the depression formatted and operating in a specific range of rotations. Various mixer designs including a four pitched blades impeller, a six <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller and four two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller were compared. Experimental data confirmed the analytical results previously obtained. The results showed that there are similarities regarding the effects generated by four pitched blades impeller {{and one of the}} two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller. Also, it is found that two shortblade impeller produces the lowest depression of all tested impeller. The maximum depression produced by all type of impellers do not exceeds 120 mmH 2 O at 400 rpm, which is a small value to realize the vaporization of the fluid and to reach the cavitation. The equipment is not in danger to be destroyed. The numerical results obtained by experiments can be used in various practical applications...|$|R

2500|$|Early axial {{compressors}} offered poor efficiency, so {{poor that}} in the early 1920s a number of papers claimed that a practical jet engine would be impossible to construct. Things changed after A. A. Griffith published a seminal paper in 1926, noting that the reason for the poor performance was that existing compressors used <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> and were essentially [...] "flying stalled". He showed that the use of airfoils instead of the <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> would increase efficiency to the point where a practical jet engine was a real possibility. He concluded the paper with a basic diagram of such an engine, which included a second turbine that was used to power a propeller.|$|R
