500|$|The missile's {{propulsion}} system consisted of four XLR35-RM-1 engines, built by Reaction Motors Inc., which produced 2,000 pounds-force (8,900 Newtons) each and could independently swivel {{up to ten}} degrees either direction. The <b>gimballing</b> motion was used to control the flight path of the missile, replacing {{the system of the}} V-2 missile that used moving fins placed within a fixed engine. The gimbal system adds complexity to the engine mounting but preserves more of the energy of the rocket exhaust during maneuvering. The engines had a specific impulse of [...] sea level.|$|E
50|$|Some designs include {{directional}} {{control of the}} exhaust. This {{can be accomplished by}} <b>gimballing</b> the nozzle, as in the Space Shuttle SRBs, by the use of jet vanes in the exhaust as in the V-2 rocket, or by liquid injection thrust vectoring (LITV).|$|E
50|$|The exhaust {{produced}} by the Hydrazine Gas Generator APUs {{on either side of}} Endeavour's tail fin created concern among some observers that something was amiss, as it appeared more pronounced than usual in NASA's visual light cameras. However, this exhaust is normal and expected. The three Hydrazine Gas Generator APUs are activated five minutes before the deorbit burn and are running for five minutes after wheels stop. The mono-propellant hydrazine changes phase due to a catalyst and reaches 1,700 °F (927 °C). The hydraulic power is needed for the shuttle's rudder/speed brake, elevons, body flap and landing gear during descent, and for the main engine nozzles' <b>gimballing</b> during ascent. Each of the Solid Rocket Boosters have two similar Hydrazine Gas Generators for their nozzle <b>gimballing.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{user input}} device for a {{vehicular}} electrical system is provided. The user input device includes a handle sized and shaped to be gripped by a human {{hand and a}} <b>gimbal</b> assembly within the handle. The <b>gimbal</b> assembly includes a first <b>gimbal</b> component, a second <b>gimbal</b> component coupled to the first <b>gimbal</b> component such that the second <b>gimbal</b> component is rotatable relative to the first <b>gimbal</b> component about a first axis, and a third <b>gimbal</b> component coupled to the second <b>gimbal</b> component such that the third <b>gimbal</b> component is rotatable relative to the second <b>gimbal</b> component about a second axis...|$|R
50|$|While {{only two}} {{specific}} orientations produce exact <b>gimbal</b> lock, practical mechanical <b>gimbals</b> encounter difficulties near those orientations. When {{a set of}} <b>gimbals</b> {{is close to the}} locked configuration, small rotations of the <b>gimbal</b> platform require large motions of the surrounding <b>gimbals.</b> Although the ratio is infinite only at the point of <b>gimbal</b> lock, the practical speed and acceleration limits of the <b>gimbals</b> limit the motion of the platform close to that point.|$|R
25|$|A {{gyroscope}} is a wheel {{mounted in}} two or three <b>gimbals,</b> which are a pivoted supports that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of three <b>gimbals,</b> one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost <b>gimbal</b> to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case of a gyroscope with two <b>gimbals,</b> the outer <b>gimbal,</b> which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer <b>gimbal</b> possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The inner <b>gimbal</b> is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer <b>gimbal)</b> so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer <b>gimbal).</b> This inner <b>gimbal</b> has two degrees of rotational freedom.|$|R
50|$|The URM-1 {{consists}} of a liquid oxygen tank at the top, followed by an intertank structure containing flight control and telemetry equipment, with the kerosene tank below that. At {{the base of the}} module is a propulsion bay containing engine <b>gimballing</b> equipment for vehicle pitch and yaw and thrusters for roll control.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} used as {{the second stage of}} both the PSLV and the GSLV launch vehicles, with four strap-on boosters. The engine is also capable of <b>gimballing.</b> The GSLV MK-3 rocket uses two Vikas engines in its L110 core stage. The {{propellant}} loading for GSLV Mk-3 vikas engines is 55 tons compared to 40 tons for regular GSLV Mk-2 and PSLV rockets.|$|E
50|$|The engine's {{development}} {{started in}} 2010 {{and it is}} a heavily modified version of the RD-0110. The main areas of work were shortening the nozzles to optimized them for the atmospheric part of the flight (the RD-0110 is a vacuum optimized engine), propellant piping, heat exchangers and the <b>gimballing</b> system, which was developed by TsSKB Progress. The RD-0110R engines is produced on the Voronezh Mechanical Plant.|$|E

In December 2016, <b>Gimbal,</b> Inc. {{was acquired}} by Santa Monica-based The Mobile Majority.

40|$|Comparing {{with the}} normal {{mechanical}} inertial stabilized platform (ISP), the novel ISP with magnetic bearing {{to suspend the}} yaw <b>gimbal</b> owns the ability of isolating the vibration and disturbance of external <b>gimbal.</b> However, on the one hand, complex structure of the magnetically suspended <b>gimbal</b> introduces parametric uncertainties into modeling of magnetic suspension force, and the disturbance of magnetic fields brings the unmodeled force into dynamics of magnetically suspended <b>gimbal.</b> On the other hand, external disturbances such as wind drag affect the stability of magnetically suspended <b>gimbal.</b> Therefore, H∞robust controllers for translation and tilting of <b>gimbal</b> are designed to dampen the negative influence on stability and improve the robustness of system. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} robust controller of magnetically suspended <b>gimbal</b> owns the excellent robustness when the load of magnetically suspended <b>gimbal</b> changes.

50|$|The {{third stage}} was powered by an RD-0210 engine and four vernier nozzles, with common systems. The verniers {{provided}} steering, {{eliminating the need}} for <b>gimballing</b> of the main engine. They also aided stage separation, and acted as ullage motors. Ducts built into the structure channelled vernier exhaust before stage separation. The third stage guidance system was also used to control the first and second stages earlier in flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{second stage}} uses a {{conventional}} cylindrical design. It {{is powered by}} 3 RD-0210 engine and 1 RD-0211 engine. The RD-0211 is {{a modified version of}} the RD-0210 used to pressurize the propellant tanks. The second stage is joined to the first stage through a net instead of a closed inter-stage, to allow the exhaust to escape because the second stage begins firing seconds before separation. Thrust vector control is provided by engine <b>gimballing.</b>|$|E
50|$|At MTF on December 1, 1966 North American Aviation {{conducted}} a successful 384-second captive firing of five J-2 engines, {{the first flight}} hydrogen-fueled engines, developing a total one million pounds of thrust. During the test, number 2 and 4 engine SLAM arms did not drop, resulting in the successful <b>gimballing</b> of engines 1 and 3 only. The test included the recording of about 800 measurements of the stage's performance, including propellant tank temperatures, engine temperatures, propellant flow rates, and vibrations.|$|E
50|$|This {{problem may}} be {{overcome}} by use of a fourth <b>gimbal,</b> intelligently driven by a motor so as to maintain a large angle between roll and yaw <b>gimbal</b> axes. Another solution is to rotate {{one or more of}} the <b>gimbals</b> to an arbitrary position when <b>gimbal</b> lock is detected and thus reset the device.|$|R
5000|$|A {{well-known}} <b>gimbal</b> lock incident {{happened in}} the Apollo 11 Moon mission. On this spacecraft, a set of <b>gimbals</b> was used on an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The engineers {{were aware of the}} <b>gimbal</b> lock problem but had declined to use a fourth <b>gimbal.</b> Some of the reasoning behind this decision is apparent from the following quote: ...|$|R
40|$|Derivation of CMG {{steering}} laws was considered. The type of CMG considered was {{a double}} <b>gimbal</b> one {{which has a}} constant magnitude momentum vector. The equations for the generation of torque of an inertially fixed CMG are presented. To realize a particular commanded torque, the <b>gimbal</b> rates of the CMG must be specified. These <b>gimbal</b> rates are shown to be functions of <b>gimbal</b> angle orientation and the commanded torque. The conventional cross-product steering law was derived by minimizing a function which was {{the square of the}} magnitude of the error between the commanded torque and the realizable torque of the gyro. This steering law was severely dependent upon the inner <b>gimbal</b> angle. When the inner <b>gimbal</b> reaches 90 degrees, the cross product law requires infinite outer <b>gimbal</b> rates to realize finite torque values...|$|R
50|$|Attitude {{control was}} {{provided}} by J-2 engine <b>gimballing</b> during powered flight and by the two APS modules during coast. The APS modules each contained four thrusters providing 150 pounds of thrust (three for roll, pitch, and yaw; one for ullage) and were fueled by a hypergolic mixture of dinitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine. They were used for three-axis control during coast phases, roll control during J-2 firings, and ullage for the second ignition of the J-2 engine and deorbit into the moon.|$|E
50|$|This new first-stage design {{would use}} four kerolox engines {{derived from the}} RD-120 used on {{the second stage of}} the Zenit. The {{standard}} RD-120, however, while manufactured in Ukraine, uses a number of Russian-made components which would have to be replaced with Ukrainian-made equivalents. It is also planned to fit each of these engines with a <b>gimballing</b> mechanism for steering (in the Zenit second stage the RD-120 is fixed to the frame while an RD-8 four-nozzle vernier engine takes care of the steering).|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{modelling}} and control of three axis camera pan-roll-tilt unit (<b>gimbal)</b> which {{was meant to be}} attached to a multi rotor platform for aerial photography. The goal of the thesis was to develop a control structure for steering and active gyro stabilization of the <b>gimbal,</b> with aid from a mathematical model of the <b>gimbal.</b> Lagrange equations, together with kinematic equations and data from CAD drawings, were used to calculate a dynamics model of the <b>gimbal.</b> This model was set up as a Simulink simulation environment. Code for sensor reading and actuator control was written to the <b>gimbal’s</b> microprocessor and the code for the control structure in the <b>gimbal</b> was developed in parallel with a control structure in the simulation environment. The thesis resulted in a method for mathematical modelling of the <b>gimbal</b> and a control structure, for steering and active gyro stabilization of the <b>gimbal,</b> implemented in its control unit {{as well as in the}} simulation environmen...|$|R

50|$|Later, Stover meets <b>Gimbal,</b> who openly proclaims a plan {{to fight}} the society system. <b>Gimbal</b> is also open about looking for {{political}} leadership with his anti-society stance. The two shake hands, but Stover is uncertain {{what to make of}} <b>Gimbal.</b>|$|R
50|$|LESS {{attitude}} control varied widely among designs. Some used the main engine for {{attitude control}} by <b>gimballing</b> the engine nozzle {{to alter the}} direction of thrust. Others had multiple engines and could use relative throttling or pulse-rate to vary the thrust from the different engines and control attitude that way. A few used cold gas RCS thrusters where high-pressure gas (typically nitrogen) was released from nozzles to provide {{a small amount of}} thrust without endangering the crew with hot gas from a rocket thruster. Most provided the pilot with a simple control stick arrangement which would automatically adjust attitude based on pilot input.|$|E
50|$|The Antares 100-series {{first stage}} was powered by two Aerojet AJ26 engines. These began as Kuznetsov NK-33 engines {{built in the}} Soviet Union in the late 1960s and early 1970s, 43 of which were {{purchased}} by Aerojet in the 1990s. 20 of these were refurbished into AJ26 engines for Antares. Modifications included equipping the engines for <b>gimballing,</b> adding US electronics, and qualifying the engines to fire for {{twice as long as}} designed and to operate at 108% of their original thrust. Together they produced 3265 kN of thrust at sea level and 3630 kN in vacuum.|$|E
50|$|The Space Shuttle APUs {{provided}} hydraulic pressure. The Space Shuttle {{had three}} redundant APUs, powered by hydrazine fuel. They were only powered up for ascent, re-entry, and landing. During ascent, the APUs provided hydraulic power for <b>gimballing</b> of the Shuttle's three engines {{and control of}} their large valves, and for movement of the control surfaces. During landing, they moved the control surfaces, lowered the wheels, and powered the brakes and nose-wheel steering. Landing could be accomplished with only one APU working.In {{the early years of}} the Shuttle there were problems with APU reliability, with malfunctions on three of the first nine Shuttle missions.|$|E
40|$|The <b>gimbal</b> {{system is}} {{described}} {{that was designed}} to mount the thruster and to reposition the thrust vector of a mercury ion bombardment thruster through the center of gravity of the SERT 2 assembly. The SERT 2 assembly was launched 3 February 1970. The <b>gimbal</b> ring, <b>gimbal</b> mounts, bearings, actuators, and environmental testing are described.

5000|$|... c. Platform <b>gimbals</b> are the {{assemblies}} {{which actually}} keep the platform accelerometers stable and enable the airplane to maneuver about the gyro-stabilized earth-oriented platform. The LN3-2A platform is a four-gimbal system (outer roll, pitch, inner roll and azimuth) allowing the airplane 360 degrees of rotation in all directions. The azimuth, pitch and outer roll <b>gimbals</b> use sliprings and brushes for electrical contacts to allow unlimited freedom. The inner roll <b>gimbal</b> provides a built-in redundancy {{to prevent a}} <b>gimbal</b> lock situation when the azimuth and outer roll <b>gimbal</b> axes become aligned at 90 degrees of pitch.|$|R
40|$|A {{steering}} law {{is presented}} which {{has all the}} features required for space applications, assuming the CMG outer <b>gimbal</b> freedom is unlimited. The reason {{is the idea of}} mounting all the outer <b>gimbal</b> axes of the CMGs parallel to each other. This allows the decomposition of the steering law problem into a linear one for the inner <b>gimbal</b> angle rates and a planar one for the outer <b>gimbal</b> angle rates. The inner <b>gimbal</b> angle rates are calculated first, since they are not affected by the outer <b>gimbal</b> angle rates. For the calculation of the outer rates, the inner rates are then known quantities. An outer <b>gimbal</b> angle distribution function (to avoid singularities internal to the total angular momentum envelope) generates distribution rates next, and finally the pseudoinverse method is used to insure that the desired total torque is delivered...|$|R
5000|$|The initial pitch {{program is}} an {{open-loop}} system subject to errors from winds, thrust variations, etc. To maintain zero {{angle of attack}} during atmospheric flight, these errors are not corrected until reaching space. Then a more sophisticated closed-loop guidance program can take over to correct trajectory deviations and attain the desired orbit. In the Apollo missions, the transition to closed-loop guidance took place early in second stage flight after maintaining a fixed inertial attitude while jettisoning the first stage and interstage ring. [...] Because the upper stages of a rocket operate in a near vacuum, fins are ineffective. Steering relies entirely on engine <b>gimballing</b> and a reaction control system.|$|E
50|$|For {{the true}} 'seat of the pants' feeling, however, the {{simplest}} designs had no {{attitude control system}} at all. Instead the pilot would stand during the flight, and simply lean backwards, forwards or side-to-side to move {{the center of gravity}} relative to the center of thrust of the fixed engine. As a result the offset thrust would cause the LESS to rotate until the astronaut returned to a neutral position and the center of gravity was again aligned with the engine thrust. Ultimately, however, this was considered to be less desirable than hardware control, particularly as it imposed significant constraints on vehicle thrust level and inertia... adding <b>gimballing</b> or relative engine throttling might actually simplify the design.|$|E
5000|$|The gravity turn {{trajectory}} is {{most commonly}} used during early ascent. The guidance program is a precalculated lookup table of pitch vs time. Control is done with engine <b>gimballing</b> and/or aerodynamic control surfaces. The pitch program maintains a zero angle of attack (the definition of a gravity turn) until the vacuum of space is reached, thus minimizing lateral aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. (Excessive aerodynamic loads can quickly destroy the vehicle.) Although the preprogrammed pitch schedule is adequate for some applications, an adaptive inertial guidance system that determines location, orientation and velocity with accelerometers and gyroscopes, is almost always employed on modern rockets. The British satellite launcher Black Arrow {{was an example of}} a rocket that flew a preprogrammed pitch schedule, making no attempt to correct for errors in its trajectory, while the Apollo-Saturn rockets used [...] "closed loop" [...] inertial guidance after the gravity turn through the atmosphere.|$|E
