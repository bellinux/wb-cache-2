40|$|ABSTRACT The {{insertion}} of axonally transported fucosyl glycoproteins into the axolemma of regenerating nerve sprouts was examined in rat sciatic motor axons at intervals after nerve crush. [3 H]Fucose was {{injected into the}} lumbar ventral horns and the nerves were removed at intervals between 1 and 14 d after labeling. To follow {{the fate of the}} "pulse-labeled" glycoproteins, we examined the nerves by correlative radiometric and EM radioautographic approaches. The results showed, first, that rapidly transported [3 H]fucosyl glycoproteins were inserted into the axolemma of regenerating sprouts as well as parent axons. At 1 d after delivery, in addition to the substantial mobile fraction of radioactivity still undergoing bidirectional transport within the axon, a fraction of label was already associated with the axolemma. Insertion of labeled glycoproteins into the sprout axolemma appeared to occur all {{along the length of the}} regenerating sprouts, not just in sprout terminals. Once <b>inserted,</b> <b>labeled</b> glycoproteins did not undergo extensive redistribution, nor did they appear in sprout regions that formed (as a result of continued outgrowth) after their insertion. The amount of radioactivity in the regenerating nerves decreased with time, in part as a result of removal o...|$|R
