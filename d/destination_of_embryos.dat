40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} attitudes towards the donation <b>of</b> surplus <b>embryos</b> among couples with cryopreserved embryos/zygotes, and to identify correlates associated with attitudes toward the <b>destinations</b> <b>of</b> surplus embryos/zygotes. METHODS: Eleven of 19 Swiss in vitro fertilization (IVF) centers in existence in 2004 participated in the survey. Questionnaires were sent to 888 eligible couples; 458 men (52 %) and 468 women (53 %) returned them. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of the participants supported the donation <b>of</b> surplus <b>embryos</b> to other couples, but divided opinions on the disclosure of biological parents' identities were identified. About 70 % of participants indicated that donations <b>of</b> surplus <b>embryos</b> for medical research or therapy should be allowed, following strict regulations. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed couples' position on the moral status <b>of</b> an <b>embryo</b> as the strongest predictor of attitudes toward all <b>destinations</b> <b>of</b> surplus <b>embryos.</b> Having children due to IVF/Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) treatment was negatively associated with attitudes towards donations to other couples. Perceived importance of religion, age < 40, being a resident of the French-speaking region and unsuccessful IVF/ICSI treatment experiences were predictive of supporting donations for medical research. CONCLUSIONS: Swiss couples with cryopreserved embryos/zygotes are open to different options related to donating, rather than discarding, surplus embryos...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{response}} to McLeod and Baylis (2007) who speculate on the dangers of requesting fresh ‘spare’ embryos from IVF patients for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research, particularly when those embryos are good enough to be transferred back to the woman. They argue that these embryos should be frozen instead. We explore what is meant by ‘spare’ embryos. We then provide empirical evidence, from a study <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> donation and <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> donors' views, to substantiate some of their speculations about the problems associated with requesting fresh embryos. However, we also question whether such problems are resolved by embryo freezing, since further empirical evidence suggests that this raises other social and ethical problems for patients. There is little evidence that the request for embryos for research, in itself, causes patients distress. We suggest, however, that no requests for fresh embryos should be made in the first cycle of IVF treatment. Deferring the request to a later cycle ensures that potential donors are better informed (by experience and reflection) about the possible <b>destinations</b> <b>of</b> their <b>embryos</b> and about the definition of ‘spare embryos’. Both this article, and that by McLeod and Baylis, emphasize the need to consider the views and experiences <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> donors when evaluating the ethics <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> donation for hESC research...|$|R

40|$|Embryo {{transfer}} and pregnancy maintenance strategies in pigs were evaluated {{with reference to}} situations in which limited numbers <b>of</b> viable <b>embryos</b> or micromanipulated embryos are available, such as pig cloning. Development <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> with compromised zona pellucida was compared with development <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> with intact zona pellucida. Micromanipulation {{had no effect on}} blastocyst production rates after development in vivo or in vitro, but development in vivo improved the number <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> reaching the blastocyst stage. Transfer <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> with compromised zona pellucida resulted in live piglets. Several hormone treatments to maintain pregnancy were tested in a model in which three embryos were transferred into unmated recipient gilts, compared with transfer <b>of</b> three <b>embryos</b> into mated recipients. None of the hormonal treatments resulted in pregnancy rates of more than 25 % at term and no more than 9 % <b>of</b> transferred <b>embryos</b> survived, in comparison with 50 % of the mated recipients successfully carrying 25 % <b>of</b> transferred <b>embryos.</b> Lastly, the developmental potential <b>of</b> parthenogenetic <b>embryos</b> was assessed and 62 % <b>of</b> transferred <b>embryos</b> resulted in pregnancies, none of which continued beyond day 55 of gestation. After co-transfer <b>of</b> three fertilized <b>embryos</b> with 55 - 60 parthenogenetic <b>embryos</b> into each <b>of</b> six recipients, two live piglets were delivered. The results from the present study indicate that transfer of zona pellucida compromised embryos can yield litters of normal piglets. In addition, it was demonstrated in a model system involving the transfer <b>of</b> three fertilized <b>embryos</b> into mature gilts that hormonal pregnancy maintenance strategies support a low proportion <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> to term.

This study compared the number, quality, and in vitro development <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> recovered from gilts following single or double estrus synchronization and superovulation. Prepubertal gilts from the single synchronization group were injected with 1500 I. U. PMSG and 1000 I. U. hCG 72 h later. The double synchronized group of gilts was treated with 750 I. U. PMSG and 500 I. U. hCG 72 h later. After 17 days, 1500 I. U. PMSG followed by 1000 I. U. hCG was administered. Five days after insemination embryos were recovered and cultured for 6 days. Both single and double hormonal stimulation schedules resulted in recovery of elevated numbers <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> (28. 4 and 23. 4 vs. 11. 3; p< 0. 01 and p≤ 0. 05, respectively) with a higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> classified as degenerated (39. 2 % and 43. 1 %, respectively) compared to the non-stimulated, control group (5. 1 %). The number <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> destined for culture did not differ between the single and double synchronized groups. The highest percentage <b>of</b> hatched <b>embryos</b> was observed in the control group.

The model was somewhat effective in that we found a relative increase of 30 % for implantation in the model-selected group <b>of</b> <b>embryos.</b> There was, however, a concomitant large rejection <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> from our test cohort, which actually resulted in pregnancy.

40|$|Antisense RNA to the 27 / 32 -kDa rat liver gap {{junction}} (GJ) protein {{was used to}} explore the role of GJs in preimplantation embryos. When all blastomeres of two- and four-cell embryos were injected with GJ antisense RNA, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> compacted at 60 hr of development was reduced to less than 20 %, while 90 % <b>of</b> uninjected <b>embryos</b> and 75 % <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> injected with an unrelated RNA were compacted. When most cells <b>of</b> compacted eight-cell <b>embryos</b> were injected with the GJ antisense RNA, 20 % <b>of</b> the <b>embryos</b> were decompacted and only 5 % had developed to the blastocyst stage at 90 hr, when blastulation had occurred in 90 % <b>of</b> the control <b>embryos.</b> When antisense RNA was injected in one blastomere <b>of</b> four-cell <b>embryos,</b> 40 % <b>of</b> the <b>embryos</b> presented a large cell that {{was not included in}} the compacted embryo at the time of compaction, and an additional 30 % <b>of</b> the <b>embryos</b> had two smaller, excluded blastomeres.

40|$|The {{biological}} significance <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> {{mortality in}} demersally spawning coral reef fishes is poorly understood. Here we describe patterns <b>of</b> variation in <b>embryo</b> mortality in Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae) at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef). The {{aim was to}} determine whether numbers <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> hatched substantially differed from egg production, and if so, identify whether predatory fishes were a source <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> mortality. Spawning success (number <b>of</b> eggs laid), <b>embryo</b> mortality (proportion <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> that died prior to hatching) and number <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> hatching were estimated from daily maps of clutches laid on artificial surfaces (PVC tiles) defended by nesting males. Patterns of variation in eggs laid, embryo mortality and numbers <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> hatched were examined at three spatial scales: (1) among widely-spaced locations around the island; (2) between adjacent reef slope and patch reef habitats occupied by P. amboinensis at a single location; and (3) among different males within these two habitats. The embryo mortality was extremely high, with a mean of 25. 9 pm ± 6. 2 % (S. E.) for 4 locations examined in 1994 and a mean of 69. 2 pm ± 2. 9 % for two habitats surveyed in 1995. There {{were no significant differences in}} embryo mortality among locations or habitats in either year. This meant that spatial patterns in the number <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> hatching reflected differences in the number of eggs laid on tiles. Embryo mortality was extremely variable on the scale of individual territories, with embryo mortality commonly ranging from 0 % to 100 %. Much of the mortality could be attributed to diurnal predatory fishes, especially the wrasse Thalassoma lunare. However, variation in predator densities did not explain spatial patterns in embryo mortality rates. Both solitary and group predatory behaviour was observed, with groups often causing 100 % embryo mortality. The level <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> mortality observed suggests that predation prior to hatching may have a substantial effect on the reproductive output of populations of this demersal-nesting fish...|$|R
