2500|$|For instance, the <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer</b> {{produces}} harmonics {{that adds}} complexity in applications where spectral {{purity of the}} VCO signal is important. [...] The resulting unwanted (spurious) sidebands, also called [...] "reference spurs" [...] can dominate the filter requirements and reduce the capture range well below and/or increase the lock time beyond the requirements. [...] In these applications the more complex digital phase detectors are used which do not have as severe a reference spur component on their output. Also, when in lock, the steady-state phase difference at the inputs using this type of phase detector is near 90 degrees. The actual difference {{is determined by the}} DC loop gain.|$|E
2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion {{superheterodyne}} receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer</b> does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, a mixer, or <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer,</b> is a {{nonlinear}} {{electrical circuit}} that creates new frequencies from two signals applied to it. In its most common application, two signals {{are applied to}} a mixer, and it produces new signals at the sum and difference of the original frequencies. Other frequency components may also be produced in a practical <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Carrier leakage is {{interference}} {{caused by}} cross-talk or a DC offset. It is present as an unmodulated sine wave within the signal's bandwidth, whose amplitude {{is independent of}} the signal's amplitude. See <b>frequency</b> <b>mixers,</b> to read further about carrier leakage or local oscillator feedthrough.|$|R
50|$|LC {{circuits}} {{are used}} either for generating signals {{at a particular}} frequency, or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal; this function is called a bandpass filter. They are key components in many electronic devices, particularly radio equipment, used in circuits such as oscillators, filters, tuners and <b>frequency</b> <b>mixers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Subharmonic mixers (a {{particular}} form of harmonic mixer where the LO is provided at a sub multiple of the frequency to be mixed with the incoming signal) are often used in direct-digital, or zero IF, communications system in order to eliminate the unwanted effects of LO self-mixing which occurs in many fundamental <b>frequency</b> <b>mixers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Mixers {{are widely}} used to shift signals from one {{frequency}} range to another, {{a process known as}} heterodyning, for convenience in transmission or further signal processing.

50|$|Frequency {{converter}} {{may also}} {{refer to a}} much-lower-powered circuit that converts radio frequency signals at one frequency to another frequency, especially in a Superheterodyne receiver. See <b>Frequency</b> <b>mixer.</b> The circuit usually consists of a local oscillator and <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer</b> (analog multiplier) that generates sum and difference frequencies from the input and local oscillator, of which one (the Intermediate frequency) will be required for further amplification, while the others are filtered out. The same result was achieved historically by the pentagrid converter or a Triode and Hexode in a single tube, but can be implemented in transistor radios economically by a single transistor functioning as a self-oscillating mixer.|$|E

It is also used in electrical engineering to model intermodulation distortion in many devices including power amplifiers and <b>frequency</b> <b>mixers.</b> Its main advantage lies in its generality: it can represent a wide range of systems. Thus it is sometimes considered a non-parametric model. [...] In mathematics, a Volterra series denotes a functional expansion of a dynamic, nonlinear, time-invariant functional.

40|$|Mixers are classic This month’s {{tutorial}} is RF/microwave a first {{introduction to}} the circuits that mathematical principles that describe the operation {{make it possible to}} translate RF signals from one of <b>frequency</b> <b>mixers</b> <b>frequency</b> to another. Ideally, they implement this frequency change with no effect on the amplitude and frequency components of the signal’s modulation. <b>Frequency</b> Translation <b>Mixers</b> are nonlinear circuits; they rely on near-perfect nonlinearity. This sounds like a contradiction, but it means that perfect switching—discontinuity being the ultimate nonlinearity—will result in ideal mixer behavior. We will describe how this switching takes place in a circuit later on, but first let’s review the overall behavior of the mixing process. Nonlinear response creates new signals where none previously existed. In the case of two unmodulated signals applied to the input of a nonlinear device, there will be a series of output signals that contain multiples of the input signals (harmonics), plus sums and differences of ALL signals, fundamental and harmonic, as described by [1]: f out = |nf...|$|R

50|$|Also, the {{animation}} contains both up- and down-converted spectra, which {{is due to}} a <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer</b> producing both sum and difference frequencies. The local oscillator feedthrough is due to the imperfect isolation from the IF signal path in the mixer.|$|E
50|$|A phase {{detector}} or phase comparator is a <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer,</b> analog multiplier or logic circuit that generates a voltage signal {{which represents the}} difference in phase between two signal inputs. It is {{an essential element of}} the phase-locked loop (PLL).|$|E
50|$|The classic <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer</b> is a multiplier. Multiplying two sinewaves {{produces}} {{just the}} sum and difference frequencies; the input frequencies are suppressed, and, in theory, {{there are no}} other heterodyne products. In practice, the multiplier is not perfect, and the input frequencies and other heterodyne products will be present.|$|E
50|$|Frequency {{multipliers}} {{have much}} in common with <b>frequency</b> <b>mixers,</b> and some of the same nonlinear devices are used for both: transistors operated in Class C and diodes. In transmitting circuits many of the amplifying devices (vacuum tubes or transistors) operate nonlinearly and create harmonics, so an amplifier stage can be made a multiplier by tuning the tuned circuit at the output to a multiple of the input frequency. Usually the power (gain) produced by the nonlinear device drops off rapidly at the higher harmonics, so most frequency multipliers just double or triple the frequency, and multiplication by higher factors is accomplished by cascading doubler and tripler stages.|$|R

50|$|By contrast, {{in what is}} {{generally}} considered to be a true analog multiplier, the two signal inputs have identical characteristics. Applications specific to a true analog multiplier are those where both inputs are signals, for example in a <b>frequency</b> <b>mixer</b> or an analog circuit to implement a discrete Fourier transform.|$|E
50|$|In more {{complicated}} transmitters which are called superheterodyne, the information signal modulates an intermediate frequency (IF) signal.

Superheterodyne transmitters are more complex than direct modulation transmitters.|$|E
50|$|A product {{detector}} {{is a type}} of demodulator used for AM and SSB signals.
