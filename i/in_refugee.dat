5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nablus {{came under}} Jordanian control. Thousands of Palestinian {{refugees}} fleeing from areas captured by Israel arrived in Nablus, settling <b>in</b> <b>refugee</b> camps {{in and around}} the city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. The 1967 Six-Day War ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Sudan, {{religion}} {{is an issue}} with growing the game. Most footballers wanting to play are required to wear the hijab and play while fully covered. While football was organised inside the country with 440 men's clubs in 2006, and the first ever women's game being played {{in the country that}} year in February between Tahadi and Sudan University at Sports’ City, Sudan University, development was hindered because a fatwa by the Fiqh Council of Islamic in 2006 condemning the creation of a women's league in Sudan. Still, in the South Sudan in 2006, the local government was indicating their support of women's football. By 2009, women's football programmes had been established in the Sudan. That year, there were ten senior women's teams, a school-based competition and a regional competition established. Young girls informally play the game <b>in</b> <b>refugee</b> camps in the Darfur region. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by Al Jazeera.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{present a}} review of the {{literature}} concerning medically unexplained physical symptoms <b>in</b> <b>refugees.</b> Methods We outline a variety of definitions and explanations of somatization, as well as the role of culture in the concept of disease. In addition, we present {{a review of}} the epidemiological literature about somatization <b>in</b> <b>refugees.</b> Results Refugees from non-Western countries exhibit more unexplained somatic symptoms than the general Western population. Although different studies have employed different methodologies and are therefore difficult to compare, it can be concluded that refugees form a particular population in which somatization is prominent. Conclusions Potential, not mutually exclusive, explanations of the high number of somatic symptoms <b>in</b> the <b>refugee</b> population include general psychopathology, specifically traumatisation, results of torture, and stigmatisation of psychiatric care. There are implications for assessment, clinical treatment and further research concerning somatization <b>in</b> <b>refugees...</b>|$|R
5|$|The city {{population}} {{is composed of}} people from virtually every region of Bangladesh. The long-standing inhabitants {{of the old city}} are known as Dhakaia and have a distinctive dialect and culture. Between 15,000 and 20,000 of the Rohingya, Santal, Khasi, Garo, Chakma and Mandi tribal peoples reside in the city. Dhaka also has a large population of European, Chinese, Korean, Indian, Pakistani, Nepali, Burmese and Sri Lankan expatriates working in executive jobs in different industries. Dhaka is also home to over 300,000 Bihari refugees, who are descendants of migrant Muslims from eastern India during 1947 and settled down in East Pakistan. The correct {{population is}} ambiguous; although official figures estimate at least 40,000 residents, it is estimated that there are at least 300,000 Urdu-speakers in all of Bangladesh, mostly residing <b>in</b> <b>refugee</b> camps in Dhaka.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{was also}} expected to re-strengthen prior to its second landfall in Mexico, though the Weather Bureau also noted {{that there was a}} chance for the storm to affect Texas. Although the possibility never materialized, the agency expected rain bands and rough seas to affect southern Texas, and small watercraft were urged to remain in ports until the hurricane moved inland. On August 21, the cyclone was expected to move ashore between Nautla and Tuxpan, though it eventually made landfall further north near Tampico. Local officials expressed concerns about residents in huts and other vulnerable structures. In the Harlingen Valley region of southern Texas, precautionary measures were taken and Red Cross divisions organized a meeting at the local city hall. City departments and facilities were ready for disposal if the cyclone moved closer to the area. The cyclone's rains were {{also expected to}} impact unpicked cotton plants in the region. In advance of the storm, a Coast Guard plane dropped messages from the air to several vessels, advising them to seek shelter. In Tampico, oil industries erected barriers to protect fields, and authorities planned to evacuate residents from the surrounding low-lying areas. Thousands of residents stayed <b>in</b> <b>refugee</b> centers on elevated ground.|$|E

40|$|Background: Asylum seekers and {{refugees}} have been {{claimed to be}} at increased risk of developing complex posttraumatic stress disorder (complex PTSD). Consequently, it has been recommended that refugees be treated with present-centred or phased treatment rather than stand-alone trauma-focused treatment. This recommendation has contributed to a clinical practice of delaying or waiving trauma-focused treatment <b>in</b> <b>refugees</b> with PTSD. Objective: The aim of this debate piece is to defend two theses: (1) that complex trauma leads to complex PTSD in a minority of refugees only and (2) that trauma-focused treatment should be offered to all refugees who seek treatment for PTSD. Methods: The first thesis is defended by comparing data on the prevalence of complex PTSD <b>in</b> <b>refugees</b> to those <b>in</b> other trauma-exposed populations, using studies derived from a systematic review. The second thesis is defended using conclusions of systematic reviews and a meta-analysis of the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatment <b>in</b> <b>refugees.</b> Results: Research shows that refugees {{are more likely to}} meet a regular PTSD diagnosis or no diagnosis than a complex PTSD diagnosis and that prevalence of complex PTSD <b>in</b> <b>refugees</b> is relatively low compared to that in survivors of childhood trauma. Effect sizes for trauma-focused treatment <b>in</b> <b>refugees,</b> especially narrative exposure therapy (NET) and culturally adapted cognitive-behaviour therapy (CA-CBT), have consistently been found to be high. Conclusions: Complex PTSD <b>in</b> <b>refugees</b> should not be assumed to be present on the basis of complex traumatic experiences but should be carefully diagnosed using a validated interview. In line with treatment guidelines for PTSD, a course of trauma-focused treatment should be offered to all refugees seeking treatment for PTSD, including asylum seekers...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to determine 25 [OH]D serum levels <b>in</b> <b>refugees</b> <b>in</b> Italy. In the following research we have taken into consideration {{the results of the}} monitoring of Vitamin D levels <b>in</b> 46 <b>refugees</b> of the Italian Service for protection of refugees and asylum seekers (SPRAR) system. The indicator of overall vitamin D status used was the circulating serum level of 25 (OH) D. Data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel. <b>In</b> the <b>refugees</b> tested, the mean level of 25 (OH) D resulted 9. 18 ng/mL. The standard deviation was 4. 8, with a minimal level of 4. 3 and a maximum of 27. 4. This figure indicates a clear condition of hypovitaminosis <b>in</b> <b>refugees.</b> While it is general assumption that migratory phenomena may induce the spread of tropical or infectious diseases, widely attested literature demonstrates how chronic pathologies and diseases related to altered lifestyles are the most relevant for Italian case records. Indeed, among the aforementioned diseases, Vitamin D deficiency so far lacks acknowledgement at a national level. Considering the results of lower-than-desirable vitamin D levels found <b>in</b> <b>refugees</b> <b>in</b> Italy, it is necessary to take this parameter into consideration when analyzing individuals who have faced migratory phenomena in order to mitigate the effects of hypovitaminosis D...|$|R
