30|$|The Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials (ASTM [2012]) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} referenced methods for fire testing of CFS assemblages.

40|$|In recent times, {{fire has}} become a major {{disaster}} in buildings due to the increase in fire loads, as a result of modern furniture and light weight construction. This has caused problems for safe evacuation and rescue activities, and in some instances lead to the collapse of buildings (Lewis, 2008 and Nyman, 2002). Recent research has shown that the actual fire resistance of building elements exposed to building fires can be less than their specified fire resistance rating (Lennon and Moore, 2003, Jones, 2002, Nyman, 2002 and Abecassis-Empis et al. 2008). Conventionally the fire rating of building elements is determined using fire tests based on the standard <b>fire</b> time-temperature <b>curve</b> given in ISO 834. This ISO 834 curve was developed in the early 1900 s, where wood was the basic fuel source. In reality, modern buildings make use of thermoplastic materials, synthetic foams and fabrics. These materials are high in calorific values and increase both the speed of fire growth and heat release rate, thus increasing the fire severity beyond that of the standard <b>fire</b> <b>curve.</b> Hence it suggests the need to use realistic <b>fire</b> time-temperature <b>curves</b> in tests.

The <b>fire</b> <b>curve</b> which has been used is based on a pool fire with a three meter diameter and a height of 2. 5 cm. Using the mass burning rate and rate of heat release the maximum power emitted by the liquid can be calculated. After having run the CFD calculation which took about four days per scenario the results of the temperatures in the steel had been formulated. Having used a CFD calculation the results of this calculation were to be checked by a reference tool. Arcelor Mittal has created a software package called Ozone. Having entered the same compartment and <b>fire</b> <b>curve</b> as had been done in the CFD simulation the results can be compared to each other. The results and the comparison of the two simulations have been evaluated in chapter 6. 4. Focussing on the load bearing capacity of the column chapter seven investigates the maximum stress which the cross section can endure in a fire situation. Please note that this chapter only checks the strength of the column at raised temperature and omits any phenomena of instability. As the temperatures have been calculated by CFD and are thus known we can distinguish two cases.

Secondly the case in which the highest temperature difference occurs in the cross section.

Temperature profile was recorded at 3 depths within the slabs and the moisture content was also measured before and after the tests. The deflection of the slabs was recorded at the middle of the 3 meters span. The second part of the paper represents a Finite Element Modelling of the slabs using DIANA software. The concrete slabs were modelled including the embedded reinforcement to conduct a non-linear transient structural analysis taking into account cracks appearance and creep. A comparison between the experimental and the FEM results is presented in the paper...|$|R
