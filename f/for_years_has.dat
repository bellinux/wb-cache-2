5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted {{the presence of}} monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> <b>has</b> seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Ripley {{makes her}} way back to Ricardo, who {{explains}} that the Working Joes, the station's service androids, abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. He also tells her that Samuels is attempting to interface with the station's controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, APOLLO's defensive countermeasures electrocute Samuels shortly after he managed to open a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. Upon reaching APOLLO, Ripley discovers that Seegson, who has been trying to sell off Sevastopol <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> <b>has</b> finally found a buyer: Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien. When Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, it refuses due to an unidentified presence within the station's reactor. Ripley arrives there and discovers that it has been converted into an alien nest. She then initiates a reactor purge to destroy the nest, but some aliens manage to escape and begin to overrun Sevastopol. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent by Weyland-Yutani to retrieve the alien, and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crosses her and takes her hostage aboard the Anesidora.|$|E

2500|$|All of Audioslave's lyrics {{were written}} by Cornell, whilst all four members were {{credited}} with writing the music. Their songwriting process was described by Wilk as [...] "more collaborative" [...] and [...] "satisfying" [...] than Rage Against the Machine's, which was [...] "a battle creatively". Cornell, for his part, saw Soundgarden's songwriting method as inferior to Audioslave's. Cornell's lyrics were mostly apolitical; Audioslave's Morello referred to them as [...] "haunted, existential poetry." [...] They were characterized by his cryptic approach, often dealing with themes of existentialism, love, hedonism, spirituality and Christianity. Cornell's battle with addiction to prescription drugs and alcoholism was a defining factor in the writing and recording process. Even though the singer admitted that he was [...] "never able to write effectively" [...] while drinking, and attended rehab after recording the debut album, Morello stated that Revelations was [...] "the first record [...] didn't smoke, drink or take drugs through the recording."

2500|$|In August 1946, Cowles {{was hired}} as the head {{basketball}} coach at the University of Michigan, succeeding Bennie Oosterbaan. [...] Upon hiring Cowles, Michigan's athletic director Fritz Crisler said, [...] "In recommending Mr. Cowles, I feel that we are very fortunate.

[...] The following year, he led the 1947–48 Michigan Wolverines to a 16–6 (.727) record. [...] The team won the 1948 Big Ten Conference championship. [...] In February 1948, as Cowles led the Wolverines to a turnaround season, the press focused on Cowles' success in Ann Arbor. [...] The Toledo Blade sports editor wrote:"Win, lose or draw in the red hot scramble for the Western Conference basketball title, the University of Michigan team has done so surprisingly well this season that Coach Ozzie Cowles is getting as much applause on the Ann Arbor campus as came to Fritz Crisler after the football season.
