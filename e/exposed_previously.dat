30|$|At this point, one {{reservation}} {{should be}} made about the classic differentiation between chronic and acute hyponatremia, in terms of risk of OD. Although there is undeniable evidence (as <b>exposed</b> <b>previously)</b> that patients with chronic hyponatremia face {{a higher risk of}} OD, from a clinical standpoint this distinction is questionable, as the exact onset of hyponatremia is seldom readily available [241]. One of the better means to prevent OD is to limit the occurrence of hyponatremia. In the ICU setting special attention should be paid to ill-motivated prescription of hypotonic fluids, especially in the post-operative setting.|$|E

In investigating how Native American, through the use of indigenous media, have been working to access a self-representation which would grant them control over their own images and narratives, it is critical to start the analysis by studying the re-appropriation of traditional media by the same people who were for so long the ‘victims’ of institutions like Hollywood, through an examination of {{what is known as the}} ‘fourth cinema’.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that melatonin inhibits nitrate tolerance in coronary arteries. Rings of porcine coronary arteries were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Nitrate tolerance was induced by incubating the tissues with nitroglycerin (10 − 4 M) for 90 min, followed by repeated rinsing for 1 h. Control rings that had not been <b>exposed</b> <b>previously</b> to nitroglycerin, but were otherwise treated identically, were studied simultaneously. The rings were contracted with U 46619 (1 – 3 × 10 − 9 M) and concentration–response curves to nitroglycerin (10 − 9 – 10 − 4 M) were obtained. Nitrate tolerance was evident by a 15 - to 20 -fold rightward shift in the concentration–response curve to nitroglycerin in rings with and without endothelium <b>exposed</b> <b>previously</b> to the drug for 90 min. Addition of melatonin (10 − 9 – 10 − 7 M) to the organ chamber during the 90 -min incubation period with nitroglycerin partially inhibited nitrate tolerance in coronary arteries with intact endothelium; however, melatonin had no effect on nitrate tolerance in coronary arteries without endothelium. The effect of melatonin on nitrate tolerance in coronary arteries with endothelium was abolished by the melatonin receptor antagonist, S 20928 (10 − 6 M). In contrast to melatonin, the selective MT 3 -melatonin receptor agonist, 5 -MCA-NAT (10 − 8 – 10 − 7 M), had no effect on nitrate tolerance in coronary arteries. The results demonstrate that melatonin, acting via specific melatonin receptors, inhibits nitrate tolerance in coronary arteries and that this effect is dependent on the presence of the vascular endothelium...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that there are many effects of climate change on aeroallergens and thus allergic diseases in humans. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration acts as a fertilizer for plant growth. The fertilizing effects of carbon dioxide, as well as increased temperatures from climate change, increase pollen production and the allergen content of pollen grains. In addition, higher temperatures are changing the timing and duration of the pollen season. As regional climates change, plants can move into new areas and changes in atmospheric circulation can blow pollen- and spore-containing dust to new areas, thus introducing people to allergens to which they have not been <b>exposed</b> <b>previously.</b> Climate change also influences the concentrations of airborne pollutants, which alone, and in conjunction with aeroallergens, can exacerbate asthma or other respiratory illnesses. The few epidemiological analyses of meteorological factors, aeroallergens, and allergic diseases demonstrate the pathways through which climate can exert its influence on aeroallergens and allergic diseases. In addition to the need for more research, there is the imperative to take preventive and adaptive actions to address the onset and exacerbation of allergic diseases associated with climate variability and change...|$|E

The effect of glucose on intestinal secretion induced by heat stable and heat labile Escherichia coli entero-toxin, cholera toxin and theophylline was examined {{in both the}} proximal and distal jejunum of weanling swine. In the proximal jejunum glucose enhanced the rate of net fluid and electrolyte absorption. This increase was accompanied {{by an increase in}} unidirectional dosium absorption. In loops exposed to either heat stable or heat labile enterotoxins, glucose significantly decreased the rate of net fluid and electrolyte secretion. The magnitude of glucose enhancement in loops exposed to heat stable and heat labile enterotoxins was similar to adjacent control loops. However, glucose enhancement did not occur in loops <b>exposed</b> <b>previously</b> to cholera toxin or concurrently to theophylline. Therefore, cholera toxin and theophylline may inhibit substrate dependent sodium absorption in the proximal jejunum.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{causes for}} immune impairment {{in patients with}} severe chronic inflammatory diseases have not been clearly defined. Recently, the overproduction of poly(ADP-ribose) in resting lymphocytes with unrepaired DNA strand breaks has been suggested to contribute to immune dysfunction in adenosine deaminase-deficient patients. Our experiments have determined to what extent DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis might also explain the impaired mitogen responsiveness of PBL exposed to toxic oxygen species. Treatment of normal resting human lymphocytes with xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine dose-dependently induced DNA strand breaks and triggered the rapid synthesis of poly(ADP- ribose). Subsequently, NAD+ and ATP pools decreased precipitously. Lymphocytes <b>exposed</b> <b>previously</b> to the enzymatic oxidizing system did not synthesize DNA after stimulation with PHA. However, if the medium was supplemented with 3 -aminobenzamide or nicotinamide, two compounds that inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) formation, cellular NAD+ and ATP pools were preserved, and the lymphocytes responded vigorously to a mitogenic challenge. Excessive poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis, provoked by DNA strand breakage, may represent a common pathway that connects the immunodeficiency syndromes associated with (a) exposure of lymphocytes to toxic oxygen species during chronic inflammatory states, (b) adenosine deaminase deficiency, and (c) certain DNA repair disorders...|$|E

Decapped roots grown on Earth completely regenerated their caps within 4. 8 days after decapping, while those grown in microgravity did not regenerate caps. In Earth-grown seedlings, the ER was localized primarily along the periphery of columella cells, and amyloplasts sedimented in response to gravity to the lower sides of the cells. Seeds germinated on Earth and subsequently launched into outer space had a distribution of ER in columella cells similar to that of Earth-grown controls, but amyloplasts were distributed throughout the cells. Seeds germinated in outer space were characterized by the presence of spherical and ellipsoidal masses of ER and randomly distributed amyloplasts in their columella cells. These results indicate that 1) gravity is necessary for regeneration of the root cap, 2) columella cells can maintain their characteristic distribution of ER in microgravity only if they are <b>exposed</b> <b>previously</b> to gravity, and 3) gravity is necessary to distribute the ER in columella cells of this cultivar of Z. mays...|$|E
40|$|Both {{increased}} T cell {{numbers and}} their increased activation state have implicated {{an important role}} for T cells in chronic inflammatory reactions seen in the airways of (allergic) asthmatics. Airway epithelial cells are frequently exposed to stimuli that cause the release of mediators and the expression of cell adhesion molecules. We have examined whether human airway epithelial cells can activate lung-derived T cells. Clonal lung T cells showed an increased adherence to transformed airway epithelial cells that had been <b>exposed</b> <b>previously</b> for 2 h to human recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma; 100 U/ml). After an additional 16 - 24 h of culturing in the absence or presence of epithelial cells, T cells expressed increased levels of both the alpha-chain of the interleukin- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R, CD 25) and the transferrin receptor (CD 71), both markers of T cell activation. T cells apparently activated by epithelial cells, however, did not produce IFN-gamma or IL- 4 nor showed an increased proliferation on the addition of IL- 2 (5 - 50 U/ml). The induced adherence to and the activation of T cells by epithelial cells is mediated largely by CD 2 and its ligand lymphocyte functional antigen- 3, a pathway known to up- and downregulate T cell function...|$|E
