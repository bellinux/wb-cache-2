Habitat specialization, the boundary {{is a hard}} edge to predators such {{that they do not}} disperse to the wildland patch. b. Differences in productivity, increased productivity in the agricultural patch allows a generalist insect predator to disperse to the lower productivity wildland patch. This {{is an example of a}} directional positive <b>edge</b> <b>response.</b> c. Complementary resource use, insect predator abundance is highest near the edge because they need resources present in both patches.

These features share similar properties with neurons in primary Visual cortex that are encoding basic forms, color and movement for object detection in primate vision. Key locations are defined as maxima and minima of the result of difference of Gaussians function applied in scale space to a series of smoothed and resampled images. Low contrast candidate points and <b>edge</b> <b>response</b> points along an edge are discarded. Dominant orientations are assigned to localized keypoints. These steps ensure that the keypoints are more stable for matching and recognition. SIFT descriptors robust to local affine distortion are then obtained by considering pixels around a radius of the key location, blurring and resampling of local image orientation planes.|$|E

Coral reefs are often adjacent to other habitats, e. g. sand or seagrass meadows, but {{little is known about}} how reef-associated organisms respond to the presence of edges. Here, we examined fish communities and benthic assemblages at varying distance from a coral reef-sand edge. At 25 sites, 30 m transects were placed at 5 locations: 1 along the edge and at 5 m and 10 m away from the edge into reef and sand habitats. Counts were made of 51 fish species and benthic composition surveyed. The fish community along the edge was substantially different to communities only 5 m into the sand and reef habitats. Overall, 61 % of the 51 fish species appeared to respond to the edge, with 43 % significantly higher or lower in abundance along the edge compared to other locations. Twelve species showed positive <b>edge</b> <b>responses,</b> including the wrasse Thalassoma lunare, which was 30 times more abundant along the edge compared to 10 m into the reef. Ten species exhibited negative <b>edge</b> <b>responses,</b> including the damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis, which was 7 times more abundant 10 m into the reef compared to the edge. Feeding ecology appears to influence edge-related distribution patterns, with carnivores and omnivores dominating the edges and planktivores more abundant into the reef. These findings suggest that habitat edges may {{play an important role in}} structuring coral reef fish communities. Future research should focus on experimental approaches to identify the underlying mechanisms driving <b>edge</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R

While habitat fragmentation research has mainly focused on species that avoid edges, or the boundaries between different landcover types (negative <b>edge</b> <b>response),</b> a hypothesized resource distribution model predicts that species that require complementary resources in different landcovers will be most abundant at edges (positive <b>edge</b> <b>response).</b> Adults of Eastern Tiger (Papilio glaucus) and Spicebush (P. troilus) swallowtail butterflies require forests for oviposition sites and meadows for nectar resources. I examined the relative abundance and flight orientation of both species {{in relation to the}} forest/meadow edge to evaluate their <b>edge</b> <b>response.</b> Overall, I found that their distribution and flight behaviour was consistent with the positive <b>edge</b> <b>response</b> model, however there were differences between species and sexes.

40|$|The {{brightness}} {{and color of}} a surface depends on its contrast with nearby surfaces. For example, a gray surface can appear very light when surrounded by a black surface or dark when surrounded by a white surface. Some theories suggest that perceived surface {{brightness and}} color is represented explicitly by neural signals in cortical visual field maps; these neural signals are not initiated by the stimulus itself but rather by the contrast signals at the borders. Here, we use {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to search for such neural "filling-in" signals. Although we find the usual strong relationship between local contrast and fMRI response, when perceived brightness or color changes are induced by modulating a surrounding field, rather than the surface itself, we find there is no corresponding local modulation in primary visual cortex or other nearby retinotopic maps. Moreover, when we model the obtained fMRI responses, we find strong evidence for contributions of both local and long-range <b>edge</b> <b>responses.</b> We argue that such extended <b>edge</b> <b>responses</b> may be caused by neurons previously identified in neurophysiological studies as being brightness responsive, a characterization that may therefore need to be revised. We conclude that the visual field maps of human V 1 and V 2 do not contain filled-in, topographical representations of surface brightness and color...|$|R

40|$|Because species respond {{differently}} to habitat boundaries and spatial overlap affects encounter rates, edge responses should be strong determinants of spatial patterns of species interactions. In the Caribbean, mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) prey on hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) eggs. Turtles nest in both open sand and vegetation patches, with a peak in nest abundance near {{the boundary between}} the two microhabitats; mongooses rarely leave vegetation. Using both artificial nests and hawksbill nesting data, we examined how the edge responses of these species predict the spatial patterns of nest mortality. Predation risk was strongly related to mongoose abundance but was not affected by nest density or habitat type. The product of predator and prey <b>edge</b> <b>response</b> functions accurately described the observed pattern of total prey mortality. Hawksbill preference for vegetation edge becomes an ecological trap in the presence of mongooses.

The proposed method characterizes both the global feature layout and the local oriented <b>edge</b> <b>responses</b> of an image, and provides a translation-invariant similarity measure to compare scene images. Our method is effective in generating initial clustering results for applications that require extensive local-feature matching on unorganized image collections, such as large-scale 3 D reconstruction and scene completion. The advantage of our method is that it can estimate image similarity via integrating global and local information. The experimental evaluations on various image datasets show that our method is able to approximate well the similarities derived from local-feature matching with a lower computational cost...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{focuses on}} spatial resolution characterization for QuickBird panochromatic images in 2003 - 2004 and presents data measurements {{and analysis of}} SSC edge target deployment and <b>edge</b> <b>response</b> extraction and modeling. The results of the characterization are shown as values of the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) at the Nyquist spatial frequency and as the Relative <b>Edge</b> <b>Response</b> (RER) components. The results show that RER is much less sensitive to accuracy of the curve fitting than the value of MTF at Nyquist frequency. Therefore, the RER/edge response slope is a more robust estimator of the digital image spatial resolution than the MTF. For the QuickBird panochromatic images, the RER is consistently equal to 0. 5 for images processed with the Cubic Convolution resampling and to 0. 8 for the MTF resampling...|$|E
