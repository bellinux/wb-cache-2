5000|$|The <b>Eurofima</b> <b>coach,</b> or European Standard Coach (Voiture Standard Européenne), is a {{passenger}} car {{designed for use}} on international railway routes in Europe. It was commissioned by the European Company for the Financing of Railroad Rolling Stock (French: [...] ) (Eurofima).|$|E
50|$|From the {{following}} day, 22 May 1977, the train, now operating as Ex 462/463, {{was made up}} of 12 ÖBB Z1 (<b>Eurofima)</b> <b>coaches,</b> one WRümh and three DB RIC coaches.|$|R
50|$|The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) have {{operated}} IC services since 1991. However, contrary to most other countries, these are often {{little more than}} regional rail, as most long-distance, high-standard trains in Austria {{are likely to be}} EuroCity (EC) services, even when not leaving the Austrian borders (named ÖBB-EuroCity until 2011). Modernised stock of <b>Eurofima</b> <b>coaches</b> is used under the brand name ÖBB-InterCity (OIC) mainly on the Austrian Western and Southern Railways from Vienna to Salzburg and Villach.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{development}} of <b>Eurofima</b> <b>coaches</b> {{a new level of}} comfort was achieved; the number of compartments was reduced whilst keeping to the same overall length, the coaches were also air-conditioned. These coaches were designated from 1976 as type Z. But because various railways still did not want to procure air-conditioned coaches or wanted {{to reduce the number of}} compartments compared with the type X (the SBB on all its acquisitions since 1969), the class was eventually divided into Z1 and Z2: ...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{forms of}} spiral {{geometry}} {{that have been}} used and proposed as transition shapes in railroad tracks and compares them with respect to dynamic performance and spiral length. The dynamic performances that are compared were calculated using the Gensys rail vehicle motion simulation program and a well known model of the <b>Eurofima</b> <b>coach.</b> The results illustrate: 1) the dynamic disturbance caused by the discontinuity of first derivatives of track curvature and twist with the conventional ‘linear ’ spiral; 2) the better dynamic performance of other simple forms of spiral including the virtually perfect performance of two of those forms; and 3) the amounts by which lengths of alternative spirals exceed that of the conventional ‘linear ’ spiral for the example transition [...] BASIC SPIRAL GEOMETR...|$|E
50|$|On 30 September 1972 the ALn 442-448 DMUs were {{withdrawn}} from service and mostly replaced by Italy's second generation TEE stock. The Mont Cenis {{was replaced by}} a first-class only Rapide operated with French RGP DMUs, although this was former TEE stock the train was painted in Orange/Grey SNCF livery and wasn't part of the TEE network any more. On 28 mei 1978 the rolling stock was replaced by locomotive hauled trains consisting of French Corail and Italian <b>Eurofima</b> <b>coaches.</b> On 1 June 1980 the Mont Cenis was labelled as international InterCity.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of its}} life, {{the train}} {{was made up of}} ÖBB <b>Eurofima</b> <b>coaching</b> stock, {{occasionally}} supplemented by coaches from DB and SNCF. It was usually around 11 coaches long, with a restaurant car. The train would undergo many locomotive changes during its journey: an SNCF BB 15000 was the usual motive power for the section in France, while a DB Class 181 multi-voltage loco would bring it over the French-German border. Between Karlsruhe or Stuttgart and Munich it was hauled by a DB 103, or later a 101, and east of Munich power was provided by an Austrian loco, either a Class 1044, or later a Taurus. The Paris-Munich service from 200w was made up of DB Intercity coaching stock.|$|R
