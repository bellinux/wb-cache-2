40|$|Formwork {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} temporary works for reinforced-concrete superstructures in building projects. The use of traditional <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> has dominated the construction industry in Hong Kong for many years. Now, however, low-waste technologies for superstructure construction are becoming more common. The study reported here compares the advantages and disadvantages of using traditional <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> and a large panel steel formwork system integrated with precast concrete semi-slab (composite formwork system) in superstructure construction in Hong Kong. The study compares these two different formwork systems used in two identically designed school projects in Hong Kong. The comparisons are focused on construction cost, time required for completion of work and construction waste generation. By conducting a detailed cost comparison, this paper shows that, despite the fact that the composite formwork system is able to produce less construction waste, the traditional <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> system is still more favourable economically. However, if the composite formwork could be reused in other standard school projects after completion of the project, economic advantages would be realised.

Experimental research focused mainly on assessing the possibilities of energy savings in a manufacturing process through shortening a technological process of moulding. By optimalisation of a moulding period, it is possible to achieve considerable energy savings. Based upon the experiments, we created an experimental model in order to determine optimum moulding time. Withing a process of usage, we evaluated particular materials with regard to re-use cycle based upon the experience of commercial manufacturers...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a notable example of the Brutalist concrete architecture of its time, though Baeckman's earlier architecture was more classically modernist in style, most notably the extension to the Åbo Akademi University Library. The exterior architecture is notable for the grains of the <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> being visible in the prefabricated concrete facades. The interior is particularly notable for the large hyperbolic paraboloid-shaped concrete shell structure, {{said to have been}} influenced by the then contemporaneous architecture of the Mexican architect Félix Candela. In the centre of the {{building is}} a hidden courtyard which originally had a garden (since demolished) designed by noted Finnish garden designer Maj-Lis Rosenbröijer.|$|R
50|$|Engineered Formwork System. This {{formwork}} {{is built}} out of prefabricated modules with a metal frame (usually steel or aluminium) and covered on the application (concrete) side with material having the wanted surface structure (steel, aluminum, timber, etc.). The two major advantages of formwork systems, compared to traditional <b>timber</b> <b>formwork,</b> are speed of construction (modular systems pin, clip, or screw together quickly) and lower life-cycle costs (barring major force, the frame is almost indestructible, while the covering if made of wood; {{may have to be}} replaced after a few - or a few dozen - uses, but if the covering is made with steel or aluminium the form can achieve up to two thousand uses depending on care and the applications).|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{carpentry}} is more correctly used {{to describe}} the skill involved in first fixing of timber items, such as construction of roofs, floors and timber framed buildings, i.e., those areas of construction that are normally hidden in a finished building. An easy way to envisage this is that first fix work is all that is done before plastering takes place. Second fix is done after plastering takes place. Second fix work, the construction of items such as skirting boards, architraves, and doors also comes under carpentry. Carpentry is also used to construct the formwork into which concrete is poured during the building of structures such as roads and highway overpasses. In the UK, the skill of making <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> for poured, or in situ, concrete, is referred to as shuttering.|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{construction}} today {{remains largely}} unchanged in basic principle. The largest labour and cost components {{have long been}} the formwork used to confine and shape the concrete in its plastic state. The objective of this treatise is to identify, in theory, whether the modular <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> systems being designed and manufactured today, offer realistic and realisable benefits over the modular steel formwork systems {{that have been used}} for many decades in the South African construction industry. Research focuses on three examples of each system and is restricted to vertical forms, i. e. those used for columns, walls, beam sides and etc. It looks at the physical ergonomics, the quality of the concrete finish produced, the durability of the formwork and the associated components and lastly compares the value in terms of rental and purchase prices per square meter.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) system as innovative lightweight composite school classroom modules. The structural composite panel system consists of profiled steel sheet attached to the dry board via mechanical self drilling and self tapping screws. Compared to traditional building systems and materials, the PSSDB system eliminates the used of conventional <b>timber</b> <b>formworks,</b> columns and roof trusses in buildings. Besides, the proposed system has many advantages {{such as it is}} lightweight, making construction less labour-orientated, shorter construction time, materials optimisation, and provides better finished products. The proposed panel system falls under the Industrialised Building System (IBS) category since all the structural panel components are manufactured in a factory, transported and assembled into a structure or building with minimal additional site work. The system was successfully implemented in two school classroom modules at Sekolah Kebangsaan Telok Mas, Melaka, Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} industry in Hong Kong heavily relies on conventional cast in-situ construction involving {{extensive use of}} <b>timber</b> <b>formworks</b> and wet trades. In 2001, the Construction Industry Review Committee (CIRC) report described the construction activities in Hong Kong as 'labour intensive, dangerous and polluting', in which 'built products are rarely defect-free'. Globally, however, the recent trend is prefabrication, which is being increasingly used in the building industry, alleviating some of the environmental burdens associated with conventional construction. The sustainable construction aspects of adopting prefabrication in high-rise buildings are examined, and the economic, environmental and social aspects of using prefabrication are assessed. A questionnaire survey was administered to experienced professionals and case studies of seven recent residential and non-residential buildings in Hong Kong were conducted. The findings revealed that environmental, economic and social benefits of using prefabrication were significant when compared to conventional construction methods. This implies that a wider use of prefabrication techniques could contribute to sustainable construction in a dense urban environment like Hong Kong.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{concerning the}} productivity of the UK construction industry and its performance compared with other European and world-wide nations have reported conflicting findings. These investigations have utilized various methodologies in attempting to measure and compare productivity levels. The present investigation uses a customized method to gauge the productivity at site level of three European national construction industries, namely Germany, France and the UK. Analysis of variance is employed to compare the productivity rates used by contractors' planning engineers for a specific concreting operation. The performance of UK contractors {{is found to be}} more disparate than those of contractors in either France or Germany. Although leading UK contractors can compete with the best on the continent, {{there are a number of}} companies whose performance is far worse than any in France and Germany, due mainly to the construction methods used by UK contractors. It is concluded therefore, that a best practice recommenda 9 tion for UK contractors would be for them to avoid using traditional <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> methods to beams, and instead adopt more productive approaches afforded using either proprietary or prefabricated systems.

40|$|The {{break with}} the {{tradition}} of the timber-roof basilica and the passage to vaulted construction {{has been one of the}} most intriguing developments of the Early Byzantine period. A crucial question concerning this development regards the degree to which the emergent vaulting technology required the use of centering. The recent graphic reconstruction of a series of Early Byzantine churches in west Asia Minor, such as St. John and St. Mary at Ephesos, Building D at Sardis, and St. John at Philadelphia sheds new light on this problem. The study of the exposed inner layers of these dilapidated monuments makes it possible to visualize their vault structure in detail. Reconstruction reveals a wide variety of vault forms and brick patterns characterized by the setting of bricks in corbelled, ‘pitched’ or ‘arched’ brick courses. This paper investigates the degree to which these techniques can be attributed to the need to limit the use of <b>timber</b> <b>formwork.</b> The author also explores the origins of these techniques and the duration of their use. A wide range of later monuments suggests that these seemingly idiomatic building techniques developed into a building tradition with a lasting influence on church architecture in the region...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{amount of}} waste and {{reduction}} {{in number of}} landfills have created a need for implementing effective waste management. A significant amount of solid wastes are produced every year from construction and demolition activities. This study aims to assess contractor’s opinion about benefits of construction waste management based on project characteristics, identify the amount of wastes, asses the amount of wastes based on subcontracting arrangements, and project types, based on the survey result from 42 contractors in Yogyakarta. 	A literature review was conducted to gather information on benefits of implementing construction waste management, project characteristics, types of construction waste, subcontracting arrangements, and project types. A set of questions was developed to gain opinion about actual situation from respondents. Research methods {{used in this study}} are descriptive statistics and mean analysis using ANOVA and T Test. 	The results prove that the reduction of landfills is the most important benefits and <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> is the most waste that generated from construction project.

40|$|Buildings {{are one of}} {{the primary}} {{contributors}} to carbon emissions. Given the small size of construction site and increasing housing demand in Hong Kong, precast concrete has been frequently adopted in not only public residential buildings, but also the private sector. This study compares the carbon emissions of precast and traditional cast-in-situ construction methods based on a case study of a private residential building in Hong Kong. Life cycle assessment (LCA) model is established to consider the system processes from cradle to end of construction. The comparison is conducted based on eight scenarios at four levels, i. e. cubic meter concrete, precast facade, group of façade elements, and an apartment. It is found that the carbon emission of the studied residential apartment is 669 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per one square meter floor area. Precasting can lead to 10 % carbon reduction for one cubic meter concrete. Steel formwork for precasting performs better than <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> used in cast-in-situ concrete. Adopting more precast concrete can lead to less carbon emission. Based on the research findings, it is highly recommended to adopt precast concrete in building construction. The building industry should consider the carbon reduction as a benefit of implementing precast concrete. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} and demolition waste generation rates (CandD WGRs) {{is an important}} factor in decision-making and management of material waste in any construction site. The present study investigated WGRs by conducting on-site waste sorting and weighing in four ongoing construction projects in Shenzhen city of South China. The results revealed that WGRs ranged from 3. 275 to 8. 791 kg/m(2) and miscellaneous waste, <b>timber</b> for <b>formwork</b> and falsework, and concrete were the three largest components amongst the generated waste. Based on the WGRs derived from the research, the paper also discussed the main causes of waste in the construction industry and attempted to connect waste generation with specific construction practices. It was recommended that measures mainly including performing waste sorting at source, employing skilful workers, uploading and storing materials properly, promoting waste management capacity, replacing current <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> with metal formwork and launching an incentive reward program to encourage waste reduction could be potential solutions to reducing current WGRs in Shenzhen. Although these results were derived from a relatively small sample and so cannot justifiably be generalized, they do however add to the body of knowledge that is currently available for understanding the status of the art of CandD waste management in China. postprin...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{investigation of the}} advanced analysis, reliability-based design and optimisation of steel support scaffolding systems. Support scaffolding systems are used to provide temporary support to <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> systems, reinforcement, concrete, workmen and equipment, during the construction of permanent structures such as buildings and bridges. Stick-type steel scaffolds with cuplok joints {{are the focus of}} the thesis. This thesis includes the collection and statistical analysis of shore load effects occurring as a result of construction dead and live loads. A comprehensive series of U-head joint subassembly tests, allowed the top rotational stiffness to be rationally quantified for advanced finite element modelling. Advanced finite element models are calibrated using data compiled in a previous investigation involving eighteen full-scale tests. This calibration exercise also provides statistical data for modelling error. Monte Carlo simulations using advanced analysis are performed to determine the statistical distributions of system strength for a range of geometric configurations of support scaffold systems. The research showed that system strength was governed mainly by jack extension at {{the top and bottom of}} the scaffolding system. By incorporating the load statistics and system strength statistics, the thesis determined the reliability of various steel scaffolding systems designed by the fundamental Load-Resistance-Factor-Design (LRFD) equation. The study further proposed a more efficient LRFD equation for steel scaffolding, based on an acceptable target reliability index...|$|R
40|$|Conference Theme: Cross-Americas: Probing Disglobal NetworksSession: Design Strategies: Situated Creative Machines: Material PracticesThrough {{the work}} of the Architect and Engineer Felix Candela on Hyperbolic Paraboloid {{surfaces}} for thin concrete shell construction, the paper retraces how ruled geometries (generalized by a sequence of rotating lines) directly regulate procedures of construction for concrete formwork, made of straight timber elements. From the conception of three timber structures, it is discussed how such geometrical principles are further explored spatially, structurally and materially. Finally, a series of subsequent physical experiments are put forward in search of new topologies, generated from the description of a line moving in space. An initial investigation on <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> research is presented through the realization of three timber structures; The Pinch, Sweep and Warp. Sequences of changing wooden trusses capture the movement of a line to support ruled decks performing as new active grounds. In doing so, the trusses are organized transversally for the Pinch, tangentially for the Sweep and longitudinally for the Warp. The results are a series of three small scale social programs: a library, a play area and a roadside marketplace. Located in remote mountainous landscapes (Yunnan, China), each project was designed with a strategy of maximizing the use and experience of the surrounding landscape. They were each built with students {{and with the help of}} a local timber workshop, developing construction methods for adapting highly articulated geometries to simple traditional techniques. Situated at the intersection of teaching and research, experimentation and on-site construction, complex geometry and local craftsmanship, these design-build projects engage with full scale construction in difficult sites through experiential learning. A live prototyping exercise further speculates on the line as vehicle to describe geometries of revolution. With the support of a 5 -axis custom-made automated hot wire, serving as the main research tool, specific protocols for synchronized motions (4 translations and 1 rotation) are inputted. As a result, new slab topologies defined by movement and time emerge, that would be difficult to preconceive through other means of (digital) fabrication. These protocols of motions are then put to use to section blocks of EPS foam into part-formworks for thin shell concrete casting. By virtue of being described by successions of straight lines, these intricate slabs retain effective structural properties and a direct link to <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> and to full scale construction. As much prominence in (digital) fabrication has been placed on surface definition machined from sheet materials, the presented prototyping procedure seek to reinstate the merits of working with volumetric materials. To this effect, a parallel is drawn with stereotomy. The effective method of stone carving invented by Philippe De L’Orme also made use of 2 d geometries to guide the stone cutter in the carving of a block. Although this time, by operating internally in the slicing of a block from the automation of a line moving in space, new spatial articulations in Architecture may emerge again from active geometries solely defined by time and movement...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{recognised}} that {{a significant}} amount of solid waste is produced from construction work. The increasing generation of construction waste such as used <b>timber</b> <b>formwork,</b> obsolete concrete and packaging, has caused significant pollution to the environment and risen public concern particularly in densely populated cities, such as Hong Kong. The minimization of construction waste has therefore become a pressing issue in pursuing the practice of sustainable construction. This paper shows the betterment of replacing in situ concreting with precast slabs for temporary works to improve sustainable construction performance. Construction waste from the obsolete concrete constitutes {{a large part of the}} construction solid waste in a typical building project. The reduction on the obsolescence by using precast slabs can significantly contribute to improving sustainable construction performance. This study identifies cost saving and the betterment of environmental performance by using precast concrete slabs over the in situ concreting. The data used for analysis in the paper were collected from statistics reports and a case study in Hong Kong construction practice. From the case study results, about 43. 93 %, 64. 01 % and 70. 70 % of the cost of using cast in situ concreting can be saved by reusing precast slabs once for temporary works, twice and three times respectively. The findings provide evidence for promoting the use of precast slabs for temporary works, and contribute to the improvement of sustainable construction performance.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1900s the School was {{in need of}} larger premises. On 8 December 1906, the Cairns School of Arts Bill was passed through the Queensland Parliament, {{empowering}} the Trustees to mortgage the School of Arts Reserve at Cairns to the value of £2500, for the purpose of erected a new building. A design competition was conducted for a new building, two-storeyed with upstairs accommodation for the School of Arts and the ground floor to be revenue-producing, the cost of which was not to exceed £2000. A design submitted by Arthur Beckford Polin was accepted, but rejected when tenders far exceeded the amount specified. The School of Arts Committee then commissioned Melbourne and North Queensland architects Tunbridge, Tunbridge and Lynch, who were Townsville-based but had a branch office in Cairns by 1907, to design a building to cost no more than the approved figure. Their work in Cairns around this time included the Harbour Board Offices (1907), the Central Hotel (1908), and the rebuilding of the Court House Hotel (1908). Hanson & Sons won the subsequent School of Arts contract with a price of £2170, and the new building was opened officially on 5 December 1907.The building incorporated an early used of reinforced concrete in Queensland, although not employed through the whole of the structure. The concrete walls of the ground floor were reinforced with 1/2 inch round steel rods, fused where they intersected at 12 inch intervals. The floors at ground level were poured without reinforcement, and for the upper level walls, concrete was poured between <b>timber</b> <b>formwork,</b> without reinforcement.|$|R
40|$|Construction wastes {{have become}} {{the major source of}} solid wastes in Hong Kong. Thousands of tonnes of solid wastes are {{produced}} every year from construction and demolition activities. Increasing generation of these wastes has caused significant impacts on the environment and aroused growing public concerns. Therefore, the minimization of construction wastes has become a pressing issue. This paper aims to: i) revealing the status of construction wastes; ii) investigating the effectiveness of prefabrication in terms of waste reduction in replacing traditional wet-trade practices; iii) examining the factors that help minimize construction wastes by the adoption of prefabrication; and iv) exploring the current waste reduction situations after adoption of prefabrication by comparing with in-situ construction. It investigates wastes generated from various wet-trade construction activities such as in-situ concreting, <b>timber</b> <b>formwork,</b> bricklaying, plastering, screeding, tiling, rebar fixing and bamboo scaffolding. Six major reasons for the excessive construction wastage are known to be: i) cutting; ii) over ordering; iii) damaging during transportation; iv) losing during installation; v) poor workmanship; and vi) change of design. From the findings of a structured interview survey of thirty-one construction practitioners, "timber formwork" is found to be having the greatest potential for cutting scrap, and wastes from "poor workmanship" can be greatly reduced by adopting prefabrication in construction. Furthermore, after the adoption of prefabrication, wastage generation can be greatly reduced in various wet-trade activities including concreting, rebar fixing, bricklaying, drywall, plastering, screeding and tiling. Especially in plastering, the waste reduction can be reduced by 100 %. It is concluded that prefabrication of building components is one of the effective technologies of waste minimization.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand of construction in Malaysia, the government has embarked and taken initiative to implement the Industrial Building System (IBS) such as the Profiled Steel Sheeting Dry Board (PSSDB). PPSDB panelling system can be classified as lightweight composite structural system {{and can be used}} as a floor, roof and wall panel. This PSSDB system. consists of Steel Sheeting (SS) and Dry Board (DB) which 'is connected to each other with self-tapping and self-drilling screws. PSSDB system can be used as temporary shelter and is suitable because it will reduce the time construction. Besides that, PSSDB system can also reduce the use of the materials like concrete and <b>timber</b> <b>formworks</b> hence reduce the overall cost. The objectives of this research are to determine the stiffness of the floor panel and to identify the relationship between thicknesses of dry board and panel stiffness. In this study, three pieces of 1. 0 mm Peva 45 and three different thicknesses of Plywood; 12 mm, 18 mm and 20 mm, have been used in the PSSDB floor panel as steel sheeting and dry board respectively. Meanwhile, MK-Fasteners screws type is used to attach the SS and DB together. Through the bending experiment, the stiffness of the panel can be determined by calculating the slope for each graph of Load vs. Deflection that has been obtained. The result shows that the stiffness value is increased from 109 kNm 2 /m to 122 kNm 2 /m when the thickness of plywood is increased from 12 mm to 18 mm. Similarly, when the thickness is 20 mm, the stiffness value is increased to 129 kNm 2 /m. According to the results obtained, it showed that the thicker plywood will give the higher value of stiffness. In other words, the thicker the plywood, the higher the value of stiffness.

40|$|Session CS 04 : Building and constructionConfenrence Theme: LCA {{in market}} {{research}} and policy: Harmonisation beyond standardisationIndustrialization {{of the construction}} process being a current trend can considerably reduce the on-site labor intensity and shorten the construction time. Prefabrication of construction components {{is one of the}} most commonly used methods to facilitate the industrialization in the sector. Since the mid- 1980 s, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) has begun to introduce prefabricated concrete components into public housing projects. While the provision of public housing is of paramount importance in Hong Kong as approximately 30 % of the population live in public rental housing (PRH) flats and 20 % reside in home ownership scheme (HOS) flats, prefabricated concrete components can replace some 17 % or 65 % in extremely cases of in-situ concrete casting by volume. Due to high labor cost and a lack of land in Hong Kong, prefabricated concrete units are mostly manufactured in mainland China and transported to the construction sites in Hong Kong. This leads to a more complicated logistic system when compared to the conventional cast-in-situ concrete method. The transportation of heavy prefabricated concrete units can generate pollutants and consequently compound the environmental burden. Nevertheless, using the prefabrication approach can help minimize on-site wastage. In this study, the environmental footprint of prefabricated and cast-in-situ concrete is compared using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. A software program known as the Environmental Modeling of Construction (EMoC) has been developed based upon the concept of LCA. EMoC considers the ‘cradle-to-site’ processes from raw material extraction, manufacturing of components, transportation to on-site construction processes. More importantly, the on-site activities related to prefabricated and cast-in-situ concrete can be evaluated separately. To facilitate comparison, the life cycle inventory of concrete has been collected from a local prefabrication yard and concrete batching plant. The comparison is based on the unit of 1 m 3 of unreinforced prefabricated concrete and the equivalent amount of cast-in-situ concrete. Through this study, it is found that the overall environmental footprint of prefabricated concrete as represented by the endpoint single score is 36 which is indeed much better than the score of 57 for cast-in-situ concrete. While cast-in-situ concrete contributes more to the toxicity, eutrophication, land occupation, and resource depletion than prefabricated concrete, the carbon footprint of prefabricated concrete is only 6 % less than that of cast-in-situ concrete. The analysis reveals that <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> is the primary contributor towards a larger environmental footprint of cast-in-situ concrete. The results show that prefabricated concrete can outweigh conventional cast-in-situ concrete from an environmental point of view due to a dramatic saving in the amount of temporary materials...|$|R
40|$|The global {{understanding}} that {{natural resources and}} non renewable energy sources are not inexhaustible has been growing lately together {{with the increase of}} conscientiousness on the consequences that our demanding way of life has on the environment. Global warming, ozone layer depletion, the greenhouse effect or the acid rain, are some of these consequences, which may reach catastrophic levels if nothing is done to emend the actual situation. Lately, society is beginning to see sustainability not only as a needed requirement but as a distinctive value which has to be pursued by the different areas of society involved and responsible for a sustainable development such as public administration and companies, engineers and researchers. As a fundamental part of society, infrastructures have utmost importance in sustainable development. Even more when it comes to rail transport infrastructure, given the important role of rail transport {{in the development of a}} sustainable society. That is why engineers should make an effort to use all the tools available to choose the best structural design, which not only meets structural requirements, but has also a good performance for the environment. To do so, engineers must focus on using renewable sources or energy and materials, increasing the life of the existing infrastructures, making them more durable. When it comes to railway bridges, it is preferable to reuse and adapt existing structures than tear them down to build new ones. In this line, environmental assessment methodologies provide an incredibly valuable tool for help decision-makers and engineers to identify and select the best alternative design regarding environmental issues. Therefore, it is important to count on a common basis and established criteria together with a systematic methodology in order to obtain reliable results to compare alternatives and make the right decisions. However, nowadays, there exists very little guidance to perform this kind of analysis, and an extensive variety of databases and methodologies non standardized, which leads to uncertainties when it comes to evaluate and compare the obtained results. This thesis means to be a good guide for engineers, when performing a Life Cycle Assessment of a railway bridge, and to become a useful tool to compare several alternatives to identify the best option relating the environmental burdens involved. With this purpose, in order to know the state of the art of LCA methodology, it has been studied a wide range of existing literature and previous studies performed to analyze bridges and building materials. Finally, it has been developed an own methodology based on all the research done before, and implemented in an Excel application program based on Visual Basic macros, which means to be easy to use with a simple user interface, and to provide reliable results. The application is useful for assessing, repair or improving existing bridges, where the amounts of materials and energy are known, but can also be helpful in the design phase to compare different alternatives. It also allows using different weighting methodologies according to several reference sources depending on the case of study. The application is tested by carrying out a Life Cycle Assessment of a Spanish railway bridge located in the city center of Vitoria-Gasteiz, evaluating the different structures that conform the bridge system thorough all the stages of its life cycle identifying the most contributive parameters to the environmental impacts. The study was carried out over a 100 year time horizon. In the case of performing the LCA of this particular bridge, the contribution of the whole bridge is taken into consideration. When comparing two different bridges, the application has the option to compare them in the same basis, dividing by length and width of the bridge, which is a helpful tool if both bridges are not the same size. All stages of the life cycle were considered: the material stage, construction, the use and maintenance stage, and the end of life. The material stage includes the raw material extraction, production and distribution. The construction stage accounts the diesel, electricity and water consumption during construction activities. The use and maintenance stage covers the reparation and replacing operations. And the end of life covers several scenarios. In this case of study, in order not to interrupt the rail traffic, the bridge was constructed parallel to its final location, and then moved into the right place with hydraulic jacks. This leads to an important auxiliary structure with its own foundations, which has a significant contribution to the overall environmental impact. The scenario chosen for the end of life was based on similar actuation in other constructions in the proximities of the bridge, as the bridge is already in use. These assumptions were to recycle 70 % of the concrete and 90 % of the steel; all the wood used for formwork was disposed as landfill. The results obtained, weighted according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, shows that the main contributor to the environmental impacts is the material phase, with the 64 % of the total weighted results with concrete and steel production as principal factors, followed by timber production. These processes account great amounts of CO 2 emissions, which makes essential to focus on reducing the impact of the material processes by optimizing the processes but mainly by reusing materials from other constructions as much as it may be possible. The maintenance activities have some importance due to the frequency of the track replacement, assumed to be once every 25 years. While construction does not imply great burdens for the environment, the end of life causes the 33 % of the overall bridge impact. This is due to the <b>timber</b> <b>formwork</b> disposal as landfill and to a lesser extent because of the recycling of the steel. The timber disposal increases widely the eutrophication effect, and will be easy to be reused in further constructions. Regarding the different parts of the bridge structure, the auxiliary structure has an important contribution with the 61 % of the overall weighted impact. As it is a concrete bridge, both the substructure and superstructure has similar contribution. The substructure has a slightly higher impact with the 21 % and the superstructure the 15 %. Rail structure and transport have very little contribution...|$|R
