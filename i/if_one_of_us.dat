500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were doing it at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is {{the main thing that}} I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of a}} big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
2500|$|Neurotics Anonymous {{was created}} eight years later, February 3, 1964 in Washington, D.C. by Grover Boydston (August 16, 1924 - December 17, 1996). Grover was an AA member, {{recovering}} alcoholic, psychologist, and Ed.M. Grover had attempted suicide five times {{before the age}} of 21 and, like Bill W., was neurotic. Grover believed members of twelve-step programs shared the same underlying neuroses caused by self-centeredness, a view expressed in other twelve-step programs. Grover went as far as to say, [...] "All of us are, indeed, brothers, and the variations in detail are no more than <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> likes chocolate ice cream, and the other likes vanilla." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the World Turns {{executive}} producer Chris Goutman stated in a WGN radio interview that Hansis and Silbermann are [...] "both very modest actors". He credited them with having {{the ability to}} show the proper emotions in subtle and effective ways (i.e. [...] "Luke's knowing smile and longing look at Noah, Noah's inner pain and fear of his father"). When asked if they rehearse together to decide which facial expressions they will use to convey these emotions in any given scene, Hansis replied, [...] "No. We rehearse together {{to make sure we}} have the lines right. But it's not usually about the acting, its just running lines." [...] He said that the [...] "acting comes" [...] when the cameras are on. [...] "We are comfortable with each other as actors, so <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> does something new during taping, the other just rolls with it and it usually creates some nice moments," [...] said Hansis.|$|E

50|$|Komar and Melamid is a tandem team of Russian-born American conceptualist artists Vitaly Komar (born 1943) and Alexander Melamid (born 1945). In an artists’ {{statement}} {{they said}} that “even <b>if</b> only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> creates some <b>of</b> the projects and works, we usually sign them together. We are not just an artist, we are a movement.” Both artists were born in Moscow, but emigrated to Israel in 1977 and subsequently to New York in 1978. The pair's co-authorship of works ceased in 2003-2004.|$|R
