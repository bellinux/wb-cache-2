The purpose of this project was to utilize these materials and create useful products like water and methane gas, which is used for rocket fuel, to further supply a deep space mission. The system used was a thermal degradation reactor with the configuration of a down-draft gasifier. The reactor was loaded with approximately 100 g of trash simulant and heated with two external ceramic heaters with separate temperature control {{in order to create}} pyrolysis and <b>gasification</b> in one <b>zone</b> and incineration iri a second zone simultaneously.

In our operating conditions, the char bed reactive zone is 3 times longer for chips (45 cm) than for pellets (16 cm).

In the UCG process, cavity growth with crack extension inside the coal seam is an important phenomenon that directly influences gasification efficiency and safety. An efficient and environmental UCG system relies upon the precise control and evaluation of the <b>gasification</b> <b>zone.</b> The effects of the feed temperature, direction of the stratified plane, and inherent microcracks (cleats) in coal and crack extension were investigated using some heating experiments performed using plate-shaped and cylindrical coal specimens. To monitor the failure process and measure the microcrack distribution inside the coal specimen before and after heating, acoustic emission (AE) measurements and X-ray CT were applied. It was demonstrated that many microcracks developed inside the coal with AE activity during heating. The temperature gradient and direction of the stratified plane and fire face affect the crack generation and extension, that is, most of the cracks initiated and developed along the stratified plane. To investigate the influence of gasification agents and operational parameters on cavity growth and gasification efficient, the laboratory UCG model experiments using coal blocks and two small-scale filed tests were conducted. AE activity, temperature profile and product gas composition were obtained for evaluating the gasification effects and gas energy recovery. The crack distribution models by AE source locations and moment tensor analysis are also compared with the cavity images of UCG models. Consequently, positive correlation was found between the temperature variation, crack extension, and AE activities. It was also concluded that sustained gasification and sufficient gaseous calorific values (estimated by stoichiometric approach) obtained using pure oxygen, that is, the cases of linking-hole UCG yielded average calorific values as high as 9. 1 MJ/m 3 (Lab.), and 11. 6 MJ/m 3 (Field.). However, the coaxial-hole cases yielded an average calorific value of gas produced as only 5. 8, 2. 65, 4. 3, MJ/m 3 (Lab.), and 6. 01 MJ/m 3 (Field.). It was considered that the difference caused by the growth of combustion zone and the direction of stratified plane. Through a series of laboratory experiments and field tests, it was found that the fracturing activity around the <b>gasification</b> <b>zone</b> is a key for efficient and safety UCG system. Therefore, the fracturing activity should be controlled by the AE monitoring and the flow rate of injection agents gases in a proposed UCG system. 本研究の目的は，室内実験と小規模な現場試験より，リアルタイム制御が可能な効果的な石炭地下ガス化（UCG）システムを提案することにある。UCGにおいては，炭層内のき裂進展に伴う燃焼空洞の成長が重要であり，これがガス化の効率や安全性に大きく影響する。すなわち，効果的で環境負荷の少ないUCGシステムを確立するためには，ガス化領域の評価と精細な制御が不可欠である。熱履歴が炭層内の潜在き裂（炭理）や成層面方向，き裂の進展に与える影響を調べるために，板状と円柱状供試体の加熱実験を行った。石炭供試体の熱破壊過程を監視し，熱履歴を受ける前後の構造変化を調べるために，AE （Acoustic Emission）計測とマイクロフォーカス３次元X線CTを用いた。石炭を加熱すると，熱応力によりAEを伴う微小き裂が多数発生した。分析の結果，熱勾配と成層面方向が供試体のき裂発生や進展に大きく影響することが明らかになった。その際，多くのき裂は成層面に沿って発生，進展することがわかった。次に，ガス化効率やガス化空洞の成長に影響を与える注入ガスなどのパラメータを調べるために，石炭ブロックを用いたUCGモデル実験と，小規模現場試験を行った。ここでは，ガス化の効率とガス化回収エネルギーを評価するために，AE活動や温度分布の変化，生産ガスの成分濃度等を計測した。また，AE震源標定とモーメント・テンソル解析によるき裂分布モデルと燃焼空洞周辺画像との比較も行った。その結果，温度変化とき裂進展，およびAE活動との間には，相関が認められた。また，純酸素を供給した際には，安定したガス化が持続し，充分な発熱量（化学定量的手法による推定）を得ることができた。リンキング方式のモデルでは，平均発熱量として 9. 1 MJ/m 3 （室内実験）以上になり，現場試験では 11. 6 MJ/m 3 となった。しかしながら，同軸型モデルの場合には， 5. 8 ， 2. 65 ， 4. 3 MJ/m 3 （室内実験）と 6. 01 MJ/m 3 （現場試験）となり，この違いは，炭層内の成層面方向や燃焼領域の成長の違いにより生じたと考えられる。一連の室内実験や小規模現場試験の結果を通じて，効果的で安全なUCGシステムにおいては，ガス化領域周辺の破壊活動が重要であることがわかった。この結果に基づき，破壊活動をAE計測により監視し，注入ガスの流量等によりガス化領域の破壊を制御するシステムを提案した。室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|E
40|$|To recover {{coal gas}} and heat energy from an {{underground}} coal seam abandoned for either technical or economic reasons, we are developing safe and efficient Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) techniques. A typical UCG system has two wells drilled {{from the surface}} into a coal seam with some separation of injection from production. The wells are connected underground by various linking techniques. After creating a combustion reactor in an underground coal seam, air and oxygen flow through the injection well. Heat energy and gases are collected from the production well. In this process, the fracturing activity inside the coal seam serves an important role for enlargement of the <b>gasification</b> <b>zone</b> because the surface area oxidization increases continuously by coal cracking. On the other hand, excess fractures inside the coal seam and surrounding rock can induce gas leakage, underground water contamination, subsidence, etc. Therefore, monitoring and control of fracturing activity in underground areas constitute key technologies for efficient and safe UCG development. To monitor fracturing activity, we used Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring during UCG model experiments using artificial coal seam. Through the experiments, {{it was found that}} the combustion and gasification volume in the coal seam was possible to estimate from the AE source location data. Therefore, AE monitoring is a useful tool to evaluate combustion reactors for efficient and safe UCG systems. 特...|$|E
40|$|This project {{develops}} Fuel-Flexible Reburning (FFR), {{which combines}} conventional reburning and Advanced Reburning (AR) technologies with an innovative method of delivering coal as the reburning fuel. The FFR can be retrofit to existing boilers {{and can be}} configured in several ways depending on the boiler, coal characteristics, and NO{sub x} control requirements. Fly ash generated by the technology will be a saleable byproduct {{for use in the}} cement and construction industries. FFR can also reduce NO{sub x} by 60 %- 70 %, achieving an emissions level of 0. 15 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu in many coal-fired boilers equipped with Low NO{sub x} Burners. Total process cost is expected to be one third to one half of that for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). Activities during reporting period included design, manufacture, assembly, and shake down of the coal gasifier and pilot-scale testing of the efficiency of coal gasification products in FFR. Tests were performed in a 300 kW Boiler Simulator Facility. Several coals with different volatiles content were tested. Data suggested that incremental increase in the efficiency of NO{sub x} reduction due to the gasification was more significant for less reactive coals with low volatiles content. Experimental results also suggested that the efficiency of NO{sub x} reduction in FFR was higher when air was used as a transport media. Up to 14 % increase in the efficiency of NO{sub x} reduction in comparison with that of basic reburning was achieved with air transport. Temperature and residence time in the <b>gasification</b> <b>zone</b> also affected the efficiency of NO{sub x} reduction...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} the heating value (HV) of gas {{produced}} during the gasification of sawdust using {{a new type of}} air-blown gasifier based on a two-compartment cylindrical fluidized bed. The gasification process is based on an internally circulating aerated fluidized bed (ICAFB) and consists of two individual zones; a <b>gasification</b> <b>zone</b> in the annulus and combustion zone in the draft tube. The annulus and draft tube are connected via orifices at the lower section of the draft tube wall to enable the solids to move from the annulus to the draft tube. Char, gasified residue, together with hot bed material move to the draft tube and combust to produce heat. Fluidization ratio (RQ) which is the ratio of air flow rate in the annulus (Qan) to the air flow rate in the draft tube (Qdt) together with equivalence ratio (ER) were used to control the temperature of the gasifier. The effects of ER on the temperature system stabilization, composition, HV of producer gas (PG) and gasifier performance were presented. ER ranges from 0. 148 to 0. 203 were used in this study. PG compositions of 3. 13 %, 2. 28 %, 25. 8 %, 8. 2 % and 22. 48 % for H 2, O 2, CO, CH 4 and CO 2 respectively with a HV of about 6. 96 MJ m_ 3 were obtained at an ER of 0. 185 and temperature of about 866 _C. Compared with previous air-blown fluidized bed biomass gasification results, the ICAFB gasifier is capable of producing producer gas with higher CO and CH 4 fractions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate the parameters affecting the gasification process within downdraft gasifiers using biomass feedstocks. In addition to investigations with an open-core gasifier, a novel open-topped throated gasifier was designed and used. A sampling system was designed and installed to determine the water, tar and particular content of the raw product gas. This permitted evaluation {{of the effects of}} process parameters and reactor design on tar and particular production, although a large variation was found for the particulate measurements due to the capture of large particles. For both gasifiers, the gasification process was studied in order to identify and compare the mechanisms controlling the position and shape of the reaction zones. The stability of the reaction zone was found to be governed by the superficial gas velocity within the reactor. A superficial gas velocity below 0. 2 Nms- 1 resulted in a rising reaction zone in both gasifiers. Turndown is achieved when the rate of char production by flaming pyrolysis equals the rate of char gasification over a range of throughputs. A turndown ratio of 2 : 1 was achieved for the hybrid-throated gasifier, compared to 1. 3 : 1 for the open-core. It is hypothesized that pyrolysis is a surface area phenomenon, and that in the hybrid gasifier the pyrolysis front can expand to form a dome-shape. The rate of char gasification is believed to increase as the depth of the <b>gasification</b> <b>zone</b> increases. Vibration of the open-core reactor bed decreased the bed pressure drop, reduced the voidage, aided solids flow and gave a minor improvement in the product gas energy content. Insulation improved the performance of both reactors by reducing heat losses resulting in a reduced air to feed ratio requirement. The hybrid gasifier gave a higher energy conversion efficiency, a higher product gas heating value, and a lower tar content than the open-core gasifier due to efficient gas mixing in a high temperature tar cracking region below the throat and reduced heat losses...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate the perforamnce of a rubberwood gasifier and engine with electricity generation and to identify opportunities {{for the implementation of}} such a system in Malaysia. The experimental work included the design, fabrication and commissioning of a throated downdraft gasifier in Malaysia. The gasifier was subsequently used to investigate the effect of moisture content, dry wood capacity and particle size of rubberwood on gasifier performance. Additional experiments were also conducted to investigate the influence of two different nozzle numbers and two different throat diameters on tar cracking. A total of 101 runs were completed during the duration of the research. From the experimental data, the average mass balance was found to be 92. 65 %. The average energy balance over the gasifier to hot raw gas was 98. 7 %, to cold clean gas was 102. 4 % and over the complete system was 101. 9 %. The heat loss from the gasifier was estimated to range from 10 - 26 % of the chemical energy of the feedstock. From the downstream operation, the heat loss was estimated to range from 17 - 37 % of the chemical energy of rubberwood feedstock. The maximum throughput for stable operation was found to be 60 - 70 % of the maximum dry wood capacity. The gasifier was found to have a maximum turndown ratio of 5 : 1. It is also postulated that the phenomenon of turndown of the gasifier is due to a `bubble theory' occurring at the <b>gasification</b> <b>zone,</b> and this hypothesis is explained. For stable power output, the working range of the engine was found to be 5 - 33. 5 kWe. The thermal efficiency and diesel displacement of the engine was found to be 17 - 18 % and 65 - 70 % respectively. The research also showed that rubberwood gasification in Malaysia is feasible if the price of diesel is above MR 35 /l and the price of wood is below MR 120 /tonne...|$|E
40|$|Cavity growth {{occurring}} with crack {{extension and}} coal consumption during UCG processes directly influences the gasification efficiency and the estimated subsidence and gas leakage to the surface. This report presents {{an evaluation of}} the gas energy recovery, coal consumption, and gasification cavity estimation using a proposed stoichiometric method to analyze the coal gasification reaction process. We defined the evaluation parameters of rate of energy recovery and investigated the effects of different parameters using UCG trials conducted with coal blocks and coal seams, adopting different Linking-hole methods and operational parameters. Analyses of results obtained from laboratory experiments and small-scale field trials using V-shaped and L-shaped linking holes, and Coaxial-hole UCG models show that the gasification of Linking-hole models yielded average calorific values of product gas as high as 10. 26, 11. 11 MJ/m 3 (lab.), and 14. 39 MJ/m 3 (field.). In contrast, the Coaxial-hole models under experimental conditions yielded average calorific values of product gas as: 7. 38, 4. 70 MJ/m 3 (lab.) and 6. 66 MJ/m 3 (field.). The cavity volume obtained with Coaxial models was about half of the volume obtained from Linking-hole models. Results obtained for these UCG systems show that the feed gas and linking-hole types can influence coal consumption and product gas energy. Fissure ratios were also investigated. Results confirmed major factors underpinning gasification efficiency. Linking-hole types strongly influenced the development of the oxidization surface and fracture cracks for subsequent combustion in the <b>gasification</b> <b>zone.</b> Estimated gas energy recovery results support experimental observations within an acceptable error range of about 10 %. Moreover, this stoichiometric approach is simple and useful for evaluating the underground cavity during UCG. Based on these results, we proposed a definition of the energy recovery rate, combined with the obtained volumes of gasification cavities that provide a definition of energy recovery and UCG effects. UCGにおいては，炭層内のき裂進展に伴う燃焼空洞の拡大と石炭の消費が重要であり，これがガス化効率や安全性 (地盤沈下，ガス漏洩等) に大きく影響する。本研究では，ガス化効率，回収エネルギーとガス化空洞の評価方法として，化学量論および化学平衡に基づく評価手法を検討した。生成ガス組成と求めたガス化反応式から，石炭の消費量，ガス生産量等を推定する方法である。また，エネルギー回収率を定義し，UCG室内モデル実験及び露天炭鉱の炭層で行った小規模現場実験の結果を評価し，リンキングの方式や注入ガス等のパラメータがガス化効率やガス化空洞の成長に与える影響を検討した。リンキングの方式として，L字，V字，同軸型のUCG実験を行い，ガス化効率の違いと，その原因を明らかにした。すなわち，リンキング型と同軸型モデルを比較すると，リンキング型UCGモデルの方が発熱量が高く，平均発熱量では，前者が 10. 26 / 11. 11 MJ/m 3 (室内) ， 14. 39 MJ/m 3 (現場) であった。一方，同軸型モデル試験では， 7. 38 / 4. 70 MJ/m 3 (室内) と 6. 66 MJ/m 3 (現場) と低い値であった。実験後の空洞体積の直接評価結果でも，リンキング型の方がガス化領域が拡大していることを確認した。リンキング方式の方が，炭層内にき裂を連続的に進展させやすいためと考えられる。また，エネルギー回収率の評価では，実験前後の供試体質量差から求めたエネルギー回収率と比較検討を行った。その結果，両者の誤差は約 10 ％で，検討した手法によりエネルギー回収率や燃焼ガス化領域の石炭消費量を推定できることがわかった。以上の結果より，検討した化学量論法よる回収エネルギー評価手法は簡便で，実用的であることが明らかになった。Special Edition for Coal Energy Technology; Development and Utilization of Coal Energ...|$|E
40|$|Agglomeration of ash {{particles}} {{provides the}} desired porosity of the ash bed for adequate agent (steam and oxygen) flow and distribution, whereas excessive slagging inside the gasifier can cause channel burning, pressure drop problems or unstable operation, resulting in cut backs on gasifier load, which implies a direct loss in gas production. The ash flow temperature (AFT) is one property that specifically gives {{more information on}} the suitability of a coal source for combustion or gasification purposes. However, normal AFT analyses give an average flow property and do not indicate exactly at what temperature the first melt/slag is occurring or what the properties of the slag is at a specific temperature. Operating experience indicates that even when the gasifiers are operated at temperatures above the flow temperature as given by AFT analysis, a low percentage of slag is formed. In this study, the focus will be on the application of viscosity determinations together with FactSage modelling. Conventional AFT analyses take the bulk chemical composition of the mineral phase into account, and does not differentiate between the composition in the slag–liquid phase and the composition of the crystalline phase. It is therefore important to describe the viscosity of not only the completely molten phase, but also the partly crystallised slag and liquid portion. The combination of viscosity predictions together with FactSage modelling will result in viscosity predictions of the actual liquid component, rather than just an average or pseudo-viscosity prediction of the total mineral system at a specific temperature. Based {{on the fact that the}} Urbain model assumes the composition as 100 % liquid or molten, which is not the case for example during fixed bed gasification where the mineral structure is of a heterogeneous nature with partial melting and crystalline material, viscosity predictions of the slag or molten portion can be more accurately determined by using the FactSage results. The viscosities, as determined from specific slag compositions at specific temperatures between 1000 °C and 1250 °C, differ from the average viscosity prediction and is highly likely to be a more accurate prediction of the slag viscosity than just based on the average mineral composition. The viscosity of the actual slag composition also remains fairly constant up to temperatures > 1200 °C. This can also be related back to the initial deformation temperature onset of the coal, where the slag properties are cumulative enough for the onset of deformation to start. The specific decrease of the viscosity at the temperature between 1200 °C and 1250 °C correlates with the slag formation trend as obtained with FactSage modelling. During the gasification process the viscosity of the slag portion decreases to ± 3. 5 cp, which is on the border between a weak deposit and strong deposit. With increasing temperature above 1250 °C, for this specific coal source the viscosity moved into the strong deposit region. After the <b>gasification</b> <b>zone,</b> the viscosity increased again as the material crystallised in the combustion process. For a specific coal source, the viscosity of the slag portion can thus be calculated. The major source of glass is derived from included minerals in carbon rich particles. It is clear that a focus on the modification of the unclassified/amorphous phase, to increase the viscosity (decrease slag formation or have a higher concentration of crystalline phases) at a certain temperature, is important. An AFT analyses only supplies information on the temperature where a mass of material, enough to deform the structure of the cone, starts to slag and does not give information on the properties of the slag below that point. The use of viscosity predictions together with FactSage modelling supplies a better understanding of slag and ash properties at specific temperatures[URL]...|$|E
