25|$|The {{original}} NES, meanwhile, {{featured a}} front-loading cartridge {{covered by a}} small, <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> that can be opened to insert or remove a cartridge and closed at other times. It features a more subdued gray, black, and red color scheme. An expansion port {{was found on the}} bottom of the unit and the cartridge connector pinout was changed.|$|E
25|$|The Police box was {{introduced}} in the United States in 1877 and was used in the United Kingdom throughout the 20th century. It is a public telephone kiosk or callbox for the use of members of the police, or for members of the public to contact the police. Unlike an ordinary callbox, its telephone was located behind a <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> so it could be used from the outside, and the interior of the box was, in effect, a miniature police station for use by police officers to read and fill in reports, take meal breaks and even temporarily hold prisoners until the arrival of transport.|$|E
25|$|The pilot's {{compartment}} had two side-by-side {{seats and}} dual controls, {{all of which}} being contained within a large Plexiglas nose section. Initially, the cockpit would be outfitted with internal telephone systems that allowed for communication between the pilots of the glider and tug aircraft while connected; however, this was replaced on later-built models by radio sets instead, which {{had the advantage of}} being able to maintain contact after detaching. Aft of the pilot's compartment was the freight loading door on the port side; the <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> could also be used as a loading ramp. The main compartment could accommodate 15 troops on benches along the sides with another access door on the starboard side. Supply containers could also be fitted under the centre-section of the wing, three on each side.|$|E

50|$|Rear <b>hinged</b> 'Suicide' cab <b>doors</b> {{were used}} {{until the end}} of {{production}} in 1981, except on vehicles manufactured for the Dutch market where conventionally <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> were available from 1968.|$|R
25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a <b>hinged</b> <b>door.</b> In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform the door by lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|E
500|$|Each {{of the two}} {{caissons}} is [...] wide, and {{can hold}} up to four [...] canal boats. Watertight doors at each end match doors located on the upper structure and lower dock pit. Due to space concerns, where a normal <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> would dramatically reduce the useful length of the caisson, vertically rising doors were chosen. The doors are raised from a recess {{in the base of}} the caisson and powered by a hydraulic lance when docked.|$|E
2500|$|It had an {{electrically}} actuated tricycle undercarriage, {{the main}} wheels retracting inwards into the wings. [...] The cabin had seats {{for four or}} five, two at the front and a bench seat behind. In a proposed air ambulance configuration, the Antilope would have carried two stretchers and a medic. [...] Access to the cabin was via a large rear <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> on the starboard side.|$|E
50|$|Light vans in Britain were at {{this time}} {{frequently}} identified by their maximum permissible gross payload, and the Atlas was often advertised simply as the Atlas 10 cwt or the Atlas 12 cwt, reflecting allowable load weights (including a driver) of 500 kg and 600 kg. In addition to the panel van, a pick up truck version was also offered. Both <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> and sliding doors were offered. There was also a small flatbed truck version which had rear <b>hinged</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Externally, the MP-1 {{resembles a}} van with a sharply sloped bonnet. The two front <b>doors</b> are normal <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> but the rear-most {{of the side}} doors slide {{backwards}} along rails. The entire rear of the MP-1 is a top <b>hinged</b> rear <b>door.</b> The passenger side sliding door also incorporated a lifting step to allow wheelchair access.|$|R

2500|$|The cell had two access points: a <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> that weighed 500kg (1,100lb) {{which is}} thought to have become {{unusable}} over the years because of its weight, and a metal door, reinforced with concrete and on steel rails that weighed 300kg (650lb) and measured [...] high and [...] wide. It was located behind a shelf in Fritzl's basement workshop, protected by an electronic code entered using a remote control unit. In order to reach this door, five locking basement rooms had to be crossed. To get to the area where Elisabeth and her children were held, eight doors in total needed to be unlocked, of which two doors were additionally secured by electronic locking devices.|$|E
2500|$|Stock with air-doors {{first entered}} {{service on the}} London Underground in 1921, and from 1923 Standard Stock {{operated}} on the Hampstead line, and these allowed staff to be reduced to front and rear guards and a driver. A Central London car was experimentally rebuilt with air-doors in 1925, and by 1928 all cars had been converted, the work being carried out at the Union Construction Company at Feltham. The end platforms were enclosed and trailer cars were equipped with two [...] openings with a single leaf sliding doors on each side. Motor cars had a single larger opening with a double-leaf sliding door and a guard's compartment with a <b>hinged</b> <b>door.</b> The sliding doors were pneumatically operated, later assisted with electrically controlled exhaust valves to speed up opening. In 1926/27, whilst the conversion was in progress, two six-car trains of 1906 Stock and 1920 Stock were borrowed from the Piccadilly line, the trailers fitted with smaller wheels {{to allow them to}} run in the smaller Central London tunnels. Fitting the air-doors reduced the number of seats, from 48 to 40 in the trailers and 42 to 30 in the motor cars.|$|E
6000|$|Still Giotto's, {{and entirely}} exquisite; {{finished}} with no less care than the shepherd, {{to mark the}} vitality of this art to humanity; the spade and hoe--its heraldic bearing--hung on the <b>hinged</b> <b>door.</b> [Footnote: Pointed out to me by Mr. Caird, who adds farther, [...] "I saw a forge identical with this one at Pelago the other day,--the anvil resting on a tree-stump: the same fire, bellows, and implements; the door in two parts, the upper part like a shutter, and used for the exposition of finished work {{as a sign of}} the craft; and I saw upon it the same finished work of the same shape as in the bas-relief--a spade and a hoe."] For subtlety of execution, note the texture of wooden block under anvil, and of its iron hoop.|$|E
50|$|These {{cars were}} built with <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> to the {{passenger}} compartments, an arrangement that caused delays during station stops, as each door had to be manually checked before the train departed.|$|R

60|$|Captain Leach {{looked at}} me {{for a moment or two}} as though he had it upon his mind to say {{something}} further. However, he did not speak, but rising, delivered a very profound bow, and left the cabin without another word. But there was no gainsaying the wisdom of the advice which he had given me as to concealing the treasure. Accordingly I obtained from the carpenter a basket of tools, and, bearing in mind the late visit with which he had favored me, having shaded the little window in the door of my cabin, I stripped off my coat and waistcoat, and after an hour or so of work, made shift to rig up a very snug little closet with a <b>hinged</b> <b>door,</b> in the bottom of my berth and below the mattress, wherein I hid the jewel. After that I breathed more freely, for I felt that the treasure could not be discovered without a long and careful search, the opportunities for which were not likely to occur.|$|E

5000|$|In 1943, {{it became}} a Massachusetts state law {{requirement}} to flank a revolving door with an outward swinging <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> or to make the revolving door collapsible (so it becomes a double partition collapsing at 180°), allowing people to pass on either side. American revolving doors are now collapsible. Some jurisdictions require them to be flanked {{by at least one}} <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> either by common practice or required by law. For example, the Ontario Building Code 3.4.6.14. asserts that revolving doors needs to [...] "(a) be collapsible, (b) have hinged doors providing equivalent exiting capacity located adjacent to it".|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between grave shelters and grave houses. Shelters, common in Protestant southern cemeteries, are primarily built with a roof, four corner posts and a fence protecting an in-ground burial site. Grave houses are complete, miniature houses with siding, <b>hinged</b> <b>doors,</b> windows and sometimes ornate interiors.|$|R
50|$|The Cyclone is {{a replica}} of the Cessna 180 that {{incorporates}} modifications and improvements, such as an extended wing span, greater wing area and vertically <b>hinged</b> <b>doors.</b> It features a strut-braced high-wing, a four-seat enclosed cabin accessed via doors, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|R
