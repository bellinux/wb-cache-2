5|$|Lalic {{thinks the}} {{strategies}} in which Black gives up the bishop pair (by exchanging its Bb4 for the Nd2) for nothing are a mistake. He {{does not like}} the strategy to retreat the Bb4 in d6 either, because they are too drawish. <b>He</b> <b>recommends</b> the strategy to retreat the bishop in c5, and maintain its position there {{with the help of}} the a7–a5 pawn advance.|$|E
5|$|The white {{supremacist}} scientist Robert Wilson Shufeldt reviewed Animal Coloration in Science in 1892, praising it as a concise and useful {{summary of the}} subject. He admires Macmillan Publishers' handling of the book with its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. He quotes Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a few new ideas. <b>He</b> <b>recommends</b> the book to all working American naturalists.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{returns to}} Sarawak, where {{he stays in}} the {{circular}} 'head-house' of a Dyak village, travels upriver, and describes the Durian, praising it as the king of fruits with exquisite and unsurpassed flavour, and the Dyak's slender bamboo bridges, as well as ferns and Nepenthes pitcher plants. On a mountain he finds {{the only place in}} his entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and <b>he</b> <b>recommends</b> naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.|$|E

5|$|Yajnavalkya dedicates {{significant}} amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage of breathing, that is inhalation, exhalation and stoppage between the two. Each stage is {{discussed in terms of}} its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing, regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for each stage without distraction, <b>he</b> <b>recommends</b> silently reciting time-measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava (Om), Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras.|$|E
5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, {{who writes}} a popular {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. <b>He</b> <b>recommends</b> Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who {{wants to build a}} Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E

For other water supplies, he had the opposite recommendation. In 1922, <b>he</b> <b>recommended</b> that most surface water supplies be filtered because those water sources were rarely protected from contamination.|$|R

25|$|While {{the above}} {{approach}} is technically correct, Devroye notes {{that it is}} linear {{in the value of}} k and in general is not a good choice. Instead <b>he</b> <b>recommends</b> using either rejection-based or table-based methods, depending on context.|$|E
25|$|Whether Bagno's {{points are}} valid {{or not is}} open to debate, {{especially}} the solutions <b>he</b> <b>recommends</b> for the problems {{he claims to have}} identified. Whereas some agree that he has captured the feelings of the Brazilians towards Brazil's linguistic situation well, his book (Linguistic Prejudice: What it Is, What To Do) has been heavily criticized by some linguists and grammarians, due to his unorthodox claims, sometimes asserted to be biased or unproven.|$|E
25|$|Places or {{backgrounds}} hence require, and reciprocally impose, order (often {{deriving from}} the spatial {{characteristics of the}} physical location memorized, in cases where an actual physical structure {{provided the basis for}} the 'places'). This order itself organizes the images, preventing confusion during recall. The anonymous author also advises that places should be well lit, with orderly intervals, and distinct from one another. <b>He</b> <b>recommends</b> a virtual 'viewing distance' sufficient to allow the viewer to encompass the space and the images it contains with a single glance.|$|E

Struggling to find meaning in their endless exploration, Captain James T. Kirk {{has applied for}} a promotion to vice admiral; <b>he</b> <b>recommends</b> Spock as his replacement. Meanwhile, Hikaru Sulu reunites with his family, Montgomery Scott works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and Nyota Uhura amicably end their relationship; Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock, his counterpart from the original timeline, has died.|$|E
25|$|With an {{appreciation}} that {{both men were}} {{to blame for the}} altercation, Banner gives Bond the assignment he craves: the rocket-powered X-2, which is designed to fly to the edge of outer space. The general insists, however, on piloting the first test flight at full power, despite strong pressure from his superior, Lieutenant General Bryan Shelby (Paul Fix), to let a younger man take on the dangerous job. When Bond is assigned to fly the last half-power test before the main flight, he goes to full power without authorization and barely survives a high-altitude bailout when the aircraft goes out of control. The base flight surgeon tells Banner that only a young, fit person could have survived, leading the general to accept a promotion and transfer. <b>He</b> <b>recommends</b> Colonel McKee as his successor. Although Banner offers to take Connie with him to his new assignment, she decides to stay with Bond.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, {{pitches and}} resins were used {{commonly}} as medicines. Pliny mentions {{a variety of}} tar-like substances being used as medicine, including cedria and pissinum. Cedria was the pitch and resin of the cedar tree, being equivalent to the oil of tar and pyroligneous acid which {{are used in the}} first stage of distilling creosote. <b>He</b> <b>recommends</b> cedria to ease the pain in a toothache, as an injection in the ear in case of hardness of hearing, to kill parasitic worms, as a preventative for impregnation, as a treatment for phthiriasis and porrigo, as an antidote for the poison of the sea hare, as a liniment for elephantiasis, and as an ointment to treat ulcers both on the skin and in the lungs. He further speaks of cedria being used as the embalming agent for preparing mummies. Pissinum was a tar water that was made by boiling cedria, spreading wool fleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them out.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>recommends</b> {{the work}} for those reading for pleasure, fiddlers, mountebanks seeking a crowd, those {{undertaking}} long sea voyages, and strolling players, as “a few ordinary properties is enough to set them up, and get money in any Town in England”. The {{extent to which these}} drolls were performed is almost impossible to tell. Some of the contents of The Wits were almost certainly edited by Kirkman from the many play scripts he owned. However, some of the drolls are known from versions that date before 1620. This suggests that, like so many plays, they existed in manuscript for many years before they were published. One droll, The Lame Commonwealth, a canting interlude extracted from The Beggars Bush, includes an additional section which seems to record stagecraft. Another droll from The Wits, Daphilo & Granida, is based on the play Granida by P.C. Hooft. Baskervill (1924) notes that a Christmas play collected from Keynsham, Somerset in 1822 contains a passage exhibiting a striking similarity to a passage from Daphilo & Granida, which suggests the text of Kirkman's droll was adapted for use in the folk play.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian-American {{business}} magnate George Soros warns in “Does the Euro have a Future?” {{that there}} is no escape from the “gloomy scenario” of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone’s political cohesion so long as “the authorities persist in their current course.” He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes <b>he</b> <b>recommends</b> include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus “the only way” to avert “another Great Depression” is the formation of a European Treasury.|$|E
500|$|On Earth, Peter Wiggin uses {{a global}} {{communication}} system to post political essays under the pseudonym [...] "Locke", hoping to establish {{himself as a}} respected orator and thence as a powerful politician.

Further, <b>he</b> <b>recommended</b> that field agents be briefed on the level of cover that they had during missions.|$|R
50|$|Barnes treated {{hypothyroidism}} by prescribing {{patients a}} {{daily dose of}} thyroid hormone. <b>He</b> <b>recommended</b> starting with a small dose, and then slowly increasing the dosage in monthly intervals until symptoms resolved and waking body temperature was between 97.8F and 98.2F. <b>He</b> also <b>recommended</b> never surpassing 3 grains of desiccated thyroid. For most patients, <b>he</b> <b>recommended</b> continuing thyroid medication for life at that optimal dose, though some could be slowly weaned off. Barnes used a desiccated thyroid extract, Armour Thyroid, almost exclusively, based on his anecdotal observation that it was superior to synthetic hormones.|$|R

500|$|Greenwood's {{work was}} {{independently}} reviewed by two separate individuals in [...] then a scholarly {{but not yet}} academic publication. The first reviewer, Daniel Cohen of Wood and Water magazine, praises Greenwood's theoretical approach, claiming {{that she had been}} [...] "braver" [...] than Luhrmann in maintaining a [...] "creative tension" [...] as both an insider and outsider. Asserting that Greenwood's use of anthropological terminology made for [...] "hard reading", he suspects that her use of the word [...] "magician" [...] would jar with many Pagans who would disagree with the manner in which she used it. In conclusion, <b>he</b> <b>recommends</b> it as a [...] "valuable but inexpensive book".|$|E

In 2003 Joshua Fogel called the book [...] "still an authority in the field", and Ritsumeikan University professor David Askew designated it [...] "the best introductory work on the Nanjing Incident in any language".
