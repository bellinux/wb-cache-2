5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, particular the woofer. Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both <b>drive-unit</b> and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
40|$|Integrated drive-units for {{electric}} vehicles (EV) with combined electric machines and power electronic components offer {{the chance to}} achieve compact and cost-optimized traction systems. The demand for high power-densities and the requirement of a reliable system operation lead to the necessity of an enhanced thermal management. In the present paper, the build-up of an integrated <b>drive-unit</b> with 2 x 20 kW is described. A thermal simulation model of the used traction machines, based on Cauer-networks and parameterized with FEM-simulations and measurements, allows an analysis of transient temperature profiles for various driving situations {{as well as a}} determination of internal temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Simple tests {{simulating}} {{drilling in}} a liquid-filled hole were done of an S-type Archimedean core drill, {{consisting of a}} <b>drive-unit,</b> a jacket, a shaft with a screw booster and a sweeper, and a barrel. The barrel length was 0. 9 m. The tests revealed that the clearance between the jacket and the barrel (which together made up an Archimedean pump) should be a little wider for drilling in a liquidfilled hole than in a dry hole. With the clearance of 7. 4 mm, the pump could transport ice chips to the storage space between the booster and the sweeper, where the booster compacted chips by squeezing {{a large portion of}} the liquid through the sweeper which was permeable to liquid. The porosity of compacted chips could be as low as 35 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{the lack}} of {{standard}} design method and the shortcomings of main functions of the existing drive circuit, a “Element-level Design under Transmission Voltage Switch Theory ” is set forth and a smallest circuit structure namely as <b>drive-unit,</b> which contains Superstratum-unit, Substratum-unit and LC-unit, is designed in this paper to achieve the necessary functions. The drive circuit of n×n ignition bridges has been got from the structure expansion formula along with the expected life estimation. The Ebers-Moll Model of transistor and the internal circuit of MOSFET were used to make a theoretical analysis and the conclusion of such analysis was verified by simulation subsequently. Actual measurement has been made and the results show that the circuit in simple structure has provided a strong loading ability and accurate output; some elements of the circuit have been heated when the circuit was working; and the response time of the circuit was of the microsecond-level...|$|E
40|$|The shutter {{of camera}} is {{a device that}} contols {{exposure}} time for the image sensor. A focal-plain-shutter is currently mainstream model of SLR Camera. The uneven-exposure is rarely occur at the manufacturing stage in the focal-plain-shutter. The uneven-exposure is phenomenon that photographs isn 2 ̆ 7 t able to be exposed. The unevenness-exposue cause is vibration of the shutter-blades. The cause of vibration is {{the gap between the}} shutter blades and pins. To reveal cause of the uneven-exposure, this study focuses on the backlash of arm with <b>drive-unit.</b> This study uses shutter-blades model for simple experiment. The experimental apparatus can drive the shutter-blade model with slider at high speed by spring force. To reveal the behavior during transient moving， two laser-displacement-meters measure the displacement gap of shutter-blade-model and slider. The results or experiments，it become clear that center of gravity and backlash size of shutter-blades model are important parameters. Rebound amount and interval time of peak to peak decrees as the backlash is decrees. ROMBUNNO. 15...|$|E
