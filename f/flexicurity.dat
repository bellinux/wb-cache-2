In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.|$|E
5000|$|Upon the {{adoption}} of the common principles of <b>flexicurity,</b> the Council called on the Member States to take them into account in drawing up and implementing [...] "national <b>flexicurity</b> pathways". Progress in the implementation of <b>flexicurity</b> strategies is reported by Member States in their National Reform Programmes and is monitored by the European Commission in the framework of the European Employment Strategy.|$|E
5000|$|The European Commission {{considers}} <b>flexicurity</b> as {{an integrated}} strategy to simultaneously enhance flexibility {{and security in}} the labour market. <b>Flexicurity</b> is designed and implemented across four policy components: 1) flexible and reliable contractual arrangements; 2) comprehensive lifelong learning strategies; 3) effective active labour market policies; and 4) modern social security systems providing adequate income support during employment transitions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flexicurity</b> {{has been}} criticized as [...] "a purely {{linguistic}} combination of opposites {{that can be applied}} to virtually any policy mix." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to recognize that the <b>flexicurity</b> concept has been developed in countries with high wages, besides clear progressive taxation, as in for example, Denmark.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, <b>flexicurity</b> {{is seen as}} a {{strategy}} to make labour markets significantly more inclusive in some of the European countries, by tackling labour market segmentation between insiders (workers well-established in stable, quality jobs) and outsiders (unemployed persons or in precarious employment who do not benefit from other advantages linked to a permanent contract, frequently youth, migrants, etc.). The relevance of <b>flexicurity</b> to tackle modern labour market challenges has also been recognised by the representatives of social partners at a transnational European level, by European Trade Union Confederation and BusinessEurope.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flexicurity</b> {{featured}} {{prominently in}} the Commission's response to the crisis, in the European Economic Recovery Plan of November 2008 and its follow up Communication [...] "Driving economic recovery" [...] of March 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{unemployment}} benefits and training provision that this system entail place a higher burden of taxation upon the higher-earning {{members of the}} Danish society. Denmark currently has high taxation rates which in part pay for generous social benefits. <b>Flexicurity</b> may thus favour low- to middle-income earners. However, this might partially be offset by Denmark's high-output growth which is coupled to low unemployment figures (2.8% in 2008) and similarly low social-exclusion rates. In recent years, Danes have been consistently ranked as the happiest nation on Earth, which has in part been attributed to aspects of Denmark's <b>flexicurity</b> model.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flexicurity</b> (a {{portmanteau}} {{of flexibility}} and [...] ) is a welfare state {{model with a}} pro-active labour market policy. The term was first coined by the social democratic Prime Minister of Denmark Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|A key Communication {{from the}} European Commission [...] "Towards Common Principles of Flexicurity: More and better jobs through {{flexibility}} and security" [...] {{was published in}} June 2007 defines <b>flexicurity</b> as an 'integrated approach' based on four interacting components.|$|E
5000|$|At the Council's request, the European Commission has {{launched}} the [...] "Mission for flexicurity", consisting of {{representatives of the}} French Presidency and the preceding Slovenian Presidency of the European Union and of the European social partners. The Mission took place between April and July 2008 in France, Sweden, Finland, Poland, and Spain, seeking to promote the implementation of <b>flexicurity</b> in different national contexts by raising {{the profile of the}} <b>flexicurity</b> approach and its common principles and by helping the relevant labour market actors to take ownership of the process. The Mission also had the objective of promoting the exchange of good practice and mutual learning between Member States. It reported to the Council in December 2008.|$|E
5000|$|The Government of Denmark views <b>flexicurity</b> as entailing a [...] "golden triangle" [...] with a [...] "three-sided mix of (1) {{flexibility}} in the labour market combined with (2) social security and (3) an {{active labour market policy}} with rights and obligations for the unemployed".|$|E
50|$|Social Democrat-led {{coalition}} governments (the Cabinets of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen I, II, III, IV) {{implemented the}} system known as <b>flexicurity</b> (flexibility and social security), mixing strong Scandinavian unemployment benefits with deregulated employment laws, {{making it easier}} for employers to fire and rehire people in order to encourage economic growth and reduce unemployment.|$|E
5000|$|Recognising the {{principle}} of a [...] "no size fits for all" [...] the European Commissions advocated for a progressive implementation of national, tailor-made, <b>flexicurity</b> strategies in all EU Member States supported by mutual learning, {{along the lines of}} commonly agreed principles. Such common principles were adopted on 5 December 2007 by the Employment and Social Affairs Council.|$|E
50|$|The European Social Agenda {{also plays}} a role in shaping the {{priorities}} of ESF spending. The Social Agenda seeks to update the 'European social model' by modernising labour markets and social protection systems so that workers and businesses can benefit from the opportunities created by international competition, technological advances and changing population patterns while protecting the most vulnerable in society. In addition, the concept of 'flexicurity' contributes to current ESF initiatives. <b>Flexicurity</b> can be defined as a policy strategy to enhance the flexibility of labour markets, work organisations and labour relations, on the one hand, and employment security and income security on the other. The term <b>flexicurity</b> encompasses a new approach to employment involving 'work for life' rather than the 'job for life' model of the past. It encourages workers to take charge of their working lives through lifelong training, adapting to change and mobility.|$|E
50|$|Liddle is {{currently}} chairman of Policy Network - an international think tank bringing together academics, policymakers and politicians across the progressive centre left; responsible for major projects {{on the future}} of the European Social Model, public service reform, immigration and integration, <b>flexicurity,</b> and globalisation and social justice. He is a visiting fellow of the European Institute at the London School of Economics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flexicurity</b> has {{therefore}} {{been adopted}} as a leitmotiv of the European employment strategy and the revised Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. In particular, the Guideline No.21 of the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Employment (adopted by the European Council {{and setting the}} objectives for the periods 2005-2008 and 2008-2010) calls on Member States to [...] "…promote flexibility combined with employment security and reduce labour market segmentation, having due regard {{to the role of}} the social partners".|$|E
50|$|<b>Flexicurity</b> is {{also seen}} {{as a way to}} {{preserve}} the European social model while maintaining and improving the competitiveness of the European Union. It is argued that, in the context of globalisation and technological change which place greater demands on business to adapt continuously, high levels of employment security will not depend only on protection of workers' specific job, but mainly on the means for workers to stay on the job market, manage smooth transitions between jobs, and make progress in their careers.|$|E
50|$|The European Commission also {{addresses}} {{this issue}} in its Joint Employment Report and its new <b>Flexicurity</b> approach, calling for an adequate method to enhance flexibility for both workers and employers that is “capable of quickly and effectively mastering new productive needs and skills and about facilitating the combination of work and private responsibilities.” ETUC also {{emphasizes the importance of}} the development of working time flexibility as an alternative to implementing external flexibility as the sole method of increasing flexibility in the labour market (ETUC, 2007).|$|E

5000|$|Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former Prime Minister of Denmark {{and leader}} of Venstre, has written books advocating minimal state {{influence}} on market activities. Denmark is a European leader on economic freedom indices.Denmark has ranked as the world's 11th [...] "most free" [...] economy, of 162 countries, in an index created by the Wall Street Journal and Heritage Foundation, the Index of Economic Freedom 2008, while keeping {{at the same time}} a huge public sector (58.4% of GDP), the highest tax burden among developed countries (48.2% of GDP) [...] and an extremely dense social security net (<b>Flexicurity).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{partnership}} between employers, trade unions and the government, whereby these social partners negotiate the terms to regulating the workplace among themselves, {{rather than the}} terms being imposed by law. Sweden has decentralised wage co-ordination, while Finland is ranked the least flexible. The changing economic conditions {{have given rise to}} fear among workers as well as resistance by trade unions in regards to reforms. At the same time, reforms and favourable economic development seem to have reduced unemployment, which has traditionally been higher. Denmark's Social Democrats managed to push through reforms in 1994 and 1996 (see <b>flexicurity).</b>|$|E
50|$|In the European Commission's approach, <b>flexicurity</b> {{is about}} {{striking}} {{the right balance}} between flexible job arrangements and secure transitions between jobs, so that more and better jobs can be created. The idea is that flexibility and security should {{not be seen as}} opposites but as complementary. Flexibility is about developing flexible work organisations where people can combine their work and private responsibilities; where they can keep their training up-to-date; and where they can potentially have flexible working hours. It is also about giving both employers and employees a more flexible environment for changing jobs. Security means 'employment security' - to provide people with the training they need to keep their skills up-to-date and to develop their talent as well as providing them with adequate unemployment benefits if they were to lose their job for a period of time.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Danish policymakers {{established}} a fiscal policy aimed at breaking the unemployment {{trend of the}} time and was further coupled to the first active labour market policy (ALMP) of 1994 which sought to reduce structural unemployment. Although some believed that the natural unemployment rate had simply increased, the Danish Government sought to improve the situation by implementing what came to be called the <b>flexicurity</b> model. The policy shift thus came about with the 1994 and 1996 labour market reforms, when the introduction of flexibility was linked to security through the continued provision of generous welfare schemes as well as the 'activation' of the labour force through a set of ALMPs. Activation in Denmark is regarded as [...] "a right and an obligation". The effects expected from this combination were twofold: qualification effects of the labour market policies (LMPs) as well as motivational effects through the welfare schemes.|$|E
5000|$|The Danish <b>flexicurity</b> {{model has}} its roots in the nineteenth century, when {{negotiations}} among employers and trade unions during the so-called September Compromise of 1899 (also called Labour Market Constitution) laid the ground for a mutually beneficial (profitable and secure) state. The 'Constitution' was revised in 1960 and renamed Basic Agreement. It settled the freedom of trade union association as well as the managerial prerogative to manage and divide the work including the right to hire and dismiss the labour force at any time necessary. [...] "It is thus important to understand that the Danish model of labour market regulation, including the right to form associations, is based on these voluntaristic principles and that legislation or interference of the state is kept on a minimum. The right of association and the recognition of labour market associations are based on the mutual recognition of conflicting interests." [...] The Danish tripartite agreements amongst employers, workers, and the state are supported by an intricate system that allows for an active response from the state, which supports the 'activation' of workers.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the concept of <b>flexicurity</b> and its effects in the {{termination}} of the employment contract in the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden. The main aim of the thesis is to describe and compare both legislations from <b>flexicurity</b> perspective and suggest changes in the czech legislation. Strategy of <b>flexicurity</b> {{is one of the most}} discussed topics not only in the field of labour law but also in the field of social security systems and active labour market policies during the past few years. The concept of <b>flexicurity</b> can in a simplified way be characterized as a policy approach that tries to combine the flexibility of labor markets and job security for employees. According to the experts, <b>flexicurity</b> could help solve issues such as globalization or effects of economic crisis and higher unemployment occured due to the crisis. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them dealing with different aspect of the concept of <b>flexicurity</b> and its application in the Czech Reoublic and the Kingdom of Sweden. Chapter One defines and explaines the concept of <b>flexicurity</b> as such, followed by examples of succesful European <b>flexicurity</b> models.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{concepts}} of <b>flexicurity</b> and mobication which were Coined {{in the context of}} European Employment Strategy. <b>Flexicurity</b> is an attempt to conciliate flexibility and security in the labor market and became a key concept within the EU's social agenda in the middle 2000 s. However, since Leehman Shock in 2008 <b>flexicurity</b> has been criticized severely. <b>Flexicurity</b> policies are considered ineffective in the midst of serious economic crisis. Instead, mobication started to garner attention. Mobication means mobility for education for all people, inside and outside the labor market. The paper analizes arguments concerning <b>flexicurity</b> and defines the significance of mobication in the context of European Employment Strategy.

40|$|The policy {{discourse}} termed <b>flexicurity</b> {{is on its}} way {{of becoming}} a concept. Yet, this political process bears the risk of departing from the very idea of <b>flexicurity.</b> This paper argues that this could be prevented if <b>flexicurity</b> were guided by a clear conception of human well-being. The paper suggests complementing <b>flexicurity</b> by the capabilityapproach. Random or adverse effects of flexicurity-policy on human freedom can be avoided if 'flexibility and security' in the employment system are recognised not as ends in themselves, but as instruments at the service of people's capabilities.

40|$|Abstract Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} and abundance of literature measuring <b>flexicurity</b> across countries. However, there is yet to be any agreement on the definition of the key concepts of <b>flexicurity</b> as well as the framework in which to base one’s research. Due to this, the outcomes found in the existing studies are rather diverse, far from reaching a consensus, and can be misleading. This paper addresses the issues by first introducing a framework, namely, the various levels and stages of <b>flexicurity,</b> as well as introducing some key issues that should be addressed when doing <b>flexicurity</b> indicators research. In addition, an empirical example is given to show how the framework derived can be used to carry out <b>flexicurity</b> research, and to show how by not regarding these frameworks one can come to misleading outcomes...|$|E
