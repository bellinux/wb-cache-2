5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the <b>effector</b> gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the <b>effector</b> gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to <b>effector</b> hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|Isotype {{or class}} {{switching}} is a biological process occurring after {{activation of the}} B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus <b>effector</b> functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE <b>effector</b> function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but {{with the ability to}} produce the <b>effector</b> function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.|$|E
5|$|Exogenous dsRNA is {{detected}} and bound by an <b>effector</b> protein, known as RDE-4 in C. elegans and R2D2 in Drosophila, that stimulates dicer activity. This protein only binds long dsRNAs, but the mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown. This RNA-binding protein then facilitates {{the transfer of}} cleaved siRNAs to the RISC complex.|$|E
50|$|<b>Effectors</b> {{are central}} to the {{pathogenic}} or symbiotic potential of microbes and microscopic plant-colonizing animals such as nematodes. <b>Effectors</b> typically are proteins that are delivered outside the microbe and into the host cell. These colonist-derived <b>effectors</b> manipulate the host's cell physiology and development. As such, <b>effectors</b> offer examples of co-evolution (example: a fungal protein that functions outside of the fungus but inside of plant cells has evolved to take on plant-specific functions). Pathogen host range is determined, among other things, by the presence of appropriate <b>effectors</b> that allow colonization of a particular host. Pathogen-derived <b>effectors</b> are a powerful tool to identify plant functions that play key roles in disease and in disease resistance. Apparently most <b>effectors</b> function to manipulate host physiology to allow disease to occur. Well-studied bacterial plant pathogens typically express a few dozen <b>effectors,</b> often delivered into the host by a Type III secretion apparatus. Fungal, oomycete and nematode plant pathogens apparently express a few hundred <b>effectors.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} type III <b>effectors</b> (T 3 <b>effectors)</b> from strains of Xanthomonas reveals a {{growing list of}} {{candidate}} and known <b>effectors</b> based on functional assays and sequence and structural similarity searches of genomic data. We propose that the <b>effectors</b> and suspected <b>effectors</b> should be distributed into 39 so-called Xop groups reflecting sequence similarity. Some groups have structural motifs for putative enzymatic functions, and recent studies have provided considerable insight into the interaction with host factors in their function as mediators of virulence and elicitors of resistance for a few specific T 3 <b>effectors.</b> Many groups are related to T 3 <b>effectors</b> of plant and animal pathogenic bacteria, and several groups appear to have been exploited primarily by Xanthomonas species based on available data.

5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at <b>effector</b> cells or <b>effector</b> molecules (see below).|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate <b>effector</b> hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the <b>effector</b> glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} RNA can {{downregulate}} gene expression by being complementary to {{a part of}} an mRNA or a gene's DNA. MicroRNAs (miRNA; 21-22nt) are found in eukaryotes and act through RNA interference (RNAi), where an <b>effector</b> complex of miRNA and enzymes can cleave complementary mRNA, block the mRNA from being translated, or accelerate its degradation.|$|E
40|$|Against {{friend and}} foe: Type 6 <b>effectors</b> in plant-associated {{bacteria}} Bacterial secretion systems play critical roles in communi-cation with neighboring bacteria {{and in the}} modulation of host immune responses via the secretion of small proteins called <b>effectors.</b> Several secretion systems have been identi-fied and these are denoted types I–VII. Of these, the type VI secretion system (T 6 SS) and its <b>effectors</b> were only recently elucidated. Most studies on the role and significance of the T 6 SS and its <b>effectors</b> have focused on human pathogens. In this review, type 6 <b>effectors</b> from plant-associated bene-ficial and pathogenic bacteria are discussed, including effec-tors from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Dickeya dadanti, Rhi-zobium leguminosarum, Pectobacterium atroseptium, Ral-stonia solanacearum, Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas protegens. Type 6 <b>effectors</b> act in symbiosis, biofilm formation, virulence, and interbacterial competition.

40|$|T {{helper cell}} (Th) 1, but not Th 2, <b>effectors</b> undergo rapid Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) -mediated, activation-induced cell death upon restimulation with antigen. Unequal {{apoptosis}} is also observed without restimulation, after a longer lag period. Both <b>effectors</b> undergo delayed apoptosis induced by a non–Fas-mediated pathway. When Th 1 and Th 2 <b>effectors</b> are co-cultured, Th 2 <b>effectors</b> survive preferentially, suggesting the responsible factor(s) is intrinsic to each population. Both Th 1 and Th 2 <b>effectors</b> express Fas and FasL, but only Th 2 <b>effectors</b> express {{high levels of}} FAP- 1, a Fas-associated phosphatase that may act to inhibit Fas signaling. The rapid death of Th 1 <b>effectors</b> leading to selective Th 2 survival provides a novel mechanism for differential regulation of the two subsets. Activation-induced cell death (AICD) 1 in CD 4 � Th has been widely studied. It is the mechanism of peripheral deletion of CD 4 � cells and is implicated {{in the loss of}} <b>effectors</b> during infectious diseases, especially those caused by viruses (1, 2).

40|$|Bacterial {{virulence}} often {{relies on}} secreted <b>effectors</b> that modulate eukaryotic signal transduction.

5|$|To combat {{pathogens}} that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, {{causing them}} to agglutinate.

By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate <b>effector</b> functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} <b>effector</b> cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction.

25|$|One major {{difference}} between regulatory T cells and <b>effector</b> T cells is that regulatory T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while <b>effector</b> T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle.

40|$|Microbial {{pathogens}} {{have evolved}} protein <b>effectors</b> to promote virulence and cause disease in host plants. Pathogen <b>effectors</b> delivered into plant cells suppress plant immune responses and modulate host metabolism {{to support the}} infection processes of pathogens. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as cellular signaling molecules to trigger plant immune responses, such as pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) -triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity. In this review, we discuss recent insights into the molecular functions of pathogen <b>effectors</b> that target multiple steps in the ROS signaling pathway in plants. The perception of PAMPs by pattern recognition receptors leads to the rapid and strong production of ROS through activation of NADPH oxidase Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologs (RBOHs) as well as peroxidases. Specific pathogen <b>effectors</b> directly or indirectly interact with plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors to induce ROS production and the hypersensitive response in plant cells. By contrast, virulent pathogens possess <b>effectors</b> capable of suppressing plant ROS bursts in different ways during infection. PAMP-triggered ROS bursts are suppressed by pathogen <b>effectors</b> that target mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Moreover, pathogen <b>effectors</b> target vesicle trafficking or metabolic priming, leading to the suppression of ROS production. Secreted pathogen <b>effectors</b> block the metabolic coenzyme NADP-malic enzyme, inhibiting the transfer of electrons to the NADPH oxidases (RBOHs) responsible for ROS generation. Collectively, pathogen <b>effectors</b> may have evolved to converge on a common host protein network to suppress the common plant immune system, including the ROS burst and cell death response in plants...|$|R
