50|$|Smuggling has a {{long and}} {{controversial}} history, probably {{dating back to the}} first time at which duties were imposed in any form, or any attempt was made to prohibit a form of traffic. Smuggling is often associated with efforts by authorities to prevent the importation of certain contraband items or non-taxed goods; however, there has also been smuggling based on illegally exporting goods. In England smuggling first became a recognised problem in the 13th century, following the creation of a national customs collection system by Edward I in 1275. Medieval smuggling tended to focus on the export of <b>highly</b> <b>taxed</b> export <b>goods</b> — notably wool and hides. Merchants also, however, sometimes smuggled other goods to circumvent prohibitions or embargoes on particular trades. Grain, for instance, was usually prohibited from export, unless prices were low, because of fears that grain exports would raise the price of food in England and thus cause food shortages and / or civil unrest. Following the loss of Gascony to the French in 1453, imports of wine were also sometimes embargoed during wars to try and deprive the French of the revenues that could be earned from their main export.|$|R

40|$|Economists have {{stressed}} that the efficiency costs of taxation are not the obvious costs to taxpayers of handing over payments to the government. Instead, the efficiency costs stem from the efforts of taxpayers to avoid paying money to the government, whether it is consuming less of the <b>taxed</b> <b>good,</b> producing less of the <b>taxed</b> <b>good,</b> smuggling, or just evading taxes. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to illustrate with historical examples the efficiency costs of taxation. Each type of tax (labor, capital, property) is shown to have particular disincentive effects, which, if the tax rates are sufficiently high, could be dramatic. The report concludes that the efficiency cost of taxation is often difficult to detect, and often takes a back seat to political considerations in tax policy.

40|$|Two-sided {{platform}} 8 ̆ 5 rms serve distinct customer {{groups that}} are connected through interdependent demand, and include major busi-nesses such as the media industry, banking, and the software industry. A well known result of tax incidence is that consumers of a more heav-ily <b>taxed</b> <b>good</b> pay a higher price and thus consume less of the good. The present paper shows that this result need not hold in a two-sided market. On the contrary, consumers may actually buy more of a good sold by a two-sided platform 8 ̆ 5 rm if the tax rate increases. In particu-lar, a higher ad valorem tax may not only lower the end-user price of the more heavily <b>taxed</b> <b>good,</b> but also the price charged to the other customer group.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive {{conditions}} under which optimal tax rates for addictive <b>goods</b> exceed <b>tax</b> rates for non-addictive consumption goods in a rational addiction framework where exogenous government spending cannot be financed with lump sum taxes. Standard static models that consider a revenue raising motive predict <b>taxing</b> addictive <b>goods</b> at a rate in excess of that observed in the data. In contrast, our dynamic results imply tax rates on addictive goods which are smaller than tax rates implied by the static framework. This is the case because high current tax rates on addictive goods tend to reduce future tax revenues, by making households less addicted in the future. Finally, we consider features of addictive goods such as complementarity to leisure that, while unrelated to addiction itself, are nonetheless common among some addictive goods. In general, such effects are weaker in our dynamic setting since if <b>taxing</b> addictive <b>goods</b> has strong positive revenue effects today, then <b>taxing</b> <b>goods</b> has a strong offsetting effect on future tax revenues...|$|R
