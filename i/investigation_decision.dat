40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that many financial and cost variables are non-normally distributed. For example, empirical studies of financial ratios and cost variance data have found non-normality. However, instead of identifying the correct distribution of these financial variables, many of these decision models (e. g. bankruptcy prediction, bond rating prediction, cost-volume-profit analysis and the cost variance <b>investigation</b> <b>decision)</b> have simply adopted an assumption of normality. This is contrary to the empirical evidence which has suggested that some of these input variables are non-normally distributed. The reason for this common adoption of the normal distribution assumption could be attributed to the lack of knowledge regarding the appropriate distribution function for the variable. In order to encourage the use of the appropriate distribution function for the required financial variable, this paper examines this aspect. The objective {{of this study is to}} assist in identifying an appropriate distribution function for modelling non-normally distributed accounting variables. A three-step procedure is described and actual cost variance data of a Fortune 500 company's manufacturing plant are used to illustrate the procedure. © 1993 Academic Press.

40|$|Abstract Background Grouping {{genes into}} {{clusters}} {{on the basis}} of similarity between their expression profiles has been the main approach to predict functional modules, from which important inference or further <b>investigation</b> <b>decision</b> could be made. While the univocal determination of similarity metric is important, current practices are normally involved with Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation, of which assumptions are not likely the case for high-throughput microarray data. Results We advocate the use of a novel metric - BayesGen - to measure similarity between gene expression profiles, and demonstrate its performance on two important applications: constructing genome-wide co-expression network, and clustering cancer human tissues into subtypes. BayesGen is formulated as the evidence ratio between two alternative hypotheses about the generating mechanism of a given pair of genes, and incorporates as prior knowledge the global characteristics of the whole dataset. Through the joint modelling of expected intensity levels and noise variances, it addresses the inherent nonlinearity and the association of noise levels across different microarray value ranges. The full Bayesian formulation also facilitates the possibility of meta-analysis. Conclusion BayesGen allows more effective extraction of similarity information between genes from microarray expression data, which has significant effect on various inference tasks. It also provides a robust choice for other object-feature data, as illustrated through the results of the test on synthetic data. </p...|$|E

40|$|Conceptual Knowledge Processing (CKP) is a {{knowledge}} management and data analysis technique that {{makes use of}} conceptual structures. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a CKP methodology that uses lattice theory to represent units of thought, or concepts. When FCA is used in software applications, it makes use of a process called Mixed Initiative. Mixed Initiative breaks down the roles of user and machine, allowing each to play to their strengths. This process allows the computer, which can process vast amounts of data, to produce interaction options from which the user can select. A human can interpret semantic knowledge contained within the data that a computer cannot. This synergy of user and computer allows complex tasks to be performed. Wille [Wil 99] proposed ten atomic tasks of CKP which are combined to make these more complex tasks. The ten tasks are exploration, search, recognition, identification, analysis, <b>investigation,</b> <b>decision,</b> improvement, restructuring and memorisation. Individually, these tasks represent facets of interaction with conceptual systems. This thesis uses the ten tasks of Conceptual Knowledge Processing {{as a framework for}} experimentation with applications that use Formal Concept Analysis. The applications used for this analysis are MailSleuth, SurfMachine, DSift, ImageSleuth and SearchSleuth. These applications approach various problems, using FCA as the primary knowledge structure and interaction framework. Each application uses various interface components and varying degrees and types of exposure to the FCA structures on which they are based. The connection between CKP tasks and interface exposure is then explored and reported...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} problem of {{providing}} incentives when {{there are more than}} one project. A principal has access to two (possibly correlated) projects which are managed by a single agent. Before undertaking a project, the agent-manager can spend some resources to investigate its quality, namely its probability of success. Only projects with a high probability of success are profitable, and therefore should be invested in. There are two classes of strategies. First, the manager may investigate only one project to save on investigation costs, but still use the acquired information to make an investment decision on the noninvestigated project. Second, the manager could investigate both projects, and make the investment decision based on the acquired information on each project. Comparing these two strategies, {{it would seem that the}} more correlated are the projects, the better it is to investigate only one project and use the acquired information to learn about the other project. And, when correlation is low, both projects should be investigated. There is, however, a third strategy that the principal could use. He could hire two agents, each managing one project. By making each agent's compensation dependent on the outcome of the project of the other agent, the principal creates some form of competition between them. When projects are highly correlated, endogenous competition provides incentives but duplicate investigation costs, while having one manager investigating only one project exploits informational economies of scale by economizing on investigation costs, but does not always yield the best investment decision since information on the noninvestigated project is not perfect. We assume that the <b>investigation</b> <b>decision</b> is private to the manager (moral hazard), as well as the information obtained doing so (adverse selection). We then show that the optimal structure depends, among other things, on the degree of correlation between the returns of the two projects. In general, delegating to one manager and investigating both projects is optimal when the projects are weakly correlated; delegating to two managers is optimal for intermediate values of the correlation coefficient, while delegating to one manager and investigating only one project may be optimal when projects are strongly correlated, depending on parameter values. We show that, for some parameter values, it may never be optimal to delegate to one manager and investigate only one project, and this even when projects are perfectly correlated. Endogenous competition is then optimal as it minimizes the cost of providing incentives to the managers, even though investigation costs are duplicated. In that case, delegating to two managers becomes optimal for intermediate and high values of the correlation coefficient. ...|$|E

Fifty cases of abdominal injury admitted in the surgical wards of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital over 2 years have been studied here. All the patients underwent laparotomy for their management. The age range of the patient was 14 to 70 years and most commonly involved age group was 21 to 30 years. Male to female ratio was 15. 6 : 1. The incidence of penetrating injury predominated (64 %) over non-penetrating injury and majority had stab injuries. Road traffic accident predominated in blunt injury.

40|$|Information {{ambiguity}} is {{prevalent in}} organizations and may in¯uence management decisions. This study examines, given imprecise probabilities or outcomes, how managers decide which department's performance to investigate further {{when they are}} provided with performance benchmarks expressed in numerical intervals. Seventy-nine MBA students participated in two experiments involving <b>investigation</b> <b>decisions.</b> We presented participants with interval benchmarks of a ®rm's expenses.

We found that, when facing outcome ambiguity, our participants consistently preferred to investigate further those departments whose performance was described as having an ambiguous outcome �when the outcome's range was centered either below or above the interval benchmark). However, when facing probabilistic ambiguity, there were two predominant choice patterns: consistently choosing to investigate the department whose performance is described with an ambiguous probability, or consistently choosing to investigate the department with unambiguous performance. To gain further insight, we conducted...|$|R
40|$|Controlling and {{monitoring}} unmanned vehicles is a cognitively demanding task, particularly when searching environments for potential {{improvised explosive devices}} (IEDs). Due to the diversity of methods used to construct IEDs, unreliable information {{about the potential for}} harm may be provided to operators. Also, warfighters may search environments that are sparsely or heavily populated. Few researchers have manipulated information reliability and task criticality jointly, though these constructs often co-vary in real task situations such as IED search.

40|$|The <b>decisions</b> on <b>investigation</b> of cost {{deviations}} {{have been}} generally {{discussed in the}} cost control literature assuming deviations are monitored and reported at {{a certain level of}} aggregation. This paper focuses on the relationship between the level of aggregation of the reporting system and the effectiveness of the investigating decisions. It suggests that, by incorporating into the decision process the prior knowledge managers have about the deviation sources, the deviation report could be further disaggregated leading to improved <b>investigation</b> <b>decisions.</b> This is done by using the reported deviation to update the prior distribution of its possible sources in a Bayesian manner. The resulting system is less costly to monitor than a system which monitors all the possible sources of a deviation, although it is less exact. The paper illustrates how the selection of the optimal level of aggregation should be made simultaneously with the information system and the decision rules. ...|$|R
