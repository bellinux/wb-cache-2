On 23 May 2011, the Belarusian ruble depreciated 56% against the United States dollar. The depreciation was even steeper {{on the black market}} and financial collapse seemed imminent as citizens rushed to exchange their rubles <b>for</b> <b>dollars,</b> euros, durable goods, and canned goods.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–2008, the governor of the People's Bank of China explicitly named the reserve currency status of the US dollar as a contributing factor to global savings and investment imbalances that led to the crisis. As such the Triffin dilemma is related to the Global Savings Glut hypothesis because the dollar's reserve currency role exacerbates the U.S. current account deficit due to heightened demand <b>for</b> <b>dollars.</b>|$|E
25|$|In March and April in {{a series}} of laws and {{executive}} orders, the government suspended the gold standard. Roosevelt stopped the outflow of gold by forbidding the export of gold except under license from the Treasury. Anyone holding significant amounts of gold coinage was mandated to exchange it for the existing fixed price of US dollars. The Treasury no longer paid out gold in exchange <b>for</b> <b>dollars,</b> and gold would no longer be considered valid legal tender for debts in private and public contracts.|$|E

25|$|The loan {{was made}} subject to conditions, the most {{damaging}} {{of which was the}} convertibility of sterling. Though not the intention, the effect of convertibility was to worsen British post-war economic problems. International sterling balances became convertible one year after the loan was ratified, on 15 July 1947. Within a month, nations with sterling balances (e.g. pounds which they had earned from buying British exports, and which they were now permitted to sell to Britain in exchange <b>for</b> <b>dollars)</b> had drawn almost a billion dollars from British dollar reserves, forcing the British government to suspend convertibility and to begin immediate drastic cuts in domestic and overseas expenditure. The rapid loss of dollar reserves also highlighted the weakness of sterling, which was duly devalued in 1949 from $4.02 to $2.80.|$|E
