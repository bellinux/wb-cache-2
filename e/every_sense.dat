5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars.

5|$|Although the Persian forces put up stout resistance, {{the heavily}} {{armoured}} Greek hoplites again proved themselves superior in combat, and eventually routed the Persian troops, who fled to their camp.

The complete destruction of the Persian navy, along with the destruction of Mardonius's army at Plataea (allegedly on the same day as the Battle of Mycale), decisively ended the invasion of Greece.

30|$|Three soft SSDF attack {{models have}} been widely adopted to test various secure sensing algorithms: Always Yes[13], Always No[14, 15], and Always Adverse[16]. In Always Yes soft SSDF attack, an {{attacker}} raises its local observations by injecting a positive offset in <b>every</b> <b>sensing</b> slot. In Always No attack, an attacker decreases its local observations by injecting a negative offset in <b>every</b> <b>sensing</b> slot. In Always Adverse attack, an attacker firstly performs a local binary hypothesis testing between H 0 and H 1 by comparing its energy observation with a predefined threshold, with H 0 denoting {{the case that the}} primary signal is absent and H 1 otherwise; then, the malicious SU raises its observations when its local binary decision is H 0 and decreases its observations when its decision is H 1. One main limitation of the existing soft SSDF attack models is that they are oversimplified and not general enough to serve as the baseline for the design of counter-attack or secure sensing algorithms.|$|R

He developed a single-minded, thoroughly uncompromising Cubism without the diversion of a classical alternative. During the 1920s Gleizes worked on a highly abstract brand of Cubism. In addition to his shows at Léonce Rosenberg's L'Effort Moderne, the dealer-publisher Povolozky printed his writings. His art was indeed backed by a prodigious theoretical effluence, most notably in La Peinture et ses lois (first published in La Vie des Lettres, October 1922). Gleizes fused aesthetic, metaphysical, moral and social priorities to describe the status and function of art.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the duties}} of the Czech President can be said to be {{ceremonial}} to one degree or another, especially since the President has relatively few powers independent of the will of the Prime Minister.

In matters of war, he is in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> merely a figurehead, since the constitution gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the parliament.

Although Robin states that Patrick could see his child as much as he wants, she does not believe he is fully {{committed}} or prepared to give up his bachelorhood for a family. He takes her to court and only after his moving testimony does she realize Patrick truly wants this, her and their child, their family. They wait for their baby as a happy, loving committed couple. On August 12, 2008, Patrick and Robin learn their baby is a girl. As Patrick goes into full panicked father mode, Robin tries to calm him down. Later, when Patrick sees Robin with Jason, he expresses his concern that he does not want his child to be around such a dangerous target and Robin agrees.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we first}} review the {{definition}} of traditional detection probability and present its limitations. Then, the concept and definition of our TDP is presented. Without loss of generality, a periodic sensing scheme is considered (i.e., in <b>every</b> <b>sensing</b> interval, a secondary user senses the channel of interest during the sensing duration). We assume that the sensing duration is relatively short compared to the sensing interval and the mean busy and idle periods of primary users are relatively long compared to the sensing interval. Based on these assumptions, {{the probability that a}} primary signal changes its state during the sensing duration is very small, and thus considered as being negligible in this article.|$|R
