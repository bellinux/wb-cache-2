The basic idea is that an exposure period, such as an accident year or policy year, gives rise to a particular distribution of accident date lags, where the accident date lag is the time elapsed {{from the start of the}} exposure pedod till the accident date. The paper shows how to derive the density of the accident date lag from a familiar parallelogram diagram. A fairly general theory of development is then presented and simplified under certain conditions to arrive at a total development random variable whose cumulative distribution is related to the usual percent of ultimate development curve. After presenting the theory, the paper tums to practical applications. Simulation is used to generate consistent pattems for different exposure pedods.

I conclude that variation in the egg-production capacity of females that lose their eggs early and late (probably age/experience effects) drives the seasonal declines in renesting rates.

40|$|As {{in other}} less {{developed}} {{countries in the region}} and elsewhere, cancers are becoming a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Jordan. Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in women and the third most common cancer in men. In Jordan, CRC is the second most common cancer in women and the most common in men. There is little known about survival from CRC in Jordan and few survival studies have been conducted in comparable Eastern Mediterranean countries. As the first study of its type in Jordan, this thesis aimed at estimating CRC survival among Jordanian patients and comparing them with survival estimates among other populations. The thesis explored the relationship between CRC and socio-demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatment, diabetes mellitus – for which the prevalence in Jordan is very high - and treatment sites. The study augmented existing Jordan Cancer Registry data by gathering additional case mix information and completing missing fields. CRC was classified according to international classification of oncology (ICD-O third edition in addition to the International Classification of Diseases, ICD- 10) as C 18. 0 -C 20. 9. The vital status of the patients was ascertained from Civil Registration Bureau based on use of the unique National Identification number of the patients with follow-up to 31 December, 2010. The survival duration of each case was determined as the time difference (in days) between the date of incidence (index date) and the date of death, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> to follow-up or the closing date for follow-up (31 December, 2010). Observed and relative CRC survival rates were calculated among a study population of 1, 896 Jordanian colorectal patients aged 15 to 99 years of age, diagnosed with first invasive primary CRC from January 2003 to December 2007. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the observed survival probability over time. The logrank test was used to estimate whether the difference in survival estimates was statistically significant between the groups. The complete approach of estimation of observed survival probability was used. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess the effect of each variable after simultaneously controlling the effects of potential confounders. With half of the sample aged 60 years and above, males were predominant (55. 5 percent) with the majority of the sample (75. 4 percent) residing in the central part of Jordan. The vast majority of the cases (63. 5 percent) were diagnosed with colon cancer, with regional metastasis present in 58. 9 percent. No significant difference was found in the distribution of colon and rectum cancer by sex. Adenocarcinoma was the most commonly found tumor (84. 4 percent) compared to mucinous tumors which was found in 7. 8 percent of the patients. In addition, 62. 7 percent of the cases were classified as moderate and 14. 9 percent as poor. The percentages of rectum cancer patients with moderate and poor/anaplastic types of cancer were higher than in colon cancer patients. The majority of patients (77. 9 percent) underwent surgery, which was mostly elective (82. 0 percent). A significantly higher occurrence of these elective surgeries was found among rectum cancer (87. 7 percent) than colon cancer patients (78. 7 percent). Curative treatment was found to be a more common form of treatment for colorectal cancer patients (76. 5 percent) than palliative (23. 5 percent). Of those undergoing surgery, 4. 8 percent has died within 30 -days of resection, with a significantly lower mortality among patients aged ≤ 65 years (2. 9 percent) than the over 65 years age group (7. 1 percent). Thirty days postoperative mortality was significantly higher among colon cancer patients (5. 3 percent), patients with more advanced tumours and those who underwent emergency operations. Results of this study revealed that the incidence of CRC in the Jordanian population to be low compared to developed countries. However, this low incidence is similar to CRC incidence rates in other countries in the region. During the 5 -year study period, the overall crude colorectal cancer incidence rate for males was 5. 6 per 100, 000 population, and 5. 1 per 100, 000 populations in females. The overall Age Standardized colorectal incidence rate (ASR) among males was 15. 5 per 100, 000 populations compared to 12. 5 per 100, 000 populations among females. For colon cancer, the crude incidence rate was 5. 4 per 100, 000 populations in males and 4. 1 per 100 000 populations in females, while ASR for males was 11. 1 and 8. 4 for females. Alternatively, the crude incidence rate for rectum cancer was 3. 0 per 100, 000 population for males and 2. 4 per 100, 000 population for females, and the respective ASR incidence rates was 6. 1 per 100, 000 males and 4. 9 per 100, 000 females. Unexpectedly, results showed a high percentage (13. 8 percent) of CRC patients among the young age groups (i. e. less than 40 years of age) with insignificant differences between the sexes. The age specific incidence rates were found to increase with age. The study revealed that 5 -year observed and relative survival probabilities for colorectal cancer to be 57. 7 and 61. 3 percent respectively, with higher probability for colon cancer. These results showed good survival estimates of colorectal cancer compared to developed countries as well as the most developed countries in the region and across the Asian continent. The slightly higher observed colorectal survival rates among females were found to be insignificantly different than those for males. Patients aged 45 through 59 years had the highest survival estimates among all age groups, and the 75 years and above age group the lowest. The highest survival estimates were found among patients living in the central parts of Jordan, and the poorest was significantly noted in the south. Moreover, the observed and relative survival estimates were consistently highest during Year 1 and lowest during Year 5. Mucinous and serous tumors showed the poorest survival rates among the colorectal cancer, with higher 5 -year relative survival rates among the mucinous and serous type of colon (52. 4 percent) compared to rectum cancer (42. 8 percent). With {{more than half of the}} colon patients (57. 2 percent) and rectal patients (62 percent) having a regional spread; a higher proportion of colon cancers (24. 1 percent) were found to have distant metastasis, than rectum cancer patients (20. 5) and an equally low (11 percent) had localized CRC at diagnosis. Results also showed that observed and relative survival rates from localized and regional colon cancer were better than survival from rectum cancer in the same stages at 1, 3 and 5 -years of diagnosis. Results also indicated that observed survival became poorer with increasing age for both localized and regional tumours. This observation was applicable for both males and females. In recognizing appropriate surgery as the most important aspect of colorectal cancer treatment, the observed survival probability for colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgery was found significantly higher than that for patients who did not undergo surgery. This scenario was similarly observed for both colon and rectum. Conversely, the overall relative survival rates for patients who underwent surgery declined from 96. 2 percent to 62. 6 percent between the first and fifth year and from 86. 5 percent to 23. 5 percent for patients who did not undergo surgery. In addition, no significant difference was found between colorectal survival estimates for patients who underwent elective surgery and those who underwent emergency surgery. This was held true for both colon and rectum cancer. A multivariable analyses done to examine the adjusted odds of death within 30 days of surgery and selected variables revealed that the odds of dying were significantly higher among colorectal cancer patients older than 65 years (OR 2. 3, 95 percent CI: 1. 3 - 4. 1), those with distant tumors (OR 3. 6, 95 percent CI: 2. 0 - 6. 2); and those who were operated upon as an emergency (OR 2. 3, 95 percent CI: 1. 2 - 4. 1). Study findings indicated that colorectal cancer patients who received chemotherapy treatment had better survival for almost the first four years. However this was not a statistically significant result. Similarly, colon cancer patients who received chemotherapy treatment had better survival rates for nearly four years, compared to rectum cancer patients had better survival rates for the first two years from receiving chemotherapy. In terms of treatment sites (hospitals), results showed that 32. 4 percent of cases were treated at public health facilities, 23. 4 percent at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC), 18. 4 percent at the teaching hospitals, 16. 8 percent at the private health facilities, and only 9. 1 percent at other sites. The results of Cox proportional hazards ratios, after adjusting for age, extent of disease, place of residence, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and intent of treatment, have shown that patients who received treatment in private hospitals as well as in the King Hussein Cancer Center, had better survival rates compared to those who received their treatment in the public sector. Finally, this study revealed that the mean survival for colorectal cancer patients with diabetes mellitus was significantly lower than that for patients without diabetes (Log-Rank test, p= 0. 0359). The study also revealed a significant relationship between diabetes mellitus and colon cancer survival, where diabetic patients with colon cancer were less likely to survive compared to non-diabetic patients with colon cancer. However, no significant association was observed regarding diabetic patients with rectum cancer. In addition, multivariate analysis identified diabetes mellitus as a significant predictor associated with lower observed survival, where diabetic patients were one and one-half times more likely to be at risk of dying compared to non-diabetic patients. Age group 75 years or older, regional and distant metastasis of disease were shown to be independent prognostic factors for observed survival in this multivariate analysis. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that age, place of residency, extent of disease, and morphology to be significant predictors for colorectal cancer survival. Colon cancer patients aged 75 years and above had 2. 2 times higher risk of death than those aged 44 years or less (HR= 2. 2, 95 percent CI: 1. 5 - 3. 1). Rectum cancer patients residing in the central region of the country had a 27 percent lower risk of death compared with those who resided in the North (HR= 0. 73, 95 percent CI: 0. 56 - 0. 95). Colon and rectum cancer patients with regional metastasis had three times and one and the half times higher risk of death than those with localized disease respectively (Colon: HR= 3. 3, 95 percent CI: 2. 0 - 5. 6); (Rectum: HR= 1. 6, 95 percent CI: 1. 1 - 2. 5). Moreover, colon patients with distant metastasis had fourteen times higher risk of death and rectum cancer patients portrayed four and the half times higher risk of death than those with localized disease (Colon: HR= 14. 0, 95 percent CI: 8. 0 - 23. 8); (Rectum: HR= 1. 6, 95 percent CI: 2. 8 - 7. 5). Colon patients with poor or anaplastic grade had almost twice the risk of death than those with well grade (HR= 1. 9, 95 percent CI: 1. 1 - 3. 2). On the other hand, patients diagnosed with mucinous rectum cancer had 1. 4 times higher risk of death than those with adenocarcinoma (HR= 1. 4, 95 percent CI: 1. 1 - 2. 1). Sex, grade and year of diagnosis were insignificant predictors across all three models (CRC, colon and rectum). The main highlights of the study findings included a higher than expected incidence and a poorer than expected colorectal survival among the younger population, a large variation in survival rates based on the place of residency, and a significantly poorer survival among diabetic patients. Results of this study prompted a set of recommendations to assist national efforts in preventing and improving the survival of colorectal cancer in Jordan. These recommendations included various actions and measures to strengthen health service provision; assure provision of health care by expanding services; improve monitoring by promoting policy and research; and improve and strengthen data quality measures. Specifically, the study recommended screening to be made at a younger age in Jordan than in other developed countries as a result of the high percentage of CRC (13. 8 percent) among young age groups (< 40 year) that was reported in the study. Conducting further research to investigate the reasons for poor survival rates among younger CRC patients is presented as a strong study recommendation. In addition, introducing managed clinical networks as an approach for reducing the variation in survival between the different hospitals was presented as a worthwhile recommendation. Undoubtedly, improving public health efforts to reduce the prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus, in addition to undertaking further research to explain the increased mortality among diabetic colorectal patients are presented as valuable recommendations in this study. Finally, the study recommended that the Jordan Cancer Registry play a major role in following-up with cancer patients to examine the quality of cancer services that they receive...|$|E

Because presence or absence of air sacs is correlated with the anatomy of the hyoid bone, a probable minimal and maximal <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> air sacs can be estimated from fossil hyoid bones: Australopithecus afarensis did still have air sacs about 3. 3 Myr ago, while Homo heidelbergensis, some 600 kyr ago and Homo neandethalensis some 60 kyr ago, did no longer. The reduced distinctiveness of articulations produced with an air sac is in line with the hypothesis that air sacs were selected against because of the evolution of complex vocal communication. This relation between complex vocal communication and fossil evidence may help to get a firmer estimate of when speech first evolved. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|Proper {{management}} of resources in construction projects can yield substantial savings in time and cost. As construction is a labor-intensive industry, this paper focuses on labor productivity in the construction industry. This study considers the current state-of-the-art issues relevant to this subject. It covers the construction labor productivity definitions, aspects, measurements, factors affecting it, different techniques used for measuring it and modeling techniques. The main outcome from the literature {{is that there is}} no standard definition of productivity. This study provides a guide for necessary steps required to improve construction labor productivity and consequently, the project performance. It can help improve the overall performance of construction projects through the implementation of the concept of benchmarks. Also, it gives an up to <b>date</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> productivity measurement for construction productivity claims. Two major case studies, from the literature, are presented to show construction labor productivity rates, factors affecting construction labor productivity and how to improve it...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fellmer, the landowner, {{was a young}} widower, whose mother, {{still in}} the prime of life, had {{returned}} to her old position in the family mansion since the death of her son's wife in the year after her marriage, at the birth of a fragile little girl. From the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> his <b>loss</b> to the present time, Fellmer had led an inactive existence in the seclusion of the parish; a lack of motive seemed to leave him listless. He had gladly reinstated his mother in the gloomy house, and his main occupation now lay in stewarding his estate, which was not large. Mrs. Fellmer, who had sat beside him under Halborough this morning, was a cheerful, straightforward woman, who did her marketing and her alms-giving in person, was fond of old-fashioned flowers, and walked about the village on very wet days visiting the parishioners. These, the only two great ones of Narrobourne, were impressed by Joshua's eloquence as much as the cottagers.|$|R
50|$|Humans are {{the only}} primate species that have {{undergone}} significant hair <b>loss</b> and <b>of</b> the approximately 5000 extant species of mammal, only a handful are effectively hairless. This list includes elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, walruses, some species of pigs, whales and other cetaceans, and naked mole rats. Most mammals have light skin that is covered by fur, and biologists believe that early human ancestors started out this way also. Dark skin probably evolved after humans lost their body fur, because the naked skin was vulnerable to the strong UV radiation as explained in the Out of Africa hypothesis. Therefore, evidence {{of the time when}} human skin darkened has been used to <b>date</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> human body hair, assuming that the dark skin was needed after the fur was gone.It was expected that <b>dating</b> the split <b>of</b> the ancestral human louse into two species, the head louse and the pubic louse, would <b>date</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> body hair in human ancestors. However, {{it turned out that the}} human pubic louse does not descend from the ancestral human louse, but from the gorilla louse, diverging 3.3 million years ago. This suggests that humans had lost body hair (but retained head hair) and developed thick pubic hair prior to this date, were living in or close to the forest where gorillas lived, and acquired pubic lice from butchering gorillas or sleeping in their nests.The evolution of the body louse from the head louse, on the other hand, places the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> clothing much later, some 100,000 years ago.|$|R
40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 24 months post <b>date</b> <b>of</b> publicationComplete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> {{vision is}} one of the most feared {{sequelae}} of retinal disease. Currently, there are few if any treatment options available to patients that may slow or prevent blindness in diseases caused by photoreceptor loss, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Electronic restoration of vision has emerged over recent years as a safe and viable option for those who have lost substantial numbers of photoreceptors and who are severely vision impaired. Indeed, there has been a dramatic increase in our understanding of what is required to restore vision using an electronic retinal prosthesis. Recent reports show that for some patients, restoration of vision to the point of reading large letters is possible. In this review, we examine the types of implants currently under investigation and the results these devices have achieved clinically. We then consider a range of engineering and biological factors that may need to be considered to improve the visual performance of newer-generation devices. With added research, it is hoped that the level of vision achieved with newer generation devices will steadily improve, resulting in enhanced quality of life for those with severe vision impairment.

50|$|The {{first law}} to authorize {{taxation}} of former citizens {{was passed in}} 1966; it created Internal Revenue Code Section 877, which allowed the U.S.-source income of former citizens to be taxed for up to 10 years following the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> their <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> citizenship. Section 877 was first amended in 1996, {{at a time when}} the issue of renunciation of U.S. citizenship for tax purposes was receiving a great deal of public attention; the same attention resulted in the passage of the Reed Amendment, which attempted to prevent former U.S. citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation from obtaining visas, but which was never enforced. The American Jobs Creation act of 2004 amended Section 877 again. Under the new law, any individual who had a net worth of $2 million or an average income tax liability of $139,000 for the five previous years who renounces his or her citizenship is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to additional taxes. Furthermore, with certain exceptions covered expatriates who spend at least 31 days in the United States in any year during the 10-year period following expatriation were subject to US taxation as if they were U.S. citizens or resident aliens.|$|R

40|$|The {{stem borer}} species that infest sorghum and pearl millet are listed. At ICRISAT Center in India, loss in grain yield due to Chilo partellus damage in sorghum was {{estimated}} by two methods. These experiments involving the phased use of carbofuran, or artificial infestation using laboratory-reared first instar larvae showed that maximum grain yield loss occurred when infestation took place 15 - 30 days after crop emergence. The {{maximum number of}} deadhearts was formed when infestation took place during this period. Stem tunneling caused by later infestations did not cause a reduction in grain yield. In two studies at the ICRISAT Sahelian Center in Niger, results showed that under low levels of borer infestation (caused by Coniesta ignefusalis), a nonprotected pearl millet crop gave slightly higher yields than one that was protected by insecticide. In a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> sowing trial, <b>losses</b> were heavier on late-sown millet {{with an increase in}} proportion of nonproductive tillers.

40|$|The {{orbit and}} {{instrumental}} {{measurement of the}} Gravity Field and Steady State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite mission offer the highest ever resolution capabilities for mapping Earth's gravity field from space. However, past analysis predicted that GOCE would not detect changes in ice sheet mass. Here we demonstrate that GOCE gravity gradiometry observations can be combined with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity data to estimate mass changes in the Amundsen Sea Sector. This refined resolution allows land ice changes within the Pine Island Glacier (PIG), Thwaites Glacier, and Getz Ice Shelf drainage systems to be measured at respectively ? 67 ?±? 7, ? 63 ?±? 12, and ? 55 ?±? 9 Gt/yr over the GOCE observing period of November 2009 to June 2012.
