500|$|Juste Debout {{was founded}} in 2002 by Bruce Ykanji in Paris. Competition {{categories}} include popping, hip-hop, locking, house, toprock, and experimental. Breaking is not included to put more focus on dance styles performed while standing up, hence the name (French for <b>Just</b> <b>Standing).</b> <b>There</b> are not any team trophies at Juste Debout. The experimental and toprock categories are only for solo dancers; popping, new style, locking, and house are for duos. In 2008, Ingrid [...] "Shéyen" [...] Gamboa, the editor-in-chief of Juste Debout magazine, {{wrote a book called}} Hip-hop: L'histoire de la danse (Hip Hop: A history of the dance).|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Carey described going under-cover as the stalker role: [...] "Well, {{we had a lot}} of people outside. I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there were a lot of people <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole. It is what it is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{began their}} third {{nationwide}} tour on 18 May 1963, the bill this time headed by Roy Orbison. Orbison had established even greater UK chart success than either Montez or Roe, with eight previous chart entries of his own—four of them entering the top 10, including the #2 [...] "Dream Baby" [...] and the #1 [...] "Only the Lonely"—and {{was about to}} achieve his next top 10 entry with [...] "Falling", which entered the charts during the tour. However, at the tour's opening show, staged at the Adelphi Cinema, Slough, the American star proved less popular than The Beatles, just as had happened with Roe and Montez throughout the previous nationwide tour. As events unfolded it became obvious this {{was not going to}} change, and a week into the tour the covers of the souvenir programs were reprinted to place The Beatles above Roy Orbison. Despite The Beatles' ascent {{to the top of the}} bill, Starr was impressed with the response Orbison still commanded. Starr recalled, [...] "We would be backstage, listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just doing it by his voice. <b>Just</b> <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> singing, not moving or anything." [...] The third tour had a duration of three weeks, and ended on 9 June 1963.|$|E
5000|$|Flynn {{requested}} that the Holy See assign a coadjutor archbishop, and on April 24, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed John Clayton Nienstedt, Bishop of the Diocese of New Ulm, Minnesota, as Flynn's coadjutor. In January 2008, Flynn, citing a Vatican instruction from 2004, ordered {{an end to the}} practice of lay preaching at Mass, sending as the end date for the practice his final day as Archbishop. He said: [...] "There has to be that kind of training and theological background that even a person with a master's degree in theology would not have. The church does not want people <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> up <b>there</b> and giving opinions or even things they've read in books." ...|$|R

2500|$|Pryor is in tears, {{with blood}} {{running down her}} neck, in a {{videotape}} made by artist Clayton Patterson. Another video made by freelance cameraman Paul Garrin shows officers swinging clubs at him and slamming him against a wall. [...] Photographer John McBride, taking still photos of the riot that were {{to be published in}} The Village Voice, was also struck by a policeman's nightstick in the same attack taped by Garrin. Mr. Fish, a travel promoter out for an evening on the town, attempted to hail a taxi on Avenue A near Sixth Street when he was suddenly struck on the head. [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> watching," [...] he said. [...] "The next thing that I remember is seeing the stick, and then a young woman who was helping me." [...] Patterson's videotape showed that no officers helped Fish until an ambulance arrived. A police helicopter hovered over the scene, contributing to a sense of chaos.|$|E
2500|$|Underwood {{confirmed}} that she began planning {{a new album}} in August 2013 and would start prep work sometime in 2014. Underwood told Billboard, [...] "After The Sound of Music, I feel like I can really buckle down and start working on the next album." [...] Underwood also stated she has been planning another tour, which might be toned down from her earlier ones, stating, [...] "I haven't thought about it much because I don't know what the next album {{is going to sound}} like, but I like <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> and singing, too. I may take a different approach, a more simple approach on the next one. I loved the energy that rock concerts had," [...] Underwood told Billboard. Underwood is featured on Miranda Lambert's album Platinum, on a song called [...] "Somethin' Bad". Released as a single, [...] "Somethin' Bad" [...] reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming Underwood's 13th number-one on the chart. The same week, the song vaulted to No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
2500|$|As [...] "In Dreams" [...] was {{released}} in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace guitarist Duane Eddy {{on a tour of}} the UK in top billing with the Beatles, whose popularity was on the rise. When he arrived in Britain, however, he saw the amount of advertising devoted to the quartet and realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of them and, annoyed, asked rhetorically, [...] "What's a Beatle anyway?" [...] to which John Lennon replied, after tapping his shoulder, [...] "I am". On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. Known for having raucous shows expressing an extraordinary amount of energy, Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison performed completely still and simply sang through 14 encores. Finally, when the audience began chanting [...] "We want Roy!" [...] again, Lennon and McCartney prevented Orbison from going on again by physically holding him back. Starr later said, [...] "In Glasgow, we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was <b>just</b> <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> not moving or anything." [...] Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work. Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.|$|E
60|$|Maud, being {{relieved}} {{from the}} fear of back-door beggary, soon became reconciled to bankruptcy; thought it rather a good joke, on the whole, for children like novelty, and don't care much for Mrs. Grundy. She regarded the new abode as a baby house on a large scale, where she was allowed to play her part in the most satisfactory manner. From the moment when, on taking possession of the coveted room, she opened {{the doors of the}} three-cornered closet, and found a little kettle <b>just</b> like Polly's, <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> she felt that a good time was coming for her and fell to dusting furniture, washing cups, and making toast, the happiest, fussiest little housewife in the city. For Maud inherited the notable gifts of her grandmother, and would have made a capital farmer's daughter, in spite of her city breeding.|$|R
5000|$|The Gateway Arch packs a {{significant}} symbolic wallop <b>just</b> by <b>standing</b> <b>there.</b> But the Arch has a mission greater than being visually affecting. Its shape and monumental size suggest movement through time and space, and invite {{inquiry into the}} complex, fascinating story of our national expansion. Robert W. Duffy of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 4, 2003 Built as {{a monument to the}} westward expansion of the United States, the arch typifies [...] "the pioneer spirit {{of the men and women}} who won the West, and those of a latter day to strive on other frontiers." [...] The arch has become the iconic image of St. Louis, appearing in many parts of city culture. In 1968, three years after the monument's opening, the St. Louis phone directory contained 65 corporations with [...] "Gateway" [...] in their title and 17 with [...] "Arch". Arches also appeared over gas stations and drive-in restaurants. In the 1970s, a local sports team adopted the name [...] "Fighting Arches"; St. Louis Community College would later (when consolidating all athletic programs under a single banner) name its sports teams [...] "Archers". Robert S. Chandler, an NPS superintendent, said, [...] "Most visitors are awed by the size and scale of the Arch, but they don't understand what it's all about.... Too many people see it as just a symbol of the city of St. Louis." ...|$|R
60|$|Looking back, I am {{a little}} sorry for Mr MacGinnis. He {{was not a good}} man. His mode of speech was not pleasant, and his manners were worse than his speech. But, though he {{undoubtedly}} deserved all that was coming to him, it was nevertheless bad luck for him to be <b>standing</b> <b>just</b> <b>there</b> at just that moment. The reactions after my panic, added to the pain of my shoulder, the scratches on my face, and the general misery of being wet and cold, had given me a reckless fury and a determination to do somebody, whoever happened to come along, grievous bodily hurt, such as seldom invades the bosoms of the normally peaceful. To put it crisply, I was fighting mad, and I looked on Buck as something sent by Heaven.|$|R
5000|$|George Harrison {{wrote the}} intro and outro guitar riff {{in the studio}} {{according}} to Tom Petty in Rolling Stone.

500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was <b>just</b> the person <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|R

5000|$|Besides vocals, Sandoval plays {{acoustic}} guitar, harmonica, Hammond organ, percussion, glockenspiel and xylophone. During live performances, Sandoval {{prefers to}} sing in near-darkness with only a dim backlight, playing the tambourine, harmonica, glockenspiel or shaker. She is reputed to have a shy personality, and rarely interacts with the audience, once stating [...] "I just get really nervous. Once you're onstage, you're expected to perform. I don't do that.

Mind you, there are exceptions to every rule, but when I pay to see a show I want to see an actual show, and that's what we try to do. We're incorporating video now, too, so the dumb possibilities are becoming endless.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} {{the building of}} Genting Highlands Resort in 1975, which {{at that time was}} just a hotel with a small casino, he began construction of the Chin Swee Caves Temple. With the same dedication that he demonstrated in developing the Genting Highlands Resort, the late Tan Sri Lim began by gathering a group of friends many of whom were from his own Anxi Clan and ancestry village of Penglai in Fujian province, China, and established the Chin Swee Temple Society. Always leading by example, the late Tan Sri Lim began a donation drive by contributing a 28-acre land for the construction of the Chin Swee Caves Temple. In addition, his companies Resorts World Bhd and Genting Berhad made a cash donation of RM8.1 million for the building fund. The late Tan Sri Lim was elected Chairman of the society while his son, Tan Sri Dato’ Lim Kok Thay was appointed its Deputy Chairman.The Chin Swee Caves Temple, which was officially opened on 29 March 1994 by Tun Dr. Ling Liong Sik (then the Minister of Transport), overlooks lush green slopes of virgin forest {{with a view of the}} winding road ascending to Genting Highlands. Such is the tranquility of the place that <b>just</b> by <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> one can feel the peacefulness of the environment in the midst of the moving white clouds and gentle cool breeze.Construction of the Temple was both arduous and dangerous due to the steep and rocky terrain, which made it impossible to utilise modern machinery for fundamental work such as piling. However, with the same tenacity and determination that he put in when building Genting Highlands Resort, the late Tan Sri Lim who acted as the planner, architect, designer, contractor and supervisor used manual labour for the digging of the foundation for the temple. He and his team manually dug holes of 80 to 100 ft in depth for this tricky hill slope development. After all this tedious and time-consuming work the Temple was completed in 18 years. More importantly, despite adopting such manual approach in extremely difficult situations and risky environment, there were neither casualties nor work- related accidents reported during the whole period of construction.|$|R
