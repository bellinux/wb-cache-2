[...] To maintain 800–1600M transfers/s (both edges of a 400–800MHz clock), the internal RAM array has to perform 100–200M fetches per second.|$|E
50|$|The Intel 80186, {{also known}} as the iAPX 186, or just 186, is a {{microprocessor}} and microcontroller introduced in 1982. It was based on the Intel 8086 and, like it, had a 16-bit <b>external</b> data <b>bus</b> multiplexed with a 20-bit address bus.

50|$|However, the {{opposite}} is often true for newer 32-bit designs. For example, the Pentium Pro processor is a 32-bit machine, with 32-bit registers and instructions that manipulate 32-bit quantities, but the <b>external</b> address <b>bus</b> is 36 bits wide, giving a larger address space than 4 GB, and the <b>external</b> data <b>bus</b> is 64 bits wide, primarily in order to permit a more efficient prefetch of instructions and data.|$|R
2500|$|The Motorola 68000 ("'sixty-eight-thousand'"; {{also called}} the m68k or Motorola 68k, [...] "sixty-eight-kay") is a 16/32-bit CISC microprocessor, which {{implements}} a 32-bit instruction set, with 32-bit registers and 32-bit internal data bus, but with a 16-bit main ALU and a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector. Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as {{the first member of}} the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward-compatible {{with the rest of the}} line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide <b>external</b> <b>bus.</b> After 38years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.|$|E
2500|$|Intel {{had tried}} unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh {{platform}} to Intel chips. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately {{would not be able}} to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 [...] offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the <b>external</b> <b>bus</b> speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering did not help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the Pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola. The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months. However, in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the commoditization of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple couldn't compete on price against [...] "the Dells of the world".|$|E

To determine the characteristics, a measuring method is presented which can be used to establish the energy model without detailed knowledge of the internal processor structures.

This is usually done using data bus access like the CPU would use, and is sometimes actually handled by a CPU, but in other cases memory chips have JTAG interfaces themselves.

50|$|The Intel i486DX2, rumored as 80486DX2 (later rebadged IntelDX2) is a CPU {{produced}} by Intel that {{was introduced in}} 1992. The i486DX2 was nearly identical to the i486DX, but it had additional clock multiplier circuitry. It was the first chip to use clock doubling, whereby the processor runs two internal logic clock cycles per <b>external</b> <b>bus</b> cycle. An i486 DX2 was thus significantly faster than an i486 DX at the same bus speed thanks to the 8K on-chip cache shadowing the slower clocked <b>external</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|E
