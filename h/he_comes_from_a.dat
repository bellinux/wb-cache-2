500|$|Political writer Howard Fineman {{has said}} that, [...] "Biden {{is not an}} academic, he's not a {{theoretical}} thinker, he's a great street pol. <b>He</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> long line of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people {{who know how to}} make a sale. He has that great Irish gift." [...] Political columnist David S. Broder has viewed Biden as having grown since he came to Washington and since his failed 1988 presidential bid: [...] "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better."

500|$|The series {{revolves}} around Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1–2; Candi Milo in seasons 3–4), a bespectacled boy-genius who possesses a secret laboratory {{hidden behind a}} bookcase in his bedroom.

Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails at what he has {{set out to do}} when he becomes overexcited and makes careless choices. Although <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> typical all-American family, Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin. Christine Cavanaugh described it as [...] "an affectation, some kind of accent, we're not quite sure. A small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he's Latino, perhaps he's French. He's a scientist; he knows he needs some kind of accent." [...] Genndy Tartakovsky explained, [...] "He considers himself a very serious scientist, and all well-known scientists have accents." ...|$|E

Swann informs Clark his birth name is Kal-El, and that <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> planet called Krypton, destroyed just after he was sent to Earth. When Lionel begins piecing together the alien language on the Kawatche cave walls, and Clark's constant presence at the caves, he seeks out Swann for the answers in the season three episode [...] "Legacy".

500|$|Cogman noted, {{about the}} Arya storyline {{in the same}} interview, that <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> theater background, and that [...] "being able {{to comment on the}} show and the {{reactions}} to the show through the players were so much fun. The show is often accused of being gratuitous in all kinds of way – the violence and the bigness of the characters. It's a huge operatic story. We're able to lovingly spoof ourselves but also play with ideas about how audiences view the show, good and bad, and how a perspective of a story changes. Plus there’s the dramatic deliciousness of Arya watching her own life play out on stage." [...] Weiss also spoke about Arya, saying [...] "We were excited to do the play within the play, and it's a distorted fun house mirror representation of things we've already seen." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Part of Arya's amusement is just that she knows that they're getting so many details wrong, but she always regretted that she didn't have a chance to watch Joffrey die, and now she gets to. It's obviously a comic version of it, but that gives her great pleasure." [...] Weiss also noted, [...] "Arya is slowly getting seduced by these performances, and Lady Crane, the actress that she's charged with killing, this is somebody who like her has taken as her life's work the job of becoming other people." ...|$|E
