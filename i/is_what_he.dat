5|$|In a four-part series {{published}} between April and August 1995, Brock {{returns to}} New York City in prusuit of supervillain Carnage after learning about Carnage Unleashed, {{a video game}} based on Carnage's rampage in Maximum Carnage (1993). Carnage discovers a method of transporting his symbiote through phone lines, which he uses to hack computers and attack people playing the game. He escapes from the Ravencroft asylum and kidnaps his caregiver, Dr. Pazzo. Venom confronts Carnage in cyberspace, before Pazzo douses Carnage in flammable liquid and sets him ablaze. Venom saves Carnage from dying, reasoning that death <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants. A subplot has Brock meeting Kirstin, a young musician. When Brock accidentally paralyzes her boyfriend Clive, Kirstin asks her mother to avenge him; this storyline continues in Venom: Sinner Takes All.|$|E
5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair {{had a plan}} of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off every so often to improve the club's bleak financial picture, whilst {{at the same time}} advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he said that what Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had in mind for the Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|Since this theory, the 'closet scene' {{in which}} Hamlet confronts {{his mother in}} her private {{quarters}} has been portrayed in a sexual light in several performances. Hamlet is played as scolding his mother for having sex with Claudius while simultaneously wishing (unconsciously) that he could take Claudius' place; adultery and incest <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> simultaneously loves and hates about his mother. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may be read through the Freudian lens {{as a reaction to}} the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Her unrequited love for him suddenly slain is too much for her and she drifts into insanity.|$|E
60|$|A new life! That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> waiting for. Surely he {{had begun}} it already. He had spared one {{innocent}} thing, at any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.|$|R

25|$|The {{first of}} Gee’s {{identity}} perspectives <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls “the nature perspective (or N-identities)” (p.101). N-identity represents an identity people cannot control, one {{that comes from}} forces of nature. An example {{of this type of}} identity would be male or female. While the person has no control over the sex they were born with, this identity only means something because society and culture say this biological difference is important. Gee explains this idea further by stating, “N-identities must always gain their force as identities through the work of institutions, discourse and dialogue, or affinity groups, that is, the very forces that constitute our other perspectives on identity” (p.102).|$|E
25|$|Hershey {{returned}} to Lancaster in 1883. He borrowed {{money from the}} bank to start the Lancaster Caramel Company, which quickly became an outstanding success. He used the caramel recipe he had obtained during his previous travels to make candies. Also, from his previous travels, he learned that caramels sell better in bulk, so that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did. This company soon became a success when a man from England visited Lancaster. He loved Hershey's candies once he tasted them and placed a big order to be delivered to Britain. Hershey was able {{to pay off the}} debt from the bank and had some money left over to buy more ingredients and equipment.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{decided to}} step up to the Tree of the {{knowledge}} of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E

25|$|Margarito {{made his}} debut {{at the age}} of 15, beating Jose Trujillo in Tijuana by decision. On April 25 he {{achieved}} his first knockout, defeating Victor Angulo in the second round. On October 17 he suffered his first defeat, a six-round decision to Victor Lozoya. Over the next six bouts, he went 4–2. Following that, his financial situation dramatically improved (which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was trying to achieve early on in his career) and from there he went 28–2–1, with notable wins over Alfred Ankamah, Juan Soberanes, future World Middleweight Champion Sergio Gabriel Martinez, Buck Smith, David Kamau and Frankie Randall, a former World Light Welterweight Champion who became the first man to beat Julio César Chávez in 91 fights.|$|E
25|$|Aibara was a {{right-handed}} middle order batsman {{and often}} captained Hyderabad. He {{played a part}} in both of Hyderabad's two Ranji Trophy wins despite them being 50 years apart, as a player in 1937-38 where he scored the match winning hundred and as coach in 1986-87. His effort in the 1937-38 Final against Nawanagar <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is best remembered for, his innings of 137 not out came in a game where the next highest score by a player from either team was 67 and it was his maiden first-class hundred. Hyderabad had been dismissed for just 113 in their first innings and were set the task of chasing 310 to win in the fourth innings. Aibara came into bat with his side at 3 for 67 and guided Hyderabad home with just one wicket to spare.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many others}} who devoted their life to {{commercial}} art {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, Denis McLoughlin was never paid a great deal for his work. Many pieces of his artwork, the Boardman book covers in particular, which Denis had been promised would be returned to him, were either lost or ended up in private collections. While he made a living, Denis never accumulated much money. Although he had a pension from the British government, he was forced to augment his income by working long past retirement age. He once commented that he never particularly liked illustrating military topics and yet that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> found himself doing for the last 20 years of his life. Perhaps, had he been given cowboy stories to illustrate, he might have been happier.|$|E

25|$|Jones {{was one of}} the instigators of the New Zealand Farmers Union, which {{eventually}} developed into Federated Farmers. On three occasions, he was the president of the North Canterbury branch. He belonged to the Wheat Board and, after World War I, the Repatriation Board. He was the chairman of the parliamentary committee that recommended the establishment of the New Zealand Meat Producers Board, and when it was established in 1922, he was appointed as its first chairman. He remained in that role until 1931 and outside his parliamentary activities, this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was best known for. He resigned from the position when he was appointed to cabinet. Soon afterwards, he failed to get re-elected in the , so he resumed his role as chairman of the Meat Producers Board and held it until 1935. He represented the Meat Producers Board at the 1932 British Empire Economic Conference in Ottawa, Canada. His 1935 resignation came about because he was appointed as member of the Commission of Agriculture.|$|E
25|$|In his What About Those Who Have Never Heard? Sanders tells a {{story about}} a college student who {{rejected}} Christianity because, he claimed, it “damns to hell all those who never hear about Jesus.” Sanders replied that though some Christians held that position there are several other views which have been affirmed by Christians throughout history. In his book, No Other Name, he discusses a range of views affirmed by Christians. Sanders coined the term “restrictivism” for the view that Christian salvation is possible only for those who have heard about the gospel of Jesus and put their faith in Jesus prior to their death. Those who die without knowing about Jesus cannot inherit eternal life. The second view he discusses is universalism (or apokatastasis) according to which every human who has ever lived will be redeemed. Between these polar views are what Sanders calls the “wider hope” and he spends the most time on two views in this category. One <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls eschatological evangelization or postmortem salvation. In this view if a person dies without having heard of Jesus then he or she will encounter Jesus after death and be provided an opportunity to put their faith in Jesus. The final position Sanders covers is the one he affirms: inclusivism. The unevangelized are saved by the work of Jesus if they respond in faith to God based on the revelation they have available.|$|E

500|$|On October 12, 1880, Melvin was reelected with 7,730 votes {{alongside}} a second judge {{to serve the}} First Judicial District, and he commenced his new term on January 1, 1881. He resigned his circuit judgeship on November 19, 1881, after tiring of the [...] "wool sack", which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called his judicial court dress. Former West Virginia Governor John Jeremiah Jacob was appointed by Governor Jacob B. Jackson to fill the remainder of Melvin's unexpired term.|$|E
500|$|One common {{criticism}} of the original Ratchet & Clank was the design and personality of Ratchet. Ted Price, the game's producer, said that to fix this they made Ratchet [...] "less cocky, he is much more friendly to Clank, and he's able to handle himself better in stressful situations without being impetuous, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was in Ratchet 1." [...] In addition, James Arnold Taylor replaces Mikey Kelley as the character's voice actor, providing a more mature-sounding voice. The character of Captain Qwark was a late addition to the game.|$|E

500|$|The actors improvise their {{dialogue}} {{based on}} the story outline, direction, and their own creativity.

The character's numerous and frequent social faux pas, misunderstandings, and ironic coincidences are the basis {{of much of the}} show's comedy and have led to the entry into the American pop culture lexicon of the expression [...] "Larry David moment", meaning an inadvertently created socially awkward situation.|$|E
500|$|The quiet {{period in}} Massachusetts was over. Adams was easily re-elected to the Massachusetts House in May 1773, {{and was also}} elected as {{moderator}} of the Boston Town Meeting. In June 1773, Adams introduced a set of private letters to the Massachusetts House, written by Hutchinson several years earlier. In one letter, Hutchinson recommended to London {{that there should be}} [...] "an abridgement of what are called English liberties" [...] in Massachusetts. Hutchinson denied that this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant, but his career in Massachusetts was effectively over. The House sent a petition to the king asking for his recall.|$|E
500|$|Whitney {{initially}} left {{management of}} the newspaper to Walter Thayer, a longtime advisor. Thayer {{did not believe the}} Tribune was a financial investment -- [...] "it was a matter of 'let's set it up so that (Whitney) can do it if this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants"—but moved to build a [...] "hen house" [...] of media properties to protect Whitney's investment and provide money for the Tribune. Over the next two years, Whitney's firm acquired Parade, five television stations and four radio stations. The properties, merged into a new company called Whitney Communications Corporation, proved profitable, but executives chafed at subsidizing the Tribune.|$|E
