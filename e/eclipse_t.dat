40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a lot of {{interest}} in research on performance-challenged networks, which are typically characterized by intermittent connectivity, high mobility, and frequent network partitioning. Attempts to overcome the difficulties in this environment include opportunistic networking and the associated applications that support it. Routing and routing algorithms has been the focus of most research. A number of simulation projects on opportunistic networks routing algorithms have been produced using data from real mobility traces. These simulations are thought to be more realistic than simulations based on generic random mobility models. One of these simulation projects is the Haggle project, which is an implementation of the Pocket Switched Network for mobile computing devices. In this thesis, we study the first implementation of the Haggle architecture, referred to as INFANT-Haggle. We present our results of profiling INFANT-Haggle, whose main objectives were to increase understanding of INFANT-Haggle, find out the performance bottleneck, and attempt to port the engine on Nokia 770 using SQLite as a database engine. The tools used were the <b>Eclipse</b> <b>Test</b> & Performance Tools Platform for profiling, the Scratchbox cross compiler, and the Maemo SDK platform for porting on Nokia 770.

A modified procedure of acid (pH 1. 5) elution of cell-associated virus, {{as compared with}} other procedures, provided a general method for the optimal recovery of receptor-bound enteroviruses. With this procedure, eclipse of virus operationally {{was considered to be}} that amount of virus infectivity which was determined initially to be cell-associated and which was not dissociable from the cells. HeLa cells killed by heating at 56 C for 30 min could not attach or <b>eclipse</b> poliovirus <b>T</b> 1, but they attached and eclipsed coxsackieviruses B 1 and B 3, and they attached echovirus 6 but did not eclipse it.

These results showed that, within the operational definition of virus eclipse, the eclipse activity of HeLa cells for some viruses can be irreversibly inactivated without impairing the activity of the receptors for attaching these viruses. The data provided additional evidence that HeLa cells possess specific receptors for the different enteroviruses...|$|R
40|$|Open Source Software (OSS) {{products}} do {{not usually}} follow the traditional software engineering development paradigms found in textbooks. Specifically, testing activities in OSS development {{may be quite}} different from those carried out in Closed Source Software (CSS) development, also {{due to the fact}} that OSS processes often seem to be less structured than CSS ones. Since testing and, in general, verification may require a good deal of resources in OSS, it is necessary to have ways for assessing and improving OSS testing processes. In this paper, we provide a set of testing guidelines and testing issues that OSS developers may want to take into account to decide which testing techniques make most sense for their OSS products. This paper 1) provides a checklist that helps OSS developers identify the most useful testing techniques according to the main characteristics of their products under test and 2) outlines a proposal for a method that helps assess the maturity of OSS testing processes. The method is a proposal of a Maturity Model for testing processes (which we call OSS-TMM). To show its usefulness, we have applied the method to seven real-life projects. Specifically, we present in the paper how we applied the method to BusyBox, Apache Httpd and <b>Eclipse</b> <b>Test</b> & Performance Tools Platform to show how the checklist supports and guides the testing process of these OSS products...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{applicability}} of effective temperature scales of several broad band colours to T Tauri stars (TTS). We take into account different colour systems as well as stellar parameters like metallicity and surface gravity which influence the conversion from colour indices or spectral type to effective temperature. For a large sample of TTS, we derive temperatures from broad band colour indices and check if they are consistent in a statistical sense with temperatures inferred from spectral types. There are some scales (for V-H, V-K, I-J, J-H, and J-K) which indeed predict the same temperatures as the spectral types and therefore can be at least used to confirm effective temperatures. Furthermore, we examine whether TTS with dynamically derived masses {{can be used for}} a test of evolutionary models and effective temperature calibrations. We compare the observed parameters of the <b>eclipsing</b> <b>T</b> Tauri binary V 1642 Ori A to the predictions of evolutionary models in both the H-R and the Kiel diagram using temperatures derived with several colour index scales. We check whether the evolutionary models and the colour index scales are consistent with coevality and the dynamical masses of the binary components. It turns out that the Kiel diagram offers a stricter test than the H-R diagram. Only the evolutionary models of Baraffe et al. (1998) with mixing length parameter 1. 9 and of D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1994, 1997) show consistent results in the Kiel diagram in combination with some conversion scales of Houdashelt et al.

A well-known example of such an architecture is Eclipse, {{best known for its}} use to create a series of extensible IDEs. Although such architectures give users and developers a great deal of flexibility to create new products, the complexity of the built systems increases. In order to manage this complexity developers use extensive automated test suites. Unfortunately, current testing tools offer little insight in which of the many possible combinations of components and components configurations are actually tested. The goal {{of this paper is to}} remedy this problem. To that end, we interview 25 professional developers on the problems they experience in test suite understanding for plug-in architectures. The findings have been incorporated in five architectural views that provide an extensibility perspective on plug-in-based systems and their test suites. The views combine static and dynamic information on plug-in dependencies, extension initialization, extension and service usage, and the test suites. The views have been implemented in ETSE, the <b>Eclipse</b> Plug-in <b>Test</b> Suite Exploration tool. We evaluate the proposed views by analyzing eGit, Mylyn, and a Mylyn connector.

40|$|Abstract. Particle {{data from}} two {{geosynchronous}} satellites (Applied Technology Satellite 6 and SCATHA) show a normally hidden ion population appearing when the satellites {{are in the}} earth's shadow. Ion and electron data show the spacecraft potential dropping from + 10 V in sunlight to + 4 to + 5 V in eclipse at local midnight, in low-energy (T < 1 keV) plasma sheet environments. During <b>eclipse,</b> a cold (<b>T</b> = 1 eV), dense (n = 10 - 100 cm- 3), isotropic ion population appears which was invisible in sunlight because of the larger positive spacecraft potential. Higher-energy populations generally cover the tails of the hidden ion populations, so they cannot be inferred from daylight data. The isotropic population appears only in a few percent of the spacecraft eclipse events, appearing only at times of low Kp (2 or less, preceded by a day with Î£Kp < 20). A low-energy (T = 1 - 2 eV) field-aligned population often appears with and without the isotropic population, at slightly higher flux levels. These fluxes are visible in sunlight, but again the distribution functions obtained in eclipse differ from those that would be inferred from daylight data. Measurement of the thermal plasma population on a consistent basis, particularly in the plasma sheet, will require some method of controlling the detector potential {{with respect to the}} ambient plasma...|$|R

Memory leaks in Java are not {{the same}} as memory leaks in, for example, the C programming language. When a C-programmer wants to use memory on the heap, he should manually allocate a memory region. After application finishes using this memory, it should be manually freed. If the pointer to the allocated region is lost, then there is no appropriate way to release this memory. This situation is called a âmemory leakâ. In Java the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handles all work with memory. When a developer wants to create and use a new object, the JVM allocates a necessary amount of memory. During an applicationâs life the JVM periodically checks for objects in memory that are not used anymore. Objects, which are not referenced, will be discarded and memory reclaimed to be used again. This process is called garbage collection. A memory leak in Java is a situation, where an application is not logically using objects, to which references still exist, meaning the Garbage Collector (GC) canât mark them as unused and free memory. When memory management of JVM cannot allocate any more memory, java. lang. OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown. When a developer is faced with an âOutOfMemoryErrorâ on production server, he can try to reproduce the problem in a test environment. Unfortunately, oftentimes test environments do not allow for reproduction of such errors. Itâs not always possible to mimic all parameters of a real environment. Developer often doesnât have all required input data or he just does not know how and why the memory leak occurred. This can be also caused by all sorts of bureaucratic obstacles and barriers in large companies with separate operations and development departments and developers just do not have full access to machines in a real environment. However, even if it is possible to search for memory leaks in a production environment â use of many developerâs tools, such as full-featured profilers is not possible, due to the memory and performance overhead not suitable for production environment. It is useful to apply all possible offline methods, such as analysis of heap dumps and collection of allocationsâ logs. And when a memory leak is localized, only then it would be helpful to turn on an allocation tracker for a specific set of objects or allocation sites to find out what code is responsible for creating objects that are eventually leaked. In order to do it in a production environment, we need effective methods and algorithms for allocation tracking. Memory allocations tracker is a tool, which works in runtime and logs memory allocation by specific objects or sites. Usually it is a part of a profiler, but standalone solutions also exist. The aim of this work is to review and compare existing open source solutions for allocation tracking in JVM. The first chapter of this work describes benchmarking techniques, which will be used for comparison of different allocations trackers. In this work will SPECjvm 2008 will be used. It is a benchmark suite for measuring the performance of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It contains several real life applications and benchmarks focusing on core java functionality. The SPECjvm 2008 workload mimics a variety of common general-purpose application computations. As SPECjvm 2008 does not give any information about memory usage a lightweight JVM Tool Interface (JVM TI) agent was created. JVM TI allows a program to inspect the state and to control the execution of other application running in the JVM [1]. The agent works in a separate thread and writes memory usage statistics to a CSV file every second. The agent creates an insignificant overhead, so it does not distort the SPECjvm 2008 results. In the next chapters of this work open-source allocations trackers are reviewed. Their work principles, algorithms and memory structures are examined. For measuring allocations tracking efficiency the SPECjvm 2008 suite will be run with every tested allocations tracking solution. The obtained data allows comparing memory and performance overhead of different approaches in memory allocations tracking. Chapter 2 introduces HPROF â an example profiler, shipped with the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) and uses the JVM TI. In chapter 3 we review the NetBeans profiler, previously known as JFluid. This is full-weight Java profiler integrated with the NetBeans IDE. Chapter 4 is about <b>Eclipse</b> <b>Test</b> and Performance platform. This is a collection of open- source frameworks and services that allows software developers to build test and performance tools. In the last chapter results of using Googleâs Allocation Instrumenter are presented. It uses java. lang. instrument package and ASM Java byte code manipulation and analysis framework. For each examined profiler brief description along with implementation details and benchmarking results are given...|$|R

Experiment I. Non-radioactive B/r bacteria were infected with highly radioactive (i. e. P 32 -unstable) T 2 and infection allowed to proceed at 37 Â°C. for various numbers of minutes before freezing the infected cells and storing them in liquid nitrogen. The longer development {{had been allowed to}} proceed at 37 Â°C. before freezing, the slower the inactivation of the frozen infective centers by P 32 decay. Samples which were frozen after incubation for 9 minutes were completely stable. Experiment II. Radioactive B/r bacteria in radioactive growth medium were infected with non-radioactive (i. e. stable) T 2 and incubated for various lengths of time before being frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen, like those of Experiment I. In this case, the infective centers were stable to P 32 decay {{as long as they were}} frozen before the end of the <b>eclipse</b> period. The <b>T</b> 2 progeny phages issuing from the infected bacteria were P 32 -unstable. Experiment III. Radioactive B/r bacteria in radioactive medium were infected with radioactive (i. e. P 32 -unstable) T 2 and otherwise incubated and frozen like those of the first two experiments. In this case, the same progressive stabilization, of the infective centers towards inactivation by P 32 decay was observed as that found in Experiment I. The ability to yield infective progeny of infected bacteria incubated for 10 minutes at 37 Â°C. before freezing could no longer be destroyed by P 32 decay. The progeny issuing from the infected cells were as unstable as the parental phage. These results could be explained by one of three general hypotheses. As vegetative phage begins to multiply, it is possible that: (a) there is a high probability that any part of the vegetative phage already duplicated can be saved after its destruction by P 32 decay through a process analogous to multiplicity reactivation or, (b) there occurs a change in state of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) preliminary to or in the course of its replication that renders it refractory to destruction by P 32 decay, or, finally (c) there occurs a transfer of the genetic factors from the DNA of the infecting phage to another substance not sensitive to destruction by P 32 decay...|$|R
