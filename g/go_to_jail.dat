5|$|Shortly {{after its}} release, Waddingtons, UK {{publishers}} of the Monopoly boardgame, raised {{objections to the}} Automonopoli title, saying {{that there was a}} risk purchasers would confuse the two products. Automata changed the name of the product to <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Jail</b> in their packaging and advertising, claiming in their advertising that despite being identical in every way, <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Jail</b> was unrelated to Automonopoli.|$|E
5|$|Automonopoli, {{also known}} as <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Jail,</b> is an {{unauthorised}} computer version of the boardgame Monopoly, released in June 1983 by Automata UK for the ZX Spectrum. Although other two-player Monopoly computer programs already existed, the developer advertised that their Automonopoli was the first with an artificial intelligence strong enough to compete against and defeat human players.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{released}} {{under the}} name Automonopoli, Waddingtons threatened legal action against Automata, and within weeks of its release the game was rebranded as <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Jail.</b> Waddingtons, concerned about the potential impact on a forthcoming official Monopoly video game, began formal court proceedings against Automata in late 1983, and the game was withdrawn from sale in early 1984.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>jail,</b> it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
