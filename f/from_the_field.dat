5|$|Luna {{resigned}} on 1 March, {{mainly in}} resentment for the rearmament of the Kawit Battalion as the Presidential Guard. Aguinaldo hesitantly accepted the resignation. As a result, Luna was absent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> for three weeks, {{during which the}} Filipino forces suffered several defeats and setbacks. One such defeat {{would be at the}} Battle of Marilao River on 27 March. Receiving the depressing reports <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> through his La Independencia correspondents, Luna went to Aguinaldo and asked to be reinstated with more powers over all the military heads, and Aguinaldo promoted him to Lieutenant General and agreed making him Commander-in-Chief of all the Filipino forces in Central Luzon (Bulacan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Zambales).|$|E

5|$|As the Afrika Korps {{retreated into}} Libya and Tunisia, the 2nd Division, {{as part of}} X Corps, was in pursuit. A series of engagements with the enemy followed, occupying Kippenberger and his men.

He remained a highly regarded officer, deputising as commander of the 2nd Division in Freyberg's occasional absence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> in higher commands.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan {{was known}} for baiting umpires. He and McGraw were often ejected from games, suspended, and on a few {{occasions}} escorted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> by police.

5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months.

5|$|For the game's halftime show, the Orange Bowl hosted American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Goo Goo Dolls.

Pregame media coverage erroneously reported that Stanford's marching band, which had been scheduled to perform, was banned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> The band had never been scheduled to perform at halftime; each team's marching band was allotted a six-minute pregame performance.|$|E
