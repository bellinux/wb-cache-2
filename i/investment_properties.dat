The building was renovated between 1979 and 1982 by McLaughlin & Harvey Ltd with architects Elsom Pack & Roberts converting the building for office use and renaming it Angel Corner House. The ground floor is now a branch of The Co-operative Bank, and the ORC International market research agency occupies the upper floors.

25|$|Following his judgment, Richard Mawrey ordered Lutfur Rahman {{to pay the}} petitioners' {{costs to}} be {{assessed}} on the standard basis if not agreed between the parties. An order for an interim payment of £250,000 to be paid within 14 days was also made pending agreement or assessment of costs, estimated at £500,000. Rahman was also ordered to pay the costs of John Williams, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police, and expenses incurred in the hosting of the election court. As {{a result of the}} cost order, Andy Erlam obtained interim charging orders on two <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> registered solely in Rahman's name as security for the judgment debt. Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid filed objection to the charging orders claiming absolute beneficial interest on one of the two property, and 74% beneficial interest in the other. Despite the objection, Erlam was able to obtain a final charging order on the second property on 29 June 2015. Additionally, an interim charging order was then secured against a property registered solely in Farid's name on the argument that Rahman has a beneficial interest in it.|$|E
500|$|Trotter's {{career began}} inauspiciously. [...] His initial {{attempts}} to get jobs at established banking and real estate firms were unsuccessful, leading him through a succession of lower-paying clerking jobs. [...] He finally landed {{a job in a}} white-owned real estate firm in 1898, but decided the next year to open his own business selling insurance and brokering mortgages. [...] He was not particularly active in agitating for civil rights in these years, although his strong opinions on racial equality were evident in an 1899 paper in which he called on African Americans to seek admission to institutions of higher learning. (It was a common practice of the time to direct African Americans away from higher education opportunities and into industrial training programs.) Trotter's business was relatively successful, {{and he was able to}} purchase <b>investment</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|E

40|$|Inquiries {{about this}} {{document}} {{can be made}} to HARC@hawaii. edu The accounting standard used in China for <b>investment</b> <b>property,</b> Chinese Accounting Standards 3 (CASs) is comparable to IAS 40 <b>Investment</b> <b>Property</b> while there are two crucial differences: (1) an entity is allowed to use the fair value method if and only if the local property market is active or if the fair value of an entity’s <b>investment</b> <b>property</b> can be estimated reliably through the values and other information of the same or similar category of properties. In other words, CAS 3 is more prudential and restricted on the use of fair value model; (2) CAS 3 does not require an entity which uses the cost method to recognize <b>investment</b> <b>property</b> to also disclose the fair values of property in the footnotes. Using a sample of publicly traded firms that hold <b>investment</b> <b>property</b> from 2007 through 2011 in China, we conduct purer tests to shield some light on the effect of fair value reporting for <b>investment</b> <b>property</b> on firm opacity and stock price dynamics in an emerging market. We find that firms that recognize <b>investment</b> <b>property</b> at fair value in China experience an increase in crash risks, consistent with the notion that fair value reporting for <b>investment</b> <b>property</b> in China does not convey managerial private information regarding firm value while could be the channel to conceal information, and hence exhibit higher stock price crash risks. We further find evidence that the association between the fair value reporting and increased crash risks is mitigated when managers operating in firms with strong corporate governance...|$|R

2500|$|Alt-A {{mortgages}} are an ill-defined category, generally prime borrowers but non-conforming in some way, often lower documentation (or in {{some other}} way: vacation home, etc.) Alt-A mortgages tend to be larger in size than subprime loans and have significantly higher credit quality. [...] For example, an Alt-A loan might be to an individual with multiple and varying sources of income; non-owner occupied, <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> are often Alt-A loans. [...] Because Alt-A loans are not conforming loans, they {{are not eligible for}} purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.|$|E
2500|$|Several books {{say that}} Sir Peter Lely lived in Princes Risborough at Brook House {{and that he}} bought the house in 1671. This {{is not likely to}} be true. Lely was a wealthy and fashionable London painter (court painter from 1661), very busy, with a house at Covent Garden, where he had an {{impressive}} collection of pictures. Samuel Pepys, after visiting him in 1667, wrote that he was a [...] "mighty proud man.....and full of state." [...] It is highly improbable that such a man would have chosen or indeed would have been able to live in a small village in the Chilterns, 40 miles from London. He had more work in London than he could easily manage. His wife died in childbirth in 1674 and was buried at St Pauls, Covent Garden, where Lely himself was buried after his death in 1680. His estate comprised his house in Covent Garden and <b>investment</b> <b>properties</b> in Surrey and Lincolnshire. No biography of the painter mentions a house at Princes Risborough.|$|E
2500|$|The central {{equitable}} principle {{applicable to}} directors {{is to avoid}} any possibility of a conflict of interest, without disclosure to the board or seeking approval from shareholders. This core duty of loyalty is manifested firstly in section 175 which specifies that directors may not use business opportunities that the company could without approval. Shareholders may pass a resolution ratifying a breach of duty, but under section 239 they must be uninterested in the transaction. This absolute, strict duty has been consistently reaffirmed since the economic crisis following the South Sea Bubble in 1719. For example, in Cook v Deeks, UKPC 10] (PC) three directors took a railway line construction contract in their own names, rather than that of their company, to exclude a fourth director from the business. Even though the directors used their votes as shareholders to [...] "ratify" [...] their actions, the Privy Council advised that the conflict of interest precluded their ability to forgive themselves. Similarly, in Bhullar v Bhullar, a director {{on one side of}} a feuding family set up a company to buy a carpark next to one of the company's properties. The family company, amidst the feud, had in fact resolved to buy no further <b>investment</b> <b>properties,</b> but even so, because the director failed to fully disclose the opportunity that could reasonably be considered as falling within the company's line of business, the Court of Appeal held he was liable to make restitution for all profits made on the purchase. The duty of directors to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest also exists after a director ceases employment with a company, so it is not permissible to resign and then take up a corporate opportunity, present or maturing, even though no longer officially a [...] "director".|$|E
