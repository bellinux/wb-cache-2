Some, however, will possess the <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> {{to such a degree that}} they find it impossible not to chase a cat that is moving quickly. The <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> is triggered by movement and much depends on how the cat behaves.|$|E
25|$|English Shepherds {{can compete}} in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding {{instincts}} and trainability {{can be measured}} at noncompetitive herding tests. English Shepherds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. English Shepherds also possess a strong <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> from their past use as an all purpose farm dog. They are known to tree prey and can be trained to flush birds {{by taking advantage of}} the innate herding instinct.|$|E
500|$|They have an {{instinct}} to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets, and so most Cavaliers will never become [...] "street-wise". As {{they tend to}} regard all strangers as friends, members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs. Spaniels have a strong <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> and may endanger birds and small animals. However, owners have reported that through training their Cavaliers live happily {{with a variety of}} small animals including hamsters and gerbils.|$|E
50|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with Korea Economic Daily (한국경제), Bak Nam-sun (박남순), an expert search dog handler in South Korea, testified that Jindo dogs are not fit as rescue dogs and search dogs. It is because Jindo dogs' <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts</b> are too strong (they can forget their mission {{because of their}} <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts),</b> and they usually give their loyalty only to the first owner, while handlers of search dogs and rescue dogs can frequently change.|$|R

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1936, {{the crew of the}} Insect class gunboat HMS Gnat voted to get a ship's mascot. This was {{due in part to the}} {{competitive}} nature of the gunboats, with HMS Bee, Cicada, and Cricket already having mascots of their own. The Captain and the Chief Bosun's mate, Lt. Cmdr. J. Waldergrave and Chief Petty Officer Charles Jefferey, purchased Judy from the kennel and presented her to the crew. As her mother was known as Kelly of Sussex, Judy was listed as Judy of Sussex in her Royal Navy paperwork. It was hoped to train her as a gundog, but the men began to treat her like a pet instead, and several days after her arrival, Jefferey's log stated that [...] "our chances of making her a trained gundog are very small." [...] Her time spent on the streets of Shanghai was blamed for her lack of <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct,</b> the only time that she would point in the traditional manner was when she could smell food.|$|E
2500|$|Ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen {{considers}} birdwatching to be {{an expression}} of the male <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> while Simon Baron-Cohen links it with the male tendency for [...] "systemizing". There have been suggestions that identification of birds may be a form of gaining status which has been compared with Kula valuables noted in Papua New Guinean cultures.|$|E
2500|$|As of May 2017, the end {{results of}} 25 years of {{breeding}} to reawaken the <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> {{have been a}} success. It has resulted in dogs that are very eager to please their masters. It {{has resulted in a}} gun dog with extreme intelligence, a relentless drive to catch its quarry, and strong swimming skills that requires special training: their aptitude is second only to the British Border Collie and thus the hunting Standard Poodle requires the gunman to be quite specific as to what he wants and how he wants it done. Unlike other spaniels and retrievers, Standard Poodles will attempt to solve a problem independently and need to be told specifically what is wanted when tracking and retrieving a bird. Because they are highly intelligent, harsh or violent training methods do not work with this dog breed in the field-corrections must be timely, given with precision and the trainer must have a firm but kind hand; an overbearing owner training his dog to hunt will find his Standard poodle terrified of his master and the entire experience, and refusing to budge an inch towards the water or into the brush.|$|E

60|$|Man hunts wild creatures; woman hunts man. Fanny was impelled by the <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct.</b> She {{was sent}} {{out of the}} house to prevent her hunting; she began to {{consider}} next, how, without discovery, she could return and carry on the hunt.|$|E
60|$|Long moments I sat there, {{with the}} poignant {{consciousness}} of the wildness of the scene, of the significant rattling of the stones and of the bell-tongued hound baying incessantly, sending warm joy through my veins, the absorption in sensations new, yielding only to the <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> when Satan snorted and quivered. Again the deep-toned bay rang into the silence with its stirring thrill of life. And a sharp rattling of stones just above brought another snort from Satan.|$|E
60|$|As instance: dim {{shapes and}} shadowy forms would {{sometimes}} appear to {{him out of}} the night, and as they flitted spectrally past he would hear, as in a dream, the hunting cries of the pack; and, as his pulse quickened, his own <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> would rouse until his controlled soft-howling in the song broke into eager whinings. His head would lower out of the entanglement of the woman's hair; his feet would begin making restless, spasmodic movements as if running; and Presto, in a flash, he would be out and away, across the face of time, out of reality and into the dream, himself running in the midst of those shadowy forms in the hunting fellowship of the pack.|$|E
50|$|A foxhound {{is a type}} {{of large}} hunting hound bred for strong <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts,</b> great energy, and, like all scent hounds, a keen sense of smell. In fox hunting, the foxhound's namesake, packs of foxhounds track quarry, followed—usually on horseback—by the hunters, {{sometimes}} for several miles at a stretch; moreover, foxhounds also sometimes guard sheep and houses.|$|R

5|$|Historically the breeds {{that were}} merged into the King Charles Spaniel {{were used for}} hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited.

6000|$|One of our savants {{has lately}} prophesied {{that the time}} will come when only the {{microscopic}} organisms will exist to satisfy the <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> in man. How these small creatures will be taken he does not tell us. Perhaps the hunters will station themselves round {{a table with a}} drop of preserved water on its centre, made large and luminous by means of a ray of magnifying light. When that time comes the amoeba--that [...] "wandering Jew," [...] as an irreverent Quarterly Reviewer has called it--will lose its immortality, and the spry rotifer will fall a victim to the infinitesimal fine bright arrows of the chase.

60|$|Heavy winter rains {{held them}} prisoners {{for two weeks}} in the Marble House. Saxon browsed among Hafler's books, though most of them were depressingly beyond her, while Billy hunted with Hafler's guns. But he was a poor shot and a worse hunter. His only success was with rabbits, which he managed to kill on {{occasions}} when they stood still. With the rifle he got nothing, although he fired at half a dozen different deer, and, once, at a huge cat-creature with a long tail which he was certain was a mountain lion. Despite the way he grumbled at himself, Saxon could see the keen joy he was taking. This belated arousal of the <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> seemed to make almost another man of him. He was out early and late, compassing prodigious climbs and tramps--once reaching as far as the gold mines Tom had spoken of, and being away two days.|$|E
60|$|The {{wind blew}} strong at our backs, a {{circumstance}} that probably kept Don {{so long in}} ignorance of the trail. A few yards further on, however, he stopped and raised his fine head. He lowered it and trotted on only to stop again. His easy air of satisfaction with the morning suddenly vanished. His savage <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> awakened through some channel to raise the short yellow hair on his neck and shoulders and make it stand stiff. He stood undecided with warily shifting nose, then jumped forward with a yelp. Another jump brought another sharp cry from him. Sounder, close behind, echoed the yelp. Jude began to whine. Then Don, with a wild howl, leaped ten feet to alight on the lion trail and to break into wonderfully rapid flight. The seven other hounds, bunched in a black and yellow group, tore after him filling the forest with their wild uproar.|$|E
50|$|Running away or {{climbing}} a tree can activate the bear's <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts</b> {{and lead to}} it perceiving the human as prey. If a bear does charge, persons are advised to hold their ground, as most bear charges are bluffs. Finally, if a bear does attack, the usual advice is to curl into a fetal position so as to shield vital organs and appear non-threatening.|$|R
50|$|Gordons were bred to run, {{and require}} 60 to 80 minutes of {{vigorous}} exercise daily. Young dogs {{should not be}} over-exercised or begin agility training until they are at least 18 months old, to avoid joint problems later in life. Because of their <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts,</b> Gordons {{should not be allowed}} to roam freely if unsupervised, as they are apt to wander into a potentially dangerous traffic situation while following a scent.|$|R
50|$|Siberian Huskies {{have a high}} prey drive due to the Chukchi {{allowing}} them to roam free in the summer. The dogs hunted in packs and preyed on wild cats, birds, and squirrels, but with training can be trusted with other small animals. They would only return to the Chukchi villages when the snow returned and food became scarce. Their <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts</b> can still {{be found in the}} breed today.|$|R
60|$|Eschtah {{pressed into}} Naab's service {{a band of}} young braves, under the {{guidance}} of several warriors who knew every trail of the range, every waterhole, every cranny where even a wolf might hide. They swept the river-end of the plateau, and working westward, scoured the levels, ridges, valleys, climbed to the peaks, and sent their Indian dogs into the thickets and caves. From Eschtah's encampment westward the hogans diminished in number till only one here and there was discovered, hidden under a yellow wall, or amid a clump of cedars. All the Indians met with were sternly questioned by the chiefs, their dwellings were searched, and the ground about their waterholes was closely examined. Mile after mile the plateau was covered by these Indians, who beat the brush and penetrated the fastnesses with a <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> that left scarcely a rabbit-burrow unrevealed. The days sped by; the circle of the sun arched higher; the patches of snow in high places disappeared; and the search proceeded westward. They camped where the night overtook them, sometimes near water and grass, sometimes in bare dry places. To the westward the plateau widened. Rugged ridges rose here and there, and seared crags split the sky like sharp sawteeth. And after many miles of wild up-ranging they reached a divide which marked the line of Eschtah's domain.|$|E
6000|$|The {{murder was}} {{the talk of}} the place for some days, chiefly on account of the painful facts of the case--that the old Alcalde, who was {{respected}} and even loved by every one, should have failed in so pitiful a way to make any attempt at saving his young relation. But the mere fact that the soldiers had cut the throat of their officer surprised no one; it was a common thing {{in the case of a}} defeat in those days for the men to turn upon and murder their officers. Nor was throat-cutting a mere custom or convention: to the old soldier it was the only satisfactory way of finishing off your adversary, or prisoner of war, or your officer who had been your tyrant, on the day of defeat. Their feeling was similar to that of the man who is inspired by the <b>hunting</b> <b>instinct</b> in its primitive form, as described by Richard Jefferies. To kill the creatures with bullets at a distance was no satisfaction to him: he must with his own hands drive the shaft into the quivering flesh--he must feel its quivering and see the blood gush up beneath his hand. One smiles at a vision of the gentle Richard Jefferies slaughtering wild cattle in the palaeolithic way, but that feeling and desire which he describes with such passion in his Story of My Heart, that survival of the past, is not uncommon in the hearts of hunters, and if we were ever to drop out of our civilization I fancy we should return rather joyfully to the primitive method. And so in those dark times in the Argentine Republic when, during half a century of civil strife which followed on casting off the Spanish [...] "yoke," [...] as it was called, the people of the plains had developed an amazing ferocity, they loved to kill a man not with a bullet but in a manner to make them know and feel that they were really and truly killing.|$|E

50|$|The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel {{has been}} a {{companion}} dog, and was bred over hundreds of years to have a calm, soft natured temperament. It can get along well with other dogs. Its easy going temperament, {{as well as its}} looks, have made the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel a popular parent breed. These qualities benefit the Beaglier. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel does not have strong <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts,</b> so its scent hunting drive is lower than that of the Beagle.|$|R
5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts,</b> the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|R
50|$|A {{pointing}} breed {{is a type}} of gundog {{typically used}} in finding game. Gundogs are traditionally divided into three classes: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. The name pointer comes from the dog's instinct to point, by stopping and aiming its muzzle towards game. This demonstrates to the hunter the location of his or her quarry and allows them to move into gun range. Pointers were selectively bred from dogs who had abundant pointing and backing instinct. They typically start to acquire their <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts</b> at about 2 months of age.|$|R

50|$|Some animals instinctively gather {{together}} as a herd. A group of animals fleeing a predator will demonstrate herd behavior for protection; while some predators, such as wolves and dogs have instinctive herding abilities derived from primitive <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts.</b> Instincts in herding dogs and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Dogs exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to aid in herding and to compete in herding and stock dog trials. Sperm whales have also been observed teaming up to herd prey in a coordinated feeding behavior.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} crash, Walt is left {{under the care}} of {{different}} people due to Michael's involvement in helping other survivors—in particular, Walt spends time with John Locke. He is intrigued by Locke's <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts,</b> and constantly tries to sneak away with him, always unsuccessfully. He sneaks away with Locke and Boone, and exhibits a natural talent in knife throwing. Michael soon arrives and is enraged, taking Walt away from them and forbidding him to see Locke again. Walt takes Vincent, the dog, and leaves camp, heading into the jungle, where he encounters a polar bear. He is rescued by Michael and Locke.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of social upbringing on the activity pattern of lion Panthera leo cubs was investigated at three sites. In this study, stimulus {{objects such as}} sticks, grass, fresh dung (elephant Loxondota africana, zebra Equus quagga, impala Aepyceros melampus, duiker Sylvicapra grimmia, kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros, giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis and wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus) and cardboard boxes, were utilized in an enrichment program aimed at encouraging active behaviors of captive lion cubs at Antelope Park and Masuwe. Lion cubs at Chipangali were not behaviorally enriched. Activity patterns were recorded for 10 days at each site. We recorded moving, resting, playing, grooming, visual exploration and display of <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts.</b> We found that behavioral enrichment enhanced the active behaviors of captive lion cubs. Orphan-raised cubs spent more time moving, playing and displaying <b>hunting</b> <b>instincts</b> than mother-raised cubs, but the time spent grooming was similar across areas and suggests that grooming is not influenced by enrichment. Mother-raised cubs spent more time engaged in visual exploration than orphan-raised cubs and {{this could be a}} behavior acquired from mothers or a result of confidence to explore because of their presence. Activity patterns were different among time treatments across our three study sites. Based on these findings, we suggest that lion cubs raised in captivity could benefit from behavioral enrichment to encourage active behaviors essential for eventual reintroduction into the wild [Current Zoology 56 (4) : 389 – 394, 2010]...|$|R
