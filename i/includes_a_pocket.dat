50|$|Tanaka {{was born}} in Kurume, Chikugo {{province}} (present-day Fukuoka prefecture) as the eldest son of a tortoise shell craftsman. Apprenticed at an early age, he was a gifted artisan. At the age of eight, he invented an inkstone case with a secret lock, which required a cord to be twisted in a certain manner to open it. At the age of 14, he had invented a loom capable of weaving intricate designs into fabric. From age 20 he began to make karakuri dolls, autonomous dolls powered by springs, pneumatics and hydraulics, capable of relatively complex movements, which were much in demand by the aristocrats of Kyoto, daimyō in feudal domains, and by the Shōgun’s court in Edo. At age 21, he was performing around the country at festivals with clockwork dolls he constructed himself. He declined {{to take over the}} family business, surrendering his position to his younger brother and devoted his full attention to karakuri dolls. However, by his mid-thirties these mechanical dolls had started to fall out of fashion. In 1834, he relocated to Osaka, where he experimented in pneumatics, hydraulics and forms of lighting based on rapeseed oil, <b>including</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> candlestick and <b>an</b> oil lamp with an air-pressurized fuel pump which proved to be very popular.|$|R

Constructed from a hairdresser's wig-making dummy, the piece has various measuring devices attached <b>including</b> <b>a</b> ruler, <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> watch mechanism, <b>a</b> typewriter, some camera segments and a crocodile wallet."Der Geist Unserer Zeit - Mechanischer Kopf specifically evokes the philosopher George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831). For Hegel...everything is mind. Among Hegel's disciples and critics was Karl Marx. Hausmann's sculpture {{might be seen as}} an aggressively Marxist reversal of Hegel: this is a head whose [...] "thoughts" [...] are materially determined by objects literally fixed to it. However, there are deeper targets in western culture that give this modern masterpiece its force. Hausmann turns inside out the notion of the head as seat of reason, an assumption that lies behind the European fascination with the portrait. He reveals a head that is penetrated and governed by brute external forces.|$|R

He continued to produce weekly cartoons for The Times until 1980.

25|$|In the {{majority}} of receptors with known structures, transmembrane alpha helices constitute most of the transmembrane component. In certain receptors, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the transmembrane domain forms a protein pore through the membrane, or around the ion channel. Upon activation of an extracellular domain by binding of the appropriate ligand, the pore becomes accessible to ions, which then diffuse. In other receptors, the transmembrane domains undergo a conformational change upon binding, which effects intracellular conditions. In some receptors, such {{as members of the}} 7TM superfamily, the transmembrane domain <b>includes</b> <b>a</b> ligand binding <b>pocket.</b> Bacteriorhodopsin is <b>an</b> example, the detailed structure of which has been determined by crystallography.|$|R
