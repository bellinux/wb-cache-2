5|$|Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) {{is seated}} in a chair in Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue. Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and still out to get Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, The Smoking Man tells Scully that he {{believes}} he shares a special kinship with her because he once held her own life in his hands. Mulder finds a message Scully left on his phone suspicious and goes to her apartment, where the landlord tells him that she left with someone else. The Smoking Man and Scully arrive {{at the home of}} Marjorie Butters (Louise Latham), a 118-year-old gardener who also has the chip implanted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. Meanwhile, Mulder visits Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) to voice his concern, but Scully calls Skinner during the meeting and says that she is fine. At a gas station, Scully removes the wire, places it in an envelope, and mails it to Mulder. However, a man following the two removes the letter from the mailbox.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E

However, he returned quickly, as the rest of the players loved having Kalas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane.|$|R
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E
25|$|In Season 2, Scully {{was kidnapped}} by an ex-FBI mental patient named Duane Barry, and then taken from Barry by a {{military}} covert operation that were working with the alien conspirators, but was later returned. In Season 3 she found out that a super hi-tech microchip has been implanted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. After having it removed, she developed cancer in the fourth season and was hospitalized after the cancer became terminal. She was saved after Mulder broke into the Department of Defense to retrieve another chip to be implanted back into her neck. At the time, Scully was also undergoing experimental medical treatments and was having a dramatic renewal of her faith.|$|E

500|$|... "Outlaw Lover", {{the sixth}} track from the album, is an up-tempo {{electronic}} song. It contains strong techno elements and features male opera vocals. Lords cast {{herself as a}} woman in a small town who had been wronged, and tells her unfaithful lover [...] "You best be warned I'm a woman scorned," [...] before shooting him dead. The lyrics were inspired by cowboy stories and old westerns. The following track, [...] "I Want You", is another song with strong trip hop influences and oriental vibe. [...] "Say Something" [...] also incorporates trip hop music within its composition. In the album's ninth track, [...] "Father's Field", Lords reveals her experience with rape when she was 10 years old. She was attacked by her 16-year-old classmate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's house.|$|E

[...] Palin [...] "and the press corps watched the sketch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> plane, {{laughing}} at Tina and Amy's satirical take on the two politicians," [...] and Palin later claimed that she had once dressed up as Fey for Halloween. However, Carly Fiorina, a spokeswoman for the John McCain campaign argued that the sketch portrayed Hillary Clinton as [...] "very substantive," [...] but Fiorina thought, in the case of Sarah Palin, that she was portrayed as [...] "totally superficial." [...] Fiorina thought the sketch was [...] "disrespectful in the extreme" [...] and [...] "sexist." ...|$|E
500|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan may {{be either}} a {{beautiful}} old or young woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklores to be dark or demonic in nature.

500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Out from Under" [...] {{and the other}} ballads from Circus [...] "have [...] hiccuping emotion from deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> throat". Chris Richards of The Washington Post commented that the singer [...] "emerges from her media bender hoping to forget the past" [...] with the song, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone considered it [...] "Spears' best ballad since 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman'". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said [...] "Out from Under" [...] "gleam with acoustic guitars", and that the song, [...] "My Baby" [...] and [...] "Unusual You", [...] "are the album's only attempts at warmth." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic considered the song, along with [...] "My Baby", [...] "a couple of not-good-at-all ballads", while Dave Donnelly of Sputnikmusic said both [...] "subtly evoke the Britney of old: airy pop ballads that benefit from the former Frou Frou producer's sophisticated, layered arrangements." [...] While comparing Circus to Blackout, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "the ballads are back, bringing with them the inevitable sprinkling of tedium". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that both songs [...] "are about five years out of date, and [...] vocals seem anemic and distracted {{in spite of the}} confessional lyrics." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today commented that [...] "Spears tosses in a couple of ballads along , but these really aren't her forte. The slew of top-flight producers [...] bolsters her vocal variety of echoes and gimmicky effects, but they don't really help the breathy 'Out From Under' or saccharin 'Unusual You'". Mike Newmark of PopMatters described the song as [...] "nearly-emo" [...] along with [...] "Unusual You," [...] saying both [...] "try for heartfelt and come off flabby." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Mwng feature quite solemn, {{personal}} lyrics, which reflect on a difficult few years for Rhys. The single, [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog", is about [...] "looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment", while [...] "Pan Ddaw'r Wawr" [...] deals {{with the death of}} rural communities. The singer claims to have wept—rather than sung—the album's last track, [...] "Gwreiddiau Dwfn" [...] / [...] "Mawrth Oer Ar y Blaned Neifion", which features lyrics [...] "so bleak it's almost comic" [...] about [...] "being rooted to a sad piece of land [...] being doomed to live somewhere and that's all you have and that's what you're stuck with". Rhys has described Datblygu's [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] as being about [...] "not knowing what love is or what love means." [...] "Drygioni" [...] is a song about [...] "sleaze [...] about good versus evil, and a person's need for both", and [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] is a [...] "moody song about war" [...] whose title is a Welsh insult that translates into English as [...] "Liverface". In contrast, [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] is a comedic song, based on an incident involving drummer Dafydd Ieuan being chased by bees after he disturbed a beehive while attempting to build a bonfire on a beach. It features lyrics that were [...] "made up on the spot" [...] by Rhys. [...] "Dacw Hi" [...] is inspired by one of Rhys's former teachers who claimed she had eyes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] is about the decline of the Roman road of the same name that was built between North and South Wales. [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon" [...] is partly inspired by the ostracisation the band felt from some areas of the Welsh musical community due to their decision to sing in English on earlier albums. The track's lyrics feature the old Welsh idiom [...] "y cythraul canu", which means [...] "the demon in music" [...] and refers to the friction this can create between people.|$|E

2500|$|Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx {{commented that}} several {{elements}} in the episode contradict the law of noncontradiction: [...] "Gloria is a police chief who isn’t really a police chief anymore, running a department that no longer quite exists, still technically {{married to a man}} who is no longer her husband, investigating the death of a man who hadn’t been her stepfather in decades but still had a paternal (or grandpaternal) presence in her life, was Ennis Stussy but not really Ennis Stussy, and who once wrote the tale of a helper robot that never seemed {{to get a chance to}} help anyone, then proved enormously helpful to the entire universe.
