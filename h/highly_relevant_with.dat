40|$|We {{set up a}} trade {{model with}} {{heterogeneous}} firms and a worker population that is heterogeneous in two dimensions: workers are either skilled or unskilled, and within each skill category there is a continuum of abilities. Workers with high abilities, both skilled and unskilled, are matched to firms with high productivities, and this leads to wage differentials within each skill category across firms. Self-selection of the most productive firms into exporting generates an exporter wage premium, and our framework with skilled and unskilled workers allows us to decompose this premium into its skill-specific components. We employ linked employer-employee data from Germany to structurally estimate {{the parameters of the}} model. Using these parameter estimates, we compute an average exporter wage premium of 5 percent.

40|$|We argue that, {{despite the}} fact that the field of {{multiscale}} modelling and simulation has enjoyed significant success within the past decade, it still holds many open questions that are deemed important but so far have barely been explored. We believe that this is at least in part due to the fact that the field has been mainly developed within disciplinary silos. The principal topics that in our view would benefit from a targeted multidisciplinary research effort are related to reaching consensus as to what exactly one means by ‘multiscale modelling’, formulating a generic theory or calculus of multiscale modelling, applying such concepts to the urgent question of validation and verification of multiscale models, and the issue of numerical error propagation in multiscale models. Moreover, we believe that this would, in principle, also lay the foundation for more efficient, well-defined and usable multiscale computing environments.

Within {{the scope of}} nonparametric time series, causal inference defined through interventions (cf. Pearl (2000)) is largely unexplored, although time order simplifies the problem substantially. We consider a marginal integration scheme for inferring causal effects from observational time series data, MINT-T (marginal integration in time series), which is an adaptation for time series of a method proposed by Ernest and Bühlmann (Electron. J. Statist, pp. 3155 - 3194, vol. 9, 2015) for the case of independent data. Our approach for stationary stochastic processes is fully nonparametric and, assuming no instantaneous effects consistently recovers the total causal effect of a single intervention with optimal one-dimensional nonparametric convergence rate n^- 2 / 5 assuming regularity conditions and twice differentiability of a certain corresponding regression function. Therefore, MINT-T remains largely unaffected by the curse of dimensionality as long as smoothness conditions hold in higher dimensions and it is feasible for a large class of stationary time series, including nonlinear and multivariate processes. For the case with instantaneous effects, we provide a procedure which guards against false positive causal statements...|$|R

Indeed, extended lifetime involves maintaining function and the capacity of living independently. Sarcopenia and physical frailty are both <b>highly</b> <b>relevant</b> entities <b>with</b> regards to functionality and autonomy of older adults. The concepts and definitions of frailty and sarcopenia have largely been revised over the years. Sarcopenia is an age-related progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. On the other hand, frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to stressors, responsible for exposing the older person to enhanced risk of adverse outcomes. Physical frailty and sarcopenia substantially overlap and several adverse outcomes of frailty are likely mediated by sarcopenia. Indeed, the concepts of sarcopenia and physical frailty can be perceived as related to the same target organ (i. e., skeletal muscle) and {{it may be possible to}} combine them into a unique definition. The biological background of such a close relationship needs to be explored and clarified as it can potentially provide novel and pivotal insights for the assessment and treatment of these conditions in old age.

40|$|Most bridge decks are {{orthotropic}}, {{because of}} the orthotropic nature of their component parts (e. g. isotropic slabs, grillages, T-beam bridge decks, multi-beam bridge decks, multi-cell boxbeam bridge, and slabs stiffened with ribs of box section). Thus, the orthotropic plate theory {{plays an important role}} in the static and dynamic analysis of bridges. For example, a multicellular Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite bridge deck can be modeled as an orthotropic plate with equivalent stiffnesses that account for the size, shape, and constituent materials of the cellular deck. Thus, the complexity of material anisotropy of the panels and orthotropic structure of the deck system can be reduced to an equivalent orthotropic plate with global elastic properties in two orthogonal directions – parallel and transverse to the longitudinal axis of the deck cell. This paper investigates a homogenization of composite, orthotropic, three-span, multi-girder bridge to explore the concept of the volumetric and mass fractions of a reinforced composite material. This homogenization takes into account all properties of this composite structure (deck slab, girders and diaphragms). From those, all the equivalent orthotropic plate properties were obtained.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} the afterglow emission of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) and its connection to the prompt γ-ray emission is still a debated issue. Relations between intrinsic properties of the prompt or afterglow emission can help to discriminate between plausible theoretical models of GRB production. Here we present {{an overview of the}} afterglow and prompt-afterglow two parameter relations, their physical interpretations, their use as redshift estimators and as possible cosmological tools. A similar task has already been correctly achieved for Supernovae (SNe) Ia by using the peak magnitude-stretch relation, known in the literature as the Phillips relation phillips 93. The challenge today is to make GRBs, which are amongst the farthest objects ever observed, standardizable candles as the SNe Ia through well established and robust relations. Thus, the study of relations amongst the observable and physical properties of GRBs is <b>highly</b> <b>relevant</b> together <b>with</b> selection biases in their physical quantities. Therefore, we describe {{the state of the art}} of the existing GRB relations, their possible and debated interpretations in view of the current theoretical models and how relations are corrected for selection biases. We conclude that only after an appropriate evaluation and correction for selection effects can GRB relations be used to discriminate among the theoretical models {{responsible for the}} prompt and afterglow emission and to estimate cosmological parameters.

The calibration issue was investigated by analysing 10 calibration blocks obtained with four GPS/IMU/optics-combinations. The earlier studies already showed that in-flight interior orientation determination was <b>highly</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>with</b> the data. The objectives of this study were to investigate the further extension of the system calibration model with the typical image deformation parameters and to evaluate efficient calibration routines for daily use. The physical image deformation parameters appeared to be quite problematic due to their high correlations with other parameters. Mathematical image deformation model of Ebner appeared to have a consistent behaviour; with the examined data the maximum corrections for image coordinates were 4 - 12 µm depending on the optics. It appeared that the accuracy of the direct orientation observations was the limiting quality factor. A minimal block geometry with a single bi-directional flight line and no ground control points (GCPs) allowed the determination of the principal point and boresight unknowns; the calibration with this minimal block structure was clearly advantageous. Single GCP improved the reliability, but in order to obtain good accuracy, several GCPs were needed. 1...|$|E

Dense ceramics sintered at relatively low temperatures (900 and 1200 degrees C), by employing minor additions of cobalt oxide sintering additive (2 mol%), {{were compared to}} those sintered at 1500 degrees C without additives. The effect of the sintering temperature on oxygen transport was analysed in O- 2 and N- 2 atmospheres. Oxide-ion transference numbers were determined by the modified electromotive force ([ME) method under oxygen/air and nitrogen/air gradients, showing positive temperature dependencies for all sintering temperatures. The partial ionic and electronic conductivities, calculated from the transference numbers and total conductivity, both increase with cobalt additions. A detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study shows a grain boundary location of the cobalt sintering additive at the lowest sintering temperature, 900 degrees C. On increasing sintering temperature the grain-boundary concentration of cobalt is depleted, leading {{to the presence of}} segregated grains of cobalt oxide.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{assembly}} job shop scheduling problem considering two phases of control: order review/release (ORR) and dispatching rules. Dispatching rules have been intensively used in earlier job shop research. Such rules determine the processing sequence of jobs {{waiting in the}} queues of corresponding machines. In recent years, ORR emerges as another option for job shop control and has received increasing attention. Such control determines when to release jobs to the shop floor. Different ORR mechanisms have been devised and are reported to bring several advantages such as reduced inventory cost of early finished orders, controlled and balanced shop load levels and shorter order flow time. Previous studies on ORR often assume a simplified job shop without assembly operations, while this research applies ORR to an assembly job shop. The aim {{of this research is}} to evaluate the ability of different combinations of ORR-dispatching rules in optimising due date and flow time related performance measures. Full factorial experiment has been designed for a simulated assembly job shop. Results show that both ORR and dispatching rules are <b>highly</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>with</b> respect to the due date and flow time related performance measures.
