The riparian countries - Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and a small part of China - form the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). This geographical region has the misfortune of being the world's epicenter of falciparum malaria, which is the most severe form of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Depending on the country, approximately 50 to 90 % of all malaria cases are due to this species. In the Malaria Modeling and Surveillance Project, we have been developing techniques to enhance public health s decision capability for malaria risk assessments and controls. The main objectives are: 1) identifying the potential breeding sites for major vector species; 2) implementing a malaria transmission model to identify the key factors that sustain or intensify malaria transmission; and 3) implementing a risk algorithm to predict the occurrence of malaria and its transmission intensity.

40|$|Surge-type Black Rapids Glacier, Alaska, has {{undergone}} strong retreat since it last surged in 1936 – 1937. To assess its evolution {{during the late}} Twentieth and Twenty-first centuries and determine potential implications for surge likelihood, we run a simplified glacier model over the periods 1980 – 2015 (<b>hindcasting)</b> and 2015 – 2100 (forecasting). The model is forced by daily temperature and precipitation fields, with downscaled reanalysis data used for the <b>hindcasting.</b> A constant climate scenario and an RCP 8. 5 scenario based on the GFDL-CM 3 climate model are employed for the forecasting. Debris evolution is accounted for by a debris layer time series derived from satellite imagery (<b>hindcasting)</b> and a parametrized debris evolution model (forecasting). A retreat model accounts {{for the evolution of}} the glacier geometry. Model calibration, validation and parametrization rely on an extensive set of in situ and remotely sensed observations. To explore uncertainties in our projections, we run the glacier model in a Monte Carlo fashion, varying key model parameters and input data within plausible ranges. Our results for the <b>hindcasting</b> period indicate a negative mass balance trend, caused by atmospheric warming in the summer, precipitation decrease in the winter and surface elevation lowering (climate-elevation feedback), which exceed the moderating effects from increasing debris cover and glacier retreat. Without the 2002 rockslide deposits on Black Rapids' lower reaches, the mass balances would be more negative, by ~ 20 % between the 2003 and 2015 mass-balance years. Despite its retreat, Black Rapids Glacier is substantially out of balance with the current climate. By 2100, ~ 8 % of Black Rapids' 1980 area are projected to vanish under the constant climate scenario and ~ 73 % under the RCP 8. 5 scenario. For both scenarios, the remaining glacier portions are out of balance, suggesting continued retreat after 2100. Due to mass starvation, a surge in the Twenty-first century is unlikely. The projected retreat will affect the glacier's runoff and change the landscape in the Black Rapids area markedly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the development of the numerical wave prediction models and recently used neural networks for ocean wave <b>hindcasting</b> and forecasting. The numerical wave models express the physical concepts of the phenomena. The performance of the numerical wave model depends on how best the phenomena are expressed into the numerical schemes, so that more accurate wave parameters could be estimated. There are still scopes for improving the numerical wave models. When exact input-output parameters are known for the same phenomenon, it can be well de-fined by the neural network. <b>Hindcasting</b> of ocean wave parameters using neural networks shows its potential usefulness. It is observed that the short-term wave predictions using neural networks are very close to the actual ones.
