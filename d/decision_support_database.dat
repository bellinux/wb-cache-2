40|$|Dramatic {{increases}} in the main-memory size of computers is allowing some applications to shift their main data storage area from disk to main memory and, as a result, increase their performance. This trend is at work in some databases, resulting in what is called memory-resident databases. However, because of the increasing gap between processor and main memory speed, in these systems, effective use of the cache hierarchy is crucial to high performance. Unfortunately, there has been relatively little work on building cache-friendly database systems. In this paper, we present several cache-oriented optimizations to enable effective exploitation of caches in memory-resident <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>databases.</b> The main optimization involves developing a query optimizer that includes the cost of cache misses in its cost metrics.

40|$|Abstract: Decision {{support systems}} (DSS) and data {{warehousing}} workloads comprise an increasing {{fraction of the}} database market today. I/O capacity and associated processing requirements for DSS workloads are increasing at a rapid rate, doubling roughly every nine to twelve months [38]. In response to this increasing storage and computational demand, we present a computer architecture for <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>database</b> servers that utilizes &quot;intelligent &quot; disks (IDISKs). IDISKs utilize low-cost embedded general-purpose processing, main memory, and high-speed serial communication links on each disk. IDISKs are connected to each other via these serial links and high-speed crossbar switches, overcoming the I/O bus bottleneck of conventional systems. By off-loading computation from expensive desktop processors, IDISK systems may improve cost-performance. More importantly, the IDISK architecture allows the processing of the system to scale with increasing storage demand. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} gap between processors and main memory is continuously increasing, making the cache hit-rate paramount for performance. Previous {{studies have shown}} that the performance of a cache leaves room for improvement, which is especially true for data caches. The effectiveness of a cache is dictated by the locality of the software, and hence the software behavior directs the cache performance. In this paper we present a framework for studying spatial locality. It focuses on the characteristics of the spatial locality in terms of closeness in time and closeness in space, in order to quantitate not only the amount of sequential data that are accessed but also have a potential for it to hit in the cache. By using this framework we are able to obtain knowledge on how to improve the cache performance.

A practicing radiologist may face {{different kinds of problems}} from pathology finding in im-age, suggestion of appropriate workup in a specific situation, formulating relevant differential diagnosis list for comparison with normal variants and artifacts. When a radiologist has the opportunity to use a computer he/she will also be able to use digital material/technology to solve these problems and make sound decisions. The available methods/materials for digital <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> in radiology may be categorized as follow: A. Image Processing When a radiological image is captured or converted to digital format, techniques like edge enhancement and contrast change may improve the diagnostic value of an image and help in decision making. B. Computer-aided Detection Thoracic imaging and mammography are two fields with promising advances in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). The ultimate role of CAD is as a second opinion besides radiologists own perception. It is obvious how-ever that when available, CAD may decrease detection errors in radiology practice. C. <b>Decision</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Databases</b> Image Banks: An electronic atlas may be used to compare patients’ image to a predefined classified set of im-ages in order to help radiologist in pattern recognition.

40|$|Data {{warehouse}} means a <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>database</b> allowing integration, organization, historisation, {{and management}} of data from heterogeneous sources, {{with the aim of}} exploiting them for decision-making. Data warehouses are essentially based on multidimensional model. This model organizes data into facts (subjects of analysis) and dimensions (axes of analysis). In classical data warehouses, facts are composed of numerical measures and dimensions which characterize it. Dimensions are organized into hierarchical levels of detail. Based on the navigation and aggregation mechanisms offered by OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) tools, facts can be analyzed according to the desired level of detail. In real world applications, facts are not always numerical, and can be of qualitative nature. In addition, sometimes a human expert or learned model such as a decision tree provides a qualitative evaluation of phenomenon based on its different parameters i. e. dimensions. Conventional data warehouses are thus not adapted to qualitative reasoning and have not the ability to deal with qualitative data. In previous work, we have proposed an original approach of qualitative data warehouse modeling, which permits integrating qualitative measures. Based on computing with words methodology, we have extended classical multidimensional data model to allow the aggregation and analysis of qualitative data in OLAP environment.

40|$|SUMMARY: This study {{describes}} {{the framework for}} developing a knowledge-based <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> system (KBDSS) for making more informed decisions for managing variation orders in institutional buildings. The KBDSS framework consists of two main components, i. e., a knowledge base and a <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> shell. The <b>database</b> will be developed through collecting data from source documents of 80 institutional projects, questionnaire survey, literature review and in-depth interview sessions with the professionals {{who were involved in}} these institutional projects. The knowledge base will be developed through initial sieving and organization of data from the <b>database.</b> The <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> shell would provide <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> through a structured process consisting of building the hierarchy between the main criteria and the suggested controls, rating the controls, and analyzing the controls for selection through multiple analytical techniques. The KBDSS would be capable of displaying variations and their relevant details, a variety of filtered knowledge, and various analyses of available knowledge. This would eventually lead the decision maker to the suggested controls for variations and assist in selecting the most appropriate controls. The KBDSS would assist project managers by providing accurate and timely information for decision-making, and a user-friendly system for analyzing and selecting the controls for variation orders for institutional buildings. The study would assist building professionals in developing an effective variation management system. The system would be helpful for them to take proactive measures fo...|$|R
