500|$|Late in 2003, Timbaland {{delivered}} the second Bubba Sparxxx album, Deliverance, {{and the third}} Timbaland & Magoo album, Under Construction, Part II Both albums were released to little fanfare or acclaim even though Deliverance was praised by reviews and embraced by the internet community. In 2004 Timbaland produced singles for LL Cool J, Xzibit, Fatman Scoop, and Jay Z, and he produced the bulk of Brandy’s fourth album, Afrodisiac. Timbaland co-wrote two tracks (Exodus '04 and Let Me <b>Give</b> <b>You</b> <b>My</b> Love) and produced three tracks of the American-Japanese Pop star Hikaru Utada’s second English album, Exodus.

500|$|Mikey MiGo of 411mania {{wrote that}} the song is a [...] "welcomed change" [...] from Timberlake's past work. She stated that the song [...] "has qualities of Prince that I've never seen anyone muster up before". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic called the song [...] "musically and melodically great", but criticized its lyrics. She {{wrote that the}} lyrics sound like the {{dialogue}} of a [...] "low-rent porn film", highlighting the lines: [...] "She's pressed up on me; I think she's ready to blow?" [...] and [...] "All I need is a moment alone, to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>my</b> tongue and {{get you out of}} control". According to Murray, [...] "It makes one question exactly what films Timberlake was starring in during his sabbatical."

500|$|Although Balzac did {{not draw}} {{specifically}} {{from the women}} in his life to create Valérie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is {{similar in some ways}} to Valérie's manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie's treacherous character, he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot. He once wrote to her: [...] "je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu'un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie" [...] ("I commit for [...] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; I <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>my</b> blood, my honor, my life").|$|E
500|$|Delft, {{captured}} {{in the early stages}} of the battle, was under the command of the Dutch Lieutenant Heilberg and the British Lieutenant Charles Bullen, with a small prize crew of 69 men. Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message [...] "The ship is sinking". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, gesturing to the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying [...] "But how can I leave these men?". In response, Bullen cried out [...] "God bless you, my brave fellow! Here is my hand; I <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>my</b> word I will stay her with you!". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.|$|E

The producer Biddu originally hired Douglas to sing [...] "I Want to <b>Give</b> <b>You</b> <b>My</b> Everything" [...] but needed something to record for the B-side, and asked Douglas if he had any lyrics they could use. Douglas showed several, out of which Biddu chose the one that would later be called [...] "Kung Fu Fighting" [...] and worked out a melody for it without taking it too seriously.|$|E
