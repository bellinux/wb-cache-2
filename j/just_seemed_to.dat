Has it been fair thus far?" [...] Detractors began to liken him to [...] "the cranky uncle who lives in the attic," [...] or [...] "the angry old guy that <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> want to become angrier." [...] Berkeley political scientist David Terr found that moderator George Stephanopoulos directed roughly five percent of his questions to Gravel; in a poll asking who did the best in the debate, Gravel placed seventh among the eight candidates. National opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination continued to show Gravel with one percent or zero percent numbers. By the end of the third-quarter 2007, Gravel had about $17,500 in cash on hand, had collected a total of about $380,000 so far during the 2008 election cycle, and was continuing to run a threadbare campaign with minimal staff.|$|E

He saw an opponent's {{weakness}} in a second. [...] Time and time again, he got a champion batsman's wicket by putting on a bowler he knew the batsman did not like." [...] The English batsman K. S. Ranjitsinhji considered Trott as a captain [...] "without a superior anywhere today". Wisden thought him, [...] "with the exception of ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country." [...] The sporting newspaper The Referee wrote, [...] " [...] bowlers felt he understood the gruelling nature of their work and that they had his sympathy in the grimmest of battles."

Corgan remarked that [...] "I don't think we've ever had people react ...it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> touch a nerve." [...] It won six awards at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1996: Video of the Year, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction in a Video (Directors: Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris), Best Special Effects in a Video (Special Effects: Chris Staves), Best Art Direction in a Video (Art Director: K. K. Barrett and Wayne White) and Best Cinematography in a Video (Director of Photography: Declan Quinn).

500|$|The album's cover art, {{photographed by}} Ament, {{features}} two skeletons wearing crowns, suggesting {{the possibility that}} the two represent a king and a queen. The forged metal figurines were created by blacksmith Kelly Gilliam. According to Ament, the band had trouble coming up with a name for the album. After the artwork had been finalized and the tracks were sequenced, the band spent weeks {{trying to come up with}} a title. Vedder suggested Riot Act, and the band members went with it as they were tired with trying to come up with a title. McCready stated that the title has no real significance. He said, [...] "I guess we were trying to come up with a title that reflected some of the music on the record, which we thought was urgent-sounding and kind of loud...It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> fit."

500|$|John Nigro of The Pitt News {{considered}} [...] "Petarded" [...] one {{of volume}} 3's best episodes along with [...] "Breaking Out Is Hard to Do" [...] and [...] "Perfect Castaway". The Sydney Morning Herald critic Marc McEvoy commented [...] "Petarded" [...] to be [...] "a real thigh-slapper." [...] Kim Voynar of TV Squad gave the episode a mixed review, saying [...] " [...] it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> wrap {{up a little}} too quickly for me, like {{they ran out of}} time and were like, 'Oops, let's wrap this up now'. Other than that quibble, though, it was a fairly funny episode." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number five on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "one of the best episodes ever" [...] for fans of offensive humor. He also noted that the episode did not [...] "go down all that well at the time with censors and charity groups." ...|$|E

500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Hershey's {{offensive}} problems {{continued in}} a 3–1 loss against the Portland Pirates on November 11, {{in which they}} struggled to get the puck out of their zone and through the neutral zone. Holtby, who made 31 saves, said afterward, [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> look dead the last couple games." [...] Kalinski suffered a hand injury and would not return until December 27. The Bears fell to Syracuse again on November 16. The 6–1 game, the most lopsided defeat of the season, was their third consecutive loss and third straight home game with only one goal. Hershey broke a three-game losing streak on November 17 with a 4–1 against the Penguins, where Garrett Mitchell scored two goals, including Hershey's first successful penalty shot since February 27, 2010. The team had surrendered two goals or fewer in eight of their past 14 games. But Hershey lost their next two games, including a 4–0 shutout loss to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on November 21. The Binghamton-based Internet radio Power Play Post Show reported from an anonymous source that Penguins head coach John Hynes put a $200 bounty on Bears defenseman Oleksy for that game, a claim Hynes strongly denied.|$|E
500|$|Kelefa Sanneh wrote a lukewarm {{review of}} the album in The New York Times, believing that Jay-Z's {{reluctance}} to indulge in the gangsta rap lyricism of his past resulted in wavering, equivocal songs such as [...] "No Hook" [...] and [...] "Say Hello". [...] "Once, words <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> flow out of him, as if he couldn't help himself", Sanneh wrote. [...] "Now it's clearer than ever that he's choosing them carefully." [...] Louis Pattison of NME was more critical and called it a regression from the [...] "slightly bloated" [...] Kingdom Come, lamenting the shortage of [...] "don't-give-a-fuck attitude" [...] highlighted on [...] "Success" [...] in favor of less effective raps exploiting Jay-Z's entrepreneurial personage. In MSN Music, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Say Hello" [...] and [...] "Blue Magic" [...] as highlights while humorously using sampled film dialogue from the latter track to frame his lukewarm opinion of the album: [...] "Jay-Z, that's a brand name, like Pepsi, that's a brand name – he stands behind it, he guarantees it, even if you don't know him {{any more than you}} know the chairman of Universal Music".|$|E

500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> piss off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be the right time for us to come back – it's a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It'll be good {{to get back on the}} old live circuit again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid. [...] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it's a bit more focused. And I think it's a bit more impassioned".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, saying it [...] "glistens with a neon pulse". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine named [...] "Marry the Night" [...] a stand-out track {{on the album}} and called it [...] "a worthy successor to 'Dance in the Dark'". BBC Music's Mark Savage called [...] "Marry the Night" [...] as perfect as [...] "a straightforward fist-pumping entry into a colossus can be." [...] Christian Blauvelt of Entertainment Weekly compared the song {{with the work of}} Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder. Caryn Ganz of Spin was impressed with the track, calling it a [...] "four-on-the-floor banger." [...] Tim Jonze of The Guardian compared the chorus of the song [...] "It's My Life" [...] by Dr Alban and felt that it was easily forgotten compared to some of the bigger dance songs on the album. Rolling Stones was impressed with the fact that [...] "Marry the Night" [...] <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> get [...] "bigger, and bigger" [...] to her, while listing pop and glam metal and artists like Pat Benatar, Bonnie Tyler and Bon Jovi as its influences.

500|$|The Beatles reconvened at EMI Studios on 21 October {{to conduct}} three {{additional}} takes, including the master. The group experimented with the arrangements, {{with the second}} take introducing a double-tracked sitar opening that complemented Lennon's acoustic melody. Though the group completely reshaped [...] "Norwegian Wood", {{it was far from}} the album version. Harrison's sitar playing is still at the forefront, alongside heavy drumbeats. The take was not considered suitable for overdubbing, so the band scrapped it, and re-evaluated the arrangement. By the third take, the song was called [...] "Norwegian Wood", and the group changed the key from D major, to E major. The Beatles skipped the rhythm section on this take, and decided to jump directly to the master take. In all, the rhythm section accommodates the acoustics, and the band thought the musical style was an improvement over earlier run-throughs. Therefore, the sitar is an accompaniment, consequently affecting the droning sound evident in past takes. Looking back on the recording sessions in the 1990s, Harrison explained his inclusion of the sitar to be [...] "quite spontaneous from what I remember", adding, [...] "We miked it up and put it on and it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> hit the spot".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the album {{influenced}} post-punk band Joy Division as bassist Peter Hook related it: [...] "We {{were introduced to}} Kraftwerk by [...] Ian Curtis, who insisted we play Trans Europe Express before we went on stage every time. The tape was played at the venue over the PA system, to be heard by everyone. The first time was Pips [...] Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor {{in time to the}} track. It took us ages of pleading to get him back in." [...] Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division [...] "used to play Trans-Europe Express before we went on stage, to get us into the zone. It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum. Trans-Europe Express <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> express an optimism - even if people see it as machine music". Morris also said: [...] "It reminds me of Cabaret, the film, with all of the 1920s singing. [...] When you get that marriage between humans and machines, and you get it right, it's fantastic. I have to say it's my favourite Kraftwerk album." [...] In the mid-1980s, Siouxsie and the Banshees' rendition of [...] "The Hall of Mirrors", on their album Through the Looking Glass, {{was one of the few}} cover versions that [...] Ralf Hütter hailed in glowing terms as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E
500|$|On September 10, Eleanor Roosevelt, {{the late}} president's widow and the gubernatorial candidate's mother, arrived in California {{for a quick}} {{campaign}} swing to support her son and Douglas before she {{had to return to}} New York as a delegate to the United Nations. Douglas hoped that the former first lady's visit would mark {{a turning point in the}} campaign. At a Democratic rally featuring Mrs. Roosevelt the next day in Long Beach, Nixon workers first handed out a flyer headed [...] "Douglas–Marcantonio Voting Record", printed with dark ink on pink paper. The legal-size flyer compared the voting records of Douglas and Marcantonio, principally in the area of national security, and concluded that they were indistinguishable. In contrast, the flyer said, Nixon had voted entirely in opposition to the [...] "Douglas–Marcantonio Axis". It implied that sending Douglas to the Senate would be no different from electing Marcantonio, and asked if that was what Californians wanted. The paper soon became known as the [...] "Pink Sheet". Chotiner later stated that the color choice was made at the print shop when campaign officials approved the final copy, and [...] "for some reason or other it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> appeal to us for the moment". An initial print run of 50,000 was soon followed by a reprint of 500,000, distributed principally in heavily populated Southern California.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a little bit too surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt {{like something out of a}} bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E
500|$|During United's first league {{game of the}} 2008–09 {{season at}} home to Newcastle United, Carrick was {{substituted}} after just 25 minutes {{as a result of}} an injured ankle in the 1–1 draw. The following day, it was confirmed he would be out for up to three weeks, which ruled him out of the UEFA Super Cup match against Zenit St. Petersburg on 29 August. His return to action came on 13 September in a 2–1 away loss to Liverpool, he was taken off at half-time during after sustaining another injury. Three days later, it was revealed he would be out for up to six weeks after breaking a bone in his foot during a challenge with Yossi Benayoun. On 1 November, Carrick scored his first goal of the season in a 4–3 home win over Hull City. His second goal followed two weeks later in a 5–0 home win over Stoke City. His first goal of 2009 came on 22 April as he scored late on in a 2–0 home win over Portsmouth. On 13 May, he assisted Carlos Tevez and then scored a late winner in a 2–1 win away to Wigan. The goal was Carrick's first for United away from home and meant that they only needed one point from their final two games to gain a third successive Premier League title. Carrick ensured a third title in three years with United as they drew with Arsenal 0–0 at home on 18 May to claim an 18th overall English title. On 27 May, Carrick played the full match in the 2009 Champions League Final in a 2–0 defeat by Barcelona. This defeat was described by Carrick as worst night of his career as he said [...] "the game <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> pass us by and we were unable to do anything about it.
