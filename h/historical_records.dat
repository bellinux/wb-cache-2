5|$|As of 2014, {{researchers}} have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from <b>historical</b> <b>records.</b> The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and {{little is known}} about them {{due to the lack of}} detailed records.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{materials}} left by peoples themselves, there are also the reports of other who have encountered them. The <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> of the Conquistadores are {{a rich source of}} information about the pre-Columbian Americans. Ethnographers also provide material about many other peoples.|$|E
5000|$|Annals ( [...] , from , [...] "year") are {{properly}} a concise <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> in which events are arranged chronologically, year by year, although {{the term is}} also used loosely for any <b>historical</b> <b>record.</b>|$|R
50|$|Historical {{negationism}} or denialism is {{an illegitimate}} {{distortion of the}} <b>historical</b> <b>record.</b> It is often imprecisely referred to as historical revisionism, but that term also denotes a legitimate academic pursuit of re-interpretation of the <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> and questioning the accepted views.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of the international criminal trial is to create an accurate and accessible <b>historical</b> <b>record.</b> This paper analyses to what extent plea bargaining can hinder or facilitate the establishment of the <b>historical</b> <b>record.</b> Drawing on the experience of the ICTY and the ICTR the author makes a number of proposals as to what how and to extent plea bargaining should be used at the ICC to advance rather than to obstruct the <b>historical</b> <b>record...</b>|$|R
5|$|The archaeological and <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> suggest {{interdependence}} {{between humans}} and vultures for millions of years. Like other animal species, early hominins probably used these birds as beacons signalling the location of meat, {{in the form of}} carcasses, in the landscape.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the chronicle}} Madala Panji, in 318 AD, the priests and servitors {{of the temple}} {{spirited}} away the idols to escape {{the wrath of the}} Rashtrakuta king Rakatavahu. In the temple's <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> it finds mention in the Brahma Purana and Skanda Purana stating that the temple was built by the king Indradyumna, Ujjayani.|$|E
5|$|After Aymer's {{death in}} 1324, the castle passed by {{marriage}} to Lawrence, Lord Hastings, and {{was held in}} the Hastings family until 1390, when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it. There are few <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> of the castle beyond this point, but it appears to have been abandoned in the early 14th century and by the 15th century had become ruined.|$|E
50|$|Another written {{source of}} Buginese is Lontara, a term {{which refers to}} the {{traditional}} script and <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> as well. The earliest <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> of Lontara dates to around the 17th century, and being influenced by myths, is not considered a reliable historical source.|$|R
50|$|The {{prehistory}} of Ireland {{has been}} pieced together from archaeological and genetic evidence; {{it begins with}} the first evidence of humans in Ireland around 12,500 years ago and finishes with {{the start of the}} <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> around 400 AD. The prehistoric period covers the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age societies of Ireland. For much of Europe, the <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> begins when the Romans invaded; as Ireland was not invaded by the Romans its <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> starts later, with the coming of Christianity.|$|R

5|$|Climate is {{a measure}} of the {{long-term}} trends in the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on <b>historical</b> <b>records,</b> the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 18th century, Mentolat erupted {{and formed}} lava flows on its western flank. These are Mentolat's best {{preserved}} volcanic deposits. The eruption deposited lapilli pumice. No <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> of activity exist, however, although reports by Serrano in the 18th century may {{refer to a}} lava flow from Mentolat. The most recent eruption {{may have been in}} 1850, or 1710 ± 5.|$|E
5|$|<b>Historical</b> <b>records</b> {{indicate}} that a semi-circular structure or barbican was built by Edward I in 1277; this area was later named the Lion Tower, to the immediate west of the Middle Tower. Records from 1335 indicate {{the purchase of a}} lock and key for the lions and leopards, also suggesting they were located near the western entrance of the Tower. By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie.|$|E

5|$|<b>Historical</b> <b>records</b> {{reveal that}} despite the {{repeated}} attacks by enemies to capture the fort, it was not taken, except for a lone one-day occupation by Kamran Mirza. Kamran was the second son of the Mughal Emperor Babur who attacked Bikaner in 1534, which was then ruled by Rao Jait Singh.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{site where}} <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> {{have been used}} to {{interpret}} sites is Chichen Itza. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> is the Mayan interest in the planet Venus. This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.|$|E
5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose had {{additional}} decks, {{but since}} virtually nothing of them survives, their design {{has had to}} be reconstructed from <b>historical</b> <b>records.</b> Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as having three decks in both castles.

5|$|Under Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were {{virtually}} {{excluded from the}} important public offices. Mucianus himself all but disappeared from <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77. Real power was unmistakably concentrated {{in the hands of}} the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of democracy.|$|E
5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> of the time.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have brought with them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and <b>historical</b> <b>records,</b> the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{earliest}} <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> of Copenhagen {{are from the}} end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen.|$|E
5|$|Buford {{appears in}} <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> {{beginning}} in the early 19th century. The area that is now Buford was originally part of Cherokee territory. Despite the treaty in 1817 that ceded the territory to the United States and Gwinnett County's legislative establishment in 1818, the area was still largely inhabited by the Cherokee until the 1830s. The first non-Native Americans moved to the Buford area in the late 1820s or early 1830s, although the Buford area was not largely settled by them until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} the presbyterate {{in the first}} months of 1786, and was appointed for the Concepción parish, the same one where he was baptized. He also worked at the aforementioned House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires. He got the curacy of Magdalena on 12 September 1790, but resigned a year later because of health problems. He returned in 1793, and resigned definitively on 21 February 1794. After this, he moved to Maldonado. There are few <b>historical</b> <b>records</b> of his activities in those curacies.|$|E
