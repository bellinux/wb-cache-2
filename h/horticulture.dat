5|$|Félix Delahaye {{was the son}} of Normandy {{labourer}} Abraham Delahaye and {{his wife}} Marie-Anne-Élisabeth Sapeigne who lived in the village of Caumont (Seine-Maritime) about 20 kilometres from Le Havre. At the age of 17 he left his parents’ farm and was employed as an apprentice gardener at the botanical garden of the Académie des Sciences in Rouen, historic capital of Normandy, under the direction of a Monsieur Varin. Just before the French Revolution in 1788, at the age of 20, he commenced work with André Thouin at the Jardin du Roi in Paris as a junior gardener, rising through the ranks to become Director of <b>Horticulture</b> at the city's new school of <b>horticulture</b> (Ecole Nationale d’Horticulture). His mentor, Thouin, was professor of <b>horticulture</b> in the Botany School of the Jardin du Roi. After the French Revolution this garden assumed its present name, the Jardin des Plantes. Thouin was also treasurer to the prestigious Société d’Histoire Naturelle and is commemorated by the name Thoin Bay in Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|Ohio is a lead {{producer}} of <b>horticulture</b> products, from greenhouse and nursery plants to bulbs. The {{state is a}} {{producer of}} white ash trees for landscaping, totalling 25,000 annually. California, Florida, Texas, Michigan, and Ohio accounted for 42% of the nation's production of bedding plants in 2002. Oberer's Flowers, headquartered in Dayton, is the nation's fifth-largest florist, while Aris <b>Horticulture,</b> headquartered in Barberton, is a world leader in research and breeding. Lake County Nursery offers over 1,000 varieties of plants and California-based Monrovia Nursery Company, a global leader, operates nurseries in Springfield.|$|E

5|$|Then, on March 8, 1859, Holmes {{was asked}} to resign as treasurer, and he complied. Some time in that year or the one following, he was {{appointed}} once again as Superintendent of <b>Horticulture,</b> guiding students in planting the College gardens and improving the grounds. Through 1861 he continued to be listed in the college catalog under various titles including Professor of <b>Horticulture,</b> Secretary, and Treasurer.|$|E

5|$|In <b>horticulture,</b> several species, cultivars and hybrids are used. Because {{of their}} wide range and many variations, the most {{important}} are those derived from E. gutatta and E. lutea. E. cuprea alone has at least 10 cultivars and hybrids.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years the area {{was used as a}} tipping site by industry and partly filled with construction rubble and slag from steel works. Now owned and managed by Groundwork Manchester, Salford, Stockport, Tameside & Trafford, the park is used as a training centre for <b>horticulture</b> training and as a volunteering hub.|$|E
5|$|Many commoners residences {{were built}} {{along the edge}} of El Laberinto swamp {{to the west of the}} site core, {{although}} some high-status residences and public buildings were interspersed among these. The area between the residences was used for <b>horticulture.</b>|$|E
5|$|The work {{is divided}} into 37 books, {{organised}} into ten volumes.

5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in <b>horticulture</b> {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Exports {{and imports}} by air in 2005 were {{estimated}} at £62.7billion and £59.6billion respectively, {{with a significant}} majority of air freight operations being conducted with countries outside of the EU, and express freight operations transporting 5 per cent by value of all UK exports in 2004. Whilst export/import facilities provide opportunities for international trade and competition, they are not without negative effect, and British <b>horticulture</b> {{is one example of}} domestic industry damaged by cheap imports.|$|E
5|$|Holmes was keenly {{involved}} with {{the details of the}} Agricultural College, influencing everything from the purchase of land for the campus, layout of the buildings, and even the placement of the chairs and tables. Once the College opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of <b>Horticulture.</b> By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} {{in what is now}} Pennsylvania since at least 10,000BC. The first {{settlers}} were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000to 1000BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and <b>horticulture,</b> between 1000BC and 1500AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrows, and ornaments.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, some of {{the stones}} were used to {{construct}} an outdoor reading terrace adjoining the Helen Crocker Russell Library of <b>Horticulture,</b> part of the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens in Golden Gate Park. Other stones were used for various purposes around Golden Gate Park and the Japanese Tea Garden, taken unofficially by park workers as they saw fit. Some of these {{ended up in the}} park's AIDS Memorial Grove, others on a scent-based flower walkway named Garden of Fragrance.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, botanical gardens, as {{cultural}} and scientific organisations, {{have responded to}} the interests of botany and <b>horticulture.</b> Nowadays, most botanical gardens display a mix of the themes mentioned and more; having a strong connection with the general public, there is the opportunity to provide visitors with information relating to the environmental issues being faced {{at the start of the}} 21st century, especially those relating to plant conservation and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Progressively more {{sophisticated}} scientific technology has aided {{the development of}} contemporary botanical offshoots in the plant sciences, ranging from the applied fields of economic botany (notably agriculture, <b>horticulture</b> and forestry), to the detailed examination of the structure and function of plants and their interaction with the environment over many scales from the large-scale global significance of vegetation and plant communities (biogeography and ecology) through to the small scale of subjects like cell theory, molecular biology and plant biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 16 days to germinate. Rarely cultivated, Banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years from seed. Information is limited on its reliability, {{but it has been}} grown {{successfully}} in South Australia. It is fast-growing but ultimately untidy in habit, and would benefit from regular pruning. Some forms in the wild have a more compact habit, and are more promising for <b>horticulture.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{botanist}} Antonio José Cavanilles described B.oblongifolia in 1800, {{though it}} was known as Banksia asplenifolia in New South Wales for many years. However, the latter name, originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury, proved invalid, and Banksia oblongifolia has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. Two varieties were recognised in 1987, but these have not been generally accepted. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences. Though easily grown as a garden plant, it is not commonly seen in <b>horticulture.</b>|$|E
5|$|The , {{also known}} as Abhilashitartha Chintamani, is an early 12th-century Sanskrit text {{composed}} by the South Indian king Someshvara III of the Kalyani Chalukya dynasty. It is an encyclopedic work covering topics such as polity, governance, ethics, economics, astronomy, astrology, rhetoric, veterinary medicine, <b>horticulture,</b> perfumes, food, architecture, sports, painting, poetry and music. The text is a valuable source of socio-cultural information on 11th- and 12th-century India.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} two major further {{education}} institutions. York College is an amalgamation of York Technical College and York Sixth Form College. Students there study {{a very wide}} range of academic and vocational courses, and range from school leavers and sixth formers to people training to make career moves. Askham Bryan College offers further education courses, foundation and honours degrees, specialising in more vocational subjects such as <b>horticulture,</b> agriculture, animal management and even golf course management.|$|E
5|$|The last sub-book of {{the text}} {{discusses}} recreation through <b>horticulture</b> {{and the art of}} creating gardens, painting, perfumery, architecture and the training and breeding of horses, elephants, lavakki (a type of quail), and other wildlife. A chapter is devoted to the royal sport of hunting deer or other wild game. It deals with 35 ways of game hunting of deer, in addition to hunting with dogs, falconry and fishing.|$|E
5|$|This part {{of campus}} {{is home to}} the MSU <b>Horticulture</b> Gardens and the {{adjoining}} 4-H Children's Garden. South of the gardens lie the Canadian National and CSX railroads, which divide the main campus from thousands of acres of university-owned farmland. The university's agricultural facilities include the Horse, Dairy Cattle, Beef Cattle, Sheep, and Poultry Teaching and Research Farms, as well as the Air Quality Control Lab and the Diagnostics Center for Population and Animal Health.|$|E
5|$|William Stearn wrote {{extensively}} {{on the history of}} botany and <b>horticulture,</b> from Ancient Greece to his own times. He collected together J. E. Raven's 1976 J. H. Gray Lectures, editing and annotating them as Plants and Plant Lore in Ancient Greece (1990). In 1993, he and Eldwyth Ruth Stearn translated and expanded Baumann's Die griechische Pflanzenwelt in Mythos, Kunst und Literatur (1986) as The Greek Plant World in Myth, Art, and Literature.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} Detroit at age 26, Holmes married into a {{merchant}} family. He later {{got involved in}} both the Detroit Horticultural Society and the Board of Education. In 1849, his background in <b>horticulture</b> and education led him to co-found the Michigan State Agricultural Society, a group dedicated to establishing a state-funded agricultural college in Michigan. Holmes spent {{the next six years}} drafting legislation and gaining support for his cause, and in 1855, the Michigan state governor signed a bill establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Another method {{adopted in}} the past to tackle the phumdis was by way of {{diverting}} them towards the Khordak River. However, as this approach had not been very successful, the State Government planned to construct a canal at Tera Khunou Khong Ahanbi to divert the phumdis to Manipur River. Other methods adopted by the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) to control phumdis and water hyacinth include introducing weevils for the biological control of water hyacinth, which was carried out in collaboration with the <b>Horticulture</b> Institute of Bangalore. Reports have shown this to be an effective method in controlling water hyacinth.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{acquired}} by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, once owned by Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as ‘La Bagatelle’. On this site two nurserymen raised the famous apple cultivars ‘John Downie’ and ‘James Grieve’. Today, the zoo {{has one of the}} most diverse tree collections in the Lothians with 120 species. The south-facing aspect allows bananas to be grown outside. Increasingly, <b>horticulture</b> is seen as a discipline in its own right, with the focus on habitat creation within enclosures, food stuffs for the animals, and enrichment for both the animals and the visiting public.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Farms was the {{original}} location for the School of Practical Agriculture and <b>Horticulture,</b> established by the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture in conjunction with Walter Law. The school's purpose was to teach students in farming, gardening, poultry-keeping, and other agriculture-related skills. The school moved to a farm near Poughkeepsie in 1903, and the school building was run as a hotel for two years until it became Miss Knox's School. After the building burned down in 1912, Miss Knox's School was relocated several times; since 1954, the Knox School has been located in St. James, New York.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{took the}} full range of {{architectural}} courses including studying engineering, physics, maths, mechanical drafting and freehand drawing in addition to architectural and landscape design. She also studied botany and <b>horticulture</b> under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the landscape design program there, who was an advocate of the classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens that combined architectural features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas.|$|E
5|$|Dorchester has {{a private}} school, Sunninghill Prep School, {{thirteen}} first schools, three middle schools and an upper school; the Thomas Hardye School {{was founded in}} 1569 by a merchant and in 2011 had 2,283 pupils on the role. The author Thomas Hardy was a school governor here from 1909 until shortly before his death. Nineteen schools in the Dorchester area form the Dorchester Area Schools Partnership (DASP). Kingston Maurward College is a land-based studies college {{on the outskirts of}} the town. It offers full-time and part-time courses, apprenticeships and university-level courses in a wide range of subjects including agriculture, <b>horticulture,</b> conservation, construction, countryside and wildlife management.|$|E
