40|$|Obtaining the {{distribution}} of the profit and loss (PL) of a portfolio is a key problem in market risk measurement. However, existing methods, such as those based on the Normal distribution, and historical simulation methods, which use empirical distribution of risk factors, face difficulties in dealing with {{at least one of the}} following three problems: describing {{the distribution}}al properties of risk factors appropriately (description problem); deriving distributions of risk factors with time horizon longer than one day (time aggregation problem); and deriving {{the distribution of}} the PL given the distributional properties of the risk factors (risk aggregation problem). Here, we show that <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> can provide reasonable solutions to all three problems. <b>Expansion</b> <b>methods</b> approximate a probability density function by a sum of orthogonal polynomials multiplied by an associated weight function. One of the most important advantages of <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> is that they only require moments of the target distribution up to some order to obtain an approximation. Therefore they have the potential to be applied in a wide range of situations, including in attempts to solve the three problems listed above. On the other hand, it is also known that expansions lack robustness: they often exhibit unignorable negative density and their approximation quality can be extremely poor. This limits applications of <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> in existing studies. In this thesis, we firstly develop techniques to provide robustness, with which <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> result in a practical approximation quality in a wider range of examples than investigated to date. Specifically, we investigate three techniques: standardisation, use of Laguerre expansion and optimisation. Standardisation applies <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> to a variable which is transformed so that its first and second moments are the same as those of the weight function. Use of Laguerre expansions applies those expansions to a risk factor so that heavy tails can be captured better. Optimisation considers expansions with coefficients of polynomials optimised so that the difference between the approximation and the target distribution is minimised with respect to mean integrated squared error. We show, by numerical examples using data sets of stock index returns and log differences of implied volatility, and GARCH models, that expansions with our techniques are more robust than conventional <b>expansion</b> <b>methods.</b> As such, marginal distributions of risk factors can be approximated by <b>expansion</b> <b>methods.</b> This solves a part of the description problem: the information on the marginal distributions of risk factors can be summarised by their moments. Then we show that the dependence structure among risk factors can be summarised in terms of their cross-moments. This solves the other part of the description problem. We also use the fact that moments of risk factors can be aggregated using their moments and cross-moments, to show that <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> can be applied to both the time and risk aggregation problems. Furthermore, we introduce <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> for multivariate distributions, which can also be used to approximate conditional expectations and copula densities by rational functions...|$|R

Stochastic <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> are {{an alternative approach}} for performing SA and UQ, and usually require fewer function evaluations. Recent work has extended non-intrusive stochastic <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> for calculating sensitivity indices. We examine the application of these techniques to {{a case in which}} data are generated from coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations. The values we analyze are generated from the numerical solution of the PDEs, in which we systematically vary both (i) fundamental modeling parameters and (ii) the underlying numerical algorithms.

5000|$|The HAM distinguishes {{itself from}} various other {{analytical}} methods in four important aspects. First, it {{is a series}} <b>expansion</b> <b>method</b> that is not directly dependent on small or large physical parameters. Thus, it is applicable for not only weakly but also strongly nonlinear problems, going beyond some of the inherent limitations of the standard perturbation methods. Second, the HAM is a unified method for the Lyapunov artificial small parameter method, the delta <b>expansion</b> <b>method,</b> the Adomian decomposition method, and the homotopy perturbation method. [...] The greater generality of the method often allows for strong convergence of the solution over larger spatial and parameter domains. Third, the HAM gives excellent flexibility in {{the expression of the}} solution and how the solution is explicitly obtained. It provides great freedom to choose the basis functions of the desired solution and the corresponding auxiliary linear operator of the homotopy. Finally, unlike the other analytic approximation techniques, the HAM provides a simple way to ensure the convergence of the solution series.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} results from a level 3 milestone study within the CASL VUQ effort. It demonstrates the application of 'advanced UQ,' in particular dimension-adaptive p-refinement for polynomial chaos and stochastic collocation. The study calculates statistics for several quantities of interest that are indicators {{for the formation of}} CRUD (Chalk River unidentified deposit), which can lead to CIPS (CRUD induced power shift). Stochastic <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> are attractive methods for uncertainty quantification due to their fast convergence properties. For smooth functions (i. e., analytic, infinitely-differentiable) in L{sup 2 } (i. e., possessing finite variance), exponential convergence rates can be obtained under order refinement for integrated statistical quantities of interest such as mean, variance, and probability. Two stochastic <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> are of interest: nonintrusive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), which computes coefficients for a known basis of multivariate orthogonal polynomials, and stochastic collocation (SC), which forms multivariate interpolation polynomials for known coefficients. Within the DAKOTA project, recent research in stochastic <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> has focused on automated polynomial order refinement ('p-refinement') of expansions to support scalability to higher dimensional random input spaces [4, 3]. By preferentially refining only in the most important dimensions of the input space, the applicability of these methods can be extended from O(10 {sup 0 }) -O(10 {sup 1 }) random variables to O(10 {sup 2 }) and beyond, depending on the degree of anisotropy (i. e., the extent to which randominput variables have differing degrees of influence on the statistical quantities of interest (QOIs)). Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate the application of these adaptive stochastic <b>expansion</b> <b>methods</b> to the analysis of CRUD using the VIPRE simulation tools for two different plant models of differing random dimension, anisotropy, and smoothness...|$|R
