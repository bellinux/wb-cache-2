500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{personalized}} {{the film}} with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, {{one of the}} original banjo players from Deliverance (1972). Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> so happy to see him and I think other people will feel the same way." [...] Original Big Fish author Daniel Wallace makes a brief appearance as Sandra's economics teacher in the [...] "Courtship of Sandra Templeton" [...] scene.|$|E
500|$|Once all {{outstanding}} CSM-012 hardware {{problems were}} fixed, the reassembled spacecraft finally completed a successful altitude chamber test with Schirra's backup crew on December 30. According {{to the final}} report of the accident investigation board, [...] "At the post-test debriefing the backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with the condition and performance of the spacecraft." [...] This would appear to contradict the account given in Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by Jeffrey Kluger and astronaut James Lovell, that [...] "When the trio {{climbed out of the}} ship, … Schirra {{made it clear that he}} was not pleased with what he had seen," [...] and that he later warned Grissom and Shea that [...] "there's nothing wrong with this ship that I can point to, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> uncomfortable. Something about it just doesn't ring right," [...] and that Grissom should get out at the first sign of trouble.|$|E
5000|$|After he {{was sworn}} in as Treasurer in mid-April, Coggs {{announced}} {{that he would not be}} resigning his position as Senator until a new Senator could be elected. [...] "With us in the state Senate tied 16-16, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> sense for <b>me</b> to keep my position. If I were to leave, I'm not saying my Republican friends would cause mischief, but I don't want to give them any temptation," [...] he stated. He said that he would donate his second salary to an as-yet-unnamed charity. Two incumbent Assembly Democrats, his cousin Elizabeth Coggs and Sandy Pasch, had already announced that they would be running for the vacant seat (although Pasch later changed her mind). In the end, he was succeeded in the Senate by another Democrat, Nikiya Harris.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009 {{she made}} a cover of Amy Winehouse' [...] "Blonde Trick" [...] and, after a friend posted the song into MySpace, the {{production}} team The Cataracs noticed it and contacted Dev. To Fashion Indie Magazine she said: [...] "I decided to put up this song on MySpace. [...] it was basically a [...] "diss track" [...] and I didn't expect anything out of <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> was <b>just</b> to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> feel good like how music usually do but Niles [...] came across to my page and was really into my voice {{and they kind of}} got me into singing and opened up my eyes to business opportunities". She dropped out of college in her first year to pursue her singing career and was then signed by the Los Angeles-based record label and management team, Indie-Pop, who also discovered The Cataracs. Six months later, Dev and The Cataracs' song [...] "2Nite" [...] began to gain exposure on the radio, the television channel MtvU and the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart. In 2009, Dev moved to Los Angeles to produce music with the Cataracs and work directly with Indie-Pop.|$|R
5000|$|I don't {{see how a}} guy {{looking at}} a naked girl in a {{magazine}} is degrading to women. Everyone has their sexuality. It's how you treat people in everyday life that counts, not what turns you on in your fantasy. If all a person ever did was get off on porno movies I would say they are probably dysfunctional sexually, but I don't think it's unhealthy {{to be interested in}} that or get off on that. I'm not interested in porno movies because everybody is ugly and faking <b>it</b> and <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> silly. They <b>make</b> <b>me</b> laugh, they don't turn me on. A movie like In the Realm of the Senses turns me on because it's real. I've been told there are some good Traci Lords movies but I've never seen them. I wouldn't want to watch a snuff movie. I wouldn't want to watch anyone get really hurt, male or female. But generally I don't think pornography degrades women. The women who are doing it want to do it. No one is holding a gun to their head. I don't get that whole thing. I love looking at Playboy magazine because women look great naked.|$|R
500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the song, {{as well as the}} album, was positive. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "fairly peppy for a PJ Harvey song about murder" [...] and rated it three stars out of five. In Pitchfork Media's review of Let England Shake, Scott Plagenhoef stated that [...] "Harvey blackly and comically shakes her head at those post-WWI diplomatic hopes" [...] and described it as [...] "a hilariously depressing coda; her song's character has experienced the unimaginable and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help." [...] Plagenhoef also cited it as the album's key song, alongside [...] "Written on the Forehead." [...] The Guardian described the song as [...] "a masterstroke" [...] and stated [...] "Harvey clearly understands that the horror doesn't really need embellishing: her way sounds infinitely more shocking and affecting than all the machine-gun sound effects in the world." [...] Patti Smith, to whom Harvey has been compared in the past by critics, hailed the single. Speaking to The Guardian in January 2011, Smith said: [...] "It just makes me happy to exist. Whenever anyone does something of worth, including myself, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> happy to be alive. So I listened to that song all morning, totally happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|G-Unit member Tony Yayo has {{alleged that}} Ghostface had a ghostwriter for his {{critically}} acclaimed album Supreme Clientele. In {{an interview with}} Spin magazine, Yayo claimed that Far Rockaway native Lord Superb, who guested on the album, wrote a majority, if not all, of the lyrics. In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album, responded saying: [...] "He [...] know damn well he [...] ain’t write that fuckin’ album. I don’t even wanna get into shit like that, because <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> upset that muthafuckas be running they mouth all kinda ways. But {{at the end of}} the day, I think Ghost gonna have to really say what he gotta say." [...] However, in a November 2007 interview with Rhapsody Music, Ghost responded with [...] "...'Perb [...] is Rae’s [...] man. He been in the studio a few times while we’re doing shit. He ain’t write shit. All ‘Perb contributed was a couple of lines that you could put in the air. When we write, we all do that.
