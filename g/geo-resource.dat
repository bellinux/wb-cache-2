40|$|The use of {{volcanic}} rocks by Neanderthals is frequently {{considered to be}} opportunistic, especially when good-quality stones were rare in the site neighbourhood. An analysis of the lithic series made {{of volcanic}} rocks discovered in the Middle Palaeolithic sites of Payre and Sainte-Anne I, located in the south part and at the southeastern margin of the Massif Central of France and dated back to MIS 7 up {{until the end of}} MIS 5, illustrates the capacity of Neanderthals to manage these raw materials and enables us to compare the strategies used in two different mineral environments. Shaping and flaking reduction sequences coexist in both sites in varying proportions, depending on the available rocks in the surroundings. At Payre, artefacts made of volcanic rocks are rarer in surroundings rich in flint while at Sainte-Anne I, the different series comprise a large quantity of artefacts made of different basalts and trachy-phonolites in an environment relatively poor in flint. Most of the reduction processes took place in situ. Activities outside the sites only appear to have concerned the shaping of some heavy-duty tools and some large flakes. It is likely that volcanic rocks were considered by Neanderthals as a <b>geo-resource,</b> either major or lesser in importance, to provide large flakes and both heavy-duty and light-duty tools, besides flint quartz and other rocks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Over {{the last}} decades, experts have been {{studying}} with growing concern statistics and demographic trends that show in many cities the urban population appears to be climbing up to astonishing numbers all over the world. Mega-Cities like Tokyo, Mexico City and Seoul are developing and nobody appears {{to be able to}} control their growth, nor to handle their impact on basic resources like water and land. The housing demand of an aging society further stimulates excessive urban sprawl. On the other hand, according to recent studies many cities expose a tendency of shrinking, from California to Japan, from Finland to the Cape of Good Hope. Shrinking cities are reported {{from all over the world}} and again it appears difficult to deal with this recent phenomenon and its impacts on our society. In times of global markets and local bottlenecks, cities change constantly and rapidly, much faster than they used to do even in the boom-days of industrialisation. Changing cities have a strong impact on both, economy and ecology. The metamorphosis of urban spaces usually degrades the environment and exhausts the resources. However, changing cities also offer chances, not only to architects and investors but also to new forms of land and resource management. In this paper the issue of growing cities and shrinking cities will be discussed. Special attention will be given to the geotechnical challenges of contracting cities. Examples from regions characterized by post-industrialization and post-socialism are presented and strategies to stimulate a sustainable urban renaissance that respects <b>geo-resource...</b>|$|E
40|$|Shale gas is an {{unconventional}} <b>geo-resource,</b> which {{had lots of}} attention in the last decade. This is mostly negative attention {{about the dangers of}} the chemicals in industrial fracking fluid {{and its impact on the}} environment. The methane emissions into the atmosphere are also a large concern when producing shale gas, as it is much higher than those of conventional resources. The challenge of today is to combine the continued use of fossil fuels, while simultaneously also reducing the associated CO 2 emissions. In this study four different type of samples were put under the microscope (using the tabletop-SEM and FIB-SEM). These four samples were all Gothic shales: unreacted Gothic shale; Gothic shale reacted with industrial fracking fluid; Gothic shale reacted with CO 2 -fluid; and Gothic shale reacted with brine. The samples investigated in this study were already produced and provided by the group of Dr. Kaszuba at the University of Wyoming who are currently conducting experiments on samples from a US based shale gas site. The aim was to observe the changes in porosity and mineralogy of each sample at the nanoscale and to find out if CO 2 -fluid would be a suitable substitute for industrial fracking fluid, while at the same time also reducing the CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere. The unreacted Gothic shale and brine reacted sample showed the least amount of pores. The Gothic shale reacted with CO 2 -fluid had larger pores in comparison to the Gothic shale reacted with fracking fluid. This was evident in the larger amount and size of cracks found in the CO 2 -fluid samples, but also in a larger increase in pore surface area compared to the fracking fluid samples. At a magnification of 600 x the CO 2 -fluid contained a total pore surface area of 1581. 4 μm 2, in comparison with 1252 μm 2 of the fracking fluid sample (see table 2). The total pore surface area of three different magnifications added up shows that the CO 2 -fluid has a total pore surface area of 3831. 35 μm 2, compared to a total pore surface of 3722. 71 μm 2. This study demonstrates that CO 2 -fluid could therefore be suitable as fracking fluid at the nanoscale, as it generates an increase in porosity in the Gothic shale rock, while at the same time it is a more environment-friendly way of producing shale gas as it reduces CO 2 -emissions. The reduction of CO 2 -emissions can take place in two different ways by injecting CO 2 -fluid into a shale gas site. The CO 2 can either react with the shale, forming carbonates, or it reacts with the clays present in the shale, causing the clays to swell. The carbonates are formed when the CO 2 -molecules dissociates into different components and reacts with the host rock. The swelling of clays due to CO 2 -fluid causes the shale to increase its sealing capacity, resulting in no leakage to the Earth’s surface. Both ways of CO 2 -reduction due to injection into the subsurface, causes CO 2 to remain in the ground. Unfortunately each shale is different in mineralogy and content, resulting in different reactions with the fluid used. This means that while CO 2 -fluid reacts well with the Gothic shale used in this study, it could react differently with another type of shale, clogging up the pores and resulting in a decrease in porosity. The difference in clay content forms the biggest problem for the clogging of the pores, as clays can be non-swelling or swelling clays (forming an increase or decrease in porosity, respectively). Therefore each shale must be investigated separately, before introducing CO 2 -fluid as a new and more environmental-friendly fracking fluid...|$|E

40|$|Although {{sustainability}} {{is a term}} {{frequently used}} in debates {{on the future of}} society and its needs (e. g. Agenda 21), many questions seemed to be open with respect to a sustainable management of the Ebro Basin in the surrounding of Zaragoza. This city of about 700. 000 inhabitants is located in {{the central part of the}} Ebro Basin. This is a highly dynamic economic axis and densely populated area within the Iberian Peninsula. In this sector, the Tertiary playa-lake deposits of Oligocene to Miocene age are only covered, in some areas, by pediments and terraces of the Ebro River and its tributaries. In the periphery of Zaragoza, the interactions with the geosphere have been largely ignored due to the fast economic and urban development of this city. This resulted among others in the destruction of many infrastructures caused by land subsidence, a loss of valuable agricultural land and valuable natural areas and an increasing aquifer contamination. At present, to ensure that land-use decisions imply a high degree of sustainability, it must be taken care of <b>geo-resources</b> and geo-hazards. Therefore, they were regionalised using Geographical Information Systems. In a first step, all available geoscientific data was collected, analysed and prepared for its introduction into a Geographical Information System in order to be mapped (geology, geomorphology, soils, climate, vegetation, land-use, natural protected areas). Afterwards, geo-hazards (erosion, dolines susceptibility and groundwater vulnerability) and <b>geo-resources</b> (sand and gravel deposits, agricultural capability of soils) were detected, described and modelled with the help of Geographical Information System and 3 D techniques. The selection of the land evaluation methodologies for geo-hazards and <b>geo-resources</b> modelling was made considering the availability and quality of information for their development, their suitability to the study area and the final objective of the models. The third step aims to develop a GIS-based risk-assessment and decision methodology for sustainable land and resource use decisions (as the title of the project promoted by the German Research Foundation). Here the maps stored in the GIS were combined with multi-criteria evaluation methodologies in order to develop different land-use suitability maps (sand and gravel extraction sites, irrigated land, industrial and urban use). After assigning priorities to individual land uses in case of competing land use interests, areas that are suitable, minor suitable or unsuitable for a special type of land use can be identified. Special attention within this process was put on the groundwater protection and the dolines susceptibility. Moreover the availability of raw materials as sand and gravel was examined. Here the development of a three-dimensional geological model proved to be especially helpful. The regionalisation of the described geo-potentials, their translation into thematic maps and their prioritising using multi-criteria evaluation methods are thereby an important step to a sustainable development, also in the sense of the Agenda 21...|$|R

Six surface crack displacement sensors (ch 1 –ch 6) were installed on surface of natural rock slope. Displacements were mainly due to thermal strains and only ch 1 gave a steep opening of fracture. Numerically, the behaviour of rock slope with a one-meter deep fracture under temperature variation was analysed using a (5 m × 5 m) two-dimensional plane strained, confined and unconfined models using elastic and elasto-plastic finite element analysis. Generally, in elastic and elasto-plastic conditions, fracture closed with temperature raising and vice-versa. Expansion of rock mass due to freezing at sub-zero temperatures was observed. Large tensile stresses appear at the fracture tip when temperature lowered, thus generating tensile failure and a small increase in fracture opening under elasto-plastic conditions in confined cases only. 3 rd International Workshop and Conference on Earth Resources Technology "Stepping towards sustainable <b>geo-resources</b> utilization and development". 13 - 14 May 2009.

When dealing with the behaviour of multiphase porous systems, e. g. geomaterials, instances of complexity and interaction are numerous, {{mainly because of the}} coexistence of several constituents and phases, their physical and mechanical interactions, their reactivity and their often non-linear behaviour.

Although the emphasis is on geoconservation, due to the predominantly karstic characteristics of the studied landscape, the process explains a course of action for the inventory, assessment and diagnosis of geological and geomorphological information for land use planning and management, including geotourism provision. The preparation of the regulations which derived from that information flow is also explained. The inventory included the classification, mapping and description of landforms.

40|$|Abstract <b>Geo-resources</b> play an {{increasing}} {{significant role in}} achieving a sustainable energy future. However, their exploitation is not free of environmental impacts. This paper aims to identify the lessons and knowledge gaps on understanding of the sources, mechanisms and scope of environmental consequences of underground geo-energy resources exploitation. The paper examines four underground exploitation activities: CO 2 geological storage, exploitation of shale gas, geothermal power and {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES). Selected studies carrying out life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental risk assessment (ERA) are structurally reviewed by applying a six steps method. Our finding indicates that global warming potential is the major focus of examined LCA studies with relatively less attention on other impacts. Environmental impacts at the local level are less evaluated except water use for shale gas and geothermal power. Environmental impacts of exploitation with storage purposes are relatively low. For energy supply associated exploitation, the impacts largely depend on the types of underground activities and the exploited energy carriers. In the ERA studies, likelihood of a hazard occurrence is the focus of the probability assessment. There is limited information on the pathways and transport of hazard agents in the subsurface and on the relation between hazard exposure and the impacts. The leakage of the storing agents is the well-identified hazard for storage associated exploitation, while the migration of fluids and exploited energy carriers are the ones for exploitation with energy supply purposes. In general, understanding of environmental risks of soil contamination are limited. Very few number of ERA studies are available for assessing a CAES. Our research points out the need for developing a framework which allows the integration between LCA and ERA in subsurface environmental management...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{analysis}} of multi-field problems in {{porous and fractured}} media is an important subject for various geotechnical engineering tasks such as the management of <b>geo-resources</b> (e. g. engineering of geothermal, oil and gas reservoirs) as well as waste management. For practical usage, e. g. for geothermal, simulation tools are required which take into account both coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes and the uncertainty of geological data, i. e. the model parametrization. For modeling fractured rocks, equivalent porous medium or multiple continuum model approaches are often only the way currently due to difficulty to handle geomechanical discontinuities. However, they are not applicable for prediction of flow and transport in subsurface systems where a few fractures dominates the system behavior. Thus modeling coupled problems in discretely fractured porous media is desirable for more precise analysis. The subject of this work is developing a framework of the finite element method (FEM) for modeling coupled THM problems in discretely fractured and non-fractured porous media including thermal water flow, advective-diffusive heat transport, and thermoporoelasticity. Pre-existing fractures are considered. Systems of discretely fractured porous media {{can be considered as}} a problem of interacted multiple domains, i. e. porous medium domain and discrete fracture domain, for hydraulic and transport processes, and a discontinuous problem for mechanical processes. The FEM is required to take into account both kinds of the problems. In addition, this work includes developing a methodology for the data uncertainty using the FEM model and investigating the uncertainty impacts on evaluating coupled THM processes. All the necessary code developments in this work has been carried out with a scientific open source project OpenGeoSys (OGS). In this work, fluid flow and heat transport problems in interactive multiple domains are solved assuming continuity of filed variables (pressure and temperature) over the two domains. The assumption is reasonable if there are no infill materials in fractures. The method has been successfully applied for several numerical examples, e. g. modeling three-dimensional coupled flow and heat transport processes in discretely fractured porous media at the Gross Schoenebck geothermal site (Germany), and three-dimensional coupled THM processes in porous media at the Urach Spa geothermal site (Germany). To solve the mechanically discontinuous problems, lower-dimensional interface elements (LIEs) with local enrichments have been developed for coupled problems in a domain including pre-existing fractures. The method permits the possibility of using existing flow simulators and having an identical mesh for both processes. It enables us to formulate the coupled problems in monolithic scheme for robust computation. Moreover, it gives an advantage in practice that one can use existing standard FEM codes for groundwater flow and easily make a coupling computation between mechanical and hydraulic processes. Example of a 2 D fluid injection problem into a single fracture demonstrated that the proposed method can produce results in strong agreement with semi-analytical solutions. An uncertainty {{analysis of}} THM coupled processes has been studied for a typical geothermal reservoir in crystalline rock based on the Monte-Carlo method. Fracture and matrix are treated conceptually as an equivalent porous medium, and the model is applied to available data from the Urach Spa and Falkenberg sites (Germany). Reservoir parameters are considered as spatially random variables and their realizations are generated using conditional Gaussian simulation. Two reservoir modes (undisturbed and stimulated) are considered to construct a stochastic model for permeability distribution. We found that the most significant factors in the analysis are permeability and heat capacity. The study demonstrates the importance of taking parameter uncertainties into account for geothermal reservoir evaluation in order to assess the viability of numerical modeling...|$|R

Fault zones have a complex internal structure, suggesting mechanical behaviour that spans {{a wide range of}} spatio-temporal scales: from gouge particle size distribution to outcrop scale roughness to large scale fault segmentation, and from rapid dynamic rupture events to the tectonic loading time scale. The structure of fault zones is constantly evolving with time and accumulated slip. Damage processes, such as fragmentation of host rock, intense cataclasis of fault gouge in preferred localized zones and asperity deformation, compete with time dependent healing processes that recover mechanical properties, and tectonic loading dynamics that ultimately drive the system. The presence of fluid in some faults can also play a role on their mechanics and the evolution of their structure, on heat and mass transport, and on healing processes. The interplay of these complex components and their evolution at all scales represent the basic ingredients of fault mechanics. This session will focus on the mechanics and structural expression of processes operating in active fault zones including: effects of fluids and/or of heat transport and heat generation, morphology of asperities, role of developing damage, dynamics of granular gouges, field observations of seismic slip criteria in outcrops or in boreholes. Contributions on the scaling laws describing gouge particle size, fault morphology or slip distribution and processes of strain localization are also welcome. We invite contributions from field geologists, laboratory experimentalists, computer modelers and theoreticians. TS 2. 2 Deformation mechanisms, microstructures, and frictional properties of upper-crustal fault zones Tectonic faults in the brittle part of the Earth’s lithosphere are typically complex zones of fracturing and fluid-rock interactions. Fault zone {{structure and}} evolution are closely linked to fault slip behavior and permeability throughout the seismic cycle, including the nucleation, propagation and arrest of earthquake ruptures. Of particular importance are the frictional properties of constituent fault rock materials and the effects of thermally- and chemically-activated processes on the evolution of frictional strength, both on short (dynamic) and long (static) timescales. We welcome field, microstructural, and laboratory contributions addressing the relationships between deformation mechanisms, friction, and the rheology and structure of fault zones in the upper crust. Key topics to be addressed include: • Linking fault zone microstructure to fault zone mechanics • Interactions between mechanical and chemical processes in the evolution of friction and permeability • The importance of fault rock fabrics and fault rock distribution • Dynamic and static fault weakening mechanisms TS 2. 3 Fault zone properties and growth mechanisms in the upper crust: insights from field, laboratory and modelling studies Understanding of fault zone properties in different geological contexts is important from a scientific point of view, to better assess the processes of fault nucleation and subsequent fault development, {{as well as for the}} exploration and management of fluid-related <b>geo-resources.</b> Over a wide range of scales, geologists employ several methodologies to assess the geometry, kinematics, mechanics and spatial properties of fault zones. Large-scale deformation is typically assessed by the interpretation of subsurface geophysical data, whereas at an outcrop-scale it is studied directly in the field or, alternatively, from well cores and/or well logs. Thin-section scale deformation, on the contrary, is analyzed by optical microscopy, SEM and microprobe investigation of key microstructures. In the laboratory, experimental studies are conducted on natural and/or artificial samples to quantify both petrophysical and mechanical fault zone properties. The results of these studies are often integrated to assess the fault architecture and, hence, the control exerted by fault zones on subsurface fluid flow. On this regard, a great contribution has been provided by analogue and numerical modelling in layered and massive media. All these aspects require a good understanding of the specific factors controlling the faulting processes (i. e. pressure-temperature conditions, fluid content, etc.) and, possibly, of the structural complexities and heterogeneities present within individual fault zones (i. e. inherited structural features, linkage processes, etc.). To address the aforementioned topics, this session aims to discuss the (1) short- and long-term processes related, at all scales, to the initiation and growth of individual faults and fault systems, and (2) the impact of these processes on porosity, permeability and overall transmissibility of fault zones. We encourage contributions from various disciplines in order to fuel the integration of field, laboratory and modelling studies to address the multi-scale relationships among deformation mechanisms, fault architecture and fault hydraulic properties.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{southern}} French Massif Central {{and on its}} southeastern border but at different altitudes, open-air sites, rock-shelters and caves have yielded artefacts ranging from isolated finds to abundant series that date from MIS 9 to at least MIS 3, representing Lower Palaeolithic (sensu Acheulean bifacial production) and diverse Middle Palaeolithic facies. From the upstream part of the gorges of the Allier and Loire Rivers to the Chassezac and Ardèche Rivers surveys, excavations and detailed analyses of the material from these sites offer data on subsistence behaviours including among others raw material acquisition, lithic reduction sequences, hunted species and carcass treatment. This information has been gathered during a Collective Research Program (PCR Espaces et subsistance au Paléolithique moyen dans le sud du Massif central) and enables discussion of the mobility of human groups, {{the size of the}} territory they occupied, duration of site occupation, landscape cognition and resource exploitation and allows some speculation about the way these humans perceived the landscape in which they lived and how these ethnographic perceptions may have changed over time. In this paper, we focus on results obtained from stratified sites dated from MIS 9 until MIS 4. Orgnac 3, Payre and Barasses II sites, Abri du Maras and Abri des Pêcheurs are caves and shelters located on low plateaus on the right bank of the Rhône corridor while the cave of Sainte-Anne I and Baume-Vallée rock-shelter are located in the mid-mountains of the Velay. The lithic repertoires found in Payre, Saint-Anne I, Baume-Vallée, Abri du Maras, Abri des Pécheurs and Barasses II suggest that the stone knapping and retouching activities that took place in them were directed towards achieving different objectives at each of them. In the several human occupation phases at Payre, the main core technology closely parallels the discoid type that provides unstandardized flakes. A lack of hafted points and the importation into the site of large flakes made from various local stone types along with introduced flint flakes and nodules are related to the seasonal occupation of the site due to its location. The flint reduction sequences are quite complete but those on local stones are often partial, indicating mobility of the occupants and off-site manufacture of lithic tools. Lithic raw material imported into Sainte-Anne I originates from more than thirty different primary localities close to the site as well as from secondary and sub-primary colluvial and alluvial outcrops. The Neanderthals who used this cave obviously had an excellent knowledge of the occurrence and potential of local resources. The presence of some specific flint types suggests the use of exploitation or trade routes which crossed the borders of fluvial systems. If the duration of occupation events can be judged from the presence {{of a large number of}} artefacts produced on local volcanic rocks, quartz and types of flint, the absence of certain items like large-sized and retouched flakes from the reduction sequences, indicates that these products were used away from the site or removed when the occupants moved on through their territories. In the upper layers of Abri du Maras, the presence of flakes and pointed artefacts as well as the kind of retouch on them suggests that special equipment was being manufactured, possibly involved with hunting and butchering reindeer and horses during long-term residential occupation. Most of the Levallois lithic processing systems are complete but, judging from the size of the core-flakes, large un-retouched blades were being imported into the site suggesting that other tasks may have been undertaken there using these transported artefacts. At Abri des Pêcheurs, irregular and thick broken flakes of quartz and small flakes of flint suggest an expedient lithic technology. This assemblage was probably the result of brief human occupation events in the shelter during which they processed some parts of a few cervids and ibex. The chaîne opératoire is complete for quartz but incomplete for the flint assemblage which contains a higher ratio of tools to unmodified lithics. At Baume-Vallée, a range of flakes was produced by a variety of knapping techniques. Using different techniques to obtain different types of tool blanks from the same core was presumably a strategy of exploitation designed to conserve a precious resource that was available mainly as small pebbles. This assemblage indicates that multiple tasks were conducted simultaneously at a seasonal horse and cervid hunting camp. Microwear analysis shows that the stone artefacts were used to work soft or semi-hard materials, probably wood. The “Charentian” aspect of the assemblage is a reflection of intense edge reduction and appears identical to that identified at the Abri du Maras. Overall, faunal remains indicate that a diverse range of landscapes was exploited during its procurement. Also, the territorial perspective provided by the widely disparate sources of lithic raw materials indicates that the groups inhabiting the sites were mobile and undertook multidirectional and more or less long-distance forays into the surrounding landscapes. Despite the complexity of territorial exploitation strategies suggested by the importation of varied and remote resources into these three sites, at present these subsistence activities provide no evidence for the existence of planning strategies comparable to those observed elsewhere. Nor can we confirm a strictly bipolarized (summer-winter / highlands-lowlands) circulatory subsistence pattern. However, there are suggestions of exploitation routes that proceeded back and forth along the course of the Allier and more certainly along the Loire for Charentian groups. The locations of the more remote <b>geo-resources</b> indicate the existence of a widespread exploitation pattern radiating outwards from semi-residential camps. The dispersed locations visited or exploited by the groups of hunter-gatherers transiently occupying other camps that were brief stopping places also supports this patterning. Additionally, remote or semi-remote lithic outcrops may mark some territorial limit or perhaps they may be places where adjoining groups could meet for some unknown purpose or, such locations may even be the source of particular raw materials needed for special occasions if not for unique tasks. In the same vein, lithic artefacts abandoned in the landscape that are often categorized by archaeologists as isolates may just as easily have been left intentionally as markers for others to discover. Although a resource territory may well differ from a social territory, petro-archaeology may be able to contribute new methods through which to decipher more of the Neanderthals’ cognitive sphere. Among the exploitative itineraries we have identified are: collection of lithic resources; transportation of these lithic resources; their abandonment; seasonal hunting of selected target species; collection of other permanently available or seasonally abundant resources; processing these and other resources at a variety of stopping places and camps; the possibility of single gender as well as mixed-gender groups undertaking specific tasks; confirmation that, from MIS 9 until MIS 3, Neanderthals were not simply reacting to landscape characteristics, they were interacting with landscape features (geosymbols) and responding to environmental and bio-resource changes in a deterministic manner. These kinds of responses to landscapes and resource occurrence are very close to modern hunter-gatherer behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Bricks are {{traditional}} building materials with ancient origin, {{but that can}} respond to the important challenges the industrial research is currently called to face, i. e. in reducing energy consumption, in lowering production costs and in improving physical properties and durability of the finished products. The growing demand for a sustainable production addressed research to obtain new materials designed to meet environmental issues and society welfare. A possible way to achieve these goals and satisfy these different aspects is the optimisation of new mix design, re-using waste materials produced from industrial, urban and excavation activities. The fulfilment of a sustainable production is twofold, determining {{a reduction in the}} exploitation of new <b>geo-resources,</b> and mitigating the problem of waste accumulation and management, reassessing residual materials as secondary sources for a new environmental-friendly material production. Although numerous studies have been carried out in the last decades addressing waste reuse as a successful alternative resource in the production of bricks, their implementation in the industrial sector is still very limited. The main reasons are: i) sporadic partnership between academic research and industry in this technological area; ii) lack of specific standards for the evaluation of processes and finished products; and iii) limited public education on the possible sustainable frontiers. Another important issue should be considered in the production of new materials: the maintenance of the aesthetic quality when substituting traditional materials. Bricks are building materials, and innovation should respect parameters such as the "cultural compatibility", understood as the recognition of the territorial identity of a community. This aspect has even of greater relevance when bricks are used as integration or replacement materials in the restoration of damaged historical buildings. This work aims at filling the gap between academic research and industrial development, through a close collaboration between university and industry and the achievement of common objectives. This was possible with the support of a leader company in the production of traditional bricks, SanMarco-Terreal srl (Noale, Italy), which contributed offering technical support, raw materials and consolidate experience in the production of traditional bricks. New mix designs have been developed according to the objectives of Horizon 2020, ([URL] particularly in the field of sustainable use of natural resources, optimization of firing conditions, recycling and gas emission control, in order to satisfy the goals related to the scientific excellence, the societal challenges and the industry leadership. Therefore, the study focused on: 1) the relationship between chemical-mineralogical characteristics and mechanical properties and durability under different stress conditions of bricks already on the market, obtained by different clays and fired at different temperatures (600, 950, 980, 1050 °C); 2) the characterisation of the pore system in commercial bricks using a multi-analytical approach, in order to fully understand and describe porosity through a parameterization of the morphological characteristics of pores. This study was also addressed to the optimization of the pore system in fired bricks obtained from different raw materials and fired at different temperatures (600, 950, 1050 °C), providing hints for the optimisation of production strategies that can affect the pore system and the brick quality; 3) the study of new mix designs obtained by adding waste material from quarrying activities and industrial sludge for the production of new bricks based on the concepts of reuse and sustainable use of natural resources. The type of waste specifically adopted were: i) trachyte fragments from quarrying activity (Euganean Hills, Italy); ii) sludge resulting from the ceramic industry. The study of the commercial bricks showed that the chemical-mineralogical and physical-mechanical properties, the porosity and the durability of the finished products are highly dependent on the raw material composition and the firing temperatures reached during the production process. The results obtained for the new experimental products demonstrated the real possibility to achieve new bricks reusing waste, maintaining the physical, mechanical and aesthetic features of the traditional materials and improving the quality of the finished product. More in detail, commercial bricks fired at temperature of 1050 °C showed considerable mineralogical transformations, with the growth of new phases and a higher vitrification process in the matrix, which determined improvement of the mechanical properties. On the contrary, brick fired at 600 °C had good water behaviour, but resulted weaker during accelerated ageing tests. This behaviour is due to the low compactness determined by the absence of vitrification in the matrix and the low rate of new phase crystallisation. Moreover, it was observed how hausmannite (Mn 3 O 4) used as a dye, caused changes not only in the aesthetic aspect of the finished product determining a dark grey colour, but also in its mechanical properties and in the porous system, since it promotes the melting process. The detailed study of the porosity allowed knowing the pore system in each of the samples and assessing the influence of the raw materials and firing temperature {{on the development of the}} pore system. Bricks produced with carbonate clay showed higher porosity and pore interconnection due to the decomposition of the carbonate during the firing process. Moreover, in the bricks fired at higher temperatures (1050 °C) changes in the morphology of pores occurred, which became larger and rounder due to the release of volatiles. On the contrary, in bricks obtained from the least carbonate clay and fired at 600 °C, porosity displayed very different features, with less homogeneous and smaller pores. In the study on the influence of the waste materials used in the production of new bricks, two different cases were considered: i) addition of stone waste from trachyte quarrying activity; ii) addition of ceramic sludge. These materials were added as temper; influence on the physical-mechanical properties and durability were investigated. Results were satisfactory, recognising their potentiality as possible sustainable additives in the brick industry. It was observed that the alkali feldspars in trachyte act as fluxing agents and decrease the melting point. This effect was emphasized with different observations: textural and mineralogical analyses showed a considerable increase of the number of bridges among minerals and a wider recrystallization of the matrix, sonic data an overall increase in compactness, porometry a different evolution of the pores system upon firing. These changes developed not only at increasing temperature, but also at increasing trachyte content. Furthermore, the analysis of the thermal properties, carried out on infrared images showed that the increasing content of trachyte reduces heat transmittance. Only in one case (a brick with 15...|$|R
