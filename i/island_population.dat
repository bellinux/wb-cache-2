5|$|On 3 January 1942, Japanese forces {{captured}} Labuan unopposed {{during the}} Battle of Borneo. The Japanese developed two airfields (Labuan and Timbalai) on the island, which were built by labourers {{who had been}} conscripted from the Lawas and Terusan regions of mainland Borneo. The <b>island</b> <b>population</b> was also subjected to harsh occupation policies. After Japanese forces suppressed a revolt at the town of Jesselton in late 1943, which was led by Chinese-ethnic civilians, 131 of the rebels were held on Labuan. Only nine rebels survived to be liberated by Australian forces in 1944. Until mid-1944, few Japanese combat units were stationed in Borneo.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Weksler {{and colleagues}} {{followed}} the 2001 definition by Sánchez {{and others for}} the restricted genus Oryzomys, but added O.antillarum from Jamaica as a species. Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed Oryzomys from western Mexico in 2009 and in this context provided an extended diagnosis of Oryzomys. They recognized eight species: the six previously mentioned plus O.albiventer and O.peninsulae. Also in 2009, Robert Voss and Weksler identified the subfossil Oryzomys curasoae from Curaçao as an <b>island</b> <b>population</b> of O.gorgasi. The next year, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study using DNA sequence data from the cytochrome b, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 genes to assess relationships within Oryzomys.

5|$|Two {{different}} Dromaius {{species were}} present in Australia {{at the time of}} European settlement, and one additional species is known from fossil remains. The insular dwarf emus, D. baudinianus and D. n. minor, originally present on Kangaroo Island and King Island respectively, both became extinct shortly after the arrival of Europeans. D. n. diemenensis, a subspecies known as the Tasmanian emu, became extinct around 1865. However, the mainland sub-species, D. n. novaehollandiae, remains common. The population of these birds varies from decade to decade, largely being dependent on rainfall; in 2009, it was estimated that there were between 630,000 and 725,000 birds. Emus were introduced to Maria Island off Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, during the 20th century. While the Maria <b>Island</b> <b>population</b> died out in the mid-1990s, more birds have since been introduced, and attempts are being made to breed a form similar to the Tasmanian emu. The Kangaroo Island birds have successfully established a breeding population.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} of the tammar wallaby exists from the late Pleistocene era—remains {{were found in the}} Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago, while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer coats and thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars, which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population. A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species' range found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island, 19th century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo <b>Island</b> <b>population.</b> The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed these populations as subspecies; M. e. derbianus, M. e. eugenii and M. e. decres respectively.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Island</b> <b>populations</b> often {{also have}} small populations due to {{geographic}} isolation, limited habitat {{and high levels}} of endemism. Because their environments are so isolated gene flow is poor within <b>island</b> <b>populations.</b> Without the introduction of genetic diversity from gene flow, alleles are quickly fixed or loss. This reduces island populations' ability to adapt to any new circumstances and can result in higher levels of extinction. The majority of mammal, bird, and reptile extinctions since the 1600s have been from <b>island</b> <b>populations.</b> Moreover, 20% of bird species live on islands, but 90% of all bird extinctions have been from <b>island</b> <b>populations.</b> Human activities have been the major cause of extinctions on island in the past 50,000 years due to the introduction of exotic species, habitat loss and over-exploitation ...|$|R

Subspecies calochrysea first described by Harry Oberholser in 1923 breeds along the Himalayas east to Myanmar and Thailand and winters across southern India. The nominate form is darker in shade. Subspecies antioxantha which was also described by Oberholser has a breeding range from southern Burma, Thailand through Malaysia to Java and Bali.

25|$|In {{the initial}} {{explication}} of character displacement, {{many of the}} examples set forth as potential evidence for character displacement were observations between multiple pairs of birds. These included rock nuthatches in Asia, Australian honeyeaters of the genus Myzantha, Australian parrots, shearwaters in the Cape Verde Islands, flycatchers of the Bismarck Archipelago and notably, Darwin's finches in the Galapagos. David Lack found that when the two species Geospiza fortis and G. fuliginosa occurred on large islands together, they could be distinguished unequivocally by beak size. When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred. Similarly, Peter and Rosemary Grant found that a Geospiza fortis <b>island</b> <b>population</b> diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor G. magnirostris in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on.|$|E

25|$|The Paleolithic {{is often}} held to finish {{at the end}} of the ice age (the end of the Pleistocene epoch), and Earth's climate became warmer. This may have caused or contributed to the {{extinction}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, although it is also possible that the late Pleistocene extinctions were (at least in part) caused by other factors such as disease and overhunting by humans. New research suggests that the extinction of the woolly mammoth may have been caused by the combined effect of climatic change and human hunting. Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the Pleistocene caused the mammoths' habitat to shrink in size, resulting in a drop in population. The small populations were then hunted out by Paleolithic humans. The global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene may have made it easier for humans to reach mammoth habitats that were previously frozen and inaccessible. Small populations of wooly mammoths survived on isolated Arctic islands, Saint Paul Island and Wrangel Island, until BCE and BCE respectively. The Wrangel <b>Island</b> <b>population</b> became extinct around the same time the island was settled by prehistoric humans. There is no evidence of prehistoric human presence on Saint Paul island (though early human settlements dating as far back as 6500 BCE were found on the nearby Aleutian Islands).|$|E

500|$|Beginning in the mid-1980s, {{long term}} studies were begun of the Sable Island herds, {{and by the}} mid-2000s, most horses living on the island had {{documented}} histories. In 2007, a genetic analysis of the Sable Island herd was performed. It was concluded that these horses were genetically similar to multipurpose and light draft breeds found in eastern mainland Canada, with differences probably created by natural selection and genetic drift. However, the researchers also stated that Sable Island horses had genetically [...] "diverged enough from other breeds to deserve special attention by conservation interest groups," [...] and {{that the loss of}} the Sable Island horses would be more damaging to the genetic diversity of the Canadian horse population than the loss of any other breed. Genetic erosion is a possibility within the Sable <b>Island</b> <b>population,</b> due to the small number of horses. In a study of mitochondrial DNA published in 2012, the Sable Island horse was found to be the least genetically diverse of the 24 horse populations studied, which included horse and pony breeds as well as feral populations from North America and Europe. A 2014 study by Parks Canada stated that the horses were under threat from their low numbers, excessive inbreeding and extreme weather due to global warming.|$|E
40|$|<b>Island</b> <b>populations</b> are an {{interesting}} dichotomy in conservation biology. On the one hand, {{they can be a}} refuge for species where mainland populations have been decimated by loss of habitat and predation by exotic predators. On the other hand, <b>island</b> <b>populations</b> usually have reduced genetic diversity and are more susceptible to extinction through genetic and demographic processes. Genetic variation and morphological characters were measured for <b>island</b> and mainland <b>populations</b> of Parantechinus apicalis, small dasyurid marsupials, restricted to southwest Australia. Genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci revealed low levels of heterozygosity (He = 0. 20 - 0. 44) and high levels of inbreeding (Fe = 0. 40 - 0. 72) in <b>island</b> <b>populations</b> compared with the mainland population (He = 0. 73). A nested clade analysis revealed that allopatric fragmentation was probably responsible for the association between geographical location and control region haplotypes, which is consistent with the isolation of <b>populations</b> on <b>islands</b> and indicative of two main populations of P. apicalis representing separate conservation units for management. While these results are typical of many <b>island</b> <b>populations,</b> they have important implications in terms of the conservation of threatened species in Australia and around the world, where <b>island</b> <b>populations</b> are a common source of founders for captive breeding and translocation to mainland sites...|$|R

40|$|For {{conservation}} purposes {{islands are}} considered safe refuges for many species, particularly in regions where introduced predators form {{a major threat}} to the native fauna, but <b>island</b> <b>populations</b> are also known to possess low levels of genetic diversity. The New Zealand archipelago provides an ideal system to compare genetic diversity of large mainland populations where introduced predators are common, to that of smaller offshore islands, which serve as predator-free refuges. We assessed microsatellite variation in South Island robins (Petroica australis australis), and compared large mainland, small mainland, natural island and translocated <b>island</b> <b>populations.</b> Large mainland populations exhibited more polymorphic loci and higher number of alleles than small mainland and natural <b>island</b> <b>populations.</b> Genetic variation did not differ between natural and translocated <b>island</b> <b>populations,</b> even though one of the translocated populations was established with five individuals. Hatching failure was recorded in a subset of the populations and found to be significantly higher in translocated populations than in a large mainland population. Significant population differentiation was largely based on heterogeneity in allele frequencies (including fixation of alleles), as few unique alleles were observed. This study shows that large mainland populations retain higher levels of genetic diversity than natural and translocated <b>island</b> <b>populations.</b> It highlights the importance of protecting these mainland populations and using them as a source for new translocations. In the future, these populations may become extremely valuable for species conservation if existing <b>island</b> <b>populations</b> become adversely affected by low levels of genetic variation and do not persist. ...|$|R
