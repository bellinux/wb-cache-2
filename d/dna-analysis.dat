5|$|Based {{on recent}} <b>DNA-analysis,</b> the genus Ploceus is almost {{certainly}} polyphyletic. If all species currently included in the genus would remain and the genus would be made monophyletic, {{it would have to}} encompass the entire subfamily Ploceinae. The Ploceinae can be divided into two groups. In the first group, the widowbirds and bishops (genus Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the genus Ploceus.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} including Walter Stephen Judd suggested to merge the Capparaceae (which at that time included the Cleomaceae) with the Brassicaceae.

40|$|Considerable {{differences}} exist amongst {{countries in the}} mutation probability methods and thresholds used to select patients for BRCA 1 / 2 genetic screening. In order to assess the added value of mutation probability methods, we have retrospectively calculated the BRCAPRO and Myriad II probabilities in 306 probands who had previously been selected for <b>DNA-analysis</b> according to criteria based on familial history of cancer. <b>DNA-analysis</b> identified 52 mutations (16. 9 %) and 11 unclassified variants (UVs, 3. 6 %).

40|$|Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) {{is caused}} by {{heterozygous}} mutations in COL 3 A 1 and is characterized by fragile vasculature and hollow organs, with {{a high risk of}} catastrophic events at a young age. During pregnancy and delivery, maternal mortality rates up until 25 % have been reported. However, recent pedigree analysis reported a substantial lower pregnancy-related mortality rate of 4. 9 %. Here, we describe an extended vEDS family with multiple uneventful pregnancy outcomes. In the proband, a 37 -year-old woman, <b>DNA-analysis</b> because of an asymptomatic iliac artery dissection revealed a pathogenic mutation in COL 3 A 1 (c. 980 G>A; p. Gly 327 Asp). She had had three uneventful vaginal deliveries. At the time of diagnosis, her 33 -year-old niece was 25 weeks pregnant. She had had one uneventful vaginal delivery. Targeted <b>DNA-analysis</b> revealed that she was carrier of the COL 3 A 1 mutation. Ultrasound detected an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta with likely a dissection. An uneventful elective cesarean section was performed at a gestational age of 37 weeks. The 40 -year-old sister of our proband had had one uneventful vaginal delivery and an active pregnancy wish. Cascade DNA-screening showed her to carry the COL 3 A 1 mutation. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of her aorta revealed a type B dissection with the most proximal entry tear just below the superior mesenteric artery. Pregnancy was therefore discouraged.

40|$|A large {{fraction}} of the cost of DNA sequencing and other <b>DNA-analysis</b> processes results from the reagent costs incurred during cycle sequencing or PCR. In particular, the high cost of the enzymes and dyes used in these processes often results in thermal cycling costs exceeding $ 0. 50 per sample.

Improved detection efficiency of new sequencing instrumentation allows the reaction volumes for cycle sequencing to be scaled down to one-tenth of presently used volumes, resulting in at least a 10 -fold decrease in the cost of this process. However, commercially available thermal cyclers and automated reaction setup devices have inherent design limitations which make handling volumes of < 1 μL extremely difficult.
