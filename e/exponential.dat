In fact, the matrix <b>exponential</b> is well-defined for square matrices (in which case this <b>exponential</b> identity only holds when x and y commute), and {{is useful for}} solving systems of linear differential equations.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But <b>exponential</b> growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the <b>exponential</b> growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The <b>exponential</b> growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the <b>exponential</b> growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix <b>exponential.</b> Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic <b>exponential.</b> Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the <b>exponential</b> map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E

The more delicate cases of Schauder bases and exact systems of windowed <b>exponentials</b> are also studied.

When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by <b>exponential</b> kinetics.
