5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{consumption of}} alcohol was recognized as a problem by Dr. Eli Todd in 1812. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Edward Hooker on March 30, 1812, he stated {{that there was no}} single solution to alcoholism. “He advised a 3-pronged attack that was as follows: there should be an association of respectable men who would make it unfashionable to take ardent spirits; work houses of ‘idle, drinking persons’ after their third conviction for drunkenness; and heavy taxes on imported and domestic liquor”.|$|E
5|$|The film's idea {{originated}} in the late 1990s in screenwriter K. V. Vijayendra Prasad mind. At that time, he was joking about a housefly seeking revenge on a human <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> his son S. S. Rajamouli. Prasad later developed the idea as a script for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an African-American boy dies {{in an attempt to}} free his family from slavery and is reincarnated as a fly. After completing Maryada Ramanna (2010), Rajamouli reconsidered the concept after thinking of directing a film that was distinct from any other. He decided to make Eega a bilingual film in Telugu and Tamil– each scene including speech was filmed twice, once for each language. The Tamil version, titled Naan Ee, was Rajamouli's directorial debut in Tamil cinema. The film was presented by Daggubati Suresh Babu of Suresh Productions.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} that the change of foreign policy occurred in 1938, after the Munich Agreement, which became the final defeat of Litvinov's anti-German policy of collective security, which was marked by the reported remark about an inevitable fourth partition of Poland made by Litvinov's deputy Vladimir Potemkin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> French ambassador Robert Coulondre shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Interior {{has been noted}} in the compositions of Degas's protégé Walter Sickert, specifically in the latter's The Camden Town Murder series of 1908, and his painting Ennui of 1914. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Sickert, Degas described Interior as a genre painting, and as in the older artist's example, Sickert's depictions {{of men and women}} together are marked by dramatic tension and narrative ambiguity.|$|E

25|$|Also {{important}} in Lyra's levels are Evasion and Deception minigames. Evasion games occur whenever Lyra is spotted by an enemy, and involves pressing buttons {{to correspond with}} icons on screen to allow Lyra escape from her pursuer. Deception games are more common. These games take place whenever Lyra is involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> someone and is attempting to deceive them. The better the player performs in the minigame, the more successful Lyra is in her deception. The minigames include, {{but are not limited}} to, matching symbols, collecting falling icons, avoiding falling icons, a Whac-A-Mole type game and a snooker type game.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the report}} on the Amerithrax {{investigation}} published by the Department of Justice, Ivins engaged in actions and made statements that indicate a consciousness of guilt. He took environmental samples in his laboratory without authorization and decontaminated areas {{in which he had}} worked without reporting his activities. He also threw away a book about secret codes, which described methods similar to those used in the anthrax letters. Ivins threatened other scientists, made equivocal statements about his possible involvement <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> an acquaintance, and put together outlandish theories in an effort to shift the blame for the anthrax mailings to people close to him.|$|E

25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E
25|$|When the Allies {{contemplated}} turning Klaipėda into a free {{city like}} Danzig, Polish Foreign Minister Konstanty Skirmunt believed {{that such a}} free city would hurt the Polish interest by allowing Germany to maintain its influence in the region. Skirmunt instead supported {{the transfer of the}} region to Lithuania if Poland would secure unrestricted trade via the Neman River and the port. At the same time Poland was preoccupied by other issues (assassination of President Gabriel Narutowicz, economic crisis, territorial disputes in Silesia, tense relations with Soviet Russia) and paid less attention to Klaipėda. Lithuania understood that a military action against Polish interest in the region could resume the Polish–Lithuanian War. To counter the expected backlash from Poland and France, the Lithuanians looked for an ally in Soviet Russia, which opposed a strong Polish state. On November 29, Soviet Foreign Minister Georgy Chicherin stopped briefly in Kaunas on his way to Berlin. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Galvanauskas, Chicherin expressed support for Lithuanian plans in Klaipėda and declared that Soviet Russia would not remain passive if Poland moved against Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{continues}} {{the story of}} the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism, socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. He seems destined to follow in the spiritual footsteps of Ivan Karamazov; Dostoyevsky uses Kolya's beliefs especially <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Alyosha to poke fun at his Westernizer critics by putting their beliefs in {{what appears to be a}} young boy who doesn't exactly know what he is talking about. Kolya is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a falling out over Ilyusha's maltreatment of a dog: Ilyusha had fed it bread in which there was a pin on Smerdyakov's suggestion. But thanks to Alyosha's intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs.|$|E
