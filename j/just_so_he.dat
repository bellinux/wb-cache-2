5|$|To {{play for}} an inter-county GAA team, Canavan {{had to work}} around a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) bylaw, because of a dispute in his parish, Errigal Ciarán. Two clubs claimed to {{represent}} the parish, the established Ballygawley St. Ciaran's club and the newly formed club, then called Errigal Ciaran Naomh Malachai. Players from the Errigal team were not recognised as being GAA members, because the club failed to register correctly. Canavan registered {{as a member of}} the Killyclogher hurling club, even though he didn't play the sport, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> would be eligible for selection for the Tyrone minors. Prior to that, he had not played legitimate club football, but had forged his way onto the Tyrone under-age teams with his performances at school level. The two clubs united under the banner of Errigal Ciaran two years later.|$|E
500|$|After the 1968 presidential election, George Romney {{was named}} the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the {{administration}} of the newly elected President Nixon. [...] Lenore was not enthusiastic about leaving Michigan to return to Washington after five decades away, but said, [...] "Any wife wants to be with her husband wherever he is, whether state or federal government, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> can develop his creative ideas." [...] By then, the couple had 12 grandchildren.|$|E
500|$|As he {{was writing}} the film in 1985, John Hughes kept track of his {{progress}} in a spiral-bound logbook. He noted that the basic storyline was developed on February 25. It was successfully pitched the following day to Paramount Studios chief Ned Tanen. Tanen was intrigued by the concept, but wary that the Writers Guild of America was hours away from picketing the studio. Hughes wrote the screenplay {{in less than a}} week. Editor Paul Hirsch explained that Hughes had a trance-like concentration to his script-writing process, working for hours on end, and would later shoot the film on essentially what was his first draft of the script. [...] "The first cut of Ferris Bueller's Day Off ended up at two hours, 45 minutes. The shortening of the script had to come in the cutting room", said Hirsch. [...] "Having the story episodic and taking place in one day...meant the characters were wearing the same clothes. I suspect that Hughes writes his scripts with few, if any costume changes <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> can have that kind of freedom in the editing." ...|$|E

500|$|Kanae {{imagined}} {{himself a}} realist and was distressed at the avant-garde {{that was coming}} to dominate the European art world; he {{found it difficult to}} comprehend and reconcile it with his understanding of a realist ideal in Western art. [...] His disappointment and confusion impacted his productivity; he produced few of the prints that were supposed to fund his stay, and the language barrier made it difficult to find buyers. [...] A Tokyo agent of his committed suicide after appropriating money from Kanae and other clients. [...] He could not bring himself to reveal his and his parents' financial situation, so he had another agent, Rokurō Watanabe, send money to Paris <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> could send it back to his parents, who were under pressure from a loan shark. [...] Along with his disappointment in the Western art world, Kanae witnessed first-hand the impact Japanese art had had there. [...] Though he kept such thoughts to himself he began to feel a sense of the superiority of Japanese art—of the same traditions he had denied himself during his years of training.|$|E
500|$|Kotaku's Owen Good called Dogmeat [...] "one of the franchise's most iconic characters" [...] {{as well as}} its [...] "one of {{the most}} motionally {{fulfilling}} features." [...] The book Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design by Scott Rogers used him as an example while discussing how the [...] "party members don't need to be human". In 2008, UGO Team stated this [...] "undisputed champion of Fallout characters" [...] is not [...] "only our favorite Fallout character, he's also one of gaming's greatest dogs." [...] That same year, Joe Martin of Bit-tech ranked Dogmeat as the sixth top PC game NPC of all time, commenting: [...] "There are a lot of computer game characters we like and a few we’d even {{go so far as to}} say we love. Dogmeat though, despite being a definite tabula rasa, sits in a different category altogether and is the only computer game character that we’d reload and repeat significant portions of a game for, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> could stand a better chance of survival." [...] In 2009, Michael Fiegel of The Escapist called Dogmeat possibly the most beloved character of the Fallout universe, writing that [...] "in an uncaring wasteland ... Dogmeat is a moral compass: Though your needle might swing towards good or evil, his center always holds strong provided you protect him." [...] Steve and Larson of ScrewAttack ranked Dogmeat as the tenth best gaming pet in 2011. Dogmeat was included in numerous lists of best video game dogs, including by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist in 2010, Michael Perry of PlayStation Official Magazine in 2012, Gergo Vas of Kotaku in 2013, and Benjamin Abbott of Metro, Brian Taylor of Paste, and the staff of Bild in 2014. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN chose Dogmeat as the top feature he wished to return in Fallout 4.|$|E
500|$|In late 2012 {{the long}} dormant rivalry between Shocker {{and his former}} tag team partner Mr. Niebla rose to the surface again as the two began to work on {{opposite}} sides of a number of matches, with increasing intensity and animosity from both wrestlers. The two were paired up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles as a way to continue the storyline between the two. The team worked together without too many problems in the initial rounds as they defeated the teams of Marco Corleone and Kraneo and the team of Máscara Dorada and Mephisto to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador Jr.. Following the loss Shocker and Mr. Niebla argued and almost came to blows over who was responsible for losing the match. On July 19 at Infierno en el Ring, Shocker won Mr. Águila's hair in a ten-man steel cage Lucha de Apuestas. In early 2014, Shocker turned rudo, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> could feud with Rush. On March 21, 2014, at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, Shocker lost his hair for the first time, when he was defeated by Rush in a Lucha de Apuestas. On June 13, Shocker and Negro Casas defeated Rush and La Máscara to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. On April 3, 2015, Shocker, El Terrible and Rey Bucanero formed a new trio named [...] (Terriblemente Guapo y un Rey, [...] "Terribly Handsome King"). In early 2016 Shocker suffered an injury that would require surgery and keep him out of the ring for almost six months. CMLL opted to not strip Shocker and Casas of the tag team championship during the long period of inactivity, which meant that there was eight months between the team defending the championship. Shocker and Casas successfully defended the championship against Atlantis and Diamante Azul on June 5, La Máscara and Sharlie Rockstar on July 18, and Místico and Volador Jr. on September 19, 2016.|$|E
50|$|Castle Goring was {{designed}} by John Rebecca for Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet. It was intended that his grandson, Percy Bysshe Shelley, would live at Castle Goring; however, the poet drowned in Italy aged <b>just</b> 29, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> never took possession.|$|R

2500|$|Liz is {{generally}} portrayed {{as something of}} a [...] "geek". So, while she is an apparently skilled writer, she seems to have very few social skills (in [...] "Rosemary's Baby", Jack describes her as [...] "socially retarded"). For example, while she was trying to pick up men at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if the seat next to her was taken, leading her to ask him why she should have to move her coat <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> could sit there. Liz is often shown to be generally insecure and holds a strong concern for how she is perceived by others. Liz is sometimes dismissive of others, a personality flaw that can be connected to her lack of social skills. Assessing Liz's personality up to near the end of season 3, Jonah Weinerslav described her as [...] "an eternal 13-year-old tomboy—scared of sex, obsessed with Star Wars and meatball subs" [...] and as [...] "cling to a fantasy of presexual, junk-food-munching adolescence".|$|E
2500|$|Kimmel's biggest {{influences}} in comedy are David Letterman and Howard Stern. Kimmel has described Letterman's work as, [...] "His show {{was just so}} weird and different, I'd {{never seen anything like}} it. I didn't know anyone who had a sense of humor like that." [...] Kimmel has often joked that the only reason he got into show business was <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> can be friends with Letterman, he has also questioned why anybody would watch his show instead of Letterman's. Kimmel wrote a piece for Time writing his love for Letterman by saying, [...] "As I write this, there are only 10 shows left before the funniest, most inventive and smartest man who ever wore an Alka Seltzer suit goes fishing for good. None of us who discovered Dave on our own and claimed him as our own {{will ever be able to}} satisfactorily explain to the younger people who didn’t what he did, what he meant and what he means. I guess it doesn’t matter. It’s only an exhibition, not a competition. Thanks Dave. For whatever it’s worth, you’re my favorite." ...|$|E
50|$|On 9 January Miliev officially {{signed a}} 2.5-year {{contract}} with Levski Sofia. He {{became the first}} signing for Levski in January. He has been given the kit number 55.

5000|$|Tomlinson cites Robbie Williams as {{his biggest}} {{influence}} and idol. In {{an interview with}} Now magazine, he said: [...] "I've always loved Robbie. <b>He's</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> cheeky, <b>he</b> {{can get away with}} anything.

50|$|Clockwork is an exciting, suspenseful {{fairy tale}} written in an ironic and amusing style. It {{has a strong}} moral message. Pullman uses the {{literary}} technique of parallel authorial commentary, similar to Rudyard Kipling in <b>Just</b> <b>So</b> Stories. <b>He</b> uses the idea of clockwork as a metafictive device, comparing the interrelated plot elements to {{the elements of a}} clock's mechanism.|$|R
60|$|I {{am afraid}} {{you must think}} me--what can you have thought of me for not {{immediately}} answering a letter which brought the tears both to my eyes and my husband's?

60|$|I knew another, who being a Tradesman, and {{in great}} Distress for Money in his Business, dream'd {{that he was}} walking all alone in a great Wood, and that he met a little Child with a Bag of Gold in its Hand, and a fine Necklace of Diamonds on its Neck, upon the Sight, his Wants {{presently}} dictated to him to rob the Child; the little innocent Creature, (<b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> dream'd) {{not being able to}} resist; or to tell who it was, accordingly he consented to take the Money from the Child, and then to take the Diamond Necklace from it too, and did so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Archer!" [...] shouted Herries, {{with sudden}} passion, {{and called to}} him with curses to come down. The figure drew back at the first cry, with an {{agitated}} movement so abrupt as almost to be called an antic. The next moment the man seemed to reconsider and collect himself, and began to come down the zigzag garden path, but with obvious reluctance, his feet falling in slower and slower rhythm. Through March's mind were throbbing the phrases that this man himself had used, about going mad {{in the middle of}} the night and wrecking the stone figure. <b>Just</b> <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> could fancy, the maniac who had done such a thing might climb the crest of the hill, in that feverish dancing fashion, and look down on the wreck he had made. But the wreck he had made here was not only a wreck of stone.|$|E
60|$|Many {{thoughts}} flashed {{across her}} mind. She {{could not help}} him now; he would be dead soon; she {{did not need to}} wait there beside him; there was a risk of some of his comrades riding into that rendezvous. Suppose his back was not broken after all! Suppose she stopped the flow of blood, tended him, nursed him, saved his life? For if there were one chance of his living, which she doubted, it must be through her. Would he not be the same savage the hour he was well and strong again? What difference could she make in such a nature? The man was evil. He could not conquer evil. She had been witness to that. He had driven Roberts to draw and had killed him. No doubt he had deliberately and coldly murdered the two ruffians, Bill and Halloway, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> could be free of their glances at her and be alone with her. He deserved to die there like a dog.|$|E

60|$|And now Harris's {{contrary}} {{nature and}} inborn selfishness were strikingly manifested. He has no spirit of self-denial. He began straight off, and continued for an hour, {{to express his}} gratitude {{that the child was}} not destroyed. I never saw such a man. That was the kind of person he was; <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>HE</b> was gratified, he never cared anything about anybody else. I had noticed that trait in him, over and over again. Often, of course, it was mere heedlessness, mere want of reflection. Doubtless this may have been the case in most instances, but it was not the less hard to bar on that account--and after all, its bottom, its groundwork, was selfishness. There is no avoiding that conclusion. In the instance under consideration, I did think the indecency of running on in that way might occur to him; but no, the child was saved and he was glad, that was sufficient--he cared not a straw for MY feelings, or my loss of such a literary plum, snatched from my very mouth at the instant it was ready to drop into it. His selfishness was sufficient to place his own gratification in being spared suffering clear before all concern for me, his friend. Apparently, he did not once reflect upon the valuable details which would have fallen like a windfall to me: fishing the child out--witnessing the surprise of the family and the stir the thing would have made among the peasants--then a Swiss funeral--then the roadside monument, to be paid for by us and have our names mentioned in it. And we should have gone into Baedeker and been immortal. I was silent. I was too much hurt to complain. If he could act so, and be so heedless and so frivolous at such a time, and actually seem to glory in it, after all I had done for him, I would have cut my hand off before I would let him see that I was wounded.|$|E
60|$|When {{her father}} at last {{appeared}} she became, as usual, instantly {{aware of the}} futility of any effort to hold him to anything. He had written {{her that he was}} ill, too ill to leave his room, and that he must see her without delay; and if this had been, as was probable, the sketch of a design, he was indifferent even to the moderate finish required for deception. He had clearly wanted, for perversities that he called reasons, to see her, just as she herself had sharpened for a talk; but she now again felt, in the inevitability of the freedom he used with her, all the old ache, her poor mother's very own, that he couldn't touch you ever so lightly without setting up. No relation with him could be so short or so superficial as not to be somehow to your hurt; and this, in the strangest way in the world, not because he desired it to be--feeling often, as he surely must, the profit for him of its not being--but because there was never a mistake for you that he could leave unmade or a conviction of his impossibility in you that he could approach you without strengthening. He might have awaited her on the sofa in his sitting-room, or might have stayed in bed and received her in that situation. She was glad to be spared the sight of such penetralia, but it would have reminded her a little less that there was no truth in him. This was the weariness of every fresh meeting; he dealt out lies as he might the cards from the greasy old pack for the game of diplomacy to which you were to sit down with him. The inconvenience--as always happens in such cases--was not that you minded what was false, but that you missed what was true. He might be ill, and it might suit you to know it, but no contact with him, for this, could ever be straight enough. <b>Just</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> even might die, but Kate fairly wondered on what evidence of his own she would some day have to believe it.|$|E
6000|$|It figured for him, clearly, {{as a final}} idea, a {{conception}} of the last vividness. He might have been signifying by it the sharp corners and hard edges, all the stony pointedness, the grand right geometry of his spreading Palladian church. <b>Just</b> <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> was insensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that, beguilingly, almost confoundingly, was a contact but with practically yielding lines and curved surfaces. [...] "You're round, my boy," [...] he had said--"you're ALL, you're variously and inexhaustibly round, when you might, by all the chances, have been abominably square. I'm not sure, for that matter," [...] he had added, [...] "that you're not square in the general mass--whether abominably or not. The abomination isn't a question, for you're inveterately round--that's what I mean--in the detail. It's the sort of thing, in you, that one feels--or at least I do--with one's hand. Say you had been formed, all over, {{in a lot of}} little pyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the Ducal Palace in Venice--so lovely in a building, but so damnable, for rubbing against, in a man, and especially in a near relation. I can see them all from here--each of them sticking out by itself--all the architectural cut diamonds that would have scratched one's softer sides. One would have been scratched by diamonds--doubtless the neatest way if one was to be scratched at all--but one would have been more or less reduced to a hash. As it is, for living with, you're a pure and perfect crystal. I give you my idea--I think you ought to have it--just as it has come to me." [...] The Prince had taken the idea, in his way, for he was well accustomed, by this time, to taking; and nothing perhaps even could more have confirmed Mr. Verver's account of his surface than the manner in which these golden drops evenly flowed over it. They caught in no interstice, they gathered in no concavity; the uniform smoothness betrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone. The young man, in other words, unconfusedly smiled--though indeed as if assenting, from principle and habit, to more than he understood. He liked all signs that things were well, but he cared rather less WHY they were.|$|E
60|$|One Christmas Eve, {{when his}} {{reindeer}} had leaped {{to the top}} of a new building, Santa Claus was surprised to find that the chimney had been built much smaller than usual.
