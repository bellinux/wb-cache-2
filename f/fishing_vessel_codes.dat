40|$|A fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) {{has existed}} for over 3 decades and the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) manages this fishery using precautionary catch limits, fishery data {{collection}} and a scientific observer programme operating on the <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels.</b> A recent {{increase in the number}} of <b>vessels</b> <b>fishing</b> and the rising costs of undertaking scientific research cruises have focussed attention on being able to use <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> to collect more extensive scientific data sets. In 2011, CCAMLR’s Subgroup on Acoustic Survey and Analysis Methods (SG-ASAM) was tasked with assessing the use of acoustic data collected from <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> to provide qualitative and quantitative information on the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill and other pelagic species. SG-ASAM conceived a proof of concept programme and implemented the first stage in 2013 to determine the current setup of acoustic equipment on participating <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> and to establish whether these vessels could collect geo- and time-referenced acoustic data. To date data have been received from 7 krill <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> and SG-ASAM has now focussed on the development of data collection protocols to enable <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> to collect quantitative acoustic data along prescribed transects. While this development work continues, the willingness of fishing industry to participate in such studies has already been demonstrated by several fishing companies, and Norwegian- and Chinese-flagged <b>fishing</b> <b>vessels</b> are undertaking krill biomass surveys in two key fishery areas in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean...|$|R
