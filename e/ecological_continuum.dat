40|$|The lively {{debate about}} {{speciation}} currently {{focuses on the}} relative importance of factors driving population differentiation. While many studies are increasingly producing results on the importance of selection, {{little is known about the}} interaction between drift and selection. Moreover, there is still little knowledge on the spatial-temporal scales at which speciation occurs, that is, arrangement of habitat patches, abruptness of habitat transitions, climate and habitat changes interacting with selective forces. To investigate these questions, we quantified variation on a fine geographical scale analysing morphological (shell) and genetic data sets coupled with environmental data in the land snail Murella muralis, endemic to the Mediterranean island of Sicily. Analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) and eight nuclear microsatellite loci showed that genetic variation is highly structured at a very fine spatial scale by local palaeogeographical events and historical population dynamics. Molecular clock estimates, calibrated here specifically for Tyrrhenian land snails, provided a framework of palaeogeographical events responsible for the observed geographical variations and migration routes. Finally, we showed for the first time well-documented lines of evidence of selection in the past, which explains divergence of land snail shell shapes. We suggest that time and palaeogeographical history acted as constraints in the progress along the <b>ecological</b> speciation <b>continuum.</b> Our study shows that testing for correlation among palaeogeography, morphology and genetic data on a fine geographical scale provides information fundamental for a detailed understanding of ecological speciation processes...|$|R

Despite the pertinent implications that these findings have for the training of perceptual skill, until now, a review has not been forthcoming.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Agroforestry is a {{traditional}} farming practice in American Samoa that has helped to sustain the livelihood of the native population for centuries. These once self-sufficient islands have become economically dependent on U. S monies and other external resources during the past century. Dependency has caused {{a shift in the}} carrying capacity of the islands and has changed cultural attitudes regarding land use. This attitude is expressed on the landscape of changing agricultural and communal lands. Preserving traditional agroforestry practices and improving these systems may be important factors contributing to the future ecological, economic, and cultural sustainability of the territory. The goal {{of this study was to}} document and describe agroforestry farming in American Samoa in order to provide base-line information regarding the utilization of agroforestry species, agroforestry farming incentives and constraints, and current practices and systems. Thirty-eight farmers were randomly selected and farmer interviews and field surveys were conducted between the months of May-August 2003. Formal survey questions for the interview were divided into five major sections: woody species usage, livestock, inputs and soil, land tenure, and farmer demographics. Site selection corresponded with the participant farmers. Basic topographical information was collected for each site. Agroforestry practices mentioned during the interview process that were observed on site were documented. Each agroforestry site was placed into an initial classification type based on a visual assessment of plot size, species diversity, and vertical vegetative structure. Subplot data regarding species composition and vertical canopy structure was measured for each site. Data collection was divided into five vertical layers primarily by height: 1) low crop (< 1. 5 m), 2) shrub/sapling (1. 5 - 4 m), 3) small tree (4 -l 0 m), 4) large tree (10 +m) and 5) climbing vines. For each subplot all ethnobotanically useful plant species were identified. Percent cover of useful species in each stratum layer was estimated and assigned one of seven percent cover classes. Subplot cover classes were averaged to obtain a single site estimate for each species in each stratum. Results from the farmer interviews suggest that agroforestry systems continue to be an important cultural and product resource in American Samoa. Although there is no longer the same level of dependency on these systems for meeting basic needs, agroforestry products continue to supplement household diets and are utilized for a variety of non-timber forest products and ecological services. Several agroforestry practices were observed among the farms in the study. However, the effectiveness of some of the practices including windbreaks, fallow, and erosion control was not optimal. This indicated that farmers could greatly benefit from institutionalized agroforestry practices such as appropriate spacing for wind filtration, improved fallow, and contour farming. Incentives and constraints for practicing agroforestry farming were identified. Some incentives included product variety, tradition, and a growing need for land-use efficiency. Identified constraints included time investment for production and poor labor resources, decreased profit when compared to mono-cultural farming, and the lack of planning prior to agroforestry implementation. The communal land tenure system acted as both an incentive and a disincentive for practicing agroforestry. The initial classification of agroforestry systems included home tree gardens, mixed crop plantations, transitional systems, and open canopy with dispersed tree systems. Agroforestry systems existed along an <b>ecological</b> complexity <b>continuum,</b> where complexity was measured by species diversity and vertical structure. A quantitative assessment of species composition and structure was used as a more objective approach to classifying local agroforestry systems. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to ordinate sites along a gradient based on species composition and structure. Several environmental and socio-economic variables were investigated to determine whether any of them demonstrated relationships with vegetative patterns. Species diversity, average number of canopy stratum layers, and elevation were three variables correlated with vegetative patterns. Sites that had high species diversity and were multi-structured were placed at the upper end of the gradient, while sites that had lower diversity with simple structure were generally placed at the lower end of the gradient. This supported the <b>ecological</b> complexity <b>continuum.</b> Less complex sites were associated with high elevations indicating that systems on the heavily populated lowland regions were more species rich and structurally diverse. The classification based on the cluster analysis indicated that distinct groups did not exist, as there was significant overlap. In general, groups derived from the cluster analysis were similar to those based on the visual assessment. One difference was that in the cluster analysis taro and gatae (Erythrina spp.) dominated sites emerged as a separate group. In addition, the cluster analysis was able to distinguish several subgroups within the mixed crop plantation type. No single socio-economic variable was correlated with vegetative patterns. This suggests that socio-economic variables do not determine vegetation in agroforestry systems and that human preference may be more of a driving factor than initially expected. It is likely that the availability of external resources allows for the selection of species within agroforestry systems to be based on choice rather than need. This trend is likely to increase as people become less dependent upon agroforestry systems to supplement needs. Traditional and institutionalized agroforestry systems have the potential to contribute to increasing self-sufficiency among American Samoan households. Because the importance of these systems is often not realized, the active promotion and education of agroforestry practices is essential. The classification of agroforestry systems provides an organizational framework for future research to build upon. The concept of the <b>ecological</b> complexity <b>continuum</b> where agroforestry systems fall along major points may be useful for answering socio-economic and ecological questions related to local agroforestry production...|$|R
40|$|The {{in between}} city {{is often used}} to name areas which are neither urban nor rural, where “the sharp {{distinction}} between city and landscape has dissolved into an <b>ecological</b> and cultural <b>continuum</b> of a built structure between city and landscape”. Sieverts in (Huhlmann, 2007). The Thesis aims {{to gain a better understanding}} of how these territories function and how they perform according to social, economic and ecological planning goals, by developing an approach using the concept of ‘Permeability’, which I define as the property and capacity of the territory that facilitates connections and therefore flows. As a first step a classification on the regional scale to identify the ‘Territories in Between’ using two deliberately distinct and different case study areas (the province of South Holland in the Netherlands and the state of The Tyrol in Austria), is undertaken to later be able to draw conclusions which are valid in the European context. An integrated approach using the concept of permeability based on the understanding of these territories as both a place (a site or territory) and as a number of often just loosely bounded, relatively disconnected and dispersed, perhaps sprawling activities, made in and through many different kinds of networks, is used to gain a better understanding of the ‘Territories in Between’ in the two test case areas. Through the combination of economic, social and ecological as well as mapable permeability indicators, the territories can be investigated in a moderate relationalism which allows overcoming the ‘network versus territories’ as well as the ‘human versus nature’ divide. “On the one hand, networks should not be seen as non-spatial and without ‘geographical anchors’ and on the other hand, territories and scales should not be viewed as closed and static. ” (Jones, 2009) Following this idea the indicators are chosen according to their suitability to establish a relationship between the territory and the flows within the landscape, describing the traces of these flows. Finally general planning and design principles are developed, which are based on a relational and not functional understanding of the ‘Territories in Between’, by comparing the indicators and the results within the different case study areas.

In this study, we identified the 50 most important questions relating to the maintenance and restoration of an <b>ecological</b> <b>continuum</b> - the connectedness of ecological processes across many scales including trophic relationship and disturbance processes and hydro-ecological flows in the European Alps. We initiated and implemented a trans-national priority setting exercise, inviting 48 institutions including researchers, conservation practitioners, NGOs, policymakers and administrators from the Alpine region. The exercise was composed of an initial call for pertinent questions, a first online evaluation of the received questions and a final discussion and selection process during a joint workshop. The participating institutions generated 484 initial questions, which were condensed to the 50 most important questions by 16 workshop participants.

The article presents an example of such a study, which the authors carried out on the model seminatural fishway in the water laboratory in Institute of Environmental Engineering in Wrocław. The results were used to assess the accuracy of the functioning of the fishway. The tested combination of “vegetated baffles” and “pools” in the fishway model was found to be optimal for the ichthyofauna.

Over one year, we surveyed the faunal assemblages by means of pitfall traps placed in the caves and specific subterranean sampling devices (SSD) buried in the MSS. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to compare the spatial and temporal dynamics of the subterranean invertebrates inhabiting the two environments. As expected, arthropod communities occurring near the surface were characterized by minor level of subterranean adaptations, and conversely, subterranean species were more abundant and diversified at higher depths, both in the caves and in the MSS. Diversity and abundance of external elements in the superficial layers {{were found to be}} highly seasonal dependent, with minor values in winter compared to the other seasons. We provided information about the faunal assemblages dwelling in the two hypogean compartments, and we characterized the microclimatic conditions therein.

40|$|International audienceTwo {{distinct}} nutritional syndromes {{have been}} described in temperate green orchids. Most orchids form mycorrhizas with rhizoctonia fungi and are considered autotrophic. Some orchids, however, associate with fungi that simultaneously form ectomycorrhizas with surrounding trees and derive their carbon from these fungi. This evolutionarily derived condition has been called mixotrophy or partial mycoheterotrophy and is characterized by 13 C enrichment and high N content. Although {{it has been suggested}} that the two major nutritional syndromes are clearly distinct and tightly linked to the composition of mycorrhizal communities, recent studies have challenged this assumption. Here, we investigated whether mycorrhizal communities and nutritional syndromes differed between seven green orchid species that co-occur under similar ecological conditions (coastal dune slacks). Our results showed that mycorrhizal communities differed significantly between orchid species. Rhizoctonia fungi dominated in Dactylorhiza sp., Herminium monorchis, and Epipactis palustris, which were autotrophic based on 13 C and N content. Conversely, Liparis loeselii and Epipactis neerlandica associated primarily with ectomycorrhizal fungi but surprisingly, 13 C and N content supported mixotrophy only in E. neerlandica.

40|$|Modelling habitat {{suitability}} of semi-aquatic vertebrates for large scale conservation purposes {{is a particularly}} challenging task, due to the fine-scale linearity of riverine habitats, and to the <b>ecological</b> <b>continuum</b> represented by the riparian and the aquatic ecosystems, on one side, and by a river and its tributaries, on the other. We advocate that habitat suitability models (HSMs) should represent the fine-scale complexity of the riparian and aquatic ecosystems at the drainage basin scale, {{which is the most}} relevant spatial unit for planning conservation strategies for semi-aquatic vertebrates, Hence, we developed a 3 -step GIS-based modelling approach, and applied it to otter Lutra lutra in Italy to illustrate its potential applications for designing a nation-wide conservation strategy. First, we built a deductive HSM (resolution: 1 : 250, 000, grain: 100 m x 100 m) of the riparian (100 m buffer around each river bank) and of the back-riparian (500 In buffer) areas along rivers. After, we created a synthetic index S(i) summarising this information within the cells of a 5 km x 5 km grid superimposed to the whole country thus obtaining a nation-wide overview of habitat suitability. Both HSM and S(i) were validated by using data on otter distribution, by performing a sensitivity analysis. Finally, we scaled-up the information provided by S(i) to obtain a suitability index within each drainage basin (S(b)). By overlapping a layer representing the basins occupied by otters to S(b) we obtained an effective tool to identify basins to be prioritised for the conservation and expansion of existing populations, for rejoining isolated sub-populations, and for habitat restoration. The methodology developed here helps filling the gap between the urgent conservation needs of semi-aquatic species, and the inadequacy of traditional modelling approaches for species inhabiting one of the world's most endangered ecosystems.

40|$|Nebraska was {{selected}} as a representative region to develop a lake and reservoir classification method appropriate for agriculturally impacted ecosystems and to classify lakes and reservoirs. There are over 3, 000 constructed reservoirs, sandpit and borrow pit lakes and natural Sand Hills lakes in the state. Due to {{the large number of}} lakes, a methodology for easily assessing lake health is critical for managing lakes and monitoring changes. There has been much interest in determining if natural ecological regions (ecoregions) based on terrestrial factors are representative of lake water quality {{in other parts of the}} U. S. Within an ecoregion, lakes that remain undisturbed by anthropogenic sources could be used to set water quality benchmarks for other lakes within the region. However, the validity of the ecoregion approach needs to be tested in the mid-west. A novel <b>ecological</b> <b>continuum</b> approach was developed utilizing factor analysis to identify lake and reservoir classes. In general, the following factors were found to be important for most lake types: water clarity, water chemistry, depth and temperature, and chlorophyll a (chl a). For all lake types, conductivity was found to be positively correlated with N:P, and negatively correlated with chl a, and conductivity and N:P were higher in lakes and reservoirs in the east. Elevation in Nebraska decreases from west to east by 840 m, climate changes from sub-arid to temperate, and evapotranspiration increases. There was no clear relationship between chl a and nutrients for reservoirs and Sand Hills lakes; however, TP appeared to limit chl a in most sandpit and borrow pit lakes. The ability of lakes grouped by ecoregions to predict water quality was tested for all lake types. Ecoregions did not adequately predict reservoir groups, often because reservoir drainage areas extended beyond ecoregion boundaries, and local hydrologic effects appeared to impact Sand Hills lakes more than ecoregional effects. Sandpit and borrow pit lakes grouped by ecoregions were reasonably good at predicting water quality. ...|$|E
