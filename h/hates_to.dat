5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E

25|$|Wolfe {{maintains}} a rigid schedule in the brownstone. He has breakfast {{in his bedroom}} while wearing yellow silk pajamas; he <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> discuss work during breakfast, and if forced to do so insists upon not uttering a word until he has finished his {{glass of orange juice}} (Murder by the Book). Afterwards, he is with Horstmann in the plant rooms from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Lunch is usually at 1:15p.m. He returns to the plant rooms from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Dinner is generally at 7:15 or 7:30p.m. (although in one book, Wolfe tells a guest that lunch is served at 1 o'clock and dinner at 8). The remaining hours, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and after dinner, are available for business, or for reading if there is no pressing business (even if, by Archie's lights, there is). Sunday's schedule is more relaxed; Theodore, the orchid-keeper, usually goes out.|$|E

25|$|According to Romila Thapar, Ashoka's Dhamma is {{a superb}} {{document}} of his essential humanity and {{an answer to}} the socio-political needs of the contemporaneous situation. It was not anti-Brahmanical because respect for the Brahmans and Sarmanas {{is an integral part of}} his Dhamma. His emphasis on non-violence did not blind him to the needs of the state. He warned the forest tribes that although he <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> use coercion, he may be required to resort to force if they continued to create trouble. By the time Ashoka stopped war, the entire Indian sub-continent was under his control. In the south he was on friendly terms with the Cholas and Pandyas. Sri Lanka was an admiring ally. Thus, Ashoka's decline of war came when his empire had reached its natural boundaries. The plea for tolerance was a wise course of action in an ethnically diverse, religiously varied, and class divided society. Ashoka's empire was a conglomerate of diverse groups; farmers, pastoral nomads and hunter-gatherers, there were Greeks, Kambojas, and Bhojas and hundreds of groups with different traditions. In this situation a plea for tolerance was needed. Ashoka tried to transcend the parochial cultural traditions with a board set of ethical principles.|$|E

Roz tells him that her husband will soon come looking for her, and he <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> see her with another man.

500|$|The {{exhibits}} featured some of Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's own drawings, {{which he}} intended to use as illustrations for his book of French-language poems, Sensations internes ("Internal Sensations"). He planned for his art movement to reach outside Romania, and, also in 1896, financed an international exhibition of independent and avant-garde artists. Salonul was known for its public protest against academic art: located just outside the Romanian Athenaeum building (a main venue for local Neoclassicism), it put up Petrescu Găină's huge caricature of academic artist C. I. Stăncescu, and flew a red flag next to it. This call to socialist rebellion attracted public attention, and the flag was urgently taken down by agents of the Romanian Police. The subsequent exhibitions were viewed with sympathy by {{a section of the}} press, including the leftist newspaper Adevărul. It republished pieces ridiculing Stăncescu in his role of official curator, and made favorable comments on all of the Salonul Independenților artists. Noting the leader's own anarchist past, Adevărul art columnist Gal wrote: [...] "Bogdan has all the qualities and flaws of a sincere French revolutionary, but one who is not entirely clear and scientific. He has an extraordinary love for all things independent and <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> the point of excess all sectarian people, and all schools." [...] In June 1896, the group of [...] "secessionists" [...] was commissioned to decorate Bragadiru Garden, where Romania's press held its annual fair. The show, attended by Bogdan-Pitești, prominently featured Stăncescu's caricature at the entrance.|$|E

[...] The three most popular versions of this tradition are related by al-Miswar b. Makhrama, a Companion who was about nine years old when Muhammad died.

2500|$|Wolfe is very {{particular}} in {{his choice of}} words. He is a prescriptivist who <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> hear language being misused according to his lights, often chastising people who do so. One example is his dislike of the word [...] "contact" [...] {{being used as a}} verb; when Archie says that [...] "contact" [...] is a verb, transitive and intransitive, Wolfe replies [...] "Contact is not a verb under this roof". One of his most severe reactions occurs in the first chapter of Gambit, when he burns a dictionary in the front room fireplace because it states that the words [...] "imply" [...] and [...] "infer" [...] can be used interchangeably. Wolfe generally abhors slang (though in [...] "Murder Is Corny" [...] he says [...] "There is good slang and bad slang") and expects Archie to avoid slang and other language he disapproves of when speaking to him. However, as with other worldly concerns, he sometimes relies on Archie's greater familiarity with slang when business demands it.|$|E
