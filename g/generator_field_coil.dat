40|$|Testing, {{results and}} {{analysis}} of a Bi- 2223 model superconducting generator coil produced under the DOE Superconductivity Partnership Initiative are presented. The test arrangement enables coil energization with dc and transient currents over a range of operating temperatures to explore coil performance under conditions analogous to those that would be experienced by a superconducting <b>generator</b> <b>field</b> <b>coil.</b> Analytical calculations of coil ac and ohmic losses and temperature rise compare well with experimental measurements. Good performance is predicted for a typical 3 -phase fault condition. Coil steady state and transient performance can be predicted with confidence for full scale superconductor application...|$|E
5000|$|The {{steam engine}} drove {{directly}} a direct current dynamo, rated at approximately 500 kW (1200A @ 400V); {{it was a}} six pole machine with the armature constructed on the Gramme dynamo principle with six brushes. The <b>generator's</b> <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> were energised by a separate bipolar dynamo capable of generating 100A at 100V (...) , which was directly driven at approximately 300rpm by a 20 CV two cylinder vertical compound steam engine of similar design to the main engine. This secondary generator's output was also used to provide a supply for electric lighting in carriages.|$|R
50|$|The {{stepping}} stone {{between these two}} major types was the consequent-pole bipolar <b>generator,</b> with two <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> arranged in a ring around the stator.|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>generators</b> with <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are self-excited, {{where some}} of the power output from the rotor is used to power the <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> The rotor iron retains a {{magnetism}} when the generator is turned off. The generator is started with no load connected; the initial weak field creates a weak voltage in the stator coils, which in turn increases the field current, until the machine [...] "builds up" [...] to full voltage.|$|R
50|$|To {{provide a}} black start, some power {{stations}} have small diesel generators, normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), {{which can be}} used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the <b>generator</b> <b>field</b> <b>coils),</b> and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.|$|R
50|$|Other {{figures of}} merit of the system are the {{electric}} power, mass and volume of the required magnetic <b>field</b> <b>generator</b> (magnetic <b>coils</b> and/or permanent magnets). A low electric power consumption, mass and volume are desirable for space propulsion applications.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of the}} electromagnetic force to the changes in electrical current in the <b>coil</b> of electromagnetic <b>field</b> <b>generator.</b> Specimen used is an electromagnetic force generator prototype which is composed of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>generator</b> and force <b>generator.</b> Magnetic <b>field</b> <b>generator</b> <b>coil</b> made of 1 mm diameter of copper wire is wrapped around the core of steel ST 37 and has rectangular cross-sectional shape. Force generator is made of isolated copper conductors 2, 6 mm in diameter which placed on steel discs. Characterization of the prototype is done by measuring the weight of the prototype while electric current in the electromagnetic <b>field</b> <b>generator</b> changed. The measurement results indicate that the resulting electromagnetic force is zero. Based on the analysis it is known that the failure is caused by incorrectly design of the geometry of force-producing element. Keywords: electric current, magnetic flux, electromagnetic forc...|$|R
50|$|Flexible {{plate is}} used in {{electric}} motor and <b>generator</b> armatures, <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> insulation, and magnet and commutator core insulation. Mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. Heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears {{at the same rate}} as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).|$|R
40|$|The NASA Space Environment Simulation Laboratory (SESL) {{features}} a chamber for studying specific space plasma physics phenomena. The test chamber, an upright domed cylinder having a 17 m diam and a 27 m height for an inner working volume, {{is lined with}} magnetic <b>field</b> <b>generator</b> <b>coils.</b> The chamber pressure is nominally 1 / 1, 000, 000 th torr. Equipment positioning is carried out by remote control from outside guided by a closed circuit television system. Plasma is generated in the chamber {{by means of a}} 30 cm Kaufman thruster which produces ion densities of 100, 000 - 1, 000, 000 /cu cm. The ion bulk flow energy is in the range of 20 - 50 eV and a charge exchange with the ambient gas produces a cold isotropic ion component. Langmuir probes provide measurements of the electron temperature and density, and the composition and pressure are monitored by mass spectrometry and ion gages. Experiments have been performed on electron beam-plasma interactions, VLF antenna impedance measurements, and high voltage plasma sheaths which may be encountered by spacecraft...|$|R
25|$|Two {{antennae}} and two <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are used, both arranged {{at right}} angles to each other. The area between the two <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> is filled with an analog of the original signal from the antennae. The sense coil, another loop antenna, is placed in the area between the <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> Rotating the sense <b>coil</b> in the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> has the same output as rotating the entire loop antenna in the original field.|$|R
50|$|For {{a machine}} using <b>field</b> <b>coils,</b> {{which is most}} large <b>generators,</b> the <b>field</b> current must be supplied, {{otherwise}} the generator will be useless. Thus {{it is important to}} have a reliable supply. Although the output of a generator can be used once it starts up, it is also critical to be able to start the generators reliably. In any case, it is important to be able to control the field since this will maintain the system voltage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> is {{the primary}} {{component}} of the rotor assembly that provides the rotating magnetic field for the pulse power alternator. The design of the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> is optimized {{so that it will}} produce the required magnetic field with minimum transient losses. The high currents required to produce the correct amp-turns, along with the mechanical loads due to high rotational speeds, present further design requirements for selection of <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> material, insulation, and surrounding material that completes the matrix of the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> sub-assembly. With the addition of active cooling requirements in the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> design, surrounding materials must be selected that retain electrically insulative properties and are thermally conductive to allow sufficient heat removal from the <b>field</b> <b>coil.</b> Thermoplastics are now being reviewed to replace traditional glass-epoxy potting compounds (thermosets) that have been used extensively in pulsed alternator designs. Fillers can be added to tailor properties of the thermoplastic, such as ceramics to increase thermal conductivity at the cost of an increase in density. Thermal analyses have been performed that show the benefits of using thermally conductive potting compounds. In addition, subscale <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> mock-ups (motorettes) have been encapsulated and tested to demonstrate encapsulation of current <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> geometries. I...|$|R
50|$|The field may be {{supplied}} by either permanent magnets or by <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> Regulation of the output voltage {{is achieved by}} controlling the current through a winding, either the <b>field</b> <b>coil,</b> or a control winding around a permanent magnet.|$|R
25|$|This is {{an older}} type of {{regulator}} {{used in the}} 1920s that uses the principle of a fixed-position <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> and a second <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> that can be rotated on an axis in parallel with the fixed coil, similar to a variocoupler.|$|R
40|$|A coil {{system for}} a {{plasmoid}} thruster includes a bias coil, a drive <b>coil</b> and <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> The bias and drive coils are interleaved with one another as they are helically wound about a conical region. A first <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> defines a first passage {{at one end of}} the conical region, and is connected in series with the bias <b>coil.</b> A second <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> defines a second passage at an opposing end of the conical region, and is connected in series with the bias coil...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a series}} wound motor, the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are {{connected}} electrically {{in series with}} the armature coils (via the brushes). In a shunt wound motor, the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are connected in parallel, or [...] "shunted" [...] to the armature coils. In a separately excited (sepex) motor the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are supplied from an independent source, such as a motor-generator and the field current is unaffected by changes in the armature current. The sepex system was sometimes used in DC traction motors to facilitate control of wheelslip.|$|R

50|$|An AC {{alternator}} is able {{to produce}} power across multiple high-current power generation coils connected in parallel, {{eliminating the need for}} the commutator.
