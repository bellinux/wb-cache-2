5000|$|From 1992 to 1995, Goldfarb was Director of Operations at Soros' <b>International</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Foundation,</b> {{which helped}} sustain tens of {{thousands}} of scientists and scholars in the former Soviet Union during the harshest three years of economic reform. In 1994 Goldfarb managed Soros' Russian Internet Project, which built infrastructure and provided free Internet access for university campuses across Russia. That project created a controversy because of a conflict with emerging Russian commercial interests in the ISP field. In 1995, during the first months of the First Chechen War, Goldfarb oversaw a Soros-funded relief operation, which ended disastrously with the disappearance of the American relief worker Fred Cuny. From 1998 to 2000 Goldfarb directed the $15 million Soros tuberculosis project in Russia. [...] He worked with Dr. Paul Farmer to battle TB in Russian prisons, an endeavor described by the Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Kidder in his bool Mountains Beyond Mountains.|$|E

40|$|The Sixth International Conference of the African Association for Biological Nitrogen Fixation {{was held}} under the theme ‘Agronomic, {{socio-economic}} and environmental benefits of biological nitrogen fixing systems in Africa’. This book {{reports on the}} deliberations of that conference which examined the activities of microorganisms that supply ‘free’ nitrogen fertiliser {{through a process of}} biological fixation. Given the rising costs of nitrogen fertilisers, any that comes ‘free’ is worthy of serious attention. Zimbabwe uses almost 25 per cent of its electricity to manufacture the same nitrogen fertilizer that microbes can supply ‘free’ through a process of biological fixation. The importance of harnessing biological nitrogen fixation to sustain agriculture in Africa cannot be over-emphasised. The publication of this book is timely given that hunger and malnutrition are ravaging some parts of our continent, a situation accentuated by lack of affordable agricultural inputs, especially for smallholder farmers.

40|$|Held August 6 - 8, 1958, U. S. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California[A]t the {{invitation}} of Rear Admiral Earl E. Stone, USN, then Superintendent of the U. S. Naval Postgraduate Scrnol, approximately sixty leaders in industry, government, and education met in Monterey, California, October 24 - 25, 1956, for the first conference of the !SF Brainpower Forum. This conference served to highlight {{the fact that we}} had not effectively utilized all sources of scientific manpower which were presently available. At the recommendations of the Forum partici- pants, the <b>International</b> <b>Science</b> <b>Foundation</b> initiated a continuing pro- gram in the area of scientific manpower and suggested that several of its members set up projects which would provide answers to some of the problems considered at the 1956 conference. As a matter of first priority, it was decided to give consideration to the gains that might be realized by giving recognition to and seeking better utilization of retired or senior professional manpower. The 1958 conference was held to give Forum participants an opportunity to report on projects in the area of senior scientific manpower that were conducted as a result of suggestions made at the 1956 conference. Among the NPS participants: Roy S. Glasgow, Dean; Captain H. M. Heming, USN, Director, Engineering School; Frank E. LaCauza, Academic Chairman, General Line and Naval Science School; Captain Paul Foley, Jr., USN, Chief of Staff; Dr. Austin R. Frey, Chairman, Department of Physics; Mitchell L.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{observation}} of two Cabibbo-suppressed ecay modes, Xi(+) (c) -> Sigma(+) pi(-) pi(+) and Xi c+ -> Sigma(-) pi(+) pi(+). We observe 59 +/- 14 over {{a background of}} 87, and 22 +/- 8 over a background of 13 events, respectively, for the signals. The data were accumulated using the SELEX spectrometer during the 1996 - 1997 fixed target run at Fermilab, chiefly from a 600 Gev/c Sigma(-) beam. The branching ratios of the decays relative to the Cabibbo-favored Xi c+ -> Xi(-) pi(+) pi(+) are measured to be B(Xi(+) (c) -> Sigma(+) pi(-) pi(+)) /B(Xi(+) (c) -> Xi(-) pi(+) pi(+)) = 0. 48 +/- 0. 20, and B(Xi(+) (c) -> Sigma(-) pi(+) pi(+)) /B(Xi(+) (c) -> Sigma(-) pi(+) pi(+)) = 0. 18 +/- 0. 09, respectively. We also report branching ratios for the same decay modes of the Delta(+) (c) relative to Delta(+) (c) -> pK(-) pi(+.) (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Airports are {{the most}} resource-constrained {{components}} of the air transportation system. This paper addresses the problems of increased flight delays and aircraft fuel consumption through the integrated control of airport arrival and departure operations. Departure operations are modeled using a network abstraction of the airport surface. Published arrival routes to airports are synthesized to form a realistic model of arrival airspace. The proposed control framework calculates the optimal times of departure of aircraft from the gates, {{as a function of}} the arrival and departure traffic as well as airport characteristics such as taxiway layout and gate capacity. The integrated control formulation is solved using dynamic programming, which allows calculation of policies for real-time implementation.
