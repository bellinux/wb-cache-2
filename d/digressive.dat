25|$|Soon {{after it}} was released, the book was panned by critics. One of the {{frequently}} mentioned problems with the book was that it lacked the extensive editing that his previous article about Shelley had been given. Critics viewed his larger work as often <b>digressive</b> and full of tangents, and some lamented the significant amount of space that Hogg devoted to describing the meals that they ate together. Others {{pointed out that the}} book did not contain the novel insights about Shelley and his poetry that Shelley at Oxford had delivered. Shelley's family was surprised to read the depictions of the young Percy Shelley and some of the accounts greatly upset them.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the letter being {{addressed}} directly to D'Alembert, it is undoubtedly meant {{to have an effect}} on the general population. The work is famous for displaying Rousseau's charismatic rhetoric and <b>digressive</b> tendencies, all with his personal experience woven into the text. It may be considered to portray Rousseau's vanity, narcissism and biases, but the text could also be thought of more positively; as expressive, lyrical and austere. The Letter shows Rousseau's tendency to think of the events in his own life as highly significant, as reflections of the larger social picture. An example is how the Letter itself is open and expressive in style, while the content of the Letter is about this openness.|$|E
500|$|This [...] "new way" [...] {{of telling}} a story in Finnegans Wake {{takes the form of}} a {{discontinuous}} dream-narrative, with abrupt changes to characters, character names, locations and plot details resulting in the absence of a discernible linear narrative, causing Herring to argue that the plot of Finnegans Wake [...] "is unstable in that there is no one plot from beginning to end, but rather many recognizable stories and plot types with familiar and unfamiliar twists, told from varying perspectives." [...] Patrick A. McCarthy expands on this idea of a non-linear, <b>digressive</b> narrative with the contention that [...] "throughout much of Finnegans Wake, what appears to be an attempt to tell a story is often diverted, interrupted, or reshaped into something else, for example a commentary on a narrative with conflicting or unverifiable details." [...] In other words, while crucial plot points – such as HCE's crime or ALP's letter – are endlessly discussed, the reader never encounters or experiences them first hand, and as the details are constantly changing, they remain unknown and perhaps unknowable. Suzette Henke has accordingly described Finnegans Wake as an aporia. Joyce himself tacitly acknowledged this radically different approach to language and plot in a 1926 letter to Harriet Weaver, outlining his intentions for the book: [...] "One great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot." [...] Critics have seen a precedent for the book's plot presentation in Laurence Sterne's famously <b>digressive</b> The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, with Thomas Keymer stating that [...] "Tristram Shandy was a natural touchstone for James Joyce as he explained his attempt [...] "to build many planes of narrative with a single esthetic purpose" [...] in Finnegans Wake".|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Clarendon Press {{published}} Gasper's work The Dragon and the Dove: The Plays of Thomas Dekker.

John Harmon of Syracuse University reviewed Gasper's book for the English Studies journal, describing it as [...] "crisply researched" [...] and [...] "eminently readable" [...] although thought that she argued [...] "somewhat defensively" [...] that scholars should take Dekker's work more seriously. Reviewing the book for The Review of English Studies, T. H. Howard-Hill of the University of South Carolina noted that despite the work's title, it did not examine all of Dekker's 26 plays but only a selection of them. While noting that the work was [...] "thoroughly researched, well documented, and densely written", Hill also opined that it was [...] "disjointed, <b>digressive,</b> repetitive, and rambling" [...] and felt {{that it did not}} [...] "convincingly illustrate Decker's militant Protestant orientation" [...] in some of the plays that she had discussed.|$|E

2500|$|New York Times {{film critic}} Stephen Holden gave the comedy drama a mixed review, writing, [...] "Although {{there is much}} to like in this psychologically canny film and in Mr. Darin's warm-hearted central performance, the movie is also {{rambling}} and <b>digressive.</b> It is so determined to delve into every cranny of Rafael's world, from his minor business woes to his rekindled friendship with the zany childhood friend with whom he used to play games of Zorro, that it has the feel of an unedited personal journal." ...|$|E

For the period, part of the attraction of the dialogued short story and the frame tale (with its fictional speakers discussing each other's stories) lies in their [...] "performability" [...] by someone reading out loud to a non-literate public and in their grab-bag and (frequently) <b>digressive</b> structure: these tales are capable of taking on all kinds of material, both sophisticated and vulgar.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is written}} {{from the point}} of view of Pierce, a man who has not met with good fortune, who now bitterly {{complains}} of the world’s wickedness, and addresses his complaints to the devil. [...] At times the identity of Pierce seems to conflate with Nashe's own. [...] But Nashe also portrays Pierce as something of an arrogant and prodigal fool. [...] The story is told in a style that is complex, witty, fulminating, extemporaneous, <b>digressive,</b> anecdotal, filled with wicked descriptions, and peppered with newly minted words and Latin phrases. [...] The satire can be mocking and bitingly sharp, and at times Nashe’s style seems to relish its own obscurity.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{according}} to Ornea, the post-Junimist group, alongside Mihail Sebastian and Octav Şuluţiu, {{was also the}} leading school of interwar critics, without whom [...] "interwar literature {{would be hard to}} imagine." [...] Literary historian Sami Damian sees Cioculescu and several of the others among the [...] "eminent" [...] group of authors directly influenced by the older Lovinescu, opting to [...] "apply a program of aesthetic independence". Similarly, critic and historian Mircea Iorgulescu discussed Cioculescu as a member of Lovinescu's [...] "first posterity". Şerban Cioculescu's own literary style was judged by Alex. Ştefănescu to represent a peak of the interwar tradition, and a link with classical mindset, characterized by calm and erudition, as well as by [...] "the [...] individualism of an urban dweller with a sense of humor". He found its [...] "pedantic and <b>digressive</b> style" [...] similar to that of 19th-century writer Alexandru Odobescu, author of the complex essay Pseudo-cynegetikos, but noted that Cioculescu matched Odobescu's [...] "reverie" [...] with [...] "malicious soberness." [...] In a 1989 essay, literary reviewer Ion Simuţ spoke about [...] "the ironic style" [...] of articles and studies authored by Cioculescu, as well as by his colleagues Călinescu and Cornel Regman, and identified by him as inspired by the comediography of Ion Luca Caragiale. However, Cioculescu did not relate to criticism as an integral aspect of literature, believing that it lacked a creative dimension, and warned against the danger posed by subjectivity.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{critical}} {{essay on the}} novel, Vivienne Muller quotes some praise by experts on disability theory: [...] "In its presentation of Christopher's everyday experiences of the society in which he lives, the narrative offers a rich canvas of experiences for an ethnographic study of this particular cognitive condition, and one which places a positive spin on the syndrome. The reader in this instance acts as ethnographer, invited to see what Mark Osteen claims is a 'quality in autistic lives that is valuable in and of itself' (cited in [...] Adams 2005, p.1). Along similar lines, [...] McClimens writes that Haddon's novel is 'an ethnographic delight' and that 'Haddon's achievement is to have written a novel that turns on the central character's difference without making that difference a stigmatising characteristic' (2005, p.24)." [...] Muller adds that the novel [...] "works with {{a strong sense of}} the disabled speaking subject, drawing readers into Christopher's cognitive/corporeal space through an incremental layering of his perspectives and reactions... The narrative also bristles with diagrams, maps, drawings, stories, texts that inform Christopher's lexicon for mapping meaning in a world of bewildering signs and sounds." [...] She also admires such elements as [...] "the <b>digressive</b> stream-of-connectedness-and-disconnectedness way in which Christopher writes and thinks; the obsessive focus on minutiae; his musings about why animals behave the way they do; his quasi philosophizing on death and life and the afterlife; his ambition to be an astronaut..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 9. You {{must bear}} in mind, {{in order to}} do justice to Rabelais and Sterne, that by right of humoristic {{universality}} each part is essentially a whole in itself.

6000|$|Like the <b>digressive</b> poet Ariosto, I {{find myself}} under the {{necessity}} of connecting the branches of my story, by taking up the adventures of another of the characters, and bringing {{them down to the}} point at which we have left those of Jeanie Deans. It is not, perhaps, the most artificial way of telling a story, but it has the advantage of sparing {{the necessity of}} resuming what a knitter (if stocking-looms have left such a person in the land) might call our [...] "dropped stitches;" [...] a labour in which the author generally toils much, without getting credit for his pains.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Direck {{became aware}} of a tall, {{drooping}} man with long hair and long <b>digressive</b> legs in still longer white flannel trousers, and a face that was somehow familiar.

It was Raeburn, Raeburn the insidious, Raeburn the completest product of the party system.... Well, that was the English way. [...] "Come for the pick up!"

6000|$|One {{who reads}} a typical {{collection}} of Lowell's essays {{is apt to}} be divided between open admiration and something akin to resentment. On the one hand they are brilliant, stimulating, filled with [...] "good things"; on the other they are always <b>digressive,</b> sometimes fantastic and too often self-conscious; that is, they call {{our attention to the}} author rather than to his proper subject. When he writes of Dante he is concerned to reveal the soul of the Italian master; but when he writes of Milton he seems chiefly intent on showing how much more he knows than the English editor of Milton's works. When he presents Emerson he tries to make us know and admire the Concord sage; but when he falls foul of Emerson's friends, Thoreau and Carlyle, his personal prejudices are more in evidence than his impersonal judgment. In consequence, some of the literary essays are a better reflection of Lowell himself than of the men he wrote about.|$|E
60|$|One other remark upon Scott before I pass on {{from that}} line of green volumes which has made me so <b>digressive</b> and so garrulous. No account of his {{character}} is complete which does not deal with the strange, secretive vein which ran through his nature. Not only did he stretch the truth on many occasions in order to conceal {{the fact that he}} was the author of the famous novels, but even intimate friends who met him day by day were not aware that he was the man about whom the whole of Europe was talking. Even his wife was ignorant of his pecuniary liabilities until the crash of the Ballantyne firm told her for the first time that they were sharers in the ruin. A psychologist might trace this strange twist of his mind in the numerous elfish Fenella-like characters who flit about and keep their irritating secret through the long chapters of so many of his novels.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{suddenly}} {{occurred to him}} that the murderer had already been shot by Redhand, so that his mission was one of simple revenge; but, a moment after, it flashed across his troubled mind that Lincoln had been left in the fort wounded--might possibly be dead by that time; so that there were probably among the flying savages other murderers to be dealt with. This idea was strengthened by another thought, namely, that the savage who stabbed and scalped Dupont might not have been the savage who shot him. The complication and aggregate of improbability amounted, in Bertram's mind, so nearly to a certainty, that he dismissed the <b>digressive</b> question as to whether there might or might not be a murderer among the Indians, and returned to the original proposition, as to whether it was right in him {{to take part in a}} pursuit of vengeance that would very likely terminate murderously. But before he could come to any satisfactory conclusion on that point he and Bounce found themselves suddenly in the midst of the cavalcade, which had halted on the summit of the ridge, in order to allow them to come up.|$|E
6000|$|The {{issue of}} these reconsiderings was the conviction, {{that all he}} could now {{reasonably}} anticipate from Isabel, in further disclosure {{on the subject of}} her life, were some few additional particulars bringing it down to the present moment; and, also, possibly filling out the latter portion of what she had already revealed to him. Nor here, could he persuade himself, that she would have much to say. Isabel had not been so <b>digressive</b> and withholding as he had thought. What more, indeed, could she now have to impart, except by what strange means she had at last come to find her brother out; and the dreary recital of how she had pecuniarily wrestled with her destitute condition; how she had come to leave one place of toiling refuge for another, till now he found her in humble servitude at farmer Ulver's? Is it possible then, thought Pierre, that there lives a human creature in this common world of everydays, whose whole history may be told in little less than two-score words, and yet embody in that smallness a fathomless fountain of ever-welling mystery? Is it possible, after all, that spite of bricks and shaven faces, this world we live in is brimmed with wonders, and I and all mankind, beneath our garbs of common-placeness, conceal enigmas that the stars themselves, and perhaps the highest seraphim can not resolve? ...|$|E
6000|$|His present phase, as a daguerreotypist, {{was of no}} more {{importance}} in his own view, nor {{likely to be more}} permanent, than any of the preceding ones. It had been taken up with the careless alacrity of an adventurer, who had his bread to earn. It would be thrown aside as carelessly, whenever he should choose to earn his bread by some other equally <b>digressive</b> means. But what was most remarkable, and, perhaps, showed a more than common poise in the young man, was the fact that, amid all these personal vicissitudes, he had never lost his identity. Homeless as he had been,--continually changing his whereabout, and, therefore, responsible neither to public opinion nor to individuals,--putting off one exterior, and snatching up another, to be soon shifted for a third,--he had never violated the innermost man, but had carried his conscience along with him. It was impossible to know Holgrave without recognizing this to be the fact. [...] Hepzibah had seen it. Phoebe soon saw it likewise, and gave him the sort of confidence which such a certainty inspires. She was startled, however, and sometimes repelled,--not by any doubt of his integrity to whatever law he acknowledged, but by a sense that his law differed from her own. He made her uneasy, and seemed to unsettle everything around her, by his lack of reverence for what was fixed, unless, at a moment's warning, it could establish its right to hold its ground.|$|E
6000|$|Another poem {{belonging}} to the same group (published under the general title of Men and Women) is [...] "Saul," [...] which finely illustrates the method that makes Browning different from other poets. He would select some familiar event, the brief record of which is preserved in history, and say, [...] "Here we see merely the deed, the outward act or circumstance of life: now let us get acquainted with these men or women by showing that they thought and felt precisely as we do under similar conditions." [...] In [...] "Saul" [...] he reproduces the scene recorded in the sixteenth chapter of the first Book of Samuel, where the king is [...] "troubled by an evil spirit" [...] and the young David comes to play the harp before him. Saul is represented as the disillusioned, the despairing man who has lost all interest in life, and David {{as the embodiment of}} youthful enthusiasm. The poem is a remarkable portrayal of the ancient scene and characters; but it is something greater than that; it is a splendid song of the fullness and joy of a brave, forward-looking life inspired by noble ideals. It {{is also one of the}} best answers ever given to the question, Is life worth living? The length of the poem, however, and its many difficult or <b>digressive</b> passages are apt to repel the beginner unless he have the advantage of an abridged version.|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} of the number, the character, {{and the length of}} the Notes, which a wise editor should append to the works of a great poet, (or to any classic), is perhaps still 'sub judice'. My own opinion is that, in all editorial work, the notes should be illustrative rather than critical; and that they should only bring out those points, which the ordinary reader of the text would not readily understand, if the poems were not annotated. For this reason, topographical, historical, and antiquarian notes are almost essential. The Notes which Wordsworth himself wrote to his Poems, are of unequal length and merit. It was perhaps necessary for him to write--at all events it is easy to understand, and to sympathise with, his writing--the long note on the revered parson of the Duddon Valley, the Rev. Robert Walker, who will be remembered for many generations as the [...] "Wonderful Walker." [...] The Poet's editors have also been occasionally led to add <b>digressive</b> notes, to clear up points which had been left by himself either dubious, or obscure. I must plead guilty to the charge of doing so: e.g. the identification of [...] "The Muccawiss" [...] (see 'The Excursion', book iii. l. 953) with the Whip-poor-Will involved a great deal of laborious correspondence years ago. It was a {{question of}} real difficulty; and, although the result reached could now be put into two or three lines, I have thought it desirable that the opinions of those who wrote about it, and helped toward the solution, should be recorded. What I print is {{only a small part of}} the correspondence that took place.|$|E

6000|$|Dante was a mystic {{with a very}} {{practical}} turn of mind. A Platonist by nature, an Aristotelian by training, his feet keep closely to the narrow path of dialectics, because he believed it the safest, while his eyes are fixed on the stars and his brain is busy with things not demonstrable, save by that grace of God which passeth all understanding, nor capable of being told unless by far off hints and adumbrations. Though he himself has directly explained the scope, the method, and the larger meaning of his greatest work,[74] though he has indirectly pointed out the way to its interpretation in the Convito, and though everything he wrote is but an explanatory comment on his own character and opinions, unmistakably clear and precise, yet both man and poem continue not only to be misunderstood popularly, but also by such as should know better.[75] That those who confined their studies to the Commedia should have interpreted it variously is not wonderful, for {{out of the first}} or literal meaning others open, one out of another, each of wider circuit and purer abstraction, like Dante's own heavens, giving and receiving light.[76] Indeed, Dante himself is partly to blame for this.

[...] Here are conundrums enough, to be sure! To Italians at home, for whom the great arenas of political and religious speculation were closed, the temptation to find a subtler meaning than the real one was irresistible.

6000|$|... "His 'Notes on Novelists.' It's one {{sustained}} {{demand for}} the picture effect. Which is the denial of the sweet complexity of life, of the pointing this way and that, of the spider on the throne. Philosophy aims at a unity and never gets there.... That true unity which we all suspect, and which no one attains, {{if it is to}} be got at all it is to be got by penetrating, penetrating down and through. The picture, on the other hand, is forced to a unity because it can see only one aspect at a time. I am doubtful even about that. Think of Hogarth or Carpaccio. But if the novel is to follow life it must be various and discursive. Life is diversity and entertainment, not completeness and satisfaction. All actions are half-hearted, shot delightfully with wandering thoughts--about something else. All true stories are a felt of irrelevances. But James sets out to make his novels with the presupposition that they can be made continuously relevant. And perceiving the discordant things, he tries to get rid of them. He sets himself to pick the straws out of the hair of Life before he paints her. But without the straws she is no longer the mad woman we love. He talks of 'selection,' and of making all of a novel definitely about a theme. He objects to a 'saturation' that isn't oriented. And he objects, if you go into it, for no clear reason at all. Following up his conception of selection, see what in his own practice he omits. In practice James's selection becomes just omission and nothing more. He omits everything that demands <b>digressive</b> treatment or collateral statement. For example, he omits opinions. In all his novels you will find no people with defined political opinions, no people with religious opinions, none with clear partisanships or with lusts or whims, none definitely up to any specific impersonal thing. There are no poor people dominated by the imperatives of Saturday night and Monday morning, no dreaming types--and don't we all more or less live dreaming? And none are ever decently forgetful. All that much of humanity he clears out before he begins his story. It's like cleaning rabbits for the table.|$|E
60|$|About noon of an ashen autumn day {{some years}} ago I was {{standing}} outside the station at Oxford intending to take the train to London. And for some reason, out of idleness or the emptiness of my mind or the emptiness of the pale grey sky, or the cold, a kind of caprice fell upon me that I would not go by that train at all, but would step {{out on the road}} and walk at least some part of the way to London. I do not know if other people are made like me in this matter; but to me it is always dreary weather, what may be called useless weather, that slings into life a sense of action and romance. On bright blue days I do not want anything to happen; the world is complete and beautiful, a thing for contemplation. I no more ask for adventures under that turquoise dome than I ask for adventures in church. But when the background of man's life is a grey background, then, in the name of man's sacred supremacy, I desire to paint on it in fire and gore. When the heavens fail man refuses to fail; when the sky seems to have written on it, in letters of lead and pale silver, the decree that nothing shall happen, then the immortal soul, the prince of the creatures, rises up and decrees that something shall happen, if it be only the slaughter of a policeman. But this is a <b>digressive</b> way of stating what I have said already--that the bleak sky awoke in me a hunger for some change of plans, that the monotonous weather seemed to render unbearable the use of the monotonous train, and that I set out into the country lanes, out of the town of Oxford. It was, perhaps, at that moment that a strange curse came upon me out {{of the city and the}} sky, whereby it was decreed that years afterwards I should, in an article in the DAILY NEWS, talk about Sir George Trevelyan in connection with Oxford, when I knew perfectly well that he went to Cambridge.|$|E

6000|$|The victory {{gained by}} the Duke of York over the Dutch fleet on the 3d of June 1665, and his Duchess's {{subsequent}} {{journey into the}} north, furnished Dryden with {{the subject of a}} few occasional verses; in which the style of Waller (who came forth with a poem on the same subject) is successfully imitated. In addressing her grace, the poet suppresses all the horrors of the battle, and turns her eyes upon the splendour of a victory, for which the kingdom was indebted to her husband's valour, and her [...] "chaste vows." [...] In these verses, not the least vestige of metaphysical wit can be traced; and they were accordingly censured, as wanting height of fancy, and dignity of words. This criticism Dryden refuted, by alleging, that he had succeeded in what he did attempt, in the softness of expression and smoothness of the measure (the appropriate ornaments of an address to a lady), and that he was accused of that only thing which he could well defend. It seems, however, very possible, that these remarks impelled him to undertake a task, in which vigour of fancy and expression might, with propriety, be exercised. Accordingly, his next poem was of greater length and importance. This is a historical account of the events of the year 1666, under the title of [...] "Annus Mirabilis" [...] to which distinction the incidents which had occurred in that space gave it some title. The poem being in the elegiac stanza, Dryden relapsed into an imitation of [...] "Gondibert," [...] from which he had departed ever since the [...] "Elegy on Cromwell." [...] From this it appears, that the author's admiration of Davenant had not decreased. Indeed, he, long afterwards, bore testimony to that author's quick and piercing imagination; which at once produced thoughts remote, new, and surprising, such as could not easily enter into any other fancy. Dryden at least equalled Davenant in this quality; and certainly excelled him in the powers of composition, which are to embody the conceptions of the imagination; and in the extent of acquired knowledge, by which they were to be enforced and illustrated. In his preface, he has vindicated the choice of his stanza, by a reference to the opinion of Davenant,[47] which he sanctions by affirming, that he had always himself thought quatrains, or stanzas of verse in alternate rhyme, more noble, and of greater dignity, both for sound and number, than any other verse in use among us. By this attention to sound and rhythm, he improved upon the school of metaphysical poets, which disclaimed attention to either; but in the thought and expression itself, the style of Davenant more nearly resembled Cowley's, than that of Denham and Waller. The same ardour for what Dryden calls [...] "wit-writing," [...] the same unceasing exercise of the memory, in search of wonderful thoughts and allusions, and the same contempt for the subject, except as the medium of displaying the author's learning and ingenuity, marks the style of Davenant, though in a less degree than that of the metaphysical poets, and though chequered with many examples of a simpler and chaster character. Some part of this deviation was, perhaps, owing {{to the nature of the}} stanza; for the structure of the quatrain prohibited the bard, who used it, from rambling into those <b>digressive</b> similes, which, in the pindaric strophe, might be pursued through endless ramifications. If the former started an extravagant thought, or a quaint image, he was compelled to bring it to a point within his four-lined stanza. The snake was thus scotched, though not killed; and conciseness being rendered indispensable, a great step was gained towards concentration of thought, which is necessary to the simple and to the sublime The manner of Davenant, therefore, though short-lived, and ungraced by public applause, was an advance towards true taste, from the unnatural and frantic indulgence of unrestrained fancy; and, did it claim no other merit, it possesses that of having been twice sanctioned by the practice of Dryden, upon occasions of uncommon solemnity.|$|E
