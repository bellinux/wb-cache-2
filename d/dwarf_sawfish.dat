5000|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> is {{protected}} in Australian waters, but {{elsewhere in the}} world, sawfishes are harvested for their meat, fins, rostrums and oil. The main threat facing the <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> is being caught as bycatch in gillnets and trawl nets. That this {{is the cause of}} declining numbers is demonstrated by the fact that populations are declining fastest in heavily fished areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this fish as [...] "endangered". There is a need for education of fishermen about safe release practices and how to manage their fisheries. However, the threats are continuing, {{and there is no reason}} to believe that the population of <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> is recovering from previous declines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> or Queensland sawfish, Pristis clavata, is a sawfish of {{the family}} Pristidae, found in {{tropical}} Australia. This endangered species {{is by far the}} smallest species in its family.|$|E
50|$|The area is home {{to three}} {{threatened}} species of plant: Cycas armstrongii, Ptychosperma macarthurii and Utricularia dunstaniae. The area {{is also home to}} eleven threatened species of animal including Australian bustard, red goshawk, northern quoll, flatback turtle and <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apart from birds, {{threatened}} animals recorded {{from the}} bay and its surrounds include northern quolls, Mertens' water monitors, argus monitors, flatback and olive ridley turtles, <b>dwarf</b> and longcomb <b>sawfish,</b> and Dodd's azure butterflies. Feral pigs and water buffaloes are present. There is an ongoing program to monitor and remove saltwater crocodiles {{from the bay}}.|$|R
50|$|Marine fauna found {{along the}} river include fish {{including}} Freshwater Sawfish, <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Sawfish,</b> Ox-eye Herring, Bony Bream, Short-tail Thryssa, several species of catfish such as Arius and Anodontiglanis dahli, Freshwater Longtom, species of Rainbowfish, Hardeyheads, species of Glassfish, species of Grunter, species of Mullet, Spotted Archerfish, species of Gudgeon, species of Goby and Baramundi.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{breeding}} habits of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish.</b> The fish are ovoviviparous with the developing embryos feeding on the yolks of their eggs. It is not known how many young can be carried at one time nor how frequently the fish can breed, but the young are about 65 cm long when they are born. Maximum longevity in this species {{is estimated to be}} forty-eight years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> is {{native to}} the western Indo-Pacific region and {{historically}} had a much wider range than it does now. Its present confirmed range is from the Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, to the northern Pilbara region of Western Australia. A recorded sighting from the Canary Islands was probably of a different species. It typically inhabits inshore waters, estuaries, tidal mudflats and sometimes the lowest reaches of rivers.|$|E
50|$|The {{smallest}} sawfish is the <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> (P. clavata), which {{grows to}} 1.4 m, {{much smaller than}} the others. The largest species seem to be the large-tooth sawfish (P. microdon), the Leichhardt's sawfish (P. perotteti), and the common sawfish (P. pristis), which can all reach about 7 m in length. One southern sawfish was recorded as weighing 2455 kg. Such massive specimens that survive long enough to approach their maximum size and age are believed to have lifespans of about 51 years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> has a torpedo-shaped {{body that}} {{resembles that of}} a shark, and grows to a length of about 320 cm. It has broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins and large, upright dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is located directly above, or slightly behind, {{the origins of the}} pelvic fins, and the caudal fin has a very small lower lobe. The snout is broad and flat and is elongated into a rostrum with around twenty pairs of rostral teeth. This fish is usually greenish-brown, or occasionally yellowish-brown, on its dorsal surface, and whitish underneath.|$|E
40|$|Studies in the Fitzroy River {{commenced}} in 2001 {{and have}} been ongoing. Strong collaboration between indigenous organisations and communities {{has resulted in a}} number of important projects being completed. Projects have resulted in fish posters of the river’s fishes in five Aboriginal languages and an increased awareness {{of the importance of the}} river to endangered species, such as Freshwater Sawfish, <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Sawfish,</b> Northern River Sharks, Barnett River Gudgeon and Greenway’s Grunter. Species distributions and habitat associations have been completed and the biology of a number of species, including Barramundi, Freshwater Sawfish, <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Sawfish,</b> Bull Sharks and Lesser Salmon Catfish, determined. The diets and trophic relationships for many of the river’s fishes have been examined. Genetic work has compared the Fitzroy River populations of Barramundi, Freshwater Sawfish and <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Sawfish</b> to those elsewhere. Tagging (conventional, acoustic and satellite) studies for Freshwater Sawfish are ongoing...|$|E
40|$|Neoheterocotyle darwinensis n. sp. is {{described}} {{from between the}} secondary gill lamellae of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis clavata Garman (Pristidae) collected {{at the mouth of}} Buffalo Creek near Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. This is only the second monocotylid species to be described from northern Australia. N. darwinensis is distinguished from the other seven valid species in the genus by the morphology of the hamuli, the dorsal haptoral accessory sclerites and the male copulatory organ. The similarities between N. darwinensis and Nonacotyle pristis Ogawa, 1991 from the gills of the freshwater sawfish Pristis microdon Latham collected in Papua New Guinea are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Fitzroy River {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{unregulated}} rivers in northern Australia and supports a diverse range of freshwater and estuarine species, including a number of endangered species, such as the Freshwater Sawfish, <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Sawfish,</b> Northern River Shark, Freshwater Whipray, Barnett River Gudgeon and Greenway’s Grunter (Morgan et al., 2004). Research of Fitzroy River fishes has highlighted that the Fitzroy River Barrage, a 2. 6 metre (m) high concrete weir structure, presents a significant barrier to the movement of fish and their migration within the river system (Morgan et al., 2005). Environs Kimberley commissioned AECOM to undertake a scoping study to investigate options to provide fish passage past the Fitzroy River Barrage...|$|E
40|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish,</b> Pristis clavata, was {{captured}} in marine waters of King Sound and estuarine waters of the Fitzroy, May and Robinson Rivers, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Observations of sexual maturity and annuli present on vertebrae suggest that the estuarine waters of at least the Fitzroy River act as a nursery for the species, where immature individuals may remain for at least 3 years. The capture of immature individuals in excess of 2, 330 mm TL during the current study in addition to Peverell's (Peverell in Environ Biol Fishes 73 : 391 - 402, 2005) record of a mature male measuring 3, 060 mm TL implies that the species may attain far greater lengths than previously reported and that the common name may not be entirely appropriate. In contrast to the sympatric freshwater sawfish Pristis microdon, the number of rostral teeth of individual P. clavata {{can not be used}} to differentiate males from females, with both sexes possessing an average of 42 rostral teeth...|$|E
40|$|New {{characters}} {{based on}} the arrangement and morphology of dermal denticles show that sawfishes {{can be divided into}} two distinctive groups. The first group, comprising the knifetooth sawfish Anoxypristis cuspidata, is characterized by tricuspid denticles variably located on both dorsal and ventral parts of the body. The second group is represented by species of the genus Pristis, showing an uniform and homogenous dermal covering of monocuspidate denticles on both dorsal and ventral sides of the body and within the buccopharyngeal cavity. Pristis is further divided into two subgroups: the first comprises species with denticles lacking any keels and furrows (the smalltooth sawfish Pristis pectinata, the green sawfish Pristis zijsron and the <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis clavata); the second comprises species with denticles presenting keels and furrows well differentiated on their anterior part (the common sawfish Pristis pristis, the largetooth sawfish Pristis perotteti and the greattooth sawfish Pristis microdon). This investigation of the dermal covering provides results which agree with studies that separate the same two species groups of Pristis on the basis of other morphological data...|$|E
40|$|Northern Australia {{has been}} {{identified}} as the last stronghold for the <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis clavata, green sawfish P. zijsron, and largetooth sawfish P. pristis, making these populations key in global conservation efforts for each species. This research assesses the levels of genetic diversity in these 3 sawfishes in Australian waters, testing for the presence of population bottlenecks using data at microsatellite loci. Levels of observed heterozygosity in each species from the west coast of Australia and the north-eastern Gulf of Carpentaria were generally high. M ratio tests suggest that assemblages of P. zijsron and P. pristis on the west coast and P. clavata and P. zijsron in the Gulf of Carpentaria may have experienced population bottlenecks. The bottlenecks are especially pronounced in P. zijsron populations and in P. clavata from the Gulf of Carpentaria. Demographic analyses, based on mtDNA data, indicate relatively recent (evolutionarily) range expansions in Pristis sawfishes in northern Australian waters, which could account for the population bottlenecks. A more recent range expansion in each of P. clavata and P. zijsron, as evidenced by more recent population divergence and more recent/higher rates of historic maternal gene flow, could account for the more pronounced bottlenecks in these species when compared to P. pristis. Given that Pristis sawfishes in Australian waters have experienced population bottlenecks, whether they be historic, contemporary or both, the preservation of remaining genetic diversity should be a high conservation priority...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{management}} of critically endangered sawfishes {{can be a}} difficult task, {{in part due to}} interspecies misidentification. Current methods for identifying sawfishes can be impractical as they are based on morphological features that are often unobservable. Further exploration is required to develop a more reliable means of identification. This study explored the utility of sawfish rostra in determining the species, size and sex of sawfishes, as rostra are commonly the only feature of a sawfish observed by fishers or present in public and private collections. A morphometric and meristic database consisting of over 1100 narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis clavata), largetooth (or freshwater) sawfish (Pristis pristis; formerly Pristis microdon) and green sawfish (Pristis zijsron) rostra from Australian waters, was statistically analysed. Identification of sawfishes was found to be possible through the use of the variables: inter-tooth spacing, standard rostrum width/standard rostrum length, standard rostrum length/total rostrum length, rostrum tip width/standard rostrum length, and/or rostral tooth count range, although the distinguishing variables were species-dependent. The relationship between standard rostrum length and total length was also observed to vary substantially between most species. Models for estimating total length from standard rostrum length are provided. This study has provided a tool {{that can be used to}} identify accurately the species and size of sawfishes by their rostra, and therefore can assist in clarifying historical and contemporary sawfish records, nomenclature and distributions. A better understanding of these issues should allow sawfish conservation strategies to become more focused, and thus more effective. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{targeted}} surveys, {{together with}} the collection of sawfish (Pristidae) rostra from the general public, have demonstrated that the Kimberley and northern Pilbara are important refuges for sawfish, with four of the world's seven species found here. These comprise all of Australia's known sawfish species, including the three species protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, i. e. Freshwater Sawfish (Pristis microdon), <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Sawfish</b> (Pristis clavata) and Green Sawfish (Pristis zijsron). The Northern River Shark (Glyphis garricki), which was only described in 2008, has only recently been discovered in the Kimberley and is listed as Endangered under the EPBC Act. These species are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List and collectively represent ~ 45 % of Australia's elasmobranchs that are listed as Vulnerable or higher under the EPBC Act. There is, however, limited information on the spatial extent of these species throughout Western Australia, particularly as most sawfish surveys have targeted only a few specific areas over a vast coastline. We therefore encouraged public participation in providing Pristis rostra, taken from the fish as curios, in order to extend the known locations of the species and relate these to life history stages based on their size. Here {{we report on the}} published records and our unpublished catches (n = 376) across three Pristis spp., and collate this with data from donated rostra, 73 % (n = 283) of which were considered usable, in that catch locations were reliable and they were from Western Australian waters. We provide information on sawfish distributions in Western Australia and identify areas that are important as pupping grounds, nursery areas or harbour mature individuals. We also collate known records of G. garricki and provide information on the ecology of this and the EPBC listed sawfish species...|$|E
40|$|The {{distributions}} of Glyphis and sawfishes are poorly known around {{most of the}} coast of the Northern Territory (NT). Previous studies have only found Glyphis in a few of the freshwater habitats around northern Australia and as such have been considered extremely rare. Our study has expanded what is known of the distribution of Glyphis and shown that these species may be more abundant than previously thought. Three species of sawfish (narrow, green and <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish)</b> were also found across large areas of the Northern Territory. The distribution of freshwater sawfish remains poorly understood. The analysis of different catch records from NT Fisheries and survey data indicate that a standard reporting and logbook scheme should be adopted by NT Fisheries that interact with these Threatened, Endangered and Protected (TEP) species. Of these, the NT Offshore Net and Line (NTONL) fishery provides the greatest level of detail in logbooks (catch and TEP reporting) and allows for species-specific estimates of catch. In addition, observer coverage is essential to verify catch records and collect biological information for these data-deficient species. We suggest that the reporting requirements for this fishery be adopted for all commercial fisheries in the Northern Territory. Local-scale information from catch records of TEP species and observer programmes has added to our knowledge of distributions identified from TEP catch and observer data. Furthermore, the presence of Glyphis garricki in the Daly River has been confirmed by our independent surveys. Spatial and temporal patterns in abundance of these species, however, are still unclear. The NT Barramundi Fishery (NTBarr) has the greatest interactions with these species: they represent about 12 % of the elasmobranch bycatch compared to only ~ 0. 2 % of the total shark catch of the NTONL fishery. This may represent a greater local abundance of these globally threatened species inshore, especially compared to other Glyphis and sawfishes populations in the region, but the biological consequence of this interaction is unclear and requires further investigation.

40|$|The {{coastal waters}} of the {{northern}} Pilbara and the western Kimberley are a global hotspot for sawfish (Pristidae) diversity, with four of the world’s seven 1 species found there; these four species comprise all of the known Australian species. This unique group of rays is readily identified {{by the presence of}} a blade like snout possessing enlarged tooth like denticles known as rostral teeth (Last and Stevens 2009). Globally, almost all sawfishes have undergone major declines in both range and abundance, {{largely as a result of}} their vulnerability to entanglement in fishing nets, but also through loss of habitat. It is only recently that information on the distribution, ecology, biology, population demographics and genetics and habitat utilization of the Australian sawfish fauna has started to become available, with much of this information restricted to grey literature or as unpublished work in progress. There is limited (or no) information on the size of the remaining populations, but many of the world’s sawfish populations are thought to survive in small fragmented areas (e. g. Simpfendorfer 2000). The four Australian species are from two genera, and are typically found throughout northern Australia, but accurate distributional descriptions are hindered by a lack of targeted surveying and are based on: limited surveys, from anecdotal reports or from collections of dried rostra. However, the Pilbara coast and west Kimberley are known to represent an important area for the four species, namely Freshwater Sawfish (Pristis microdon), <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Sawfish</b> (Pristis clavata), Green Sawfish (Pristis zijsron) and the Narrow Sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata). The first three of these species are listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and these form the basis of this review; although all are protected species within Western Australia under the Fish Resource Management Act 1994 (FRMA Act). Pristis zijsron was also listed under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 in Western Australia in 2006. Woodside Energy Ltd contracted the Centre for Fish & Fisheries Research (Murdoch University) to provide an overview of the current knowledge of the three EPBC Act listed pristids (P. microdon, P. clavata and P. zijsron) and also the Endangered (EPBC Act) Northern River Shark (Glyphis garricki) in Western Australian waters. Glyphis garricki was discovered in Western Australia in 2002 (Thorburn and Morgan 2004) and its formal description is recent (Compagno et al. 2008). Collectively, these species represent 50...|$|E
40|$|Northern Australia is {{believed}} to contain the last ‘viable’ populations of the critically endangered Freshwater Sawfish, Pristis microdon, <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Sawfish,</b> Pristis clavata, and Green Sawfish, Pristis zijsron, making these populations of global significance. Mitochondrial and microsatellite markers were used to investigate the population structure, levels of genetic diversity, and evolutionary history {{of each of these}} species in northern Australian waters. Pristis microdon, which utilizes freshwater rivers as juveniles and marine waters as adults, has high levels of mtDNA heterogeneity and no nDNA heterogeneity; indicating that this species has female philopatry coupled with male-biased dispersal in northern Australian waters. The conservation plans for this species should, therefore, place a high priority on the protection of females, pupping grounds, and nursery areas to minimize the risk of extirpation. Conservation plans also need to consider the likelihood that a decline in the abundance of this species in one location could have an effect on its abundance and genetic ‘health’ in other locations via male gene flow. In contrast, P. clavata and P. zijsron, which spend their entire lives in marine and/or estuarine waters, each have heterogeneity in the mtDNA and nDNA markers, suggesting that gene flow in both males and females is restricted at large spatial scales in northern Australian waters. Consequently, the risk of extirpation for each of these species is relatively high since a decline in abundance is unlikely to be replenished by immigration from other locations. Therefore, conservation plans for P. clavata and P. zijsron should place a high priority on the protection of males and females, as well as pupping grounds and nursery areas. Most of the assemblages of each of the Pristis species contained moderate and high levels of diversity in mtDNA and nDNA markers, respectively. This suggests that the prognosis for the short and medium-term survival of each of these species in Australian waters is relatively good, providing that measures are put in place to curb any further declines in abundance. However, the levels of mtDNA diversity in the assemblage of each of P. clavata and P. zijsron in the Gulf of Carpentaria were reduced and, therefore, these assemblages may warrant special conservation status. Finally, the evolutionary histories of the Pristis species in Australian waters have most likely {{played an important role in}} shaping the observed patterns of population structure and levels of genetic diversity, however, the relative influence of contemporary versus historic factors on the amount and distribution of genetic variation in each of these species remains somewhat unresolved...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{extirpation}} {{of a number of}} elasmobranch species commonly encountered in fresh and estuarine waters elsewhere in the world, 39 river systems were sampled throughout northern Australia to determine the species present. A total of 502 elasmobranchs representing 36 species, in addition to 1531 teleosts representing 46 species, were captured. In regard to elasmobranch species known to frequent riverine habitats, the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas was captured in the highest number, followed by the freshwater sawfish Pristis microdon, the freshwater whipray Himantura chaophraya and the <b>dwarf</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis clavata. Although these species were generally captured in low numbers, all were widely distributed throughout the region. Furthermore, the waters of King Sound, Western Australia, and the rivers entering it, i. e. the Fitzroy, May and Robinson rivers, were found to contain far higher numbers of P. microdon and P. clavata {{than any of the other}} rivers sampled, as well as the northern river shark Glyphis sp. C, and which subsequently provided an ideal locality to study the biology of these species. The Fitzroy River was shown to act as a nursery for P. microdon and P. clavata, where immature individuals remain for a maximum of four or five years before migrating to marine waters. Investigations of the rostra and rostral tooth morphology of P. microdon indicated their usefulness as a diagnostic tool in differentiating this species from other members of the genus, including P. clavata, and for differentiating between the sexes, i. e. female P. microdon generally possess 17 - 21 teeth cf. 19 - 23 teeth in males. However, no significant difference in the number of rostral teeth was found between female and male P. clavata, with both sexes possessing an average of 42. Furthermore, the facts that P. clavata was captured up to 2332 mm in total length and all of the individuals were immature, indicates that the description of this species as a 'dwarf' sawfish is erroneous. The use of rivers of northern Australia as nurseries was also apparent for C. leucas, with none of the 111 individuals dissected (ranging in length from 681 to 1365 mm TL) being mature. Furthermore, this species appeared to remain within the rivers for approximately four years. Stomach content analysis and field observations confirmed an opportunistic, and often aggressive, feeding nature, and thus the species may pose some risk to bathers utilising inland waters far upstream (i. e. over 300 km). Morphometrics and radiographs of 10 Glyphis sp. C captured from the macrotidal waters of King Sound (the first capture of this species in Western Australia) indicated that these specimens possessed both a wider range in total vertebral count (i. e. 140 - 151 cf. 147 - 148) and number of diplospondylous caudal centra (i. e. 64 - 70 cf. 65 - 68) than that previously reported and lent support for its synonymisation with Glyphis gangeticus. Radiographs also revealed the spinal deformation and fusing of vertebrae in three of the ten individuals, which may be attributable to a genetic abnormality indicative of inbreeding within a small gene pool. Analyses of stomach content and stable carbon ([delta] 13 C) and nitrogen ([delta] 15 N) isotope ratios of fishes occurring in the Fitzroy River indicated that the diets of a majority of the species present are broad, and greatly influenced by the seasonal availability of different prey types. While stomach content analysis suggested that aquatic insects, and to a lesser extent filamentous algae, represent vitally important food sources for many of the species present, stable isotope analysis strongly suggested that this latter food source may not be an important direct energy source, and that prey types which persist throughout the year (e. g. fish, molluscs and Macrobrachium rosenbergii) may in fact be more important sources of the energy than dietary data revealed. Dietary overlap was found to be the highest during the wet season when prey availability was high, decreased in the early dry season as fishes became more specialised in their feeding, before increasing again in the late wet when food became very limited. These analyses also supported the views that juvenile fishes may target high energy food items to attain higher growth rates and a large size rapidly, in order to achieve competitive feeding advantages and reduce the risk of predation, and that many species will maximise their energy intake in response to changes in resource availability...|$|E
