40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates predictability {{in strategic}} {{air traffic management}} {{with a focus on}} ground delay programs (GDPs). Through a survey of <b>flight</b> <b>operators,</b> we confirm the proposition that <b>flight</b> <b>operators</b> care about predictability. We then develop models that incorporate predictability into GDP cost optimization after failing in finding an existing model that can serve this purpose. This is accomplished by modifying traditional GDP delay cost functions so that they incorporate predictability, and determining the sensitivities of the optimal planned capacity recovery time and associated cost to the unpredictability premiums included in the cost functions. To do this, we develop two stochastic GDP models: a GDP no-revision, or static, model; and a GDP revision, or dynamic, model considering one GDP revision. GDP scope, which matters only in the revision model, is also considered. The optimization results from the case study show that the cost of unpredictability clearly matters, particularly in the more realistic case where GDP revision is allowed. Of the two unpredictability cost parameters, the one for unplanned delay has a stronger impact than the one for planned un-incurred delay. The insights from this analysis might eventually be used to develop a decision support tool that air traffic managers could use in determining what the planned end time should be for a GDP in a manner that reflects the importance of predictability to <b>flight</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R

With Stewart's wife's permission, he wore one of Payne's own signature outfits for {{the final round of}} the tournament on Sunday, and {{most of the rest of}} the golfers in the field wore [...] "short pants" [...] that day, as well.One year after Stewart's death, his widow Tracey and their two children, and the family of Stewart's agent, Robert Fraley, who also died on that flight, brought a lawsuit against Learjet, <b>flight</b> <b>operator</b> SunJet Aviation, Inc., and aircraft owner JetShares One Inc. They alleged that a cracked adapter resulted in an airflow valve detaching from the frame, causing a fatal loss of cabin pressure. They also claimed that the aircraft was severely out of maintenance due to negligence by SunJet. In April 2000 as part of a federal criminal investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided SunJet and seized its flight logbooks, effectively grounding all of its aircraft. The investigation was dropped in 2002, but it was too late to save SunJet; unable to legally operate, it had filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2000. The case against Learjet went forward in state court in Orlando. In June 2005, jurors found that the aircraft's manufacturer had no liability in the deaths of Stewart and Fraley and that no negligence was found in the design or manufacture of the aircraft.|$|E
30|$|The main {{difference}} between our proposed algorithm {{and the other}} hybrid Cuckoo search and Nelder–Mead algorithms {{is the way of}} applying the Nelder–Mead method. The authors in Chang et al. (2015), Jovanovic et al. (2014) have invoked the Nelder–Mead method in the cuckoo search algorithm instead of the levy <b>Flight</b> <b>operator.</b> The drawback of this idea is the computation time because the calling for NM method at each iteration in the Cuckoo search algorithm. However in our proposed algorithm we run the standard CS algorithm for some iterations then we pass the best found solution to the Nelder–Mead method to start from good Solution which help the NM method to get the global minimum of the functions in reasonable time.|$|E
40|$|Oceanic {{operations}} {{suffer from}} multiple inefficiencies, including pre-departure planning {{that does not}} adequately consider uncertainty in the proposed trajectory, restrictions on the routes that a <b>flight</b> <b>operator</b> can choose for an oceanic crossing, time-consuming processes and procedures for amending en route trajectories, and difficulties exchanging data between Flight Information Regions (FIRs). These inefficiencies cause aircraft to fly suboptimal trajectories, burning fuel and time that could be conserved. A concept to support integration of existing and emerging capabilities and concepts is needed to transition to an airspace system that employs Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) to improve efficiency and safety in oceanic operations. This paper describes such a concept {{and the results of}} preliminary activities to evaluate the concept, including a stakeholder feedback activity, user needs analysis, and high level benefits analysis...|$|E

40|$|The Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP) is a Traffic Management Initiative (TMI) {{intended}} {{to control the}} air traffic flow rates at multiple specified Flow Constrained Areas (FCAs), where demand exceeds capacity. CTOP allows <b>flight</b> <b>operators</b> to submit the desired Trajectory Options Set (TOS) for each affected flight with associated Relative Trajectory Cost (RTC) for each option. CTOP then creates a feasible schedule that complies with capacity constraints by assigning affected flights with routes and departure delays {{in such a way}} as to minimize the total cost while maintaining equity across <b>flight</b> <b>operators.</b> The current version of CTOP implements a Ration-by-Schedule (RBS) scheme, which assigns the best available options to flights based on a First-Scheduled-First-Served heuristic. In the present study, an alternative flight scheduling approach is developed based on linear optimization. Results suggest that such an approach can significantly reduce flight delays, in the deterministic case, while maintaining equity as defined using a Max-Min fairness scheme...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ration-by-schedule (RBS) has {{provided}} a widely accepted resource-rationing principle for ground delay program (GDP) planning in the U. S. Rationing of airspace resources poses significant new challenges not well-addressed by RBS. In this paper, we describe new resource rationing principles and a new methodology for use in rationing access to constrained enroute airspace. While RBS implicity assumes that all flights requesting a slot must receive one, our new methods explicitly allow some flights to be refused access, since flight operators {{have the option of}} rerouting around the constrained airspace. Unlike RBS our methodology requires and makes use of <b>flight</b> <b>operator</b> prefer-ence information and it employs randomization. Our methods have potential usefulness both in airspace flow program (AFP) planning and in the emerging System Enhancements for Versatile Electronic Negotiation (SEVEN).

40|$|International audienceThe {{malicious}} {{insider threat}} is often listed {{as one of}} the most dangerous cloud threats. The main difference for this threat between a cloud computing (CC) scenario and a traditional IT infrastructure, is that once perpetrated, it could damage other CSCs due to the multi‐tenancy and virtual environment cloud features. One of the challenges associated is that this threat domain is highly dependent on characteristics of human behavior as opposed to the more purely technical domains of network data generation. Therefore, we outline the design of synthetic data, while discussing cloud‐based indicators, socio‐technical human factors and derive a cloud scenario dataset for threat detection purposes. As a proof of concept, we test our model on an airline flight scheduling application, provided by a <b>flight</b> <b>operator,</b> together with proposing realistic threat scenarios for its future detection. The work is motivated by the complexity of the problem itself as well as by the absence of the open, realistic cloud‐based dataset...|$|E
40|$|FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 {{mandates}} UAS {{integration in}} the NAS by 2015. Operators {{must be able to}} safely maneuver UAS to maintain separation and collision avoidance. Delegated Separation is defined as the transfer of responsibility for maintaining separation between aircraft or vehicles from the air navigation service provider to the relevant <b>flight</b> <b>operator,</b> and will likely begin in sparsely trafficked areas before moving to more heavily populated airspace. As UAS operate primarily in areas with lower traffic density and perform maneuvers routinely that are currently managed through special handling, they have the advantage of becoming an early adopter of delegated separation. This experiment will examine if UAS are capable of performing delegated separation in 5 nm horizontal and 1000 ft vertical distances under two delegation conditions. In Extended Delegation, ATC are in charge of identifying problems and delegating to pilot identification and implementation of the solution and monitoring.
