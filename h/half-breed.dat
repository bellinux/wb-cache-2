5|$|Of the 14 men in {{contention}} for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to}} the convention were Ulysses S. Grant, James G. Blaine, and John Sherman. Grant had served two terms as President from 1869 to 1877, and was seeking an unprecedented third term in office. He was backed by the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party, which supported political machines and patronage. Blaine was a senator and former representative from Maine who was backed by the <b>Half-Breed</b> faction of the Republican Party. Sherman, the brother of Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, was serving as Secretary of the Treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes. A former senator from Ohio, he was backed by delegates who did not support the Stalwarts or Half-Breeds.|$|E
5|$|The Republican {{convention}} met first, convening in Chicago, Illinois, on June 2. Of the men {{vying for}} the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to the}} convention were former president Ulysses S. Grant, Senator James G. Blaine and Treasury Secretary John Sherman. Grant had been the leading military commander for the Northern forces during the Civil War, and had served two terms as president from 1869 to 1877. He was seeking an unprecedented third term in the office. He was backed by Conkling's faction of the Republican Party, now known as the Stalwarts. They are mainly known for their opposition to the civil service reforms sought by President Hayes. Blaine, a senator and former representative from Maine, was backed by the <b>Half-Breed</b> faction of the party, which did support civil service reform. Sherman, the brother of Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, was a former senator from Ohio serving in Hayes's cabinet. He was backed by a smaller delegation that supported neither of the major factions.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Half-Breeds" [...] were a {{political}} {{faction of the}} United States Republican Party in the late 19th century. The <b>Half-Breeds</b> were a moderate-wing group, and were the opponents of the Stalwarts, the other main faction of the Republican Party. The main issue that divided the Stalwarts and the <b>Half-Breeds</b> was political patronage. The Stalwarts {{were in favor of}} political machines and spoils system-style patronage, while the <b>Half-Breeds,</b> led by Maine senator James G. Blaine, were in favor of civil service reform and a merit system. The epithet [...] "Half-Breed" [...] was invented in derision by the Stalwarts to denote those whom they perceived as being only half Republican.|$|R

Tafoya's and Parker's goal {{were the most important}} to them. And despite a history of hostility between them, Tafoya apparently agreed to mislead the soldiers for the return of his stock plus interest. He deliberately translated parts of the conversation wrong to Nolan. Somehow through the three-way conversation and translations, Nolan quickly realized that some type of deal was made between Parker and the <b>half-breed</b> Tafoya. At that point Nolan began to lose critical trust in his primary trail guide. And later his trust in the hunters faltered. And maybe, the men who witnessed Nolan's tirade faltered in their own trust of their commander.|$|E
25|$|The witches' teat is {{associated}} with the perversion of maternal power by witches in early modern England. The witches' teat {{is associated}} with the feeding of witches' imps or familiars; the witch's familiar supposedly aided the witch in her magic in exchange for nourishment (blood) from sacrificial animals or from the witch's teat. It is also where the devil supposedly suckles when he comes at night to bed his faithful servants, sometimes impregnating them with his seed. Once the devilish <b>half-breed</b> has been conceived, the cambion may only feed upon this teat and no other. Folklore suggests that on the 7th day of the 7th week of consecutive feeding upon the teat, the cambion would grow to adulthood immediately and begin wreaking havoc with a range of demonic powers inherited from its supernatural father. However, should the ritual be disrupted during the 49-day period, the process has to restart all over again.|$|E
25|$|In {{choosing}} {{the members of}} his cabinet, Hayes spurned Radical Republicans in favor of moderates, and also disregarded anyone whom he considered a potential presidential contender. Among those selected were: William M. Evarts, who had defended President Andrew Johnson against impeachment, as Secretary of State; George W. McCrary, who had helped establish the Electoral Commission of 1877, as Secretary of War; and Carl Schurz, who had supported the Liberal Republican ticket in 1872, as Secretary of the Interior. Additionally, in an effort to reach out to Southern moderates, Hayes selected David M. Key, a former Confederate soldier, to serve as Postmaster General. John Sherman, a close ally and currency issues expert, became Secretary of the Treasury, while Richard W. Thompson was selected to reward Oliver P. Morton for the latter's support at the 1876 Republican National Convention. The Schurz and Evarts nominations alienated both the Stalwart and the <b>Half-Breed</b> factions of the Republican Party. Despite this, his initial Cabinet won confirmation in the Senate with the help of some Southern Senators.|$|E

Grant, who, if elected, would be serving his third term. A stalemate ensued between the <b>Half-Breeds</b> and the Stalwarts, so a compromise was struck by the <b>Half-Breeds</b> and supporters of John Sherman to nominate James A. Garfield, with Chester A. Arthur, former Collector for the Port of New York, as his running mate, to satisfy the Stalwarts and thereby ensure their support for the general election.|$|R

25|$|Tower Rock {{was visited}} {{by a member}} of the {{expedition}} again in 1806. The expedition remained a single party after departing Fort Clatsop on the Pacific Ocean. Having reached Traveler's Rest (near present-day Lolo, Montana), Lewis and Clark decided to split the expedition in two. Lewis took nine men and proceeded due east, intending to find the Marias River again. Clark, meanwhile, proceeded south-southeast toward the headwaters of the Missouri, intending to locate the source of the Yellowstone River and explore it until its confluence with the Missouri. Lewis' group did not visit Tower Rock. The main party under Clark followed the Bitterroot River south to Sula, Montana, where it turned south toward Gibbons Pass and the crossing of the Continental Divide. Following a series of creeks and trails southwestward, Clarks' party reached the Big Hole River, following it to the Jefferson River and then to the Missouri again. At Three Forks (where the Jefferson, Gallatin, and Madison rivers join to form the Missouri River), on July 13, 1806, Clark ordered Sergeant John Ordway to take a group of nine and go down the Missouri to the camp at White Bear Island and there await Meriwether Lewis. On the afternoon of July 17, the Ordway party approached Tower Rock. But high winds came up, causing heavy waves which nearly swamped the canoes. The Ordway group was forced to spend the afternoon and night near Tower Rock before proceeding past <b>Half-Breed</b> Rapids the next day. Ordway reached White Bear Island on July 19.|$|E
