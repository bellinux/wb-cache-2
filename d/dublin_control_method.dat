40|$|Simulation(시뮬레이션) Abstract: The {{transmission}} <b>control</b> <b>method</b> {{of a small}} forklift {{is classified}} into a pilot <b>control</b> <b>method</b> and a direct <b>control</b> <b>method.</b> In the pilot <b>control</b> <b>method,</b> the complex hydraulic circuit consists of many components, making the production process too costly and time consuming. The direct <b>control</b> <b>method</b> contains fewer components that can be configured to simple hydraulic circuits. As another advantage, the input profile easily changes the shift sensitivity of the transmission. Therefore, this research considers {{the characteristics of the}} direct <b>control</b> <b>method</b> in the development of hydraulic system design. This paper will present a simulation of the direct control transmission using AMESim. First, modeling of the direct <b>control</b> <b>method</b> is obtained and simulated with real parameters. The simulation results then are carried out and compared with the experimental results to verify and analyze the characteristics of the direct <b>control</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R
