5|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{environmental}} parameters like changes in temperature and prior residence may affect the cichlid's territorial aggression. The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E

This could be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> {{that many of the}} best horses of his generation (notably St. Simon) had not been entered for the race, while others, such as his stable companion Busybody and Queen Adelaide, were fillies more likely to run in the Oaks.|$|R
30|$|Unfortunately, {{there was}} no data {{available}} to compare the incidence of firearm injuries with largely populated urban places such as Riyadh or Jeddah. According to the Menoufiya University Hospital study, firearm injuries were found more common in rural regions (72.41 %) compare to urban areas (27.59 %). This could be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that rural population has easier access to small firearms to protect their livestock and less gun regulations than urban areas (Badawy et al. 2009).|$|R
5|$|Some sources, such as Claxton, {{state that}} there was only a single boiler, but others, such as Fletcher and Maginnis, state that there were three side by side. This {{apparent}} discrepancy is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there were three separate boilers or boiler compartments sharing a common housing.|$|E
5|$|The {{democratic}} party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics, and Pericles seemed willing {{to follow a}} populist policy in order to cajole the public. According to Aristotle, Pericles' stance can be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that his principal political opponent, Cimon, was both rich and generous, {{and was able to}} gain public favor by lavishly handing out portions of his sizable personal fortune. The historian Loren J. Samons II argues, however, that Pericles had enough resources to make a political mark by private means, had he so chosen.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the same}} character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist {{at the same time as}} the original one.|$|E

Garcia dies in the fight. Django leaves a sack of gold to Garcia’s wife ”for you and the children” before he leaves.|$|R
30|$|Plate {{and frame}} {{filtration}} presses {{working at the}} pressure of approximately 410 – 550  mPa are basic operation units, used by industrial FPH producers in order to purify protein fraction of hydrolysates from different impurities. As for investigations considering such a filtration for any studies with FPH, the information is very limited by a few publications (Chakraborty and Madhavan 1977; Loosen et al. 1994). It <b>explains</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that plate and frame filtration is rather a technological step at a large production than a matter of investigation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical flow-through method to separate anisole and ethyl phenylacetate, respectively, from a polystyrene mixture. The microfluidic separation uses different diffusive {{dynamics of the}} substances transverse to the lamination flow formed in a microchannel. The effect of inlet flow rates and ambient temperature on separation is examined. Additionally, {{the possibility of the}} separation of the light substance from the mixture with different molecular weight is shown numerically and experimentally. The separation efficiency is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that <b>the</b> relaxation time depends on the inlet flow rate and that the diffusivity depends on the ambient temperature. This method can be applied to separate monomers from aggregates...|$|R
5|$|The {{average age}} of the Politburo's members was 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar greying also took place in the Central Committee, the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members can be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Central Committee was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to Hasan's rule {{outside of}} his family's core region around Mosul remained, however—in Diyar Bakr, the {{governor}} of Mayyafariqin, Ali ibn Ja'far, rebelled against Hasan, and in Diyar Mudar, the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj also revolted. Hasan subdued them and secured control over the entire Jazira {{by the end of}} 936, due to the efforts of his brother Ali, who was given the governorship of the two provinces as a reward. In the meantime, the defeated Banu Habib, some 10,000 strong and under the leadership of al-Ala ibn al-Mu'ammar, left their lands and fled to territory controlled by the Byzantine Empire. This unprecedented move may be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that {{a significant portion of the}} tribe still practised Christianity, or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from the south, but the primary goal of the move was to escape from Hamdanid authority and taxation. Hasan also attempted to extend his control to Sajid-ruled Azerbaijan in 934 and 938, but his efforts failed.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they cannot {{be made in}} the most common {{processes}} of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce {{is that it is a}} magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} {{inflation}} targeting improves economic performance, as measured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> behavior of inflation, output, and interest rates. We compare seven OECD countries that adopted inflation targeting {{in the early}} 1990 s to thirteen that did not. After the early 90 s, performance improved along many dimensions for both the targeting countries and the non-targeters. In some cases <b>the</b> targeters improved <b>by</b> more; for example, average inflation fell by a larger amount. However, these differences are <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that targeters performed worse than non-targeters before the early 90 s, and there is regression to the mean. Once one controls for regression to the mean, {{there is no evidence}} that inflation targeting improves performance. ...|$|R

This is somewhat unexpected as pension wealth typically {{is seen as}} the stronger variable, but it may be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> regrettable <b>fact</b> that we can include these variables only in the form of country averages – albeit differentiated by sex - rather than as individually calculated information.|$|R
50|$|Ghabdellatif {{grew up in}} Crimean Khanate, {{which had}} closer ties with Ottoman Empire than with Muscovy. As he became older, he started to conduct more {{independent}} politics. That was unacceptable to the faction which selected him for the throne. In 1501 a group of Kazan nobles headed by Qol (Kel) Axmat visited Moscow. In January 1502, an embassy from Muscovy came to Kazan. Ghabdellatif was ousted, taken from Kazan under guard to Moscow and then exiled to Beloozero (now Belozersk, Russia). Moxammat Amin was installed as khan once again. The conflict resulted {{in a number of}} inquiries from Crimean Khanate, but it did not cause hostilities. It could be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that <b>the</b> throne passed to another step son of Meñli I Giray, and that Crimean Khanate was busy with a war against Big Horde.|$|R
