5|$|In 2010 fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate {{receptor}} modulator, {{became the}} first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell. Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose. In 2013 one further oral drug, <b>dimethyl</b> fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of fumaric acid, an already existing drug), {{was approved by the}} FDA. <b>Dimethyl</b> fumarate is taken twice daily.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium has {{no known}} {{biological}} function, although fungi can incorporate {{it in place}} of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to account for {{a major part of}} the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form <b>dimethyl</b> telluride, although <b>dimethyl</b> ditelluride is also formed by some species. <b>Dimethyl</b> telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.|$|E
5|$|As a soft acid, {{platinum}} {{has a great}} {{affinity for}} sulfur, such as on <b>dimethyl</b> sulfoxide (DMSO); numerous DMSO complexes have been reported and care should be taken {{in the choice of}} reaction solvent.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, eleven disease-modifying {{medications}} {{have been}} approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). They are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, <b>dimethyl</b> fumarate, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and ocrelizumab.|$|E
5|$|Fingolimod {{may give}} rise to {{hypertension}} and slowed heart rate, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels. Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of <b>dimethyl</b> fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While <b>dimethyl</b> fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
5|$|In living systems, {{selenium}} {{is found}} in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is <b>dimethyl</b> selenide.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its high}} neutron cross-section, boron-10 {{is often used to}} control fission in nuclear {{reactors}} as a neutron-capturing substance. Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the <b>dimethyl</b> ether adduct of boron trifluoride (DME-BF3) and column chromatography of borates are being used.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when {{phytoplankton}} bloom was apparent, {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases were trapped in a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most apparent RSCs were <b>dimethyl</b> sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Organotellurium {{compounds}} such as <b>dimethyl</b> telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and methyl allyl telluride are {{precursors for}} synthesizing metalorganic {{vapor phase epitaxy}} growth of II-VI compound semiconductors. Diisopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is the preferred precursor for low-temperature growth of CdHgTe by MOVPE. The greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used in these processes. The compounds for semiconductor industry and are prepared by adduct purification.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium has no {{biological}} function, although fungi {{can use it}} {{in place}} of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into <b>dimethyl</b> telluride, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in <b>dimethyl</b> sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and <b>dimethyl</b> sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} <b>dimethyl</b> terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and <b>dimethyl</b> fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, <b>dimethyl</b> sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as <b>dimethyl</b> selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{official}} guidelines {{yet on the}} use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. <b>Dimethyl</b> fumarate is potentially {{one of the most interesting}} oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.|$|E
25|$|DMSO is metabolized by {{disproportionation}} to <b>dimethyl</b> sulfide and <b>dimethyl</b> sulfone. It {{is subject}} to renal and pulmonary excretion. A possible side effect of DMSO is therefore elevated blood <b>dimethyl</b> sulfide, which may cause a blood borne halitosis symptom.|$|E
25|$|Methanolysis is {{only rarely}} {{carried out in}} {{industry}} today because polyester production based on <b>dimethyl</b> terephthalate(DMT) has shrunk tremendously, and many <b>dimethyl</b> terephthalate (DMT) producers have disappeared.|$|E
25|$|In the Diels–Reese {{reaction}} <b>dimethyl</b> acetylenedicarboxylate {{reacts with}} 1,2-diphenylhydrazine to an adduct, which in xylene gives <b>dimethyl</b> indole-2,3-dicarboxylate and aniline. With other solvents, other products are formed: with {{glacial acetic acid}} a pyrazolone, and with pyridine a quinoline.|$|E
25|$|Other {{chemical}} derivatives of methanol include {{acetic acid}} and <b>dimethyl</b> ether (DME), {{the latter of}} which has replaced chlorofluorocarbons as an aerosol spray propellant. <b>Dimethyl</b> ether can also be blended with liquified petroleum gas (LPG) for home heating and cooking, {{and can be used}} as a replacement for transportation diesel fuel.|$|E
25|$|The Dewar benzene {{converts}} to <b>dimethyl</b> phthalate on heating at 90°C.|$|E
25|$|Simple ethers or {{symmetrical}} ethers; e.g., diethyl ether, <b>dimethyl</b> ether, etc.|$|E
25|$|Fetor hepaticus is a musty breath odor {{resulting}} from increased <b>dimethyl</b> sulfide.|$|E
25|$|The image below {{illustrates}} some {{of processes}} from various raw materials to <b>dimethyl</b> ether.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} trace (<1% volume) compounds give flatus its smell. Historically, compounds such as indole, skatole, ammonia {{and short}} chain fatty acids {{were thought to}} cause the smell of flatus. More recent evidence proves that the major contribution to the smell of flatus comes {{from a combination of}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). It is known that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan, MM (also known as methanethiol, MT), <b>dimethyl</b> sulfide (DMS), <b>dimethyl</b> disulfide (DMDS) and <b>dimethyl</b> trisulfide (DMTS) are present in flatus. The benzopyrrole volatiles indole and skatole have a mothball smell, and therefore probably do not contribute greatly to the characteristic smell of flatus.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} {{is produced}} from ethylene glycol and <b>dimethyl</b> terephthalate(DMT) (C6H4(CO2CH3)2) or terephthalic acid.|$|E
25|$|Bufotenin (bufotenine) is {{also known}} by the {{chemical}} names 5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-HO-DMT), N,N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, <b>dimethyl</b> serotonin, and mappine.|$|E
25|$|Terephthalic {{acid and}} its <b>dimethyl</b> ester have very low toxicity, with s over 1g/kg (oral, mouse).|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{promising}} fuel in diesel engines, petrol engines (30% DME / 70% LPG), and gas turbines. For diesel engines, an advantage is the high cetane number of 55, {{compared to that of}} diesel fuel from petroleum, which is 40–53. Only moderate modifications are needed to convert a diesel engine to burn <b>dimethyl</b> ether. The simplicity of this short carbon chain compound leads during combustion to very low emissions of particulate matter, NOx, and CO. For these reasons as well as being sulfur-free, <b>dimethyl</b> ether meets even the most stringent emission regulations in Europe (EURO5), U.S. (U.S. 2010), and Japan (2009 Japan). Mobil uses <b>dimethyl</b> ether in their methanol to gasoline process.|$|E
25|$|Methyl iodide {{may also}} be {{prepared}} by treating iodoform with potassium hydroxide and <b>dimethyl</b> sulfate under 95% ethanol.|$|E
25|$|A {{potentially}} major use of <b>dimethyl</b> ether is as {{substitute for}} propane in LPG used as fuel in household and industry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimethyl</b> ether is {{also used}} as a {{propellant}} in aerosol products. Such products include hair spray, bug spray and some aerosol glue products.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimethyl</b> ether, DME, is a synthetic, gaseous {{diesel fuel}} {{that results in}} clean {{combustion}} with very little soot and reduced NOx emissions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimethyl</b> {{sulfoxide}} {{can produce}} an explosive reaction {{when exposed to}} acyl chlorides; at a low temperature, this reaction produces the oxidant for Swern oxidation.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} of biological effects of <b>dimethyl</b> sulfoxide (DMSO) and MSM differ, {{but those of}} DMSO may be mediated, at least in part, by MSM.|$|E
