5|$|As the {{deadline}} stipulated in Part XVII of the Constitution for switching to <b>Hindi</b> as primary official language approached, {{the central government}} stepped up its efforts to spread Hindi's official usage. In 1960, compulsory training for <b>Hindi</b> typing and stenography was started. The same year, India's president Rajendra Prasad acted on the Pant Committee's recommendations and issued orders for preparation of <b>Hindi</b> glossaries, translating procedural literature and legal codes to <b>Hindi,</b> imparting <b>Hindi</b> education to government employees and other efforts for propagating <b>Hindi.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Rajakumari, Radha and Ranjan reprised {{their roles}} in the <b>Hindi</b> version, Radha and Ranjan's {{characters}} were renamed. Radha's character (Veerasimhan) was Veer Singh in the <b>Hindi</b> version, and Ranjan's character (Sasankan) was renamed Shashank. Of the other cast members, N. S. Krishnan, T. A. Madhuram, T. E. Krishnamachari, Pottai Krishnamoorthy and N. Seetharaman appeared only in the Tamil version, and Yashodhara Katju and H. K. Chopra appeared only in the <b>Hindi</b> version.

5|$|During 1946–50, {{there were}} {{sporadic}} agitations against <b>Hindi</b> by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced <b>Hindi</b> as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations {{in this period}} occurred in 1948–50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make <b>Hindi</b> compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made <b>Hindi</b> compulsory from the academic year 1948–49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in <b>Hindi</b> {{for the promotion of}} students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory <b>Hindi</b> teaching. As in the agitation of 1938–40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on <b>Hindi</b> and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made <b>Hindi</b> teaching optional from the academic year 1950–51. Students {{who did not want to}} learn <b>Hindi</b> were allowed to participate in other school activities during <b>Hindi</b> classes.|$|E
5|$|Enthiran was {{released}} on 1October2010 in three languages– in Tamil as Enthiran, in <b>Hindi</b> as Robot and in Telugu as Robo. The original version was in Tamil, while the <b>Hindi</b> and Telugu versions were dubbed. The film {{was released}} in 2,250theatres worldwide, including 500theatres in Tamil Nadu, 350theatres in Andhra Pradesh, 128theatres in Kerala, 23theatres in Karnataka, and 750theatres in North India. With an estimated budget of 1.32billion, Enthiran was India's most expensive film up to that point, surpassing the <b>Hindi</b> film Blue (2009), which was filmed on a budget of 750million.|$|E
5|$|Hindu natal astrology {{originated}} with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though incorporating the Hindu lunar mansions. The {{names of the}} signs (e.g. Greek 'Krios' for Aries, <b>Hindi</b> 'Kriya'), the planets (e.g. Greek 'Helios' for Sun, astrological <b>Hindi</b> 'Heli'), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek 'apoklima' and 'sunaphe' for declination and planetary conjunction, <b>Hindi</b> 'apoklima' and 'sunapha' respectively) in Varaha Mihira's texts are considered conclusive evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology. The Indian techniques {{may also have been}} augmented with some of the Babylonian techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{when the}} {{government}} required that <b>Hindi</b> be taught in the school system, E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to <b>Hindi</b> played {{a big role in}} the politics of Tamil Nadu. The fear of the <b>Hindi</b> language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the Tamils, acceptance of <b>Hindi</b> in the school system was a form of bondage. When the Justice Party weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing <b>Hindi</b> in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.|$|E
5|$|Nehru died in May 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister of India. Shastri and {{his senior}} cabinet members Morarji Desai and Gulzari Lal Nanda were strong {{supporters}} of <b>Hindi</b> being the sole official language. This increased the apprehension that Nehru's assurances of 1959 and 1963 {{would not be}} kept despite Shastri's assurances to the contrary. Concerns over the preference of <b>Hindi</b> in central government jobs, civil service examinations and the fear that English would be replaced with <b>Hindi</b> as medium of instruction brought students into the anti-Hindi imposition agitation camp in large numbers. On 7 March 1964, the chief minister of Madras State, M. Bhaktavatsalam at a session of the Madras Legislative Assembly recommended the introduction of Three-language formula (English, <b>Hindi</b> and Tamil) in the state. Apprehension over the Three-language formula increased student support for the anti-Hindi cause.|$|E

5|$|The Indian National Congress won the 1937 {{elections}} in Madras Presidency. Rajaji became the Chief Minister on 14 July 1937. He was {{a supporter of}} propagating <b>Hindi</b> in South India. On 11 August 1937, within a month of coming to power, he announced his intention to introduce <b>Hindi</b> language teaching in secondary schools by issuing a policy statement. On 21 April 1938, he issued a government order (G.O.) making the teaching of <b>Hindi</b> compulsory in 125 secondary schools in the Presidency. Periyar and the opposition Justice Party led by A. T. Panneerselvam immediately opposed the move. They started statewide protests against Rajaji and <b>Hindi.</b>|$|E
5|$|The anti-Hindi activists from Madras State {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the 1967 Amendment, as it did not address their concerns about the three language formula. However, with DMK in power, they hesitated to restart the agitation. The Tamil Nadu Students' Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation council split into several factions. The moderate factions favored letting Annadurai and the government to deal with the situation. The extremist factions restarted the agitations. They demanded scrapping of the three language formula and an end to teaching of <b>Hindi,</b> abolishing the use of <b>Hindi</b> commands in the National Cadet Corps (NCC), banning of <b>Hindi</b> films and songs and closure of the Dakshina Bharat <b>Hindi</b> Prachara Sabha (Institution for Propagation of <b>Hindi</b> in South India).|$|E
