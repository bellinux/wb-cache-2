Partners of injured people often <b>feel</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|Creative Assembly's studio director, Tim Heaton, {{explained}} that Halo Wars 2 would not feature gameplay {{similar to their}} Total War series. Instead they wanted to build upon the foundation established with Halo Wars. With Halo Wars 2, the development team hoped to introduce new players to the strategy game genre while appeasing experienced players by including a range of multiplayer modes that {{a wide spectrum of}} players could enjoy. They also wanted to extend the purpose of leader units and their abilities by giving each of them a more defining role in the style of play they represent. Creative Assembly thought that the game needed more units capable of performing long range attacks. They wanted to add more artillery pieces, however they found that there were currently no suitable vehicles in the Halo universe. To remedy this, they created two new vehicles, the Kodiak and the Blisterback, to fit the role. They used reference material supplied by 343 Industries to ensure the new vehicles did not <b>feel</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place. Halo Wars 2s creative director, Alistair Hope, noted that staying true to the source material was important aspect for all of Creative Assembly's games, but stated that the team were given more freedom to explore and expand the Halo universe than they had anticipated. Hope praised the control scheme used in Halo Wars and aimed to enhance the system by ensuring that Halo Wars 2 would be intuitive to play on a console. One common control feature included in many PC RTS games but absent from the original Halo Wars is control groups, which enables sets of units to be manually assigned to a key. As Halo Wars 2 was developed for console and PC, the designers were keen to include the feature for both versions of the game. 343 Industries had initially considered supporting cross-platform play between Windows and Xbox One devices, but the feature was ultimately excluded from the game at launch.|$|E
25|$|The Temple {{stressed}} egalitarian ideals, asking {{members to}} attend in casual clothes so poor members would not <b>feel</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place, and providing {{shelter for the}} needy. While the Temple had increased its African-American membership from 15% to nearly 50%, in order to attempt further gains the Temple hired African-American preacher Archie Ijames (who had earlier given up organized religion). Pastor Ijames {{was one of the}} first to commit to Jones' socialist collective program. In 1959, the church joined the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and was renamed the Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel. This affiliation was a successful attempt to both raise the dwindling membership and restore the reputation of the organization.|$|E

500|$|Shortness {{of breath}} {{is often the}} symptom that most bothers people. It is {{commonly}} described as: [...] "my breathing requires effort," [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> breath," [...] or [...] "I can't get enough air in". Different terms, however, {{may be used in}} different cultures. Typically the shortness of breath is worse on exertion of a prolonged duration and worsens over time. In the advanced stages, it occurs during rest and may be always present. It is a source of both anxiety and a poor quality of life in those with COPD. Many people with more advanced COPD breathe through pursed lips and this action can improve shortness of breath in some.|$|E

It was the band's first single to chart outside the UK Singles Top 75 peaking at number 89. It received a generally positive response from critics.

Pitchfork Media called [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] the best track on parent album Mwng and described it as a [...] "decidedly retro number that combines the swingin' sounds of the '60s with some high-tech vocal effects". In a 2006 feature on the Super Furry Animals' back catalogue Incendiary Magazine called the track a [...] "clever slice of pop". In a play on words on the track's meaning in English, Drowned in Sound stated that [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] was Mwng's [...] "sunny interval" [...] and wouldn't <b>feel</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place on 1999's Guerrilla. Both the NME and Rolling Stone likened the track to the work of Roxy Music with the former calling it [...] "happily woozy" [...] and the latter claiming it is a [...] "spunky, sax-spiked bop". The NME also placed the track at number 33 in their single of the year list for 2000. Yahoo! Music described the track as a [...] "playground free-for-all ... frazzled and psychedelic". Art Sperl, writing for Rock's Backpages in December 2000, was critical of the track, calling it [...] "flimsy". The track appears on vinyl and CD copies of the band's singles compilation album [...] but is not included on the DVD release as no music video was made.|$|E

2500|$|Adventure Gamers' Cameron Urquhart scored it 4 out of 5. He praised how {{the game}} used factual {{historical}} information in its fictional narrative, {{and was also}} impressed with the graphics, sound and voice acting. He was also complementary of the puzzles; [...] "Rather than being loaded down with contrived puzzles for padding, Dracula 3 relies heavily on inventory puzzles, yet you are never resigned to trying everything on everything. The hotspots are almost always necessary, while puzzles are logical and accessible and never <b>feel</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place." [...] He concluded [...] "The game rarely wows you in any one way, and the pace can drag at times in dry subject matter, but overall it's both logical and accessible, with [...] interesting approach to vampire lore and deftly crafted storyline." ...|$|E

Tim Robins was the graphic artist; he created text information seen on the screen, such as icons, menus and maps, was responsible for the visual style of interactive elements in the game and also served as an assistant layout artist.

2500|$|Jympson's {{original}} assembly {{contained a}} large amount of footage which differed from the final cut of the film, including several alternate takes and a number of scenes which were subsequently deleted to improve the narrative pace. The most significant material cut was a series of scenes from {{the first part of the}} film which served to introduce the character of Luke Skywalker. These early scenes, set in Anchorhead on the planet Tatooine, presented the audience with Luke's everyday life among his friends as it is affected by the space battle above the planet; they also introduced the character of Biggs Darklighter, Luke's closest friend who departs to join the Rebellion. Chew explained the rationale behind removing these scenes as a narrative decision: [...] "In the first five minutes, we were hitting everybody with more information than they could handle. There were too many story lines to keep straight: the robots and the Princess, Vader, Luke. So we simplified it by taking out Luke and Biggs". [...] After viewing a rough cut, Alan Ladd likened these Anchorhead scenes to [...] "American Graffiti in outer space". Lucas was looking for a way of accelerating the storytelling, and removing Luke's early scenes would distinguish Star Wars from his earlier teenage drama and [...] "get that American Graffiti <b>feel</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it". Lucas also stated that he wanted to move the narrative focus to C-3PO and R2-D2: [...] "At the time, to have the first half-hour of the film be mainly about robots was a bold idea." ...|$|E
