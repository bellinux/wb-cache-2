5|$|Nonetheless, many stone Norman keeps made {{considerable}} compromises {{to military}} utility. Norwich Castle, for example, included elaborate blind arcading {{on the outside}} of the building and appears to have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony, rather than for defence. The interior of the keep at Hedingham could certainly have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective. Important early English and Welsh keeps such as the White Tower, Colchester, and Chepstow were all built in a distinctive Romanesque style, often reusing Roman materials and sites, and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people. The political value of these keep designs, and the social prestige they lent to their builders, may <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they continued to be built in England into the late 12th century, beyond the point when military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted.|$|E

5|$|Those {{in favour}} of viewing the objects as the {{personal}} hoard of Athanaric suggest that the gold was buried {{in an attempt to}} hide it from the Huns, who had defeated the Gothic Greuthungi north of the Black Sea and began moving down into Thervingian Dacia around 375. However, it remains unclear why the gold would have remained buried, as Athanaric's treaty with Theodosius I (380) enabled him to bring his tribesmen under the protection of Roman rule prior to his death in 381. Other researchers have suggested that the hoard was that of an Ostrogothic king, with Rusu (1984) specifically identifying Gainnas, a Gothic general in the Roman army who was killed by the Huns around 400, as the owner of the hoard. Although this would <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the hoard remained buried, it fails to account for the conspicuous ring-barrow having been chosen as the site to hide such a large and valuable treasure.|$|E

25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that the hiatus has been caused in part by increased sulfur emissions from volcanic activity. A study published in November 2014 found that more sulfur dioxide had been emitted from small volcanoes than previously thought over the period 2000-2013.

25|$|While Harsiese A {{may have}} become king at Thebes prior to Year 4 of Osorkon II, contra Kitchen, he {{certainly}} ruled Thebes during {{the first decade of}} Osorkon II's reign as Kitchen notes. Osorkon II's control over this great city is only first documented by 2 separate Year 12 Quay Texts which means that Harsiese had died by this time. If Harsiese was already ruling at Thebes earlier under Takelot I, it might <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Takelot I's own Year 5, Year 8, and Year 14 Nile Quay Texts, which mention the serving High Priests Iuwelot and Smendes III—who were all brothers of Takelot I--consistently omit any mention of Takelot's name, as Gerard Broekman aptly notes in an article in JEA (88 (2002)). Takelot I's name is left deliberately blank here. This might indicate a possible rivalry between Takelot I and Harsiese A at Thebes. The Amun Priests may have chosen not to involve themselves in this dispute by omitting any mention of the reigning king's name.|$|E
25|$|A species {{could benefit}} greatly from better {{abilities}} to reason about, predict {{and understand the}} world. French social and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber, with his colleague Hugo Mercier, describes {{the idea that there}} could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. Sperber points out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs. Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. Sperber says this could suggest that there are not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. They also claim that reason may {{have more to do with}} winning arguments than with the search for the truth.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing to}} pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E

He said that Spurr's hope that his book will <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Japan refused to surrender, [...] "is a modest aspiration for his well-balanced treatment of historical evidence and his workmanship in reconstructing the tragic event".

[...] The review goes on to point out that [...] "the reliance on the [...] "Jerk" [...] sound can be a little monotonous, there are enough variations along the way to keep things interesting." [...] He also says [...] "The duo's flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly. If you were looking for undisputedly pop-rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch, the New Boyz debut is a fine destination." [...] XXL said that the album delivered [...] "unexpected lyrical talent" [...] but that it lacked [...] "sonic variety". The review also {{goes on to say that}} the album [...] "is no hip-hop classic, but rather the breath of fresh air rap needs." [...] Jeff Weiss of The Los Angeles Times gave the album three stars, commenting that the album [...] "is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> for the last six months, the kids have been saying out with the old, in with the New Boyz.". The review also said that the album [...] "successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound (the minimalist bass-heavy bounce of jerk music) and style (skinny jeans, Vans and [...] "colors that ain’t even on the rainbow"), with traditional teenage themes (girls, the desire for self-expression, adults who don’t understand, girls). The result is a West Coast antidote to the South’s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap—a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through the lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying the face cards that fate dealt." [...] The Selby Times said that the album [...] "is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude, even if it makes adults' eyes roll in disgust." [...] Wendy Roby of BBC said that, [...] "But overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over – and with its day-glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek, Skinny Jeanz and a Mic is hard to resist." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album [...] "one of the year’s most charming rap debuts, and certainly the least expected." [...] In a separate review, he named the album the sixth best album of the year, commenting, [...] "Emerging from Southern California’s jerk scene, this teenage duo made an album that’s appealingly young, simultaneously wide-eyed and knowingly lewd." [...] DJBooth.net's Nathan Slavik was less positive, predicting that the album would be [...] "the last time we hear from the New Boyz." ...|$|E

Eric Clapton described Johnson's music as [...] "the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice." [...] In two takes of [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he shows {{a high degree of}} precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: [...] "The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing."
