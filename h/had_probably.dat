5|$|Christoph Wolff notes a {{similarity}} between the fugue theme and one by Johann Hugo von Wilderer, whose mass Bach <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731. Wilderer's mass also has a slow introduction, a duet as the second movement and a motet in stile antico, similar to late Renaissance music, as the third movement. Bach based the work on a composition in C minor, as mistakes in the copying process show.|$|E
5|$|De Coventre {{received}} a B. A. under John de Waltirstone from the University of Paris by Lent, 1333. Although he <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> completed a Licentiate in the Arts and a Master of Arts by 1335, because of {{gaps in the}} Paris records it is not certain {{that he was a}} Master until April 1345.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Pawnee people were not a single unified tribe. At {{the middle of the}} 18th century, they consisted of two major groups. The Skidis, or Wolf Pawnees, had migrated northward with the Arikaras, and <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> been in Nebraska since 1600 or earlier. By the beginning of the 18th century, they were established on the Loup River, which flows through central Nebraska into the Platte River from the north.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle at}} Catraeth {{has been seen}} as an attempt to resist the advance of the Angles, who <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> by then {{occupied}} the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{confrontation}} {{took place}} between Russian and Georgian ships on 10 August. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Russian navy sank one Georgian vessel after four Georgian missile boats had attacked the Russian Navy ships {{off the coast of}} Abkhazia. The Russian patrol ship Mirazh was probably responsible for the sinking. The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet on 10 August. The Black Sea Fleet, which participated in the military conflict {{for the first time since}} 1945, <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> departed from Sevastopol before full-scale hostilities between Russia and Georgia began.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1541, {{in either}} the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion) on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> been driven out of Chania to Candia after an {{uprising}} against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, also Greek. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531– 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent {{the last years of}} his life (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Delius and Jelka had {{returned}} to Grez. He had begun to show symptoms of syphilis that he <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> contracted in the 1880s. He took treatment at clinics across Europe, but by 1922 he was walking with two sticks, and by 1928 he was paralysed and blind. There was no return to the prosperity of pre-war years: Delius's medical treatment was an additional expense, his blindness prevented him from composing, and his royalties were curtailed by the lack of continental performances of his music. Beecham gave discreet financial help, and the composer and musical benefactor H. Balfour Gardiner bought the house at Grez and allowed Delius and Jelka to live there rent-free.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla {{was born}} in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. He had a {{slightly}} younger brother, Geta, who would briefly rule as co-emperor alongside him. Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, appointed Caracalla joint Augustus and full emperor from the year 198 onwards. His brother Geta was granted the same title in 210. In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, a woman whom he hated, though for what reason is unknown. By 205 Caracalla had succeeded in having Plautianus executed for treason, though he <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> fabricated {{the evidence of the}} plot himself. It was then that he banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracalla's orders.|$|E
5|$|Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, {{in command}} of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm's arrival, knew by June 23 that a major British {{offensive}} was about to begin. He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; {{the fact that the}} British held him was an indication that the messenger <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> learned too much just by being in the British camp. Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.|$|E

5|$|In 821, {{the year}} of Coenwulf's death, a council was held in London at which Coenwulf {{threatened}} to exile Wulfred if the archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 pounds to the king. Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms, but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf's death, with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf's brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so {{it is evident that}} some accommodation had been reached by that time. Wulfred <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain her {{position}} in the national squad, Kydd attended the extended squad's first training camp in September 2005, but {{was one of several}} players forced out after succumbing to a virus. She was subsequently left out of the team for a practice tour of Jamaica and New Zealand in the lead-up to the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but continued her efforts to make the team for the Games. Finally, on 10 December 2005, she voluntarily withdrew her name from selection, noting ongoing complications from the earlier concussion (team doctors stated that she <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> attempted to return too quickly) and low motivation.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the well-preserved rocks of the dry, {{central part of the}} Andes, the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E

5|$|In his 1928 {{paper on}} the species, Lowe thought that the Inaccessible Island rail was the {{descendant}} of flightless ancestors which had reached Inaccessible Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria. Land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before the development and acceptance of plate tectonics. By 1955 it was understood that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to Inaccessible Island. It was also realised that {{like all the other}} land birds of the Tristan Archipelago, it <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> reached the island from ancestors in South America.|$|E
5|$|Leofric {{replaced}} the monks with canons. The new community {{was given the}} Rule of Chrodegang by Leofric, which rule he <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> learned in Lotharingia before his return to England. Leofric moved {{the seat of his}} see because Crediton was too poor and rural, and Exeter was a city with protective walls and an abandoned church that could be used as the new cathedral. Leofric claimed that he found his diocese lacking in episcopal vestments and the other items required for church services, and his surviving list of gifts to the church noted that he gave vestments, crosses, chalices, censers, altar coverings, and other furnishings to the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|No-one had {{questioned}} Calvert's conformity at the time, {{and if he}} {{had been}} secretly Catholic, he had hidden it well. It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest reported to the Congregation Propaganda Fide in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on a plan for a Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).|$|E

5|$|On 14 March 1772, amid various {{political}} machinations, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo {{was elected to}} the archbishopric as a compromise candidate acceptable to the imperial court in Vienna. Although unpopular among Salzburgers, this appointment appeared at first to be to the Mozarts' advantage: Leopold's withheld salary was paid, and on 31 August Colloredo authorised the payment of Wolfgang's Konzertmeister salary. However, the new archbishop began to look for someone outside the Salzburg court to be his new Kapellmeister. Eventually, he chose the Italian Domenico Fischietti, who was several years younger than Leopold. Realising that his chances of promotion <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> been irrevocably lost, Leopold turned his hopes for a comfortable old age towards Wolfgang, giving new urgency to the third Italian journey which began in October 1772.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj was reoccupied at the {{beginning}} of the Middle Preclassic. This was probably by Mixe–Zoquean inhabitants, as evidenced by the plentiful Olmec-style sculpture at the site dating to this period. The construction of public architecture <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> begun by the Middle Preclassic; the earliest structures were made of clay, which was sometimes partially burned in order to harden it. Ceramics from this period belonged to the local Ocosito tradition. This ceramic tradition, although it was local, showed strong affinities with the ceramics of the coastal plain and foothills of the Escuintla region.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{during this}} period. The masonry {{of the castle}} <b>had</b> <b>probably</b> been stripped for use as local building materials, as this part of England was traditionally very short of suitable stone. Edward VI gave the castle to Sir John Checke, until it reverted to Mary I. After Mary, the castle was acquired by Sir Gervase Elwes, whose family retained it until the 19th century. At some point after 1720, the surviving east and south sides of the inner bailey walls were destroyed.|$|E
