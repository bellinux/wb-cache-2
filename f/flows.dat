5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava <b>flows.</b> The extent of these <b>flows</b> makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava <b>flows</b> similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major <b>flows,</b> like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older <b>flows.</b> Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E

5|$|Licancabur {{formed in}} three units, {{all of which}} have lava flows; the last one also {{includes}} pyroclastic deposits. The bulk of the cone was formed by the second unit. The second unit's eruption was preceded by the injection of basic magma into the magma chamber. The oldest <b>flows</b> crop out on the western and northern sides of the volcano and are partially covered by more-recent <b>flows</b> from Licancabur and <b>flows</b> from Sairecabur. <b>Flows</b> from both appear to be pre-glacial. The older lavas have compositions similar to shoshonite and old Sairecabur lavas, and tend to be more basic than recent lavas. Weak explosive activity left pyroclastic deposits on the volcano. Licancabur formed primarily after the late glacial period, between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Flank lava <b>flows</b> are its youngest feature. The neighbouring Juriques dates to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Limousins in {{different}} countries are bred according to different selection practices or objectives, and are connected by limited international gene <b>flows.</b> Poor genetic connectedness between countries has negative implications for estimation accuracies of international genetic prediction programmes. As a result of genetic drift or different selection, each country's population of Limousins is becoming genetically differentiated, but which is counterbalanced to a limited extent by gene <b>flows</b> from other countries. A study of over 2.4million Limousin pedigree files of five European countries (France, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom) showed moderate gene <b>flows</b> from France to the United Kingdom and Denmark, but negligible gene <b>flows</b> to Sweden. Except for gene <b>flows</b> originating from France, and some limited gene <b>flows</b> between Denmark and Sweden in the 1990s, bull and semen exchanges between European countries has been scarce, especially since about 2000. Cow and embryo <b>flows</b> {{have been even more}} scarce. Conversely, the genetic contribution of North American Limousins to European countries has increased since the late 1990s, which has occurred because of their use in breeding programmes to introduce the polled gene.|$|E

These advances have led to the recognition of several <b>flow</b> regimes in individual fractures subjected to different initial and boundary conditions. Of these, the most important regimes are film <b>flow,</b> rivulet <b>flow,</b> and sliding of droplets.

5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava <b>flows,</b> vesicular lava <b>flows,</b> dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava <b>flows</b> with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and <b>flows.</b> Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava <b>flows</b> and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava <b>flows</b> appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava <b>flows</b> and domes.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava <b>flows</b> is that although they were high in silica content, the <b>flows</b> were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the <b>flows</b> a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic <b>flows.</b> Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice <b>flows,</b> bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E
