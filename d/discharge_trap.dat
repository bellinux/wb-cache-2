During the last decade considerable {{progress has been made in}} formulating process equations that represent the individual sources and sinks for eroding soil. The objective of this report is to provide an overview of some wind erosion processes on agricultural lands. By considering two soil states (crusted and aggregated) along with the erosion processes, one can define the temporal soil properties of dry soils that control soil erodibility. These temporal properties include the dry stabilities, mass fractions and size distributions of mobile and immobile soil components, as well as surface roughness. The threshold friction velocities of bare soils also depend upon surface roughness and cover of immobile clods and crusts. The transport capacity of the suspension-size soil is several times larger than the limited transport capacity for the saltation and creep-size component of horizontal soil discharge. Thus, on large fields suspension discharge often exceeds saltatiodcreep discharge. Sources of saltatiodcreep discharge include entrainment of loose aggregates and abrasion of immobile clods and crust.

The latter is usually carried out on the particle flow, thereby allowing quantitative detection in various experimental conditions such as ambient air analysis or exhaust stack monitoring, to name but a few. A possible alternative method for particle analysis has been experimented combining a low pressure RF (Radio-Frequency) plasma discharge with the LIBS technique. Such approach has two peculiar features {{in comparison to the}} usual LIBS analysis. First, the particles injected in the RF plasma <b>discharge</b> are <b>trapped</b> in levitation. Second, the analysis is performed at a reduced pressure of around 1 mbar. LIBS detection at such low pressure has this peculiarity that particle vaporization is assumed to be achieved through direct laser particle interaction whereas it is caused by laser-induced plasma ignited in the gas at atmospheric pressure. The use of such particle trap could allow improving particle sampling, making organic particle analysis possible (by using an inert gas for RF plasma ignition) and even (depending on the pressure) obtaining a better signal to noise ratio. Detection of the elements of nanoparticle agglomerates made following their injection in the RF discharge has demonstrated the feasibility of such approach.

This new method provides abundant data compared to previous discrete time-integrated breath sampling methods. The method is particularly well suited to studying dermal exposure because the full face mask eliminates exposure to contaminated air. Seven of the 10 subjects bathed in water at two or three different temperatures between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Subjects at the highest temperatures exhaled about 30 times more chloroform than the same subjects at the lowest temperatures.

Hence, the obtained state of the system is a hybrid between the Kondo regime, typically associated with single electron occupancy, and the mixed valence regime, associated with large charge fluctuations. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, we demonstrate that the system is equivalent to a two level-level system coupled to an Ohmic bath, with a bias controlled by the applied magnetic field. Due to the Kondo screening, the effect of the magnetic field is significantly suppressed in the singly occupied state.

30|$|The above {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} bipolar resistance switching with eightwise polarity originates from {{the presence of the}} Schottky barrier near the Au/STO interface, in which there exist trapping states, such as oxygen vacancies and impurity states. The Schottky barrier width/height is changed due to the trapping/detrapping effect in the depletion layer [10, 14]. When a large forward-bias voltage is applied to the Schottky junction, electrons are <b>discharged</b> from the <b>trapping</b> states, resulting in unoccupied trapping states in the Schottky barrier. The increased density of positively charged trapping states in the depletion layer reduces the Schottky width/height, which results in the large leakage current simultaneously. So the Au/STO/Ti cell is switched to the LRS. In the lower-bias-voltage region, electrons can tunnel easily through the reduced Schottky barrier. When a large reverse-bias voltage is applied, electrons are captured in the trapping states, resulting in the reduction of the net positive charge in the depletion layer. This makes the barrier wider and higher, and the cell returns to the HRS. The trapped electrons seem to be released during a coming positive bias sweeping. The electroforming process is not required to realize this eightwise-polarity switching. This is because the high concentration of defects exists in the pristine junction due to the STO films prepared in an anoxic environment.|$|R

A model based on uniform trap generation throughout the oxide during the high-voltage stressing and subsequent tunnel charging and <b>discharging</b> of the <b>traps</b> within approximately 3 nm of either interface after the stress voltages were removed {{has been used to}} explain and accurately fit all of the thickness depen-dences of the trap generation and flatband voltage shifts. The thickness dependences of the transient and dc low-level leakage currents were explained on the basis of electrons tunneling both into, out of, and between the stress-generated traps. Both components of stress-induced leakage currents were proportional to the stress-generated trap densities when the thickness dependences of these currents were analyzed...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the energy loss through the steam trap in the steam system. In industry, steam traps {{frequently}} fail {{but they are not}} noticed except when they are leaking. If steam trap fail in failed open, live steam can escape to surrounding. High amount of energy will loss from the steam system. It takes weeks or months before it being repaired or replaced. The first objective {{of this study is to}} measure the heat loss for normal thermodynamic steam trap in respond to operating pressure for different condensate load. The second objective is to measure the heat loss for failed open thermodynamic steam trap in respond to operating pressure for different condensate load. The last objective is to compare energy loss between normal and failed open steam trap. From the last objective, the actual energy loss if failed steam trap is not repaired is determined. Thermodynamic steam trap has been tested in the experiment and the operating pressure is below 1 bar. Condensate that <b>discharges</b> from steam <b>trap</b> is collected to record the reading of its temperature and weight. These data is used to determine the energy loss through the steam trap. For normal steam trap, energy loss for high condensate load is higher than low condensate load. For failed open steam trap, energy loss for high condensate load is lower than low condensate load. Finally, after comparing the result, steam system that has low condensate load has higher energy loss compare to high condensate load...|$|R
40|$|Propagule {{dispersal}} of four mangrove species Rhizophora mucronata, R. apiculata, Ceriops tagal and Avicennia officinalis in the Pambala-Chilaw Lagoon Complex (Sri Lanka) was studied by combining a hydrodynamic model with species-specific knowledge on propagule dispersal behaviour. Propagule transport was simulated using a finite-volume advection-diffusion model {{to investigate the}} effect of dispersal vectors (tidal flow, freshwater <b>discharge</b> and wind), <b>trapping</b> agents (retention by vegetation) and seed characteristics (buoyancy) on propagule dispersal patterns. Sensitivity analysis showed that smaller propagules, like the oval-shaped propagules of Avicennia officinalis, dispersed over larger distances and were most sensitive to changing values of retention by mangrove vegetation compared to larger, torpedo-shaped propagules of Rhizophora spp. and C. tagal. Directional propagule dispersal in this semi-enclosed lagoon with a small tidal range was strongly concentrated towards {{the edges of the}} lagoon and channels. Short distance dispersal appeared to be the main dispersal strategy for all four studied species, with most of the propagules being retained within the vegetation. Only a small proportion (max. 5 %) of propagules left the lagoon through a channel connecting the lagoon with the open sea. Wind significantly influenced dispersal distance and direction once propagules entered the lagoon or adjacent channels. Implications of these findings for mangrove restoration were tested by simulating partial removal in the model of dikes around abandoned shrimp ponds to restore tidal hydrology and facilitate natural recolonisation by mangroves. The specific location of dike removal, (with respect to the vicinity of mangroves and independently suitable hydrodynamic flows), was found to significantly affect the resultant quantities and species of inflowing of propagules and hence the potential effectiveness of natural regeneration. These results demonstrate the value of propagule dispersal modelling in guiding hydrological restoration efforts that aim to facilitate natural mangrove regeneration...|$|R
