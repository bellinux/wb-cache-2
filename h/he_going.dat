Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E

The South Africans, subject to an international boycott caused by the apartheid policy of their government, were keen to see their individual cricketers compete with the world’s best.

25|$|Sage {{stated that}} on Sunday afternoon, July 22, Dillinger {{asked her if}} she {{wanted to go to the}} show with them, he and Polly.She asked him what show was <b>he</b> <b>going</b> to see, and he said he would 'like to see the theater around the corner,' meaning the Biograph Theater. She stated she was unable to leave the house to inform Purvis or Martin about Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph, but as they were going to have fried chicken for the evening meal, she told Polly she had nothing in which to fry the chicken, and was going to the store to get some butter; that while at the store she called Mr. Purvis and {{informed}} him of Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph that evening, at the same time obtaining the butter. She then returned to the house so Polly would not be suspicious that she went out to call anyone.|$|E

500|$|Entering 2008, Baseball America ranked Davis {{the number}} two {{prospect}} in the Rangers' organization, behind Elvis Andrus. Davis began the season playing first base for Frisco. He batted [...]333 with 62 hits, 13 home runs, and 42 RBI in 46 games before earning a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League. In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit [...]333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI. He {{was named to the}} All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in it because he was promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: [...] "I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but I put up these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was <b>he</b> <b>going</b> {{to be able to do}} it at the big league level?' The thing about it was, I just couldn't do it consistently. I couldn't put the bat on the ball. I was striking out an astronomical amount, and this year it's just been consistency day in and day out." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the final}} episode for actor Iwan Rheon, who had played Ramsay Bolton since Game of Thrones third season. His first {{appearance}} was in [...] "Dark Wings, Dark Words", as a then-unnamed [...] "boy" [...] who helps a captured Theon Greyjoy. Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow. In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, then I got the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they said that I said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because what else is <b>he</b> <b>going</b> to do after this? He's done so many things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's nice for the audience that he goes out on this high, if you will." [...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E
500|$|A comment he {{made during}} the debate became another {{campaign}} issue for Thompson. He again apologized for remarks, this time over an {{answer to a question}} in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is something that should be [...] "left up to the individual business." [...] A few days following the debate, the candidate rescinded the comments, and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid, stating that he [...] "didn't hear the question." [...] Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate, having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis, and that all he could think about [...] "was getting off the stage." [...] Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson's campaign became [...] "unrecoverable." [...] Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks. Jason Stephany, the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rhetorically asked [...] "How many times is <b>he</b> <b>going</b> to say something that's completely offensive to the majority of Americans before people start to say, 'What's going on here?'" [...] Thompson tried to reassure the public that there was [...] "nothing discriminatory about [...] at all." [...] Afterwards, he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin, with 84 of the 306 members polled, trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes. He stood at 16% in an average of statewide polls for the state in May, and stood at 4.3% in Iowa, where he based his campaign.|$|E

When's <b>he</b> <b>going</b> to decide that $100,000 is too much? (...) You're on a slippery slope here. You vote on somebody who decides that $250,000 and you're rich? And $100,000 and you're rich?

2500|$|In 1985, Lim {{tried his}} hand at {{directing}} with David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, retitled Paradise Heights, for the Drama Festival. The Straits Times Rebecca Chua found that Lim's debut as director [...] "displayed some uncertainty". In the same year, Lim resigned from The Straits Times to set up TheatreWorks in February. TheatreWorks, the first adult professional theatre company in Singapore, was formed to [...] "promote theatre that is relevant to Singaporeans" [...] and create work for English-language actors. Lim served as the company's press and media relations consultant, in addition to acting in several of their plays. Lim also acted in the English-language versions of Kuo Pao Kun's influential plays The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole (1985) and No Parking on Odd Days (1986). Both productions travelled to the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 1987. Of the role he originated in The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole, Lim remembers: [...] "For me, [...] was panic stations. I had never done a long monologue. In drama school, we had to prepare monologues based on a Shakespearean character. Nothing like this, which was 30 to 35 minutes long. And [...] spent {{at least a couple}} of weeks just talking to me. I was worried. Because I thought, when is <b>he</b> <b>going</b> to get down to it?" [...] In preparation, Kuo and Lim visited a coffin-maker and discussed the nature of funerals while Lim memorised the script.|$|E
2500|$|Newark {{burned in}} 1967, where {{six days of}} rioting left 26 dead, 1500 injured, and the inner city a burned out shell. In Detroit in 1967, Governor George Romney sent in 7400 {{national}} guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and on police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead, 2250 were injured, 4000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The biggest wave of riots came in April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this fell on deaf ears. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had {{lost control of the}} streets of major cities as well as his party. Johnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: [...] "What did you expect? I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's <b>he</b> <b>going</b> to do? He's going to knock your block off." ...|$|E
