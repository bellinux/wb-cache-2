40|$|A student model {{description}} language and its synthesis method are presented. The language called SMDL {{is based on}} a logic programming language taking 4 truth values such as true, false, unknown and fail. A modeling method called HSMIS is a new nonmonotonic model inference system and has the following major characteristics: (1) Model inference of logic program taking 4 truth values, (2) Treatment of nonmonotonicity of both student's belief and inference process itself. HSMIS incorporates de Kleer's ATMS as a vehicle for formulating the nonmonotonicity. Both SMDL interpreter and HSMIS have been implemented in Common ESP(Extended <b>Self-contained</b> <b>Prolog)</b> and incorporated into a framework for ITS, calle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Prolog’s {{ability to}} return {{multiple}} answers on backtracking provides an elegant mechanism to derive reversible encodings of combinatorial objects as Natural Numbers i. e. ranking and unranking functions. Starting from a generalization of Ackerman’s encoding of Hereditarily Finite Sets with Urelements and a novel tupling/untupling operation, we derive encodings for Finite Functions {{and use them}} as building blocks for an executable theory of Hereditarily Finite Functions. The more difficult problem of ranking and unranking Hereditarily Finite Permutations is then tackled using Lehmer codes and factoradics.

40|$|Abstract. A “pairing {{function}} ” J associates {{a unique}} natural number z to any two natural numbers x,y such that for two “unpairing functions” K and L, the equalities K(J(x,y)) =x, L(J(x,y)) =y and J(K(z),L(z)) =z hold. Using pairing functions on natural number representations of truth tables, we derive an encoding for Binary Decision Diagrams with the unique property that its boolean evaluation faithfully mimics its structural conversion to a a natural number through recursive {{application of a}} matching pairing function. We then use this result to derive ranking and unranking functions for BDDs and reduced BDDs. The paper is organized as a <b>self-contained</b> literate <b>Prolog</b> program, available a...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{organized}} as a <b>self-contained</b> literate <b>Prolog</b> program that implements elements of an executable finite set theory with focus on combinatorial generation and arithmetic encodings. The complete Prolog code {{is available at}} [URL]. First, ranking and unranking functions for some "mathematically elegant" data types in the universe of Hereditarily Finite Sets with Urelements are provided, resulting in arithmetic encodings for powersets, hypergraphs, ordinals and choice functions. After implementing a digraph representation of Hereditarily Finite Sets we define decoration functions that can recover well-founded sets from encodings of their associated acyclic digraphs. We conclude with an encoding of arbitrary digraphs and discuss a concept of duality induced by the set membership relation. In the process, we uncover the surprising possibility of internally sharing isomorphic objects, independently of their language level types and meanings. Comment: Unpublished draf...|$|R
40|$|Agent {{communities}} are self-organized virtual spaces {{consisting of a}} large number of agents and their dynamic environments. Within a community, agents group together offering special e-services for effective, reliable, and mutual benefits. Usually, an agent community is composed of specialized agents performing one or more tasks in a single domain/sub-domain, or in highly intersecting domains. However, secure Multi- Agent Systems require severe mechanisms in order to prevent malicious attacks. Several limits affect exiting secure agents platform, such as the lack of a strong authentication system, the lack of a flexible distributed mechanism for access control and the lack of a system for storing past behaviors of agent/user. Biometric owner agents authentication, agent/users policies to regulate agent''s behavior and actions, and agent/users reputation level to select trusted agents can be used to overcome the above limits and enhance the level of security for these applications. In this paper an extended JADE-S based framework for developing secure Multi-Agent Systems is proposed. The framework functionalities are <b>extended</b> by <b>self-contained</b> FPGA biometric sensors providing secure and fast user authentication service. Each agent owner, by means of biometric authentication, acquires his/her own X. 509 v 3 digital certificate. Policy files and a flexible, fast distributed Access Control Mechanism can regulate behavior and actions of any users/agent inside the platform. In addition, a mechanism based on the agent reputation is used: reputation is an attribute associated to each owner and/or agent on the basis of its past behavior and integrity. In order to prove the feasibility of the proposed framework, we have developed a multi-agent e-Banking system. System goal deals with e-Banking services such as bank account statements, account transactions and so on. In the paper, the experimental features of the biometric self-contained sensors are also outlined...|$|R
40|$|A concise {{supervision}} of food products during transport {{is an essential}} precondition {{for the improvement of}} their quality and reduction of losses. However, existing remote or telemetric systems implement only parts of the entire supervision task. Standard systems measure temperature only at one or two points, and the evaluation of sensor data has to be done manually. This thesis presents a system which measures a spatial profile of temperature and other parameters. The idea of remote transport supervision is <b>extended</b> to a <b>self-contained</b> sensor system that locally processes measurement data and detects critical situations autonomously. The algorithms for sensor data evaluation are implemented inside the means of transport; they can either share a common embedded processor unit or run separately on wireless sensors nodes, which are attached to the loaded freight objects. The system automatically adapts the supervision process to different kinds of goods. This intelligent container combines technologies from different fields, such as RFID, wireless sensor networks, and telemetric system, which have so far been applied separately. A shelf life model, based on the dynamic temperature profile, estimates the amount of quality loss during transport. The quality supervision is implemented as a set of software agents. Each freight object is supervised by an individual sensory way bill. A demonstration system for the {{supervision of}} food transports shows the feasibility of this new approach...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we address}} shortcomings of two important group communication layers, IP Multicast and gossip based message dissemination, {{both of which}} have scalability issues when the number of groups grows. We propose a transparent and backward-compatible layer called Dr. Multicast to allow data center administrators to enable IPMC for large numbers of groups without causing stability issues. Dr. Multicast optimizes IPMC resources by grouping together similar groups in terms of membership to minimize redundant transmissions as well as cost of ﬁltering unwanted messages. We then argue that when nodes belong to multiple groups, gossip based communication loses its appealing property of using ﬁxed amount of bandwidth. We propose a platform called GO (for Gossip Objects) that bounds the node’s bandwidth use to a customizable limit, prohibiting applications from joining groups that would cause the limit to be exceeded. Both systems incorporate optimizations that are based on group similarity or afﬁnity. We explore group afﬁnity in real data-sets from social networks and a trace from an industrial setting. We present new models to characterize overlaps between groups, and discuss our results in the context of Dr. Multicast and GO. The chapters on Dr. Multicast and GO are <b>self-contained,</b> <b>extended</b> versions of papers that appeared respectively in the ACM Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets) Workshop 2008 [85] and the International Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) Conference 2009 [87]...|$|R
40|$|Proof nets provide {{abstract}} {{counterparts to}} sequent proofs modulo rule permutations; {{the idea being}} that if two proofs have the same underlying proof-net, they are in essence the same proof. Providing a convincing proof-net counterpart to proofs in the classical sequent calculus is thus {{an important step in}} understanding classical sequent calculus proofs. By convincing, we mean that (a) there should be a canonical function from sequent proofs to proof nets, (b) {{it should be possible to}} check the correctness of a net in polynomial time, (c) every correct net should be obtainable from a sequent calculus proof, and (d) there should be a cut-elimination procedure which preserves correctness. Previous attempts to give proof-net-like objects for propositional classical logic have failed at least one of the above conditions. In [23], the author presented a calculus of proof nets (expansion nets) satisfying (a) and (b); the paper defined a sequent calculus corresponding to expansion nets but gave no explicit demonstration of (c). That sequent calculus, called LK∗ in this paper, is a novel one-sided sequent calculus with both additively and multiplicatively formulated disjunction rules. In this paper (a <b>self-contained</b> <b>extended</b> version of [23]), we give a full proof of (c) for expansion nets with respect to LK∗, and in addition give a cut-elimination procedure internal to expansion nets - this makes expansion nets the first notion of proof-net for classical logic satisfying all four criteria.
