5|$|Targets for NIF are {{extremely}} expensive. Each one {{consists of a}} small open ended metal cylinder with transparent double-pane windows sealing each end. In order to efficiently convert the driver laser's light to the x-rays that drive the compression, the cylinder has to be coated in gold or other heavy metals. Inside, suspended on fine plastic wires, is a hollow plastic sphere containing the fuel. In order to provide symmetrical implosion, the metal cylinder and plastic sphere have extremely high machining tolerances. The fuel, normally a gas at room temperature, is deposited inside the sphere and then cryogenically frozen until it sticks to the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sphere. It is then smoothed by slowly warming it with an infrared laser to form a 100µm smooth layer on the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pellet. Each target costs {{tens of thousands of}} dollars.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee to the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of the back of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nasal cavity and a ridge at the back of the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E
5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to the Moon {{was due to the}} {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas.

Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit {{a fair amount of}} diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
