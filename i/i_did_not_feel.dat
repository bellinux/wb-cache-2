According to Moberly, his {{appearance}} was [...] "most repulsive... its expression odious. His complexion was dark and rough." [...] Jourdain noted [...] "The man slowly turned his face, which was marked by smallpox; his complexion was very dark. The expression was evil and yet unseeing, and though <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that he was looking particularly at us, I felt a repugnance to going past him. A man later described as [...] "tall... with large dark eyes, and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat" [...] came up to them, and showed them the way to the Petit Trianon.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Quatermass {{met with}} a {{generally}} unenthusiastic critical response. Sean Day-Lewis wrote, [...] "Although Piers Haggard's direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some way since the 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s". The reviewer in The Daily Telegraph found Professor Quatermass [...] "far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest" [...] while The Times found the serial to be [...] "a so-so affair". More positive was the Daily Mail who thought the serial was [...] "not the best of Nigel Kneale but it equalled any of his earliest Quatermass stories". John Brosnan, writing in Starburst magazine, found the serial to be [...] "a bitter reaction {{by a member of}} an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the hippy movement with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It's very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it's the older people who are impervious to the malign alien influence". This view is echoed by filmmaker John Carpenter who said, [...] "Nigel was very embittered about the way of the world, as was shown, I think, in The Quatermass Conclusion".|$|E

[...] In the amphibious landing on February 19, 1945, Smith went ashore in the third wave of soldiers with his rifle but without his typewriter, which had been lost at sea. [...] Smith's Los Angeles Times column would occasionally recount his experiences during the battle. [...] On the subject of the iconic Iwo Jima flag raising, Smith addressed a sometimes discussed controversy of a second, larger American flag being raised to replace the initially planted one (as the first one was too small to be seen by the soldiers fighting on the island). [...] He recalled that he [...] "happened to look up at Mt. Suribachi from the beach that day and saw [...] rippling in the breeze. [...] <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> cheated because I had not seen the first one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morton's {{claim to}} have invented jazz in 1902 aroused resentment. The jazz historian, musician, and {{composer}} Gunther Schuller says of Morton's [...] "hyperbolic assertions" [...] that there is [...] "no proof to the contrary" [...] and that Morton's [...] "considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation". Alan Lomax, who recorded extensive biographical interviews of Morton at the Library of Congress in 1938, did not agree that Morton was an egoist: In being called a supreme egotist, Jelly Roll was often a victim of loose and lurid reporting. If we read the words that he himself wrote, we learn that he almost had an inferiority complex {{and said that he}} created is own style of jazz piano because [...] "All my fellow musicians were much faster in manipulations, I thought than I, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> as though I was in their class." [...] So he used a slower tempo to permit flexibility through the use of more notes, a pinch of Spanish to give a number of right seasoning, the avoidance of playing triple forte continuously, and many other points". --Quoted in John Szwed, Dr Jazz.|$|E

2500|$|But {{the plans}} to make the film with Jessel would fall through, for {{multiple}} reasons. Jessel's contract with Warner Bros. had not anticipated that the movie they had particularly signed him for would be made with sound (he'd made a modestly budgeted, silent comedy in the interim). When Warners had hits with two Vitaphone, though dialogue-less, features in late 1926, The Jazz Singer production had been reconceived. Jessel asked for a bonus or a new contract, but was rebuffed. According to Jessel's description in his autobiography, Harry Warner [...] "was {{having a tough time}} with the financing of the company.... He talked about taking care of me if the picture was a success. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that was enough." [...] In fact, around the beginning of 1927, Harry Warner—the eldest of the brothers who ran the eponymous studio—had sold $4 million (US$ in [...] dollars) of his personal stock to keep the studio solvent. Then came another major issue. According to Jessel, a first read of screenwriter Alfred A. Cohn's adaptation [...] "threw me into a fit. Instead of the boy's leaving the theatre and following the traditions of his father by singing in the synagogue, as in the play, the picture scenario had him return to the Winter Garden as a blackface comedian, with his mother wildly applauding in the box. I raised hell. Money or no money, I would not do this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruddock {{went back}} to Japan in 1966 {{specifically}} to learn Aikido, travelling six weeks by sea. He first saw Ueshiba about four days after he started regular training. [...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. I knew what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
