5|$|As America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified, Motley joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 {{and was sent}} to the <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> Naval Training Station. There he played for the <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> Navy Bluejackets, a military team coached by Paul Brown, who was serving in the Navy during an extended leave from his job as head coach of The Ohio State University's football team. Motley played fullback and linebacker at <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes,</b> and was {{an important component of the}} team's offense and defense. The highlight of his time at <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> was a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame in 1945. Motley was eligible for discharge before the game – it was the final match of the season and the last military game of World War II – but he stayed on to play. Motley put up an impressive performance, thanks in part to Brown's experimentation with a new play: a delayed handoff later called the draw play.|$|E

Brown, however, noticed Collier's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes,</b> bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes.</b>|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.|$|E

In order to increase the size of the reservoir at the <b>Great</b> <b>Lake,</b> and increase the water available to the important Waddamana Power Stations, Arthurs Lake was created in the 1920s with the damming of several creeks and water was pumped from it into the <b>Great</b> <b>Lake</b> as required by the station. With the construction of the much larger Poatina Power Station in 1966 to replace Waddamana, Tods Corner was added to recover some of the energy used by the pump systems. The power station is located on the south-eastern shore of <b>Great</b> <b>Lake</b> and is supplied with water via a 105 m-long penstock connected to an open flume which carries the discharge from Arthurs Lake Pumping Station.|$|R
