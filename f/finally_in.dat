5|$|By rationalisation, Weber {{understood}} first, {{the individual}} cost-benefit calculation, second, the wider, bureaucratic organisation of the organisations and <b>finally,</b> <b>in</b> {{the more general}} sense as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic (disenchantment).|$|E
5|$|<b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> 1997, an {{agreement}} was signed at the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) conference at Doha that established a QIZ agreement with Jordan. On 6 March 1998, the Al-Hassan Zone in Irbid was designated the first QIZ in Jordan.|$|E

Two storage boxes were attached to the DFI pallet, with more stored in six of the Getaway Special canisters.|$|E

50|$|However, these {{technical}} obstacles were <b>finally</b> overcome <b>in</b> 2008, {{and software}} written by developer Richard Russell at the informal Colour Recovery Working Group {{was put to}} use, <b>finally</b> resulting <b>in</b> the broadcast and release of colour-recovered episodes of Dad's Army and Doctor Who.|$|R
5|$|<b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since {{even a small}} amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population. Generally, {{sympatric speciation}} in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.|$|E
5|$|In American football, the Washington Redskins {{joined the}} National Football League in 1932 as the Boston Braves. In 1933, {{the name was}} changed to the Boston Redskins, and <b>finally,</b> <b>in</b> 1937 the Redskins moved to Washington, D.C. The Redskins' first {{selection}} as an NFL team was Riley Smith, a blocking back from Alabama. The team's most-recent first-round selection was Jonathan Allen, a defensive lineman from Alabama.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Tiridates, {{backed by}} his brother, {{refused to go}} to Rome, and even engaged in {{operations}} against those Armenians whom he deemed were loyal to Rome. Tension mounted and <b>finally,</b> <b>in</b> the early spring of 58, war broke out.|$|E

5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of deflector plates.|$|E
5|$|The Tulunid triumph was {{to prove}} ephemeral, however. In 893 Abu'l-Abbas, now Caliph, succeeded in regaining the Jaziran provinces by treaty, and after Khumarawayh's death in 896, took {{advantage}} of Tyulunid weakness to recover northern Syria and Cilicia as well. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> 905 the Abbasids launched a campaign that rapidly brought {{about the end of}} Tulunid autonomy and fully re-incorporated their lands into the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} managed by Network SouthEast also under BR. Following the {{privatisation}} of British Rail, {{ownership and management}} passed to Railtrack in April 1994 and <b>finally,</b> <b>in</b> 2002, to Network Rail.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius {{seems to}} have tired of {{politics}} at this point. In AD22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus, and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD23, Drusus mysteriously died, and Tiberius {{seems to have}} {{made no effort to}} elevate a replacement. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> AD26, Tiberius retired from Rome altogether to the island of Capri.|$|E
5|$|When I-94 was {{completed}} in 1963, M-29 south of 23Mile Road was routed onto it down to present day exit235. Three years later, a realignment in Marysville, realigned M-29 onto the Busha Highway, returning the old route to local control. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> 1971, M-29 south of exit243 on I-94 was truncated back to its present-day terminus, and the route has existed as such since then.|$|E

5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> recognition of the vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved {{from the sides of}} the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} Barcelona, Gaudí {{frequently}} changed his address: {{as a student}} he lived in residences, generally {{in the area of}} the Gothic Quarter; when he started his career he moved around several rented flats in the Eixample area. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> 1906, he settled in a house in the Güell Park that he owned and which had been constructed by his assistant Francesc Berenguer as a showcase property for the estate. It has since been transformed into the Gaudí Museum. There he lived with his father (who died in 1906 at the age of 93) and his niece Rosa Egea Gaudí (who died in 1912 at the age of 36). He lived in the house until 1925, several months before his death, when he began residing inside the workshop of the Sagrada Família.|$|E

5|$|After {{the brigade}} had been disbanded in June 1948, its battalions were reformed, by {{renumbering}} {{those in the}} 2nd Parachute Brigade. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion became the 2nd Parachute Battalion, the 4th/6th Parachute Battalion the 1st Parachute Battalion, and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion the 3rd Parachute Battalion. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> July 1948, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade Group, taking its one and six numbers from the two wartime divisions.|$|E
5|$|As 1943 {{gave way}} to 1944, many {{problems}} remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of the}} product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process.|$|E
5|$|At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Metternich and his {{conservative}} allies had reestablished the Spanish monarchy under King Ferdinand VII. Over the following forty years, {{the great powers}} supported the Spanish monarchy, but events in 1868 would further test the old system. A revolution in Spain overthrew Queen Isabella II, and the throne remained empty while Isabella lived in sumptuous exile in Paris. The Spanish, looking for a suitable Catholic successor, had offered the post to three European princes, each of whom was rejected by Napoleon III, who served as regional power-broker. <b>Finally,</b> <b>in</b> 1870 the Regency offered the crown to Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a prince of the Catholic cadet Hohenzollern line. The ensuing furor has been dubbed by historians as the Hohenzollern candidature.|$|E
