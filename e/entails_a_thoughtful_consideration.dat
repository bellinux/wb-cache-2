However, current trends suggest little of the dysfunction of prior mega event hosting will automatically disappear with a change of geographic focus to emergent economies. Indeed, whilst location may change, cultural content, organisation and, critically, uneven socio-economic outcomes appear depressingly resistant to change. There is, therefore, an opportunity to refashion the hosting of mega events in ways which are more embedded, locally oriented, inclusive and diverse, {{but only if the}} objectives and metrics of success are wider than the purely financial or economic-developmental.

40|$|In {{his plea}} for a land ethic, Aldo Leopold (1949 / 1970) retold {{the story of}} Odys-seus, on his return from Troy, hanging a dozen slave girls of his {{household}} for sus-pected misbehavior. Leopold noted, This hanging involved no question of propriety. The girls were property. The dis-posal of property was then, as now, a matter of expediency, not of right and wrong. (p. 237) Leopold was, of course, concerned with the absence of consideration for wild nature in our ethical systems and our treatment of land as mere property. We no lon-ger find it acceptable to treat humans as property, at least in such a flagrant manner as in Odysseus’s time, but other living creatures remain governed by the dictates of expediency rather than right and wrong. <b>A</b> <b>thoughtful</b> <b>consideration</b> {{of the relationship between}} animals and society raises important questions.

Nonethe-less, social scientists can provide fruitful answers as to the forces that lead to vari-ous types of relationships between society and animals.

And it really {{seemed as if}} she were for the first time inclined to heed the lessons of civilization and profit by her new condition. An agreeable change was first noticed in her appearance. Her lawless hair was caught in a net, and no longer strayed over her low forehead. Her unstable bust was stayed and upheld by French corsets; her plantigrade shuffle was limited by heeled boots. Her dresses were neat and clean, and she wore a double necklace of glass beads. With this physical improvement there also seemed some moral awakening. She no longer stole nor lied. With the possession of personal property came a respect for that of others. With increased dependence on the word of those about her came <b>a</b> <b>thoughtful</b> <b>consideration</b> of her own. Intellectually she was still feeble, although she grappled sturdily with the simple lessons which Miss Portfire set before her. But her zeal and simple vanity outran her discretion, and she would often sit for hours with an open book before her, which she could not read. She was a favorite with the officers at the fort, from the Major, who shared his daughter's prejudices and often yielded to her powerful self-will, to the subalterns, who liked her none the less that their natural enemies, the frontier volunteers, had declared war against her helpless sisterhood. The only restraint put upon her was the limitation of her liberty to the enclosure of the fort and parade; and only once did she break this parole, and was stopped by the sentry as she stepped into a boat at the landing.|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>thoughtful</b> <b>consideration</b> of {{strategies}} for handling uncertainty in policy development offers advantages {{in the management}} of a social-ecological system. Uncertainty is inherent in policy development and introduces a risk of adverse consequences of policy and a blockage in the policy development process. Scientists and practitioners often consider the handling of uncertainty difficult. The contribution of this thesis is that it connects the understanding of uncertainty and related methods and rationales of uncertainty handling from different fields of scientific literature: (participatory) policy analysis, network and process management and adaptive and resilience management. This thesis offers a comprehensive and interdisciplinary conceptual framework for handling uncertainty in policy development. The framework is inspired by water management cases, but is expected to be more widely applicable. Uncertainty in policy development is defined as the absence of complete and shared understanding of the system subject to policy development, a definition that frames uncertainty as related to both substantive and process aspects of policy development. The primary focus of the thesis is on the substantive aspects of policy development and related substantive uncertainty, but it specifically considers the close relationship to the process of actor interaction resulting in strategic and institutional uncertainty. The core of the framework consists of two variables to classify uncertainty handling in policy development, represented by two intersecting axes. The first is the method used for handling uncertainty, for which the framework reflects a variety of methods based on scientific analysis and process management. The second variable is the rationale of uncertainty handling, for which the framework shows a range of rationales from system control to system resilience. The chapters of this thesis provide insight into the merits and trade-offs of one-sided uses of a type of method or a specific rationale, and opportunities for complementary approaches. The presented framework offers structure when choosing an uncertainty handling strategy. An appropriate uncertainty handling strategy for complex policy development processes probably combines approaches. The broader perspective on uncertainty handling presented is argued to equate uncertainty literature with the wider perspective on policy development emerging in water management and other fields...|$|R

The Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) also recognizes this challenge, describing one of the three core functions of public health as “assuring that all populations have access to appropriate and cost effective care, including health promotion and disease prevention services. ” To achieve this core function, the ASPH cites “a competent public health and personal healthcare workforce” as one of the ten essential public health services.
