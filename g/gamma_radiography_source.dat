No evidence of radiation exposure, as indicated by dicentric or translocation aberrations in chromosomes from blood lymphocytes, was found in 22 persons.

40|$|Corrosion under {{insulation}} {{is difficult}} to measure by the available techniques of ultrasound and <b>gamma</b> or x-ray <b>radiography.</b> In this work a Lab experiment was performed that simulate a real case where pipe corrosion (wall thinning) was measured by backscattered gamma rays. A collimated gamma ray beam of 1 cm diameter from 10 mCi 137 Cs source was allowed to be incident on carbon steel pipes. The pipes were having different wall thicknesses and different diameters and were wrapped with about 5 cm commercially available insulator. The beam penetrates the insulator without significant interaction. Upon interaction with the pipe wall the scattered radiation, due to Compton process, was measured by 2 x 2 NaI(Tl) scintillation detector located beside the source. Because gamma ray energy of scattered radiation depends on the angle of scattering, which was kept constant, all gamma ray photons reaching the detector were having the same energy. The backscattered radiation made very clear and well resolved peak on the multi-channel analyzer. Counts under the peak versus wall thickness showed almost linear response {{up to more than}} 1 cm wall thickness. The small increase in counts from the insulator are constant can be considered part of the background since corrosion takes place in the pipe only. Data showed that a fraction of a millimeter change in thickness can be detectable for 2 min counting time. This can be improved by extending the collection time or by using a stronger source. This method is non-contact, therefore can be used at any pipe temperature. The counts were, relatively, insensitive to pipe wall diameters; this may be an advantage because it makes the calibration process much easier. On the other hand the counts were sensitive to change in distance between the pipe and the detector. Because the activity used was only few mCi, the system is much safer to use compared to <b>gamma</b> <b>radiography</b> where <b>source</b> strength of about 100 Ci is usually used. The exposure rate was very close to background at about 1 m when the beam was open...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{detection}} of assembled nuclear devices and concealed special nuclear materials (SNM) such as plutonium or uranium in commercial cargo traffic {{is a major}} challenge in mitigating {{the threat of nuclear}} terrorism. Currently available radiographic and active interrogation systems use ∼ 1 – 10 MeV bremsstrahlung photon beams. Although simple to build and operate, bremsstrahlung-based systems deliver high radiation doses to the cargo and to potential stowaways. To eliminate problematic issues of high dose, we are developing a novel technique known as multiple monoenergetic <b>gamma</b> <b>radiography</b> (MMGR). MMGR uses ion-induced nuclear reactions to produce two monoenergetic <b>gammas</b> for dual-energy <b>radiography.</b> This allows us to image the areal density and effective atomic number (Zeff) of scanned cargo. We present initial results from the proof-of-concept experiment, which was conducted at the MIT Bates Research and Engineering Center. The purpose of the experiment was to assess the capabilities of MMGR to measure areal density and Zeff of container cargo mockups. The experiment used a 3. 0 MeV radiofrequency quadrupole accelerator to create sources of 4. 44 MeV and 15. 11 MeV gammas from the 11 B(d,nγ) 12 C reaction in a thick natural boron target; the gammas are detected by an array of NaI(Tl) detectors after transmission through cargo mockups. The measured fluxes of transmitted 4. 44 MeV and 15. 11 MeV gammas were used to assess the areal density and Zeff. Initial results show that MMGR is capable of discriminating the presence of high-Z materials concealed in up to 30 cm of iron shielding from low- and mid-Z materials present in the cargo mockup...|$|R
40|$|Gamma-ray and fast-neutron imaging was {{performed}} {{with a novel}} liquid xenon (LXe) scintillation detector read out by a Gaseous Photomultiplier (GPM). The 100 mm diameter detector prototype comprised a capillary-filled LXe converter/scintillator, coupled to a triple-THGEM imaging-GPM, with its first electrode coated by a CsI UV-photocathode, operated in Ne/ 5 %CH 4 cryogenic temperatures. Radiation localization in 2 D was derived from scintillation-induced photoelectron avalanches, measured on the GPM's segmented anode. The localization properties of Co- 60 gamma-rays and a mixed fast-neutron/gamma-ray field from an AmBe neutron source were derived from irradiation of a Pb edge absorber. Spatial resolutions of 12 +/- 2 mm and 10 +/- 2 mm (FWHM) were reached with Co- 60 and AmBe sources, respectively. The experimental results are in good agreement with GEANT 4 simulations. The calculated ultimate expected resolutions for our application-relevant 4. 4 and 15. 1 MeV gamma-rays and 1 - 15 MeV neutrons are 2 - 4 mm and ~ 2 mm (FWHM), respectively.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{mathematical}} model to find the optimal inspection strategy for detecting a nuclear weapon (or nuclear material to make a weapon) from being smuggled into the United States in a shipping container, subject to constraints of port congestion and an overall budget. We consider an 11 -layer security system consisting of shipper certification, container seals, and a targeting software system, followed by passive (neutron and <b>gamma),</b> active (<b>gamma</b> <b>radiography),</b> and manual testing at overseas and domestic ports. Currently implemented policies achieve a low detection probability, and improved security requires passive and active testing of trusted containers and manually opening containers that cannot be penetrated by radiography. The annual cost of achieving a high detection probability of a plutonium weapon using existing equipment in traditional ways is roughly several billion dollars if testing is done domestically, and is approximately five times higher if testing is performed overseas. Our results suggest that employing high-energy x-ray radiography and elongating the passive neutron tests at overseas ports may provide significant cost savings, and several developing technologies, radiation sensors inside containers and tamper-resistant electronic seals, should be pursued aggressively. Further effort is critically needed to develop a practical neutron interrogation scheme that reliably detects moderately shielded, highly enriched uranium.

Also, the indirect method for image formation was implemented for two types of converters: indium and dysprosium. Growth curves for optical density were also made according to contact time between converter-film, for different types of films. The resolution of the facility was also analyzed using two methods: Klasens (1946) and Harms (1986). Harms method came closer to the resolution of the human eye when compared to the Klasens method.

5000|$|Industrial {{radiography}} {{appears to}} have one of the worst safety profiles of the radiation professions, possibly because there are many operators using strong gamma sources (> 2 Ci) in remote sites with little supervision when compared with workers within the nuclear industry or within hospitals. Due to the levels of radiation present whilst they are working many radiographers are also required to work late at night when there are few other people present as most industrial radiography is carried out 'in the open' rather than in purpose built exposure booths or rooms.

40|$|Radioisotopes are {{radioactive}} {{versions of}} the natural chemical elements, differing from these only in their nuclear mass and {{in their ability to}} emit radiations. They are produced mainly by neutron bombardment of ordinary materials in a nuclear reactor. The most important radiations are beta particles (fast electrons of nuclear origin) and gamma rays (penetrating electromagnetic radiations). These are detected with ionization chambers, Geiger counters or scintillation counters. In production control, the absorption or scattering of radiations is used as a measure of material thickness, and in some cases, of its atomic number. Radioactive tracers aid in production research in rapid determination of mixing efficiencies and hold-up times. Tracers are also used in the non-destructive testing of materials and components and in more basic research into alloy structure. In this latter research, photographic films are used to produce autoradiographs which show the micro-scopic distribution of radioactively labelled constituents. Radioactivation by neutron irradiation enables certain impurities to be assayed at sub-microgram levels without chemical separation. The wear of engine parts can be measured, in a fraction of the time taken for orthodox methods, by making the parts in question radioactive and measuring the worn radioactive debris in circulating lubricant. Cutting tools can be measured similarly by assaying radio-active debris attached to the swarf.

40|$|An {{air cargo}} {{inspection}} system combining two nuclear reaction based techniques, namely Fast-Neutron Resonance <b>Radiography</b> and Dual-Discrete-Energy <b>Gamma</b> <b>Radiography</b> {{is currently being}} developed. This system is expected to allow detection of standard and improvised explosives as well as special nuclear materials. An important aspect for the applicability of nuclear techniques in an airport inspection facility is the inventory and lifetimes of radioactive isotopes produced by the neutron and gamma radiation inside the cargo, {{as well as the}} dose delivered by these isotopes to people in contact with the cargo during and following the interrogation procedure. Using MCNPX and CINDER 90 we have calculated the activation levels for several typical inspection scenarios. One example is the activation of various metal samples embedded in a cotton-filled container. To validate the simulation results, a benchmark experiment was performed, in which metal samples were activated by fast-neutrons in a water-filled glass jar. The induced activity was determined by analyzing the gamma spectra. Based on the calculated radioactive inventory in the container, the dose levels due to the induced gamma radiation were calculated at several distances from the container and in relevant time windows after the irradiation, in order to evaluate the radiation exposure of the cargo handling staff, air crew and passengers during flight. The possibility of remanent long-lived radioactive inventory after cargo is delivered to the client is also of concern and was evaluated. Comment: Proceedings of FNDA 201...|$|R
