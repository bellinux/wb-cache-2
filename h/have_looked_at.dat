Scientists <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the properties of giraffe skin when developing suits for astronauts and fighter pilots because the people in these professions {{are in danger of}} passing out if blood rushes to their legs. Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using reaction–diffusion mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine {{was born}} in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At the request of her parents, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court {{statutory}} powers to act on her behalf. Police described Madeleine as blonde haired, with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye. In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine.|$|E

25|$|A {{few studies}} <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the role of}} cystatin C or the CST3 gene in age-related macular degeneration. Cystatin C has also been {{investigated}} as a prognostic marker in several forms of cancer. Its role in pre-eclampsia remains to be confirmed.|$|E

25|$|Few studies <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the {{percentage}} of the time wisdom teeth are present or the rate of wisdom teeth eruption. The lack of up to five teeth (excluding third molars, i.e. wisdom teeth) is termed hypodontia. Missing third molars occur in 9-30% of studied populations.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{few studies}} <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the impact of}} {{elevated}} carbon dioxide concentrations on whole farming systems. Most models study the relationship between CO2 and productivity in isolation from other factors associated with climate change, such as an increased frequency of extreme weather events, seasonal shifts, and so on.|$|E

25|$|Domestication {{of plants}} such as maize, rice, barley, wheat etc. {{has also been a}} {{significant}} driving force in their evolution. Some studies <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the origins of the maize plant and found that maize is a domesticated derivative of a wild plant from Mexico called teosinte. Teosinte belongs to the genus Zea, just as maize, but bears very small inflorescence, 5–10 hard cobs, and a highly branched and spread-out stem.|$|E
25|$|Within {{days of his}} {{confession}} in open court, Heirens denied any responsibility for the murders. Mary Jane Blanchard, daughter of murder victim Josephine Ross, {{was one of the}} first dissenters, being quoted in 1946 as saying:I cannot believe that young Heirens murdered my mother. He just does not fit into the picture of my mother's death... I <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> all the things Heirens stole and there was nothing of my mother's things among them.|$|E
25|$|Thinkers such as John Fiske <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> how audiences use {{popular media}} {{to get their}} own {{enjoyment}} from them, claiming, in a diametrically opposed fashion to much other media theory, that popular media, and thus the popular culture they are both part of and help create, can actually be progressive as audiences struggle to use these media for their own individual purposes, and the media then shift to accommodate these purposes.|$|E

25|$|Many studies <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the {{bereaved}} {{in terms of}} increased risks for stress-related illnesses. Colin Murray Parkes in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, and so forth {{in the first six}} months following a death. Others have noted increased mortality rates (Ward, A.W. 1976) and Bunch et al. found a five times greater risk of suicide in teens following the death of a parent.|$|E
25|$|Attentional control {{refers to}} an individual's {{capacity}} to choose what they pay attention to and what they ignore. The ability to regulate and direct attention releases the child from the constraints of only responding to environmental events, and means they are able actively to guide their attention towards the information-rich areas key for learning. For example, a number of authors <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the relationship between an infants' capacity to exercise attentional control and their subsequent performance during language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Reviews {{have found}} no {{association}} between aspartame and cancer. These reviews <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> numerous carcinogenicity studies in animals, epidemiologic studies in humans, {{as well as in}} vitro genotoxicity studies. These studies {{have found no}} significant evidence that aspartame causes cancer in animals, damages the genome, or causes cancer in humans at doses currently used. This position is supported by multiple regulatory agencies like the FDA and EFSA as well as scientific bodies such as the National Cancer Institute. Aspartame did not show any DNA-damaging properties either.|$|E

The Smart city proposals of the “winning” cities offer insights into how citizens, States and ULBs have interpreted this smartness differently. The way Bhubaneswar <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{it is not}} quite the way Pune <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it. That is why this Mission is refreshingly different.|$|R

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{research}} within the last decade outlining some studies that <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions on young children. There have also been several studies done studying this cross culturally. One study that explored this relationship, was a study conducted in 2009 by Eadaoin Hui and Tat Sing Chau. In this study, Hui and Chau looked at the relationship between forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who {{were less likely to}} forgive those who had wronged them. The findings of this study showed that there was an effect of forgiveness interventions on the young Chinese children.|$|E
25|$|Reviews have {{analyzed}} {{studies which}} <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the consumption of}} aspartame in countries worldwide, including the United States, countries in Europe, and Australia, among others. These reviews have found that even {{the high levels of}} intake of aspartame, studied across multiple countries and different methods of measuring aspartame consumption, are well below the ADI for safe consumption of aspartame. Reviews have also found that populations that are believed to be especially high consumers of aspartame such as children and diabetics are below the ADI for safe consumption, even considering extreme worst-case scenario calculations of consumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} text has undergone numerous changes, with the oldest known version dated May 1612, through the rewriting effort {{commissioned by the}} then regent of Johor, Yang di-Pertuan Di Hilir Raja Abdullah. It was originally written in the Classical Malay on traditional paper in old Jawi script, but today exists in 32 different manuscripts, including those in Rumi script. Notwithstanding some of its mystical contents, historians <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the text as a primary source of information on past events verifiable by other historical sources, in the Malay world. In 2001, the Malay Annals was listed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme International Register.|$|E
