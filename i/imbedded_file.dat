40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This file comprises a teaching package designed to introduce students to analysis of manuscript schedules {{of the nineteenth century}} census for social, urban, family, and demographic history. Main Topics : Variables The files are designed for use with SPSS. They are organized to illustrate constrasts among cities at different stages of industrialization and the demographic transition in Europe and America: Pisa, Italy (1841), Amiens, France (1851), Stockport, England (1841 and 1851), and Providence, United States (1850, 1865 and 1880). The rural district around Pisa and part of Providence County are also included. Summaries <b>imbedded</b> in the <b>file</b> permit analysis at the individual, household, or nuclear unit level. The package also contains a coursebook with explanation of each variable, a dictionary with occupational titles that appear in the censuses, course syllabus, and other instructions for use. The files are being used in the separate ongoing research of the two principal investigators and should be used for instructional purposes only. This teaching package can be supplied only in the format provided to ICPSR, as two card-image data files, two files of SPSS instruction cards, and associated printed documentation. /,br> Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|R
40|$|In the Pacific Northwest, {{migration}} {{is a critical}} life history component of native anadromous fishes including Pacific salmon, steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus spp), and Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus). Improving fish passage at dams during upstream spawning migration has been a central objective of population recovery efforts in the region for several decades. Unfortunately, the structural and operational details of fishways along with behavioral information collected during fish monitoring projects are often distributed among many stakeholders, including: dam managers, {{state and local government}} agencies, researchers and tribal authorities. In an effort to facilitate efficient communication between stakeholders, link fishway geometry with research results and passage information, and provide an interactive archive of fishway information, we developed a visual wiki page for Bonneville Dam (Columbia River). The 3 -D model of the fishway is the foundation upon which key information is mapped in interactive links. We selected Google/Trimble Sketchup as the platform to build this model based on the criterion of cost, accessibility, and ease of use. Sketchup can readily <b>imbed</b> links to <b>files</b> within the model to allow for spatial reference to ancillary information sources (photos, videos, reports, etc). Information is then organized on layers based on context (e. g., images, history of fishway modifications, water elevation, fishway passage efficiency, etc). The individual layers can be filtered by stakeholders to synthesize information on fish passage based on management concerns or reporting requirements. This presentation describes the implementation of this tool using the upstream migration of Pacific Lamprey at the north shore of Bonneville Dam as a case study. We will review the modelâ€™s functionality and demonstrate capabilities of this tool {{to bridge the gap between}} stakeholders and the reference information they need to support decision making on fishway passage decisions, including structural and operational improvements...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of ASCA {{observations}} of a heterogenous sample of 15 spiral galaxies. 8 are LINERs or low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN), 5 are starburst galaxies and 2 are normal spiral galaxies. We find that in all cases the ASCA spectra can be described by a canonical model consisting of a power-law with a photon index ~ 1. 7 - 2. 0, plus a soft optically thin emission component with kT ~ 0. 6 - 0. 8 keV. The implied element abundances are often sub-solar. The soft component is usually extended and the nuclear, point-like emission is sometimes absorbed by column densities in the range log nH ~ 21 - 23 cm- 2. The relative luminosities of the soft and hard components vary from galaxy to galaxy. For the LINERs, the 2 - 10 keV luminosity of the hard component is typically log L ~ 40 - 41 ergs/s whereas the 0. 5 - 2. 0 keV luminosity of the soft component is typically log L ~ 39 - 40 ergs/s. For starbursts, the 2 - 10 keV luminosity of is log L ~ 39 - 40 ergs/s, somewhat lower than the corresponding luminosity {{of most of the}} LINERs in our sample. The hard component is similar to the observed X-ray spectra of quasars and also to the intrinsic X-ray spectra of classical Seyfert galaxies. Most of the galaxies in our sample exhibit no significant (dI/I > 20 %) short-term variability (with timescales of a day or less) whereas long-term variability is common. We present a case study of the LINER M 81 in detail where there is evidence of large-amplitude (dI/I ~ 70 %) variability over several weeks. There is also clear evidence for a broad, complex Fe-K emission line which is compatible with an origin in an accretion disk viewed at ~ 40 deg. These results suggest a strong connection between classical AGN, LINERs, and starburst galaxies. Comment: 20 pages, 18 postscript <b>files</b> <b>imbedded</b> as 11 figure...|$|R
