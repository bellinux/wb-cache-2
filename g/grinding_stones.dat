5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} <b>grinding</b> <b>stones.</b> The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|The stone tool {{technology}} in {{use during the}} Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian are gradually displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, end and side scrapers, <b>grinding</b> <b>stones,</b> and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades {{may have been used}} during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, microlithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.|$|E

40|$|Elastic <b>grinding</b> <b>stone</b> such as P. V. A {{generally}} have some special constitution compared with ordinary <b>grinding</b> <b>stone.</b> At <b>grinding</b> process by elastic <b>grinding</b> <b>stone</b> the stoneradius of curvature exceedingly increase and abrasive grains play displacement and rotation by grinding forces such as results grain {{depth of cut}}, depth of cut and grinding force exceedingly decrease. On the other hand different grain depth of cut at the contact arc length and increased negative rake angle of the abrasive grain would induce vibration and burnish action. These phenomena would effectively contribute to good grinding surface. 弾性研削においては砥石の構成要素が普通砥石とやや趣きを異にするのと，結合剤が弾性に富むために，砥石が研削抵抗を受けると，その曲率半径に変化を来し，又砥粒自身は変位と転動を起し，この砥石の特性や砥粒の挙動が，研削抵抗や仕上面の祖さに大きな役割を果すものである。本稿はこれらの諸項について，平面研削を対象として理論的な解析を試みたものである...|$|R

50|$|About thirty seven knapping hammers were collected, thirty two of {{them were}} {{unbroken}} and weigh anywhere from 15 to 25 g a piece. Out of all the knapping stones only one was quartz and a preferred type of hammer—pieces of flattened ovoid shape were apparent in the discovery. Twelve pounding stones were collected, with maximum dimensions of 68 to 118 mm and a mean of 87 mm. Four anvils were collected, three being quartz and one on chert cobble. Seven rubbing stones were collected and only one <b>grinding</b> <b>stone.</b> However, the <b>grinding</b> <b>stone</b> was 67 mm thick and was grounded to a depth of twelve mm. The last use for the <b>grinding</b> <b>stone</b> was for a red pigment.|$|R

25|$|Water {{was brought}} to the mill in an open ditch (zanja) from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea {{designed}} an unusual horizontal, direct impulse water wheel. There were three vaulted water chambers on the ground floor and a single horizontal water wheel. The water wheel was attached to a vertical shaft that went up to the second level (the current entrance room) where the <b>grinding</b> <b>stones</b> were located. One of the <b>grinding</b> <b>stones</b> was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the water wheel. A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the wheel turning with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.|$|E

25|$|West Acre mill was a four-storey building, with a brick-built {{ground floor}} and the upper storeys built in weatherboarded timber. It had a pantiled roof, with a mill house attached. The ground floor of the mill dated from the 15th century, and {{appeared}} to be built from material obtained from West Acre Abbey. The water wheel drove four pairs of <b>grinding</b> <b>stones,</b> although only two were used in later years. The four-level stone driving frame, which allowed all four wheels to be operated at once, was noted as an outstanding example of milling machinery in the 1950s, when the building was surveyed, but it was demolished in 1959, as it was deemed to be unsafe. The mill house remains.|$|E
25|$|Zia farming {{produced}} {{a wide array}} of crops, but {{the most important of these}} were maize, beans, and squash, nicknamed the three sisters. These crops were planted in shared or common ground, which everyone contributed. They were the staple of Zia and Pueblo diets. Corn was the most important of all. While some was eaten fresh, most was stored away in pots and cellars for the winter and droughts. When some of the corn dried, it was turned into flour and bread by the women. They would sit outside at <b>grinding</b> <b>stones,</b> singing religious songs while rubbing stones against the corn, producing flour. They sang, because they considered the corn to be sacred.|$|E
