40|$|SummaryBackgroundPatient {{adherence}} to recommended use of ICS is questionable in asthma, with irregular use or interruptions occurring frequently. Factors explaining discontinuation of controller therapy could orientate interventions. The characteristics {{of patients with}} interruptions of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), intentional or accidental, were investigated. MethodsAsthma patients regularly prescribed ICS by GPs (Cegedim network) were included. Patients' characteristics and behaviours toward ICS (accidental/intentional interruptions, less frequent use of ICS and change in dosing) were identified from self-report questionnaires, and linked to data prescription database. Interrelations between declared behaviours toward ICS were studied with a Multiple Component Analysis (MCA) and the correlates of ICS interruptions were identified. ResultsDuring the past 3 months, 31. 6 % of 204 patients (mean age: 53. 8 years, females: 59. 3 %) intentionally interrupted ICS when feeling better, 25. 4 % forgot ICS and 18. 3 % deliberately changed the doses. A quarter of patients considered constant use of respiratory medicines as unhealthy. MCA revealed that intentional, accidental interruptions and less frequent use of ICS were closely correlated. Risk of <b>intentional</b> <b>interruption</b> was increased when patients considered constant use of respiratory therapy to be unhealthy (OR= 3. 36, 95 %CI=[1. 47 – 7. 66]). Conversely, risk was significantly lower when ICS was associated or combined with another controller (OR= 0. 24, 95 %CI=[0. 08 – 0. 73]), compared to ICS in monotherapy. Less frequent interruptions were observed in patients older than 65 (OR= 0. 35, 95 %CI=[0. 13 – 0. 89]). ConclusionsOur study suggests that discontinuation of use of controllers is associated with other inadequate behaviours or beliefs about inhaled controllers. Efforts should be targeted at patients' perceptions and behaviours toward controller therapy...|$|E
40|$|Many people face {{difficulties}} in remembering knowledge, which {{is complex and}} abstract. This is especially important when the descriptions of knowledge are to be stored in searchable knowledge bases. But if complex knowledge can be transferred through real life stories, it is more understandable and easier to retrieve for the knowledge acceptor. Moreover, if the stories follow a certain pattern like ‘intentional suspense’ {{it may be more}} useful. This study investigates how far a story with <b>intentional</b> <b>interruption</b> is helpful in transferring complex computer science knowledge through processing of information that compares similarities between new and well-understood concepts. The data collection was done by applying framework analysis approach through the interview of 40 students of Stockholm University. Results of this study is assumed to help organizations to design, store and retrieve complex knowledge structures in knowledge bases by using a specific pattern of the stories used in the narrative pedagogy known as 'Zeigarnik effect' which is a form of creating suspense. Interviews with managers showed that they are positive to using the type of knowledge transfer as is proposed in the results of this thesis. Transcribed interviews with students show that the students appreciate and understand the use of analogies in combination with the ‘Zeigarnik effect’ as is described in the result of this thesis. After analysis of the data collected from the experiments, it was confirmed that ‘Zeigarnik effect’ has a small positive effect for a group of people as better results have been found in most of the time when ‘Zeigarnik effect’ was used as compared to when the ‘Zeigarnik effect’ was not used. The participants that experienced the ‘Zeigarnik effect’ answered in a better way which proved that their understanding and memory regarding the subject have been enhanced using it...|$|E

40|$|Network {{security}} {{is becoming a}} very sensitive and important topic for equipment manufacturers and network operators. In transparent optical networks, {{security is}} even more complex since the optical signals are not regenerated as in opaque networks and, therefore, the faults and attacks at the physical layer {{are more difficult to}} detect and isolate without significantly affecting the overall network performance. In this paper we define Failure Management as the prevention, detection, and reaction against failures. Failures are defined as the interruptions of the normal functioning of the network and comprise faults (accidental interruptions) as well as attacks (<b>intentional</b> <b>interruptions</b> which can be performed by service disruption or eavesdropping). Our work deals with a solution to detection of failures in transparent networks. For this purpose we have extended a Fault Location algorithm 3 developed for opaque optical networks to be used in transparent networks and be able to also locate attacks. The proposed algorithm is called Transparent Failure Location Algorithm (TFLA). The first part of the extension is based on the study of other optical network elements such as Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (OADMs), Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs), wavelength converters, Optical Line Terminators, etc. The vulnerability of these elements depends on their architecture and/or fabrication technology and, therefore, different attacks can be considered. A classification of these components based on the masking and alarming properties is proposed. The second part of the extension is based on the monitoring equipment that may be available in transparent networks. The TFLA was applied for the case of a transparent ring of the Pan-European network...|$|R
