50|$|The {{possible}} interference between ATES and chlorinated ethenes has been also {{seen as an}} opportunity of integration of sustainable energy technology and sustainable groundwater management. The combination of ATES and enhanced bioremediation first introduced in the “More with SubSurface Energy” (Meer met Bodemenergie, MMB) project in the Netherlands in 2009. Several scientific and practical rationales are the basics for seeing such combination as a promising possibility. Increased temperature around the warm well can enhance reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes. Although low temperature in cold well can hamper the biodegradation, the seasonal operation of ATES can transfer contaminant from cold well to <b>hot</b> <b>well</b> for faster biodegradation. Such seasonal groundwater transportation can also homogenize the environmental condition. ATES {{can be used as}} a biostimulation too, for example to inject electron donor or microorganism needed for reductive dechlorination. Finally, the life time of ATES (30 years) fits the long duration of in situ bioremediation.|$|E

30|$|To {{overcome}} these problems, we suggest a triplet setup which {{is depicted in}} Fig.  5. Here, the water is produced from a cold well, conditioned, heated and injected into the <b>hot</b> <b>well.</b> From here, the water is produced in times of increased heat demand and, after recuperation of the heat, is injected into a third “warm” well. From the “warm” injection well, the water will slowly propagate to the “cold” production well. Although we calculated {{a slight increase in}} the hardness of the water, model results show that this operation can be run for decades.|$|E
30|$|The {{standard}} setting for an ATES system {{consists of two}} wells connected to a doublet system. In our simulation scenario, cold water is produced during summer months, heated up by excess heat to 130  °C and injected with a flow rate of 80  L/s in the <b>hot</b> <b>well</b> (see Fig.  3). After an injection time of up to eight months, the water is produced to extract the heat down to temperatures of 60  °C. The water is now oversaturated with respect to CO_ 2 and undersaturated {{with respect to the}} aquifer matrix and injected in the cold well. As a consequence dissolution of the aquifer matrix takes place around the cold well.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{simulation}} {{model of the}} condenser in a 600 MW supercritical thermal power plant was developed by using Matlab/Simulink. The important parameters such as condenser pressure, <b>hot</b> <b>well</b> water temperature and cooling water temperature were calculated by using this model. The simulation results under different operating conditions were compared with design parameters, and the relative errors were within- 0. 2 % and + 0. 2 %. This shows that the {{simulation model}} developed in this paper is reasonable. The dynamic performance and off-design performance of the condenser were studied by using the simulation model, which would be useful for the optimal operation of the condenser. The model of the condenser, which was developed based on the modular modeling method, would be an important basis for the simulation of the whole power plant...|$|E

40|$|The Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) {{controller}} is {{the most}} widely used control strategy in the Industry. The popularity of PID controllers can be attributed to their robust performance {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions and partly to their functional simplicity. The process of setting of PID controller can be determined as an optimization task. Over the years, use of intelligent strategies for tuning of these controllers has been growing. Biologically inspired evolutionary strategies have gained importance over other strategies because of their consistent performance over wide range of process models and their flexibility. The level control systems on Deaerator, Feed Water Heaters, and Condenser <b>Hot</b> <b>well</b> are critical to the proper operation of the units in Nuclear Power plants. For Precise control of level, available tuning technologies based on conventional optimization methods are found to be inadequate as these conventional methods are having limitations. To overcome the limitations, alternate tuning techniques based on Genetic Algorithm are emerging. This paper analyses the manual tuning techniques and compares the same with Genetic Algorithm tuning methods for tuning PID controllers for level control system and testing of the quality of process control in the simulation environment of PFBR Operator Training Simulator(OTS) ...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{stimulation}} {{of an existing}} deep, <b>hot</b> <b>well</b> on the west flank of Newberry Volcano was performed {{in the fall of}} 2012 as part of the Newberry EGS Demonstration. A microseismic array of 15 stations was installed in the summer to monitor the EGS growth. Eight geophones were installed in 213 - 246 m deep boreholes, four drilled in the summer of 2012, in order to reduce noise due to scattering in the attenuating volcanic deposits near the surface. Seven surface geophones were installed to further improve locations and allow determination of source mechanisms by enhancing focal sphere coverage. Each station is equipped with a cell phone modem which sends data in real-time to an acquisition server in Seattle After onsite assembly of moderate pressure pumps and piping, injection of cold groundwater into the EGS target well head began October 17 and continued until December 7. 174 microearthquakes with moment magnitudes between 0. 0 and 2. 4 were located within 1 km of the injection well, defining the EGS reservoir. Multi-zone stimulation was carried out by injecting thermally-degradable zonal isolation materials to plug stimulated fractures and shift stimulation to new fractures. The Newberry Volcano EGS Demonstration will allow geothermal industry and academic experts to develop, validate and enhance geoscience and engineering techniques, and other procedures essential to the expansion of EGS. Successful development will demonstrate to the American public that EGS can {{play a significant role in}} reducing foreign energy dependence, and provide clean, renewable, and safe baseload geothermal power generation...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{control systems}} express control {{solutions}} {{by means of}} expressions, usually mathematically based. In order to completely express the control solution, {{a vast amount of}} data is required. In contrast, knowledge-based solutions require far less plant data and mathematical expression. This reduces development time proportionally. In addition, because this type of processing does not require involved calculations, processing speed is increased, since rule process is separate and all processes can be performed simultaneously. These results in improved product quality, better plant efficiency, simplified process, etc. Within this project, conventional PID control has already been implemented, with the control parameter adjustment and loop tuning being problematic. This is mainly due to a number of external parameters that affects the stability of the process. In maintaining a consistent temperature, for example, the steam flow rate varies, the <b>hot</b> <b>well</b> temperature varies, the ambient may temperature vary. Another contributing factor, the time delay, also affects the optimization of the system, {{due to the fact that}} temperature measurement is based on principle of absorption. The normal practice in industry to avoid an unstable control condition is to have an experienced operator to switch the controller to manual, and make adjustments. After obtaining the desired PV, the controller is switched back to automatic. This research project focuses on eliminating this time loss, by implementing a knowledge-based controller, for intelligent decision-making. A FLC design tool, which allows full interaction, whilst designing the control algorithm, was used to optimize the control system. The design tool executed on a PC is connected to a PLC, which in turn is successfully integrated into the process plant...|$|E
5000|$|A sulfur-laden {{artesian}} spring {{was found on}} the site in 1892. Two years later, a bathhouse and hotel followed under the direction of developer McClellan Shacklett. <b>Hot</b> <b>Wells</b> claimed its waters would benefit persons with diseases of the skin, liver, and kidney as well as those with rheumatism and even sepsis. Not long after the facility opened, fire destroyed the resort in December 1894, but Shacklett was financially unable to rebuild. Instead, a German immigrant Otto Koehler of Pearl Brewing Company, purchased the property and re-opened it in 1902 as a three-story brick building with eighty rooms. In the octagonal bathhouse, there were forty-five private baths in three pools. Koehler brought ostriches to the resort to provide guests with ostrich races. There were also domino parties, concerts, and lectures. Streetcars brought guests from downtown San Antonio. At its peak, <b>Hot</b> <b>Wells</b> was likened to other such resorts in Karlsbad, Germany and in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1906, the Cincinnati Reds baseball team conducted its training camp there.
