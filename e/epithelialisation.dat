40|$|The purine {{alkaloid}} caffeine is a {{major component}} of many beverages such as coffee and tea. Caffeine and its metabolites theobromine and xanthine have been shown to have antioxidant properties. Caffeine can also act as adenosine-receptor antagonist. Although {{it has been shown that}} adenosine and antioxidants promote wound healing, the effect of caffeine on wound healing is currently unknown. To investigate the effects of caffeine on processes involved in <b>epithelialisation,</b> we used primary human keratinocytes, HaCaT cell line and ex vivo model of human skin. First, we tested the effects of caffeine on cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and migration, processes essential for normal wound <b>epithelialisation</b> and closure. We used 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) proliferation assay to test the effects of seven different caffeine doses ranging from 0 · 1 to 5 mM. We found that caffeine restricted cell proliferation of keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, scratch wound assays performed on keratinocyte monolayers indicated dose-dependent delays in cell migration. Interestingly, adhesion and differentiation remained unaffected in monolayer cultures treated with various doses of caffeine. Using a human ex vivo wound healing model, we tested topical application of caffeine and found that it impedes <b>epithelialisation,</b> confirming in vitro data. We conclude that caffeine, which is known to have antioxidant properties, impedes keratinocyte proliferation and migration, suggesting that it may have an inhibitory effect on wound healing and <b>epithelialisation.</b> Therefore, our findings are more in support of a role for caffeine as adenosine-receptor antagonist that would negate the effect of adenosine in promoting wound healing...|$|E

Fifteen children (1 - 15 years) admitted for acute or reconstructive burns procedures in a tertiary referral hospital in Australia were randomly assigned to the experimental group, Mepitel(®) (n= 8) and to the control group, SurfaSoft(®) (n= 7). All donor sites were treated with ReCell(®) and covered with the assigned dressing. Measurements of rate of <b>epithelialisation</b> and epidermal maturation, pain, and ease of dressing removal were recorded every two days until the wound was healed. Results showed that {{there was no difference in}} the rate of epidermal maturation between the two groups. Less pain and force to remove the dressing was shown in the Mepitel(®) group when compared to SurfaSoft(®). The rate of <b>epithelialisation</b> was found to be an unreliable measure. Although additional research is required to support the results of this study, these results suggest that Mepitel's(®) pliable, self-adhesive and atraumatic properties may improve healing of ReCell(®) treated donor sites with less pain at dressing changes.

40|$|AbstractIn higher vertebrates, the {{paraxial}} mesoderm {{undergoes a}} mesenchymal to epithelial transformation to form segmentally organised structures called somites. Experiments {{have shown that}} signals originating from the ectoderm overlying the somites or from midline structures are required {{for the formation of}} the somites, but their identity has yet to be determined. Wnt 6 is a good candidate as a somite <b>epithelialisation</b> factor from the ectoderm since it is expressed in this tissue. In this study, we show that injection of Wnt 6 -producing cells beneath the ectoderm {{at the level of the}} segmental plate or lateral to the segmental plate leads to the formation of numerous small epithelial somites. Ectopic expression of Wnt 6 leads to sustained expression of markers associated with the epithelial somites and reduced or delayed expression of markers associated with mesenchymally organised somitic tissue. More importantly, we show that Wnt 6 -producing cells are able to rescue somite formation after ectoderm ablation. Furthermore, injection of Wnt 6 -producing cells following the isolation of the neural tube/notochord from the segmental plate was able to rescue somite formation at both the structural (<b>epithelialisation)</b> and molecular level, as determined by the expression of marker genes like Paraxis or Pax- 3. We show that Wnts are indeed responsible for the <b>epithelialisation</b> of somites by applying Wnt antagonists, which result in the segmental plate being unable to form somites. These results show that Wnt 6, the only known member of this family to be localised to the chick paraxial ectoderm, is able to regulate the development of epithelial somites and that cellular organisation is pivotal in the execution of the differentiation programmes. We propose a model in which the localisation of Wnt 6 and its antagonists regulates the process of <b>epithelialisation</b> in the paraxial mesoderm...|$|E

The formulations of ethanolic extract of Phyllanthus niruri were prepared in gum acacia at 8 % and in ointment base at 10 % and were administered orally (400 mg/kg) and externally respectively. The parameters studied were the wound contraction and the period of <b>epithelialisation.</b> ResultsIn burn wound model, oral and topical administration of Phyllanthus niruri did not show any significant effects in wound contraction and period of <b>epithelialisation</b> when compared to control. In dexamethasone suppressed burn wound model, wound contraction rate was increased significantly by topical (P < 0. 001) and oral (P < 0. 001) administrations of Phyllanthus niruri by about 47. 57 % and 26. 16 % respectively. Topical administration has shown significant (P < 0. 05) enhancement of wound contraction than oral dosage form.

40|$|Introduction. Urea is {{the final}} product of protein {{degradation}} secreted in saliva. It has low molecular weight and neutral molecule that can freely diffuse through bacterial wall, mature plaque and extracellular polysaccharides exerting a buffering effect. In the presence of urease, urea is broken down into one molecule of ammonia and two molecules of weak carbonic acid, causing alkalization of the substrate and pH increase. Hydrolysis of urea begins at pH 4 - 6. In mature plaque with low pH, urea hydrolysis is a compensatory mechanism that opposes pH decrease trying to keep an optimal acidbase balance. This mechanism explains the role of urea in controlling plaque, caries and gingivitis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of urea on the quality and speed of <b>epithelialisation</b> of thermally wounded gingiva in rats. Material and Methods. The study included 36 Wistar albino rats, 3 - 4 months old, divided in three groups (12 in each group). According to the protocol thermal wounding of gingiva was performed in all animals. Wounded gingival epithelial tissue was treated with: 10 % urea solution (experimental group), 3 % hydrogen peroxide and saline (control groups). The extent and quality of <b>epithelialisation</b> was verified histologically after 3, 5, 8, 11 and 14 days. Results. There was a strong cellular infiltration and stromal edema with no significant morphological differences between groups in the samples analyzed after 3 days. The acceleration of <b>epithelialisation</b> in the experimental group observed in samples obtained after 5 days was evidenced by rapid mitotic division of epithelium and initial covering of defects in both directions. In samples obtained after 8 days, in the experimental group, epithelial defect was covered and in some areas cells were differentiated in vertical direction. After 11 days horizontal coverage of defects as well as accelerated cell differentiation in the vertical direction were noted. Restitutio ad integrum in the experimental group and significant delay in wound healing in the control groups was demonstrated in 14 -day samples. Conclusion. Complete <b>epithelialisation</b> of gingiva occurred significantly faster in the group treated with 10 % urea solution, than in the control groups treated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution and saline...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} (CL) generally presents with {{a single}} or several localised cutaneous ulcers without involvement of mucous membranes. Ulcerated lesions are susceptible to secondary contamination that may slow the healing process. OBJECTIVE This study verified the influence of non-parasitic wound infection on wound closure (<b>epithelialisation)</b> and total healing. METHODS Twenty-five patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CL and ulcerated lesions underwent biopsy of ulcer borders. One direct microbial parameter (germ identification in cultures) and four indirect clinical parameters (secretion, pain, burning sensation, pruritus) were analysed. FINDINGS Biopsies of ten lesions showed secondary infection by one or two microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Candida parapsilosis). “Secretion” and “burning sensation” influenced <b>epithelialisation</b> time but not total healing time. Positive detection of germs in the ulcer border and “pain” and “pruritus” revealed no influence on wound closure. CONCLUSIONS Our borderline proof of clinical CL ulcer infection inhibiting CL wound healing supports the need to follow antimicrobial stewardship in CL ulcer management, which was recently proposed for all chronic wounds...|$|E
40|$|Enhancement of collagen's {{physical}} characteristics has been traditionally approached using various physico-chemical methods frequently compromising cell viability. Microbial transglutaminase (mTGase), a transamidating enzyme obtained from Streptomyces mobaraensis, {{was used in}} the cross-linking of collagen-based scaffolds. The introduction of these covalent bonds has previously indicated increased proteolytic and mechanical stability and the promotion of cell colonisation. The hypothesis behind this research is that an enzymatically stabilised collagen scaffold will provide a dermal precursor with enhanced wound healing properties. Freeze-dried scaffolds, with and without the loading of a site-directed mammalian transglutaminase inhibitor to modulate matrix deposition, were applied to full thickness wounds surgically performed on rats’ dorsum and explanted at three different time points (3, 7 and 21 days). Wound healing parameters such as wound closure, <b>epithelialisation,</b> angiogenesis, inflammatory and fibroblastic cellular infiltration and scarring were analysed and quantified using stereological methods. The introduction of this enzymatic cross-linking agent stimulated neovascularisation and <b>epithelialisation</b> resisting wound contraction. Hence, these characteristics make this scaffold a potential candidate to be considered as a dermal precursor...|$|E

40|$|The {{wound healing}} {{activity}} of topically applied ethanol extract of Pseudarthria viscida was evaluated in wistar rat by excision wound {{model for a}} period of 12 days. The extract was prepared as ointment form (5 and 10 % w/w) and applied on Wistar rats. Neomycin ointment 0. 5 %w/w was used as standard drug. The healing of the wound was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, period of <b>epithelialisation,</b> skin breaking strength. Both the ointments (5 % and 10 % w/w) of Pseudarthria viscida extract promoted the wound-healing activity significantly when compared to the standard drug. High rate of wound contraction, decrease the period for <b>epithelialisation,</b> high skin breaking strength were observed in animals treated with 10 % w/w extract ointment when compared to the control group of animals. So ethanol extract of Pseudarthria viscida in the form of 10 % ointment promote wound-healing activity better than the former concentration, 5 %.

In 18 the stricture lay at the squamocolumnar mucosal junction and was associated with reflux oesophagitis, in five it was situated in the columnar lined segment and in four of these it was {{known to have been}} preceded by a chronic ulcer {{at the site of the}} stricture. Controls were an age and sex matched group of patients with benign stricture related to reflux oesophagitis unassociated with columnar <b>epithelialisation.</b> CLO associated strictures involving squamous mucosa were situated significantly (p less than 0. 01) higher in the oesophagus than non-CLO strictures. The {{response to}} endoscopic dilatation and active medical treatment was significantly better, as judged by the need for subsequent dilatation (p less than 0. 01) in the CLO than in the non-CLO group.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to investigate corneal re-epithelialisation of surface-modified polymethacrylate hydrogel implants in order to evaluate them as potential materials for an artificial cornea. Polymethacrylate hydrogels were modified with amines and then coated with different extracellular matrix proteins (collagen I, IV, laminin and fibronectin). The modified hydrogels were surgically implanted into bovine corneas maintained in a 3 -D culture system for 5 days. The epithelial growth across the implant surface was evaluated using fluorescent, light and electron microscopy. Full <b>epithelialisation</b> was achieved on 1, 4 -diaminobutane-modified hydrogels after coating with collagen IV. Hydrogels modified with 1, 4 -diaminobutane but without further coating only showed partial re-epithelialisation. Hydrogels modified with other amines (1, 2 -diaminoethane or 1, 3 -diaminopropane) showed only partial re-epithelialisation; further coating with extracellular matrix proteins improved <b>epithelialisation</b> of these surfaces but {{did not result in}} complete re-epithelialisation. Evaluation of the corneas implanted with the 1, 4 -diaminobutane-modified hydrogels coated with collagen IV showed that the artificial corneas remain clear, integrate well and become covered by a healthy stratified epithelium. In conclusion the 1, 4 -diaminobutane surface-modified hydrogel coated with collagen IV supported the growth of a stable stratified epithelium.

40|$|Wound {{healing is}} a {{transition}} of processes {{which is also}} {{recognized as one of}} the most complex processes in human physiology. Complex series of reactions and interactions among cells and mediators take place in the healing process of wound involving cellular and molecular events. The inflammatory phase is naturally intended to remove devitalized tissue and prevent invasive infection. The proliferative phase is characterized by the formation of granulation tissue within the wound bed, composed of new capillary network, fibroblast, and macrophages in a loose arrangement of supporting structure. This second phase lasts from day 8 to 21 after the injury is also the phase for <b>epithelialisation.</b>  The natural period of proliferative phase is a reflection for us in treating wound to reach the goal which ultimately defines as closed wound. The final maturation phase is also characterized by the balancing between deposition of collagen and its degradation. There are at least three prerequisites which are ideal local conditions for the nature of wound to go on a normal process of healing i. e. 1) all tissue involved in the wound and surrounding should be vital,  2) no foreign bodies in the wound, and 3) free from excessive contamination/infection. The author formulated a step ladder of thinking in regards of healing intentions covering all acute and chronic wounds. Regarding the “hierarchy” of healing intention, the fi rst and ideal choice to heal wounds is by primary intention followed by tertiary intention and lastly the secondary intention.

40|$|Post-traumatic large-surface or deep wounds often cannot {{progress}} to reepithelialisation because they become irresponsive in the inflammatory stage, so intervention {{is necessary to}} provide the final sealing epidermis. Previously we have shown that Amniotic Membrane (AM) induced a robust <b>epithelialisation</b> in deep traumatic wounds. To better understand this phenomenon, we used keratinocytes to investigate the effect of AM on chronic wounds. Using keratinocytes, we saw that AM treatment is able to exert an attenuating effect upon Smad 2 and Smad 3 TGFß-induced phosphorylation while triggering the activation of several MAPK signalling pathways, including ERK and JNK 1, 2. This also has a consequence for TGFß-induced regulation on cell cycle control key players CDK 1 A (p 21) and CDK 2 B (p 15). The study of a wider set of TGFß regulated genes showed {{that the effect of}} AM was not wide but very concrete for some genes. TGFß exerted a powerful cell cycle arrest; the presence of AM however prevented TGFß-induced cell cycle arrest. Moreover, AM induced a powerful cell migration response that correlates well with the expression of c-Jun protein at the border of the healing assay. Consistently, the treatment with AM of human chronic wounds induced a robust expression of c-Jun at the wound border. The effect of AM on the modulation of TGFß responses in keratinocytes that favours proliferation together with AM-induced keratinocyte migration is the perfect match that allows chronic wounds to move on from their non-healing state and progress into epithelialization. Our results may explain why the application of AM on chronic wounds is able to promote <b>epithelialisation...</b>|$|E

Methods: A three-armed phase IIb, randomized and {{controlled clinical trial}} was performed in Mazar-e-Sharif. L. tropica- or L. major-infected CL patients received intradermal sodium stibogluconate (SSG) (Group I); HF-EC followed by MWT with 0. 045 % DAC N- 055 (Group II); or MWT with 0. 045 % DAC N- 055 in basic crème alone (Group III). The primary outcome was complete <b>epithelialisation</b> before day 75 after treatment start. Results: 87 patients enrolled in the trial were randomized into group I (n = 24), II (n = 32) and III (n = 31). The per-protocol analysis of 69 (79 %) patients revealed complete <b>epithelialisation</b> before day 75 in 15 (of 23; 65 %) patients of Group I, in 23 (of 23; 100 %) patients of Group II, and in 20 (of 23; 87 %) patients of Group III (p = 0. 004, Fisher’s Exact Test). In the per-protocol analysis, wound closure times were significantly different between all regimens in a pair-wise comparison (p = 0. 000039, Log-Rank (Mantel-Cox) test). In the intention-to-treat analysis wound survival times in Group II were significantly different from those in Group I (p = 0. 000040, Log-Rank (Mantel-Cox) test). Re-ulcerations occurred in four (17 %), three (13 %) and seven (30 %) patients of Group I, II or III, respectively (p = 0. 312, Pearson Chi-Square Test). Conclusions: Treatment of CL ulcers with bipolar HF-EC followed by MWT with 0. 045 % DAC N- 055 or with DAC N- 055 alone showed shorter wound closure times than with the standard SSG therapy.

As compared to aqueous and control group of animals, ethanol extract showed significant wound healing activity which was evidenced by {{significant decrease in}} the period of <b>epithelialisation</b> (17. 84 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 06) and increase in wound contraction rate, skin breaking strength (581. 45 &#x 00 B 1; 4. 98), granulation tissue breaking strength (512. 80 &#x 00 B 1; 5. 08), dry weight of granulation tissue (47. 23 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 10) and elevated concentration of hydroxyproline (2322. 83 &#x 00 B 1; 8. 49). Histopathalogy of the granulation tissue of the ethanol extract treated animals showed few macrophages with increase in collagenation indicating the potency of the ethanol extract in promoting the process of wound healing. The present finding provides a scientific base to the ethno medicinal use of L. serratum...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} results of Martius&#x 2032; labial fat pad {{interposition}} and its modification using skin island in the repair of giant and recurrent vesicovaginal and urethrovaginal fistulae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients of urethrovaginal and vesicovaginal fistulae underwent Martius&#x 2032; labial fat pad interposition and its skin island modification during 1996 to 1999. Ten of these were recurrent (66 &#x 0025;) and five were giant fistulae (34 &#x 0025;) i. e. more than five cms. RESULTS: Results were very gratifying with a successful repair in 14 patients (93 &#x 0025;). Two patients had transient, low-grade stress incontinence, which did not need any additional procedure. In one patient, there was failure of repair, which was later successfully repaired using fat pad from opposite labia. CONCLUSION: Martius&#x 2032; fat pad interposition provides vascularity and surface for <b>epithelialisation</b> and also prevents overlapping of vesical/urethral and vaginal suture lines. Martius&#x 2032; repair has good results with low morbidity {{in the treatment of}} giant and recurrent urethrovaginal and vesicovaginal fistulae...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To report {{one case}} of corneal {{antibiotic}} deposition after ciprofloxacin administration in Laser Assisted Subepithelial Keratomileusis (LASEK). Methods. One case of post-LASEK treatment resulted in corneal precipitates and poor wound healing. Debris was analyzed with {{dark field microscopy}} and placed on a blood-agar plate seeded with a susceptible stain of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213). Results. The alterations resolved with discontinuation of ciprofloxacin treatment, although some residual deposits persisted subepithelially for 6 months. Analysis of precipitates revealed polydisperse crystalline needles of 183 [*]m average length (SD= 54 [*]m) and the excised precipitate demonstrated a zone of inhibition. Conclusions. Fluoroquinolone antibiotic drops have been used extensively in postsurgical treatment of refractive surgery. Corneal precipitates have been previously reported in the literature, but up to now nothing has been documented after LASEK. Polypharmacy during refractive surgery may impair <b>epithelialisation,</b> and clinical management should reduce toxic environment and promote ocular surface stability when performing surface ablations...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 1996. Since then great advances have been made with regard to understanding the healing properties of honey, how to use it, and the development and availability of honey products. ‘Honey, the most ancient of wound treatments, is taking its place in modern wound care … it is easy to apply, painless and comfortable, harmless to tissues, creates a moist healing environment, is antibacterial and stimulates healing and <b>epithelialisation.</b> ’ 1 Some of honey’s antibacterial activity is due to the high osmolarity created by its sugar content, some is due to hydrogen peroxide released by exudate, and some is due to phytochemicals that come from the nectar of plants. 1 The latter are so important a factor in Manuka honey (from Leptospermum scoparium) that this activity is measured as the ‘Unique Manuka Factor ’ (UMF number). 1 In vitro and animal studies 2 - 4 have also advanced ou...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in persistent corneal epithelial defect with or without stromal thinning and corneal perforation.  METHODS— 28 patients (28  eyes) with persistent corneal epithelial defect unresponsive to medical treatment were given preserved human amniotic membrane transplants. The patients were divided into three groups: group A, persistent corneal epithelial defect 10  eyes; group B, epithelial defect with stromal thinning 13  eyes; and group C, corneal perforation five eyes. AMT was performed using one layer in group A and multilayers in group B and C.  The causes of persistent epithelial defect were neurotrophic keratopathy (24  eyes), limbal deficiency (six eyes), exposure keratopathy (four eyes), and Mooren's ulcer (one eye).  RESULTS—Success was noted in 82. 1 % (23 / 28 eyes) in all groups, with 80 % (8 / 10 eyes), 84. 6 % (11 / 13 eyes), and 80 % (4 / 5 eyes) in groups A, B, and C respectively, with a mean follow up of 10. 9  months (1 - 30 months). The mean <b>epithelialisation</b> time after AMT was 2. 1  weeks. The healing times of groups B and C are also significantly shorter than group A (p= 0. 017 and 0. 018, respectively). Corneal stromal thickness was significantly increased in all cases in groups B and C (p= 0. 006). Those with corneal perforation in group C were completely healed by multilayer AMT. There {{was no difference in}} the <b>epithelialisation</b> time between successful cases treated by a single operation (17  eyes) or repeated operation (six eyes). Vision improved in 18. 9 % (8 / 28 eyes) and worsened as a result of cataract formation in 2. 3 % (1 / 28 eyes). Failure was noted in 17. 9 % (5 / 28 eyes), because of corneal infection (two eyes), neurotrophic keratopathy with and without limbal deficiency (two eyes), and intractable corneal perforation (one eye). No patient developed major immediate postoperative complications or graft rejection.  CONCLUSION—Amniotic membrane can successfully treat refractory corneal epithelial defect by promoting epithelial healing and thus prevent corneal perforation. It {{can be used as a}} treatment for corneal perforation by restoring corneal stromal thickness so that emergency penetrating keratoplasty can be avoided. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of covering wounds to the tongue with a polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheet and fibrin glue. Eighteen mature male Japanese white rabbits had a unilateral glossectomy involving an area 10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm. After glossectomy the tongues were covered with PGA sheets 8 mm × 8 mm in size and fibrin glue (mucosal defect covered with fibrin glue and polyglycolic acid sheet = MCFP) 1 week after the operation (n = 3), after 2 weeks (n = 3), and after 4 weeks (n = 3). In control groups, after 1, 2, and 4 weeks (n = 3 in each group), the partially resected tongues were closed with absorbable sutures (polyglactin 910). One week (experimental and control groups 1), 2 weeks (experimental and control groups 2) and 4 weeks (experimental and control groups 3) after operation the tongues were harvested and stained for microscopic examination. Histological examination showed that the covered wound surface had not epithelialised and the basal layer had yet to form in experimental group 1, but had formed in experimental group 2. However, in control group 1, <b>epithelialisation</b> of the sutured wound had begun. Immunohistochemical examination showed that, in experimental group 1, the non-uniform epithelial layer of the covered wound surface expressed cytokeratin AE 1 /AE 3, and the epithelial and connective tissue layers stained strongly for FGF- 2. Similar results were obtained in experimental group 2, whereas in experimental group 3, FGF- 2 was expressed only in the connective tissue layer, and <b>epithelialisation</b> was complete. However, in control group 1, AE 1 /AE 3 was expressed in the epithelial layer, and FGF was expressed in the connective tissue layer beneath the basal layer. In control groups 2 and 3, AE 1 /AE 3 and FGF- 2 were expressed in patterns similar to those in experimental groups 2 and 3. We suggest that this method is useful and the operation is simple. However, further testing of the method is needed and it should be widely used clinically before it is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{patterning}} involves regionalised cell specification. Recent {{studies indicate}} that cell dynamics play instrumental roles in neural pattern refinement and progression, but the impact of cell behaviour and morphogenesis on neural specification is not understood. Here we combine 4 D analysis of cell behaviours with dynamic quantification of proneural expression to uncover {{the construction of the}} zebrafish otic neurogenic domain. We identify pioneer cells expressing neurog 1 outside the otic epithelium that migrate and ingress into the epithelialising placode to become the first otic neuronal progenitors. Subsequently, neighbouring cells express neurog 1 inside the placode, and apical symmetric divisions amplify the specified pool. Interestingly, pioneer cells delaminate shortly after ingression. Ablation experiments reveal that pioneer cells promote neurog 1 expression in other otic cells. Finally, ingression relies on the <b>epithelialisation</b> timing controlled by FGF activity. We propose a novel view for otic neurogenesis integrating cell dynamics whereby ingression of pioneer cells instructs neuronal specification.

40|$|Background Post-traumatic large-surface or deep wounds often cannot {{progress}} to reepithelialisation because they become irresponsive in the inflammatory stage, so intervention {{is necessary to}} provide the final sealing epidermis. Previously we have shown that Amniotic Membrane (AM) induced a robust <b>epithelialisation</b> in deep traumatic wounds. Methods and Findings To better understand this phenomenon, we used keratinocytes to investigate the effect of AM on chronic wounds. Using keratinocytes, we saw that AM treatment is able to exert an attenuating effect upon Smad 2 and Smad 3 TGFß-induced phosphorylation while triggering the activation of several MAPK signalling pathways, including ERK and JNK 1, 2. This also has a consequence for TGFß-induced regulation on cell cycle control key players CDK 1 A (p 21) and CDK 2 B (p 15). The study of a wider set of TGFß regulated genes showed {{that the effect of}} AM was not wide but very concrete for some genes. TGFß exerted a powerful cell cycle arrest; the presence of AM however prevented TGFß-induced cell cycle arrest. More...|$|E
