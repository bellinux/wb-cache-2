40|$|Background: Patients {{with chronic}} renal disease should be vaccinated {{as soon as}} {{dialysis}} is forestalled, and this could improve the seroconversion of hepatitis B vaccination. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to compare seroconversion and immune response rates using 4 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 40 μg and 3 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 20 μg Euvax B recombinant Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBs Ag) vaccine administered to predialysis patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients and Methods: In an open, randomized clinical trial, we compared seroconversion rates in 51 predialysis patients with mild and moderate chronic renal failure who received either 4 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 40 μg or 3 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 20 μg of Euvax B recombinant hepatitis B vaccine administered at 0, 1, 2, 6 and 0, 1, 6 months, respectively. Results: Differences in seroconversion rates after 4 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 40 μg (80. 88 %) compared to 3 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 20 μg (92 %) were not significant (P = 0. 4124). The mean HBs antibody level after 4 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 40 μg at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months (182. 2 ± 286. 7) {{was significantly higher than}} that after 3 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 40 μg at 0, 1, and 6 months (96. 9 ± 192. 1) (P = 0. 004). Seroconversion after 4 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 40 μg (80. 8 %) was also significantly higher than that after 3 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 40 μg (77 %) (P = 0. 004).

Conclusions: We found that 4 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 40 μg did not lead to significantly more seroconversion than 3 <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 20 μg...|$|R

50|$|In rodent studies, low <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> PNU-99,194 produce {{conditioned}} place preference (CPP) with {{no effect}} on intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), whereas low <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> D3 agonists like 7-OH-DPAT inhibit ICSS behavior and cause conditioned place aversion (CPA). In contrast, high <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> PNU-99,194 produce CPA and inhibit ICSS, while high <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> 7-OH-DPAT result in the opposite. Paralleling this, low <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> PNU-99,194 and 7-OH-DPAT induce hyperactivity and hypoactivity, respectively, whereas the inverse is seen at high doses with both agents. These data indicate that the D3 receptor has biphasic effects on reward mechanisms and locomotor activity, likely due to opposing roles of autoreceptors versus postsynaptic receptors.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{multiple}} <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin {{and continuous}} insulin infusion therapy as treatment for {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus. Methods 40 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (21 female) with ages between 10 and 20 years (mean= 14. 2) and mean duration of diabetes of 7 years used multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin for at least 6 months and after that, continuous insulin infusion therapy for at least 6 months. Each one of the patients has used multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin and continuous insulin infusion therapy. For analysis of HbA 1 c, mean glycated hemoglobin levels (mHbA 1 c) were obtained during each treatment period (multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin and continuous insulin infusion therapy period). ResultsAlthough mHbA 1 c levels were lower during continuous insulin infusion therapy {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. During multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin, 14. 2 % had mHbA 1 c values below 7. 5 % vs. 35. 71 % while on continuous insulin infusion therapy; demonstrating better glycemic control with the use of continuous insulin infusion therapy. During multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin, 15 – 40 patients have severe hypoglycemic events versus 5 – 40 continuous insulin infusion therapy. No episodes of ketoacidosis events were recorded. ConclusionsThis is the first study with this design comparing multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin and continuous insulin infusion therapy in Brazil showing no significant difference in HbA 1 c; hypoglycemic events were less frequent during continuous insulin infusion therapy than during multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin and the percentage of patients who achieved a HbA 1 c less than 7. 5 % was greater during continuous insulin infusion therapy than multiple <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> insulin therapy...|$|R
