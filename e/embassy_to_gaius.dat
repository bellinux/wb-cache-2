40|$|The Acts of the Apostles can fruitfully {{be studied}} as persuasive narrative. This thesis {{develops}} {{and uses a}} new method to investigate what {{we can learn from}} the way Acts has been constructed about the persuasive influence the text would have exerted on its early audiences. Acts is a narrative and purposes suggested for it often involve persuasion. The proposed method for addressing the persuasiveness of narrative is a development of both narrative criticism, which has traditionally neglected persuasion, and rhetorical criticism, which is based on persuasive techniques in speeches, whereas rather different techniques are employed in narrative. The method employs a taxonomy of techniques of persuasion relevant to narrative. Speeches, events and asides each contribute. A character’s influence depends on trust – whether they are accredited or discredited. Respect and empathy have different persuasive effects. Before considering Acts, the method is demonstrated by applying it to: Philo’s <b>Embassy</b> <b>to</b> <b>Gaius,</b> which is more overtly polemical than Acts; Josephus’s Jewish War, addressing a more hostile audience than Acts; the Letter of Aristeas, which is more of an encomium than Acts; and Joseph and Aseneth, with a more overt ‘journey of discovery’ than Acts. In Acts, accrediting and discrediting are provided in many ways, most forcefully through the Holy Spirit. Ananias and Sapphira provide a cautionary tale. The hearer accompanies Peter on his ‘journey of discovery’ about Gentiles. The approach of persuading by gentle steps suggests that some among the implied audience were unconvinced about mission to Gentiles and about Paul. Overall, the persuasiveness of Acts is not unsuitable for presentation to interested outsiders alongside believers. Persuasiveness is evident, especially in favour of the Jesus movement, Gentile mission and Paul. This research proposes a method and, by using it, shows how Acts can, itself, be considered an act of persuasion...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{will discuss}} the relationship of philosophers to those in power {{in terms of their}} activities as advocates and ambassadors for their communities. Greek philosophy was closely tied with civic activity from the very beginnings of both philosophy and the polis. One of the commonly attested political duties of the ancient Greek philosopher is that of an ambassador representing his city to another community or, under the principate, to Roman officials. An examination of this role will naturally involve many of the issues that scholars have already recognized as important in the study of philosophy and power at this period: the concept of the freedom of speech and frankness (parrhesia) of the true philosopher in the presence of power, the anxiety about proper conduct and philosophical integrity in what is essentially a supplication of a powerful figure—a threat to the dignity and autonomy that a philosopher must always outwardly maintain—and the ongoing debate among philosophers about the proper balance between the active and contemplative life, especially when faced with the political demands of the society around them. The relationship between Greek philosophy and Roman power is also an important theme in this study, and the philosopher-ambassador makes a particularly useful lens for examining this issue. I will focus on four Hellenic philosophers who took on embassies to the Roman state: Carneades, whose spectacular rhetorical displays during his embassy 155 BC were long remembered by the Romans, Philo of Alexandria, who was forced by dire circumstances to take on an <b>embassy</b> <b>to</b> <b>Gaius</b> Caligula on behalf of the Jews in his native city, Plutarch, who spent his life as a Roman elite and a Greek philosopher negotiating between his people and Roman officials, and Themistius, a philosopher of the late imperial period who served ostensibly as an ambassador for the Constantinopolitan senate, but in reality was a representative of the Emperor to the citizenry. A pattern will emerge of a forceful and energetic philosophical advocacy degenerating into impotent panegyric, even as Greek philosophy and philosophers become progressively more powerful and influential in the Imperial government...|$|E
