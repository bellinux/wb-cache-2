5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and <b>identity</b> <b>formation</b> in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

It situates the series' three super-powered heroines within the 1990 s popular discourse of ‘Girl Power’, presenting empowered images of young femininity.

40|$|This study {{advances}} an ethnographic {{exploration into}} a community of migrant workers from Turkey. The paper revolves around a fairly straightforward question asking why these people migrate, but the answer {{turns out to be}} complicated: Research findings point to the importance of economic dynamics. However, {{it is not possible to}} neglect non-economic motivations either. In particular, social/cultural capital and <b>identity</b> <b>formations</b> require a greater recognition. A fuller understanding of migration also necessitates going beyond rationality: economic and non-economic motivations are ubiquitously interwoven with irrational interactions between individuals and structures in both coercive and preferential ways...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates asylum seekers/refugees’ orientations to {{belonging}} and identity. It {{is based on}} in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted among asylum seekers/refugees residing in Scotland between 2006 and 2008 and on a media monitoring {{of a number of}} UK newspapers. The interviews were analysed for interviewees’ orientations to feelings of {{belonging and}} identity with the UK, Scotland and homelands. They were also analysed for interviewees’ perceptions (beliefs and understandings) of newspapers’ reporting of asylum and importance to their sense of national belonging and national identity forming. The monitoring provided the context of newspapers’ reporting of asylum at the time of interviews. It enabled a small-scale examination of media content with reference to interviewees’ perceptions. The thesis explores two assumptions. Firstly, asylum seekers/refugees’ national belonging and national <b>identity</b> <b>formations</b> are complex and contingent upon their everyday ‘lived’ experiences. Secondly, asylum seekers/refugees’ belonging and <b>identity</b> <b>formations,</b> as social processes of citizenship, cannot be understood in isolation from the high visibility of the asylum issue in UK media. As an empirical study, therefore, its findings are deployed to critique policymaking, theoretical and media accounts of non-British citizens’ forms of belonging to, and identification with the British ‘nation’. It is suggested that, in addition to policymaking, there are other social circumstances that would facilitate ethnic minority migrants’ national belonging and national <b>identity</b> <b>formations.</b> These factors do not only account for the prioritising of Scottishness over Britishness, but also migrants’ ‘hyphenated’ identities. This thesis will therefore provide evidence suggesting that non-citizens (ethnic minorities), have their own meanings and agency of orientating to a feeling of national belonging and national identity that is nuanced and contingent on their experiences. The thesis does not aim to establish media causality. However, it highlights the fact that newspaper coverage can evoke responses from marginalised groups and provide the context from which identities are narrated and mobilised. The thesis will improve our understanding of the practices, meanings and contestations of belonging and identity that is grounded in the ‘lived’ experiences of noncitizens. This sociological dimension to ethnic minorities’ citizenship forming is not only poorly understood, but has been dominated by theoretical and policymaking accounts in the contemporary state...|$|R
25|$|Generally, {{it can be}} {{said that}} in scholarship, as well as popular discourse, there has been a {{tendency}} of talking about indigenous peoples in terms of ethnicity, about afro-minorities and white socio-economic privilege in terms of race, and about mestizos in tems of national identity. It is now however becoming recognized that processes of <b>identity</b> <b>formation</b> and social stratification in regards to all population groups in Mexico can be analyzed both in terms of race and of ethnicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{events in}} a life script are often positive, celebrated, and normative. It {{represents}} and idealized life story. An average life would also include negative events and people would learn from experience. But the life script is handed down from older generations, through stories, and observations {{of the behavior of}} others, typically older, people within the same culture. Individuals should also remember more during their young adulthood because that era is the time of biological maturation, new experiences, adult <b>identity</b> <b>formation,</b> and major events in life scripts.|$|E
25|$|The narrative/identity account {{suggests}} that the reminiscence bump occurs because {{a sense of identity}} develops during adolescence and early adulthood.

The events from this period {{are more likely to be}} organized into a story or view of oneself, and benefits from the advantage of schematic organization in memory.|$|E

25|$|These {{memories}} {{have been}} tested in different ways, including measuring the ability to recall details of the event {{and the impact of}} additional cues on the recall of the event. Denver, Lane and Cherry found that flashbulb memories {{that took place in the}} reminiscence bump were exceptionally vivid and easily accessible. It is suggested that the flashbulb memories encoded during the reminiscence bump are so vivid because the events happened during a time of <b>identity</b> <b>formation</b> and peak brain function. Additionally, these events are recalled well because they undergo more rehearsal due to their serious nature and frequent discussion.|$|E
25|$|The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, {{now known}} as the Community of Christ, was first {{established}} in India in July 1964 when William Samuel Jesudawson, an independent Protestant minister, affiliated with the church along with his congregation in Madras in South India. The church experienced sporadic growth and instability in South India due to corruption among church ministers, lack of funds for outreach, and lack of <b>identity</b> <b>formation</b> and commitment to the church among new members. Since 1998, more capable and committed leadership has been in place, which has led the church to expand with congregations in Uthamapalayam, Chennai, and Madurai all in Tamil Nadu.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the stolen generations, Aboriginal {{children}} were removed from their families and placed in institutions where they were punished for speaking their indigenous language. Different, mutually unintelligible language groups were often were mixed together, with Australian Aboriginal English or Australian Kriol language as the only lingua franca. The result was a disruption to the inter-generational transmission of these languages that severely impacted their future use. Today, that same transmission of language between parents and grandparents to their children is a key mechanism for reversing language shift. For children, proficiency in the language of their cultural heritage has a positive influence on their ethnic <b>identity</b> <b>formation,</b> and it is thought to be of particular benefit to the emotional well-being of Indigenous children. There is some evidence to suggest that the reversal of the Indigenous language shift may lead to decreased self-harm and suicide rates among Indigenous youth.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the Bara begins along the Ihosy River in the Arindrano region of {{southwest}} Madagascar, near Toliara. Little {{is known about the}} earliest period in Bara <b>identity</b> <b>formation,</b> beyond that it coincided with the formation of the Maroserana dynasty of the Sakalava people and that certain Bara nobles had Maroserana origins. This early kingship-based social structure is believed to have had weak or nonexistent rules of succession. Around 1640 a noble of the Mahafaly people invaded Bara territory and installed his family as rulers under the dynastic name Zafimanely. This was an imposition to which many Bara were unwilling to submit, leading them to simply migrate internally to new territory. Zafimanely power became more firmly established after the death of the Mahafaly nobleman in 1653, but competition and ambition led these newcomers to engage in an ongoing struggle for power until around 1680, greatly disrupting life in Bara territory (Ibara). A major driver of this instability was the absence of a tribute system, leading Zafimanely nobles to engage in cattle raiding and issuing costly fines to law breakers that sparked internal and external tensions alike.|$|E

30|$|And {{yet other}} authors point to {{experiment}} from the periphery, and innovative activity {{which in fact}} depends on the periphery. As Howard notes, Maharshi Mehi confronted scholars’ presuppositions of rigid textual boundaries and <b>identity</b> <b>formations.</b> He made connections between Santmat and Hindu dharma. He and other Santmat leaders select philosophical writings and myths of Hindu dharma—to show the link between creative and orthodox thinkers. They do so to create a common religious language to communicate esoterica, and to “address the contemporary rise of extremism by showing how Vedic dharma encourages adherence to harmonizing inner path.” All of this, in Howard’s assessment, cannot be done from an orthodox “center,” but by remaining {{on the periphery of}} dogmatic Hinduism.|$|R

Yet, the analysis of our empirical data reveals that these families are heterogeneous units who select specific strategies and assemble them in two types of transnational health care arrangements —sequential and sporadic arrangements— according to different heterogeneity markers. By conducting such analysis we go beyond the work of transnational feminist scholars who have used an intersectional lens in a global set of relations particularly applied to <b>identity</b> <b>formations</b> or to the mapping of how ideas and capital get transferred across borders through different power lines but rarely to study the distribution of social rights (Grewal & Kaplan, 1994).|$|R
