25|$|Studies {{throughout}} Europe {{have identified}} risks that make children vulnerable to exploitation {{that are also}} causes and contributing factors of child trafficking. These include social and economic marginalisation, dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, gender-based violence and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment. As the efforts of national governments to improve social safety nets can lessen many of these risks, child trafficking is considered not only a result of criminal activities but also as indicating weaknesses in the national government's ability to effectively safeguard children’s rights to a safe and healthy development.|$|E

In this thesis I want to explain the reasons for Ukrainian women to take up work as irregular caregivers in Italy, giving insight into the organization of daily life of irregular Ukrainian care givers. Practical examples will be given that examine the help women receive from Ukrainian professional and private networks. Despite information gaps, the combination of expert and migrant interviews in combination with the analysis of research studies and secondary sources produced important findings on this topic. Firstly, <b>irregular</b> female <b>migration</b> is economically motivated and women are driven to Italy through specific push and pull factors. Secondly, employment and daily life as a caregiver to the elderly in Italy entails economic advantages, but psychological disadvantages for Ukrainian women. ...|$|R

50|$|Given {{the current}} {{political}} priority around people smuggling, it is perhaps surprising that a concerted international focus on defining and responding to migrant smuggling only occurred in the 1990s.

40|$|In the Netherlands Antilles, {{opposite}} the Venezuelan coast, the cyprinodont fish Poecilia sphenops vandepolli {{is found in}} fresh water, in brackish water, in the sea and in supersaline water. When comparing the populations from fresh water, sea water and supersaline water some significant morphological differences were found, e. g. in size, in depth {{of the body and}} of the caudal peduncle, in length of the head, and in the number of rays in the pectoral and caudal fins and the number of lateral scales. In raising experiments, however, it could be shown that these differences are phenotypic. The characteristics of the subspecies or varietas arubensis as described by VAN LIDTH DE JEUDE (1887) proved also to be phenotypic. Optimum growth was found in seawater. The adaptation to fresh water after transfer from sea water or supersaline water is quicker than in the opposite direction; this concerns specific weight adaptation, growth resumption and the change of preference for the new salinity after transfer. With respect to these characteristics fresh water is more favourable than sea water or brine. The inland migration after rainfall is not caused by the fresh water itself, but by an organic compound that is found in inland water, whether fresh or saline, and also in rain water after it has been in contact with the soil. From the fact that mollies also are attracted by IJsselmeer water, just as elvers are, it seems likely that mollies and elvers are attracted by the same organic compound. This behaviour of the molly causes <b>irregular</b> <b>migrations</b> from sea to inland waters which prevent the inland populations from developing into separate forms, races or subspecies...|$|R
