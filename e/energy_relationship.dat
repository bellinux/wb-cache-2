A plot of log(Ka) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(K) and slope ρ.

Hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects.|$|E

The reasons for observed non-linearities in free <b>energy</b> <b>relationships</b> are considered. Attention is paid to the influences of changes in kinetic mechanism (e. g. general-acid catalyzed versus uncatalyzed reactions, and the competition between associative, dissociative and concerted modes of group transfer), changes in rate-determining step and the choice of an appropriate reference reaction.
