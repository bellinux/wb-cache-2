40|$|Organ {{donation}} plays a {{major role}} in the management of patients with single organ failure of the kidneys, liver, pancreas, heart, or lung, or with combined organ failure of heart and lung (such as in cystic fibrosis) or of kidney and pancreas (such as in diabetes). A shortage of transplant organs has resulted in long waits for transplantation. Currently about 500 people in the United Kingdom die each year because of a shortage of donated organs, and at 31 March 2011 almost 7000 patients were waiting for a kidney transplant 1 and would be having costly dialysis with serious morbidity and impact on quality of life. This shortage of organs is partly the result of relatively low numbers of road traffic deaths (lower than in many countries) but is also the result of inefficiencies in the <b>donor</b> <b>identification</b> and consent processes. This article summarises the most recent recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on improving <b>donor</b> <b>identification</b> and consent rates for deceased organ donation...|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} far {{infrared}} (FIR) dielectric response of shallow impurity {{states in a}} semiconductor has been developed and is presented for the specific case of the shallow donor transitions in high purity epitaxial GaAs. The model is quite general, however, and should be applicable with slight modification, not only to shallow donors in other materials such as InP, but also to shallow acceptors and excitons. The effects of the enormous dielectric response of shallow donors on the FIR optical properties of reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance, and photoconductive response of high purity epitaxial GaAs films are predicted and compared with experimental photothermal ionization spectra. The model accounts {{for many of the}} peculiar features that are frequently observed in these spectra, one of which was the cause of erroneous <b>donor</b> <b>identifications</b> in the early doping experiments. The model also corrects some commonly held misconceptions concerning photo-thermal ionization peak widths and amplitudes and their relationships to donor and acceptor concentrations.

To support the {{diagnosis}} of antibody-mediated TRALI, HLA and HNA antibodies are tested in involved blood <b>donors.</b> <b>Identification</b> of antibody positive donors is important as exclusion of these donors is part of preventative strategies against TRALI. We compared cellular-based versus bead-based techniques for diagnosis of antibody-mediated TRALI. All reported TRALI cases in the Netherlands during a 5 -year period were evaluated. Donors were screened for the presence of HLA class I and class II antibodies using both cellular-based and bead-based techniques. In total, 100 TRALI cases were reported of which 91 were fully tested. In 113 donors, HLA antibodies were detected of which 84 were only detected by bead-based techniques, 12 only by cellular-based tests and 17 by both assays. Antibody-mediated TRALI was diagnosed in 44 of 91 reported cases. Twenty-one (48 %) of these cases would not have been identified using only cellular-based assays. Bead-based techniques show a higher sensitivity for detecting incompatible donors in TRALI cases than cellular-based assays. These results suggest that the use of bead-based assays will result in a significant reduction of future TRALI reactions as more antibody positive donors will be excluded from future donation...|$|R

In this paper, we are proposing a <b>donor</b> <b>identification</b> system to recognize the donors based on face recognition or through an Identification number. A centralized repository is maintained by the hospitals to store the required information of a donor which includes thumb impression, facial images and other basic details of the donor. In case of accidental death, the donor will be checked in our portal for verification about his organ donation and informed to the guardian. The process of taking the organ before the stipulated prescribed medical time will be initiated. In case of normal death, the person’s address and reference number will be checked and based on that, the organs will be taken with a formal confirmation from their guardian.

40|$|Many factors, {{including}} {{lower risk}} of GVHD, rapid availability of 4 / 6 – 6 / 6 matched cord blood (CB) units and incremental gains in the outcomes, have led to an increasing use of CB transplantation (CBT) to treat many patients who lack fully matched adult BM donors.

In this review, we examine the current status and cumulative experience of related and unrelated donor CBT {{for the treatment of}} nonmalignant diseases, including hemoglobinopathies, BM failure syndromes, primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) and inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), and conclude that CBT offers a promising and effective therapy for these diseases. Future strategies to facilitate earlier diagnosis and to decrease transplant-related risks should further improve the short- and long-term outcomes.

There are both ethical and logistic problems with man-dated choice. The view of the family should be respected in organ requests, even when patient wishes are known. Public sentiment against overriding family wishes could cause low rates of pro-donation registration. Caregivers have usually refused to take organs when families oppose donation. Logistic issues with mandated choice include the cost and complexity of maintaining a national database on donors and the enforcement of registration.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the functional characteristics of choline uptake in human tongue carcinoma using the cell line HSC- 3. Furthermore, we explored the possible {{correlation between the}} inhibition of choline uptake and apoptotic cell death. Both choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL 1) and CTL 2 mRNAs and proteins were expressed, and were located in plasma membrane and mitochondria, respectively. Choline uptake was saturable and mediated by a single transport system, which is pH-dependent. Several cationic drugs inhibited cell viability and [3 H]choline uptake. Choline uptake inhibitors and choline deficiency inhibited cell viability and increased caspase- 3 / 7 activity. We conclude that extracellular choline is mainly transported via a CTL 1 that relies on a directed H+ gradient as a driving force. The functional inhibition of CTL 1 by cationic drugs could promote apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, CTL 2 may be the major site for the control of choline oxidation in mitochondria and hence for the supply of endogenous betaine and S-adenosyl methionine, {{which serves as a}} major methyl <b>donor.</b> <b>Identification</b> of this CTL 1 - and CTL 2 -mediated choline transport system provides a potential new target for tongue cancer therapy...|$|E

40|$|The timing {{represents}} a relevant prognostic factor of outcome {{for patients with}} hematological malignancies undergoing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT). In this review, the most recent studies and own transplant center policy on the donor search will be summarized in order to design an algorithm of <b>donor</b> <b>identification</b> driving towards a timely ASCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Nowadays, volunteer-unrelated, umbilical cord blood and haploidentical-related donors represent the three alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells for patients who lack a human leukocyte antigen identical sibling, so that an alternative donor can potentially be found for about all patients eligible for an ASCT. To date, all retrospective studies comparing transplants from these alternative donors have shown no substantial differences in terms of final outcome of patients grafted for hematological malignancies. The policy of a widespread search for an alternative donor has been progressively increasing in the past years. SUMMARY: All patients with hematological malignancy for whom the intention to treatment includes an allogeneic transplant should proceed with a well timed ASCT, whatever the stem cell source.

A national retrospective cohort {{study was conducted in}} all eight Dutch pediatric intensive care units. Records of deceased children were analyzed by an independent donation officer. Seventy-four (11 %) of 683 deceased children were found to be suitable for organ donation and 132 (19 %) for tissue donation. Sixty-two (84 %) potential organ donors had been correctly identified; the parental consent and effectuation rate was 42 %. Sixty-three (48 %) potential tissue donors had been correctly identified; the parental consent and effectuation rate was 27 %. Correct identification increased with age (logistic regression, organs: P =. 024; tissues: P =. 011).

40|$|With an {{empirical}} study in two nonprofit industries (a money-collecting and blood-collecting organization), the authors investigate how organizational identification and identity salience together function {{in relation to}} satisfaction, loyalty, and behavior. They develop and test a model that best represents relationships featuring donor-nonprofit identification and donor identity salience in existing satisfaction-loyalty studies. Overall, the study empirically confirms that donor-nonprofit identification and donor iden-tity salience are distinct constructs and that both have direct positive effects on loyalty, but not that much on donations. Within the money donation context, both identification constructs have stronger total effects on donor loyalty than donor satisfaction, whereas in the blood donation context, donor satisfaction has a stronger effect on loyalty. In testing the causal direction between donor-nonprofit identification and donor satisfaction, the authors also find that the path should be conceptualized from satisfac-tion to identification.

It is well documented that certain regions of the adult human central nervous system contains undifferentiated, progenitor cells or multipotent precursors. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to describe the distribution and progenitor features of this cell population in humans, and to confirm their ability to differentiate within the neuroectodermal lineage. We demonstrate that neural stem/progenitor cells are present in FT obtained from patients treated for tethered cord.

Cells expressing Sox 2 and Musashi- 1 were found to outline the central canal, and also to be distributed in islets throughout the whole FT. Following plating, the cells developed antigen profiles characteristic of astrocytes (GFAP) and neurons (β-III-tubulin). Addition of PDGF-BB directed the cells towards a neuronal fate.

40|$|The use of overset grids in CFD started {{more than}} two decades ago, and has {{achieved}} tremendous success in handling complex geometries. In particular, overset grids have the advantage of avoiding grid remeshing when dealing with moving boundary flow problems. Traditionally overset grids were mainly used with structured grids to simplify the grid generation process, because a complex computational domain can be more easily meshed after it is partitioned into sub-domains with overset interfaces than with patched interfaces. More recently, unstructured grids are also used in the overset grid system to further simplify grid generation for each sub-domain. In this paper, two particular unstructured grids are advocated for moving boundary flow simulation, i. e., the use of overset adaptive Cartesian/prism grids. Semi-structured prism grids are generated around solid walls. These prism grids then overlap a single adaptive Cartesian background grid. With the adaptive Cartesian grid, the mesh resolution of the prism grid near the outer boundary can easily match that of the oversetting Cartesian grid cells. In addition, the tree-based data structure of the Cartesian grid can be used efficiently in hole-cutting and <b>donor</b> cell <b>identification.</b> The overset adaptive Cartesian/prism grid method is tested for both steady and unsteady flow computation.

We analyzed the outcome of patients entered into S 0106, a recently reported cooperative group trial for patients with newly diagnosed AML. A total of 589 eligible patients was treated, of whom 150 (25 %) did not achieve a remission while on study and were available for further analysis. The 4 -year survival rate for the entire cohort of 150 patients was 23 %. Among the 64 patients who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, the 4 -year survival rate was 48 % compared with 4 % for the 86 patients who did not undergo transplantation. Among those transplanted, we could not detect a difference in outcome according to remission status, donor source, type of preparative regimen, or cytogenetic risk category. More than 20 % of patients with newly diagnosed AML who fail induction therapy can still be cured, particularly if they are able to receive an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{leading to}} <b>donor</b> <b>identification,</b> consent, organ procurement, and allocation continue to domi-nate debates and {{efforts in the}} field of transplantation. A considerable shortage of donors remains while the number of patients needing organ transplantation in-creases. This article reviews the main trends in organ dona-tion practices and procurement patterns from both de-ceased and living sources in the USA. Although there have been increases in living donation in recent years, 2002 witnessed a much more modest growth of 1 %. Absolute declines in living liver and lung donation were also noted in 2002. In 2002, the number of deceased donors increased by only 1. 6 % (101 donors). Increased donation from de-ceased donors provides more organs for transplanta-tion than a comparable increase in living donation, be-cause on average 3. 6 organs are recovered from each deceased donor. The total number of organs recovered from deceased donors increased by 2. 1 % (462 organs).

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{a growing number}} of {{countries}} have legislated open-identity donation, in which donor-conceived offspring are given access to the donor's identity once the child has reached maturity. It is held that donor anonymity creates identity problems for such children similar to the "genealogical bewilderment" described within the adoption context. The study of the social and psychological effects of open-identity donation is still very much in its infancy, but what has been left unquestioned is whether (and to what extent) offering access to the donor's name and address is an adequate response to such effects. This study has two goals: First, we aim to provide a systematic review of the reasons why donor-conceived (DC) offspring want to know the identity of their sperm donor. Second, we examine to what extent the provision of donor-identifying information can satisfy the reasons mentioned. The most important motivations appear to be: (1) to avoid medical risks and consanguineous relationships; (2) to satisfy curiosity; (3) {{to learn more about the}} self or to complete one's identity; (4) to learn more about what kind of person the donor is (biographical information, why he donated, etc.); (5) to form a relationship with the donor and/or his family; and (6) to learn about one's ancestry/genealogy. Our analysis shows that for nearly all of these reasons access to the donor's identity is not necessary. In those cases where it is, moreover, <b>donor</b> <b>identification</b> is not sufficient. What is really needed is (extended) contact with the donor, rather than the mere provision of his name...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMulti-parametric {{flow cytometry}} {{is a key}} {{technology}} for characterization of immune cell phenotypes. However, robust high-dimensional post-analytic strategies for automated data analysis in large numbers of donors are still lacking. Here, we report a computational pipeline, called FlowGM, which minimizes operator input, is insensitive to compensation settings, and {{can be adapted to}} different analytic panels. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) -based approach was utilized for initial clustering, with the number of clusters determined using Bayesian Information Criterion. Meta-clustering in a reference <b>donor</b> permitted automated <b>identification</b> of 24 cell types across four panels. Cluster labels were integrated into FCS files, thus permitting comparisons to manual gating. Cell numbers and coefficient of variation (CV) were similar between FlowGM and conventional gating for lymphocyte populations, but notably FlowGM provided improved discrimination of “hard-to-gate” monocyte and dendritic cell (DC) subsets. FlowGM thus provides rapid high-dimensional analysis of cell phenotypes and is amenable to cohort studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{lipoprotein}} changes after cardiac transplantation {{have been}} documented, {{the effects of}} transplantation and subsequent immunosuppressive therapy (particularly the combination of prednisone, azathioprine and cyclosporine) on apolipoprotein levels and lipoprotein(a) have not been reported. Fasting cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein A- 1 and B- 100 and lipoprotein(a) were evaluated in 69 consecutive patients during the waiting period before cardiac transplantation. There were 28 deaths before <b>donor</b> organ <b>identification</b> and 41 patients received a cardiac allograft. The lipoprotein levels of transplant recipients were again assayed 3 months postoperatively. Mean (± SEM) values increased for total plasma cholesterol (from 180 ± 8 to 228 ± 8 mg/dl, p ≤ 0. 001), triglycerides (from 126 ± 11 to 207 ± 14 mg/dl; p ≤ 0. 001), HDL cholesterol (from 39 ± 2 to 49 ± 3 mg/dl; p ≤ 0. 002) and LDL cholesterol (from 119 ± 7 to 138 ± 7 mg/dl; p < 0. 02). Apolipoprotein A- 1 and B- 100 also increased, but lipoprotein(a) decreased from 11. 7 ± 1. 7 to 6. 8 ± 1. 1 mg/dl; p ≤ 0. 0001) after transplantation. Although total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, apoliprotein A- 1 and B- 100 increased dramatically after cardiac transplantation, so did HDL cholesterol, thereby keeping the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio constant. The surprising decrease in lipoprotein(a) after cardiac transplantation suggests that metabolism of lipoprotein(a) is independent of LDL cholesterol and that immunosuppressive drugs either decrease the synthesis or increase catabolism of lipoprotein(a) ...|$|R
40|$|Serum samples {{identified}} as positive for total anti-HBc, but negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, {{are referred to}} as anti-HBc alone. This serological response is compatible with acute, resolved, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection but might also signify occult HBV infection. Once the anti-HBc alone pattern is detected, false-positive reactivity should be ruled out and further analyses can resolve the clinical status of the <b>donor.</b> The <b>identification</b> of anti-HBc positivity in the absence of HBsAg in organ transplant donors and in candidate patients for chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation because of the risk of HBV reactivation. False-positive detection, acute infection during the window phase, and resolved or chronic HBV infection are all possible and only distinguishable if the additional assays are done and measures of liver damage are taken into account. Measurement of serum anti-HBs responses after the administration of HBV vaccination can be useful to distinguish this serological profile. In view of the low risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc alone patients who are candidates for immunosuppressive treatment, such patients might not require pre-emptive antiviral therapy, but should be followed up on a monthly basis for alanine aminotransferase followed by quantitative HBV DNA testing in those with alanine aminotransferase increase. According to specific guidelines, nucleoside analogue prophylaxis is recommended in anti-HBc-positive liver allograft recipients and anti-HBc alone individuals who receive chemotherapy or biological therapy and should be continued for 6 – 12 months after discontinuation of such immunosuppressive therapies to protect against HBV reactivation...|$|R
