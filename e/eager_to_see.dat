5|$|In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone {{topped the}} New York Times list of best-selling fiction, and stayed {{near the top}} of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult {{sections}} under pressure from other publishers who were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their books given higher placings. Publishers Weeklys report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6million copies).|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} months, Johnson flew as a night fighter pilot. Using day fighters {{to act as}} night fighters without radar was largely {{unsuccessful}} in intercepting German bombers during The Blitz; Johnson's only action occurred on 22 February 1941 when he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110 in Spitfire R6611, QJ-F. A week later, Johnson's squadron was moved to RAF Tangmere on the Channel coast. Johnson was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> combat after just 10.40 operational hours and welcomed the prospect of meeting the enemy from Tangmere. If the Germans did not resume their assault the Wing {{was to take the}} fight to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} troops escorting Choe and his Korean party reached Jiantiao Battalion on March 8; on {{the next}} day, they travelled by boat across Sanmen Bay to reach the Yuexi Police Station and Post House. On March 10, the party travelled along the postal route to Baiqiao Station, a courier centre between Taizhou and Ningbo prefectures. The courier officials were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Koreans off, since a party of 43 was a somewhat large group for a courier station to provide sudden accommodations for.|$|E

5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with such}} {{conflicting}} accounts {{and unable to}} reach a conclusion, the Parlement announced on 15 September {{that the two men}} would fight to the death on 27 November 1386 to decide guilt in the case. If Carrouges lost, then Marguerite would be burnt at the stake for perjury. In fact, the duel was delayed a month as the King and his court, which contained most of the country's senior dukes and generals, was held up on campaign in Flanders and could not return in time. <b>Eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what was rapidly becoming the event of the season, the King ordered the duel postponed until 29 December so that he would be present for its culmination.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the Second Punic War, Hannibal crossed into Italy by {{traversing}} the Pyrenees and the Alps during the summer and early autumn. He quickly won major victories over the Romans at Trebia and at Lake Trasimene. After these losses, the Romans appointed Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus as dictator to deal with the threat. Fabius used attrition warfare against Hannibal, cutting off his supply lines and avoiding pitched battles. These tactics proved unpopular with the Romans who, as they recovered from the shock of Hannibal's victories, began to question the wisdom of the Fabian strategy, which had given the Carthaginian army a chance to regroup. The majority of Romans were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a quick conclusion to the war. It was feared that, if Hannibal continued plundering Italy unopposed, Rome's allies might defect to the Carthaginian side for self-preservation.|$|E

40|$|In {{the years}} from the first {{production}} of The Black Crook in 1866 to The Earl and the Girl in 1905, American musical theater was character-ized by change and evolution. The country had no stable theatrical institutions or tradition, and most performers were borrowed from the Old World. Yet producers grew rich from the masses of people <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the latest novelties; composers and performers readily found an audi-ence; publishers were inundated with both American and uncopyrighted European music, which they printed in cheap editions for home consumption; and audiences in unprecedented numbers, in the most cosmopolitan cities {{as well as the}} smallest isolated towns, supported musica...|$|R
5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states.

There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|R
5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing {{was written}} by A. S. Neill and {{published}} by Hart Publishing Company in 1960. In a letter to Neill, New York publisher Harold Hart suggested a book specific for America devised of parts from four of Neill's previous works: The Problem Child, The Problem Parent, The Free Child, and That Dreadful School. Neill liked his idea and gave the publisher wide liberties in the manuscript's preparation, preferring to write a preface or appendix in reflection on the writings. In rereading his work, he realized he disagreed with his earlier statements on Freudian child analysis. Neill later regretted the liberties he afforded the publisher, particularly his removal of Wilheim Reich's name from the book and index, since Neill saw Reich as an influential figure. They also struggled over issues of copyrights. Neill did not contest his disagreements, as he was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the book published.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{capitulation}} {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Kościuszko, who had not lost a single battle in the campaign. By mid-September 1792 he was resigned to leaving the country, and in early October he departed from Warsaw. First he went east, to the Czartoryski family manor at Sieniawa, which gathered various malcontents. In mid-November he spent two weeks in Lwów (in Ukrainian, Lviv; in German, Lemberg), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the famed commander. Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who held Lwów, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, but he left Lwów before they could do so. At {{the turn of the}} month, he stopped in Zamość at the Zamoyskis' estate, met Stanisław Staszic, then went on to Puławy.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{has often}} stated that, while he will allow {{some of his}} work to be optioned for film under the right circumstances, he has little {{interest}} in movies and is not overly <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his work filmed. In 1999, his short story The Sixth Sentinel (filmed as The Dream Sentinel) comprised one segment of episode 209 of The Hunger, a short-lived horror anthology series on Showtime. Of all his books, only Lost Souls is currently under option, by producer Paul Natale.|$|E

Had they waited another day, they {{would no longer have}} {{required}} her father's consent. Their marriage proved a remarkable business partnership, with Clara acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidant to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after they married, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his grandchildren.|$|E

25|$|Maradona {{played his}} first World Cup tournament in 1982 {{in his new}} country of residence, Spain. Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. The Catalan crowd was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their new world-record signing Maradona in action, {{but he did not}} perform to expectations, as Argentina, the {{defending}} champions, lost 1–0. Although the team convincingly beat both Hungary and El Salvador in Alicante to progress to the second round, there were internal tensions within the team, with the younger, less experienced players at odds with the older, more experienced players. In a team that also included such players as Mario Kempes, Osvaldo Ardiles, Ramón Díaz, Daniel Bertoni, Alberto Tarantini, Ubaldo Fillol and Daniel Passarella, the Argentine side was defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners Italy. The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile, as Italy beat Argentina at the Sarrià Stadium in Barcelona, 2–1.|$|E
25|$|Kitchener {{was born}} in Ballylongford near Listowel, County Kerry, in Ireland, son of army officer Henry Horatio Kitchener (1805–1894) and Frances Anne Chevallier (d. 1864; {{daughter}} of John Chevallier, a priest, and his third wife, Elizabeth, née Cole). His father had only recently bought land in Ireland, under a scheme to encourage the purchase of land, after selling his commission. They then moved to Switzerland where the young Kitchener was educated at Montreux, then at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Pro-French and <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> action, he joined a French field ambulance unit in the Franco-Prussian War. His father took him back to Britain after he caught pneumonia while ascending in a balloon to see the French Army of the Loire in action. Commissioned into the Royal Engineers on 4January 1871, his service in France had violated British neutrality, and he was reprimanded by the Duke of Cambridge, the commander-in-chief. He served in Palestine, Egypt and Cyprus as a surveyor, learned Arabic, and prepared detailed topographical maps of the areas. His brother, Lt. Gen. Sir Walter Kitchener, had also entered the army, and was Governor of Bermuda from 1908 to 1912.|$|E

25|$|Development on Sakura Wars {{lasted for}} {{approximately}} three years, double the original estimate. Hiroi acted {{as the general}} producer, while Ito acted as general director. The CGI segments were developed by Buildup Entertainment and Neverland; the anime sequences were handled by Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie. Sega initially outsourced programming to an unnamed external company, and by 1995 it had already developed one or two chapters of the game's combat-based content before Hiroi objected to the direction the game was taking, becoming a generic simulation game that deviated from his vision. Red Company refused to continue development of the prototype, and the external studio was removed from development. <b>Eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the game completed, duties were transferred to Sega's internal studio Sega CS2 R, which would co-develop the game with Red Company. The conflicting gameplay elements needed to be divided between different teams within Sega CS2 R, only bringing the two parts together {{at the end of}} development. Due to this development technique, none of the elements could be effectively tested until the game was close to completion. Due to these various development difficulties, the Sega team found production difficult. Sega also commented in an interview that Sakura Wars was their most expensive video game production to date, although no exact budget was given.|$|E
