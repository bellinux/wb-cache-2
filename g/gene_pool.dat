5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer <b>gene</b> <b>pool</b> and create hybrids, depleting the purebred <b>gene</b> <b>pool.</b> For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E
5|$|Rhinocyllus conicus, a seed-feeding weevil, was {{introduced}} to North America to control exotic musk thistle (Carduus nutans) and Canadian thistle (Cirsium arvense). However the weevil also attacks native thistles, harming such species as the endemic Platte thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum) by selecting larger plants (which reduced the <b>gene</b> <b>pool),</b> reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species' survival.|$|E

In this study investigate the extent of diversity of European germplasm compared to the American germplasm and to define the level of introgression between the European Mesoamerican and Andean <b>gene</b> <b>pools</b> are investigated. 68 accessions representative of Mesoamerican and Andean American <b>gene</b> <b>pools</b> and 241 accessions from 24 different countries belonging to an European bean core collection were analysed for three morphologic quantitative (length, height and width) and 4 qualitative (shape, lighter colour, darker colour and coat pattern of seed) seed characters and for 4 AFLP primer combinations: E-AGT/MGAC, E-AGT/M-GTA, E-ACC/M-AGA and E-ACC/M-ATG. A total of 138 polymorphic bands were scored among the 309 accessions analysed. The European and the Mesoamerican <b>gene</b> <b>pools</b> {{had a number of}} common and very common AFLP polymorphic bands higher than the American and the Andean <b>gene</b> <b>pools.</b> The European accessions moreover were used for Structure and cpSSR analysis to identify pure and introgressed lines. These groups were compared for morphological traits and AFLP profiles.

40|$|Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is {{the most}} {{important}} edible food legume in the world. It is an important source of calories, proteins, dietary fibres, minerals and vitamins for millions of people in both developing and developed countries. Common bean was originated and domesticated in the New World and has two major <b>gene</b> <b>pools,</b> the Andean and the Mesoamerican, based on their centers of origin in South and Central America, respectively. The existence of Andean and Mesoamerican <b>gene</b> <b>pools</b> is supported by molecular marker analyses (seed storage protein, isozymes, RFLPs, RAPDs, AFLPs, and SSRs). These can be complemented by DNA sequence data that provide a complete and unambiguous genotype of all specific genomic regions. In this study we assessed the frequency of SNPs in a fragment of P. vulgaris DNA localized on the B 8 linkage group. This fragment was obtained from genomic DNA. We conducted a sequence analysis of 80 European domesticated landraces, belonging to a European core collection, 147 American wild and domesticated common bean genotypes, that had been previously assigned to the Andean or Mesoamerican <b>gene</b> <b>pools</b> using phaseolin patterns and as a control, 10 genotypes of P. coccineus, P. lunatus, P. acutifolius and P. polyanthus. Including indels, sequence lengths was 393 bp. In P. vulgaris one 46 bp indel and 4 SNPs distinguished unequivocally the Mesoamerican and the Andean <b>gene</b> <b>pools.</b> The population structure identified in this study is generally consistent with the current hierarchical scheme of <b>gene</b> <b>pools.</b> This DNA sequence displays 5 polymorphic markers that discriminate very clearly the two <b>gene</b> <b>pools</b> of P. vulgaris...|$|R

5|$|Artificial selection, the {{deliberate}} selective breeding of domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial <b>gene</b> <b>pool</b> of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed <b>gene</b> <b>pool</b> in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E

40|$|The recent rapid {{developments}} in biotechnology have made great {{contributions to the}} study of plant <b>gene</b> <b>pools.</b> The application of in vitro methods in freeze storage and DNA protection techniques in fast production studies has made major advances. From that aspect, biotechnology is an indispensable means for the protection of plant <b>gene</b> <b>pools,</b> which includes the insurance of sustainable agriculture and development of species. Besides all the positive developments, one of the primary risks posed by the uncontrolled spreading of genetically modified organisms is the possibility for other non-target organisms to be negatively affected. Genes of plant origin should be given priority in this type of studies by taking into consideration such negative effects that may result in disruption of ecological balance and damage to plant genetic pools. Turkey, due to its ecological conditions and history, has a very important position in terms of plant <b>gene</b> <b>pools.</b> This richness ought to be protected without corrupting its natural quality and natural evolution process in order to provide the sources of species that will be required for future sustainable agricultural applications. Thus, attention should be paid to the use of biotechnological methods, which play an important role especially in the protection and use of local and original plant <b>gene</b> <b>pools...</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{controversy}} has existed over {{the origins of}} captive breeding stock used by The Peregrine Fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous United States. Several peregrine subspecies {{were included in the}} breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the extirpation of the eastern anatum (Falco peregrinus anatum), the near extirpation of the anatum in the Midwest, and the limited <b>gene</b> <b>pool</b> within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole.|$|E

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to assess the genetic structure of wild Phaseolus lunatus L. in the Americas and the hypothesis of a relatively recent Andean origin of the species. For this purpose, nuclear and non-coding chloroplast DNA markers were analyzed {{in a collection of}} 59 wild Lima bean accessions and six allied species. Twenty-three chloroplast and 28 nuclear DNA haplotypes were identified and shown to be geographically structured. Three highly divergent wild Lima bean <b>gene</b> <b>pools,</b> AI, MI, and MII, with mostly non-overlapping geographic ranges, are proposed. The results support an Andean origin of wild Lima beans during Pleistocene times and an early divergence of the three <b>gene</b> <b>pools</b> at an age that is posterior to completion of the Isthmus of Panama and major Andean orogeny. <b>Gene</b> <b>pools</b> would have evolved and reached their current geographic distribution mainly in isolation and therefore are of high priority for conservation and breeding programs.

5|$|Over time, {{because of}} the {{relatively}} limited number of potential consorts, the <b>gene</b> <b>pool</b> of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines of descent, such as the numerous European royalty and nobility descended from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom or King Christian IX of Denmark. The House of Habsburg was infamous for inbreeding, with the Habsburg lip cited as an ill effect, although no genetic evidence has proved the allegation. The closely related houses of Habsburg, Bourbon, Braganza and Wittelsbach also engaged in first-cousin unions frequently and in double-cousin and uncle-niece marriages occasionally.|$|E

The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around the world that are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.|$|E

5|$|The mallard is {{considered}} to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Unlike many waterfowl, mallards are considered an invasive species in some regions. It is a very adaptable species, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The non-migratory mallard interbreeds with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild <b>gene</b> <b>pool</b> gets genetically polluted by the domesticated and feral mallard populations.|$|E

The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the <b>gene</b> <b>pool</b> of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation.
