40|$|Measurement of {{infrastructure}} has highly {{evolved in the}} last years. Scanning systems became more precise and many methods were found to add and improve content created {{for the analysis of}} buildings and landscapes. Therefore the pure amount of data increased significantly and new algorithms had to be found to visualize these data for further exploration. Additionally many data types and formats originate from different sources, such as <b>Dibits</b> hybrid scanning systems delivering laser-scanned point clouds and photogrammetric texture images. These are usually analyzed separately. Combinations of different types of data are not widely used but might lead to new findings and improved data exploration. In our work we use different data formats like meshes, unprocessed point clouds and polylines in tunnel visualization to give experts a tool to explore existing datasets in depth {{with a wide variety of}} possibilities. The diverse creation of datasets leads to new challenges for preprocessing, out-of-core rendering and efficient fusion of this varying information. Interactive analysis of different formats of data also has to have several approaches and is usually difficult to merge into one application. In this paper we describe the challenges and advantages of the combination of different data sources in tunnel visualization. Large meshes with high resolution textures are merged with dense point clouds and additional measurements. Interactive analysis can also create additional information, which has to be integrated precisely to prevent errors and misinterpretation. We present the basic algorithms used for heterogeneous data formats, how we combined them and what advantages are created by our methods. Several datasets evolve over time. This dynamic is also considered in our visualization and analysis methods to enable change detection. For tunnel monitoring this allows to investigate the entire history of the construction project and helps to make better informed decisions in the preceding construction phases or for repairs. Several methods are merged like the data they are based on enabling new ways of data exploration. In analyzing this new approach to look at heterogeneous datasets we come to the conclusion that the combination of different sources leads to a better solution than the sum of its parts...|$|R

40|$|Practical {{recording}} channels deviate {{significantly from}} the oft-used model based on linearity and additive Gaussian noise. Among the well-known anomalies are partial erasure and transition jitter. In this paper, we first describe a precompensation technique to combat the partial erasure effect. It utilizes the unique property of the maximum transition run (MTR) code wherein all dibits are isolated. The idea {{is to increase the}} spacing between the two transitions that make up each <b>dibit.</b> This tends to mitigate the nonlinear amplitude reduction associated with partial erasure. Next, we consider a recording channel that is linear but subject to transition jitter. We modify the hyperplane-based detector known as 3 D- 110 by introducing data-dependent threshold terms. The overall complexity of the detector is small, yet this modification provides almost 2 dB of improvement relative to the original 3 D- 110 structure and the extended partial response maximum likelihood (EPRML) method tuned to additive Gaussian noise...|$|E

40|$|Icings fed by {{perennial}} {{discharge of}} groundwater cause traffic and maintenance problems at several {{points along the}} Alaska Highway in the Yukon. At the site investigated in detail (km 1817. 5), slightly mineralized groundwater is being discharged {{at a rate of}} up to 9. 4 m 3 per hour. Isotope analyses indicate that the discharge is derived from recent precipitation. During the 19791 1980 winter, icing extended 240 m upstream from the highway, with a maximum thickness of 2. 55 m and a total volume of about 14, 000 m 3; icing covered the highway on several occasions. Maximum predicted icing volume for this site is 33, 000 m 3, which would increase average thick-ness by 1. 2 m and extend the icing area to about 350 m upstream from the highway. Annual expen-ditures for icing control at this and other icing sites can be reduced considerably (or eliminated) by improved management of groundwater discharge, through installation of subdrains, through provision of "icing-storage " areas, or some combination of these.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} some {{techniques that}} enhance a receiver's {{performance in a}} wireless voice communication system where differential phase shift keying (DPSK) is the adopted modulation scheme and soft-decision decoding is used to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} channel coding scheme. First, several fundamental issues regarding the statistical properties of fading channels are provided. We demonstrate the constraints, that must be satisfied so that the channel can be regarded as impaired by ﲦlat (i. e., non-frequency-selective) fading with a constant fading factor over each symbol duration. Throughout this thesis these constraints are assumed to be satisfied. We next investigate the channel capacity and cutoff rates for fading channels with DPSK-modulated input signals and perfect symbol interleaving. The impact of the channel state information (CSI), on these information-theoretic limits is also discussed. We introduce several symbol metrics for soft-decision decoding, and their performance is investigated by analytical derivation as well as by simulation. Furthermore, we define a bit metric for DQPSK modulation, and compare this bit metric to <b>dibit</b> (symbol) metrics. We then consider the problem of error concealment for mobile radio, communications with a maximum-likelihood soft- decision decoder. A normalized codeword reliability is defined as the decision reliability information when CSI is not available. We employ a given, interpolation algorithm on a particular land mobile radio system and design a rule for selecting unreliable codewords. Simulation results show that error concealment can decrease the minimum operational signal-noise ratio (SNR) by 3 dB or more. Finally, we address the problem of exploiting the residual redundancy in the source to enhance the channel decoder's performance -i. e., maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding. We use two simple source models to demonstrate that MAP decoding can achieve significant gain over maximum-likelihood decoding. We employ a practical CELP-based land mobile radio system to show that significant residual redundancy does exist in the output of some source encoders. Simulation results show that a 2 - 3 dB gain can be achieved by MAP decoding (over ML) at low SNR. <P...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Randall H. Victoria. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 118 pages. Two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) {{has been proposed}} as a promising approach for ultra-high densities towards 10 Tbits/in 2. How to effectively write and detect the data to reach such a high density is a challenge. For read back and detection process, a novel system design for sensing very high density magnetic recording data is investigated. The rotated single head (RSH) with oversampled signals, minimum mean squared error equalizers and pattern-dependent noise prediction detector has been proposed. The bit error rate (BER) can be decreased {{by a factor of}} 5 compared to a normally oriented head array, increasing user bit density to 10. 04 Tbits/in 2 with conventional media. Simulation indicates that a rotated head achieves a density gain of 1. 7 x (single head) or 2. 1 x (array) over a normally oriented single head (NSH) at a target BER of 10 - 3 with sampling period of 2 nm. The study indicates that the significant improvement in performance of the rotated head compared to the normally oriented head {{can be attributed to the}} larger amplitude of its <b>dibit</b> response and the reduced overlap between conditional probability density functions. The proposed reader has been also applied to bit patterned magnetic recording: it has more than 20 dB gain compared to a normally oriented head array for reading back at 10 Tbits/in 2. For the writing process, micromagnetic writing on 8 nm grains and readback with various readers has also been studied. For a conventional writer recording a pseudo-random binary sequence with 2 Tbits/in 2 channel bit density, user densities of 1. 52 Tbits/in 2 and 1. 09 Tbits/in 2 can be achieved with a RSH and a NSH, respectively, using oversampling signal processing. Simulation indicates that a RSH with multiple scans and 2 D equalization provides better resistance to a skew angle of 15 ° than NSH. An optimized shingled writer is proposed; simulation indicates that a RSH and rotated head array can reach a user areal density of 3. 76 and 4. 52 Tbits/in 2 for 2 grains per channel bit, which is close to the predicted maximum user areal density (4. 66 Tbits/in 2) for this grain size obtained with an ideal writer and reader...|$|E
