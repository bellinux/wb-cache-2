50|$|Since the {{realization}} that performance goal orientation is best split into two separate parts, researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of these three dimensions to goal orientation. Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that {{the factor structure of}} Goal Orientation does indeed lend itself to three distinct dimensions, as summarized below. An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> are also included for completeness.|$|E
50|$|One main {{contribution}} of the disclosure processes model is to incorporate dispositional factors, namely antecedent goals, into the process of stigma management. The DPM posits that disclosure is regulated by the goal orientation (either approach-focused or avoidance-focused) held by individuals. Approach-focused goals are associated with attention to positive stimuli, positive affect, and approach-focused coping strategies, whereas avoidance-focused goals are associated with attention to negative stimuli, negative effect, and avoidance-focused coping strategies. The model suggests that goals influence outcomes throughout the entire disclosure process. Therefore, {{it is critical to}} understand how the <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> lead people to disclose in order to understand when disclosure is beneficial.|$|E

5000|$|Subsequent work by Eison {{and colleagues}} in 1982, {{led to a}} change in the {{conceptualization}} of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs. [...] More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation style simultaneously: persons can be high in both learning and performance orientations, low in both learning and performance orientations, or high in one orientation and low in the other. Ultimately, individuals can entertain multiple competing <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> at the same time, striving to both outperform competitors and improve their own performance. This led to the conceptualization of two separate continuums, one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} great debate if goal {{orientation}} should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the goal orientation literature, there are inconsistencies {{with regard to the}} conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They articulated that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state [...] "depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support" [...] (p. 1115). State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation. It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. However, state goal orientation is [...] "specific to the task and context at hand" [...] (p. 5). For example, VandeWalle, Cron & Slocum stated that goal orientation can be domain specific. They stated that it is possible for an individual to have a strong learning goal orientation in their academic domain but not in their work domain. Trait goal orientation refers to the [...] "consistent pattern of responses in achievement situations based on the individual's standing on goal orientation dimensions". This view of goal orientation treats the construct as a stable, individual difference characteristic. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct, stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. These authors found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional <b>goal</b> <b>orientations.</b> However, when [...] "dispositional <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation (p. 40). Thus, trait and state goal orientation interact, so both operationalizations should be considered simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Goal {{orientation}} {{has also}} been linked to organizational outcomes, specifically job performance. Payne et al. found that individuals {{with high levels of}} trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance. They found that PPGO was unrelated to performance. The authors also found that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics. This finding suggests that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be {{in the best interest of}} organizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance. In another study by VandeWalle, Cron & Slocum, the authors found that individuals with a learning goal orientation had higher sales performance than those with performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientations.</b> This finding suggests that in order to be successful in organizational setting, individuals must have the desire to develop their skills.|$|E

40|$|The dualistic {{model of}} passion theorizes that passion is multidimensional, {{consisting}} of both harmonious passion and obsessive passion. Similarly, theories regarding <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> assert that <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> is a multifaceted construct, {{consisting of a}} learning <b>goal</b> <b>orientation,</b> prove performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation,</b> and avoid performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation.</b> Specifically, this study aimed {{to determine if the}} combination of an employee’s work <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> and passion for work is predictive of the amount of job stress he or she perceives. Data from individuals (N= 116) employed full-time were collected through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Only obsessive work passion was found to be positively related to perceived job stress.

5000|$|Research has {{produced}} mixed results when examining {{the relationship between}} cognitive ability and goal orientation. For example, Eison found that learning-oriented (learning goal orientation) students had higher levels of cognitive ability than grade-oriented (performance goal orientation) students. However, Dweck and her colleagues were unable to find any relationship between the constructs. [...] Although findings are mixed, [...] "a substantial body of theory and research suggests motivational and ability traits are generally uncorrelated" [...] (p. 130). In a meta-analysis by Payne and her colleagues, cognitive ability and goal orientation {{were found to be}} independent constructs. Accordingly, individuals with high cognitive ability are equally likely to hold learning, prove performance, and avoid performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientations.</b> These authors also found that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond cognitive ability. [...] Based on this research, goal orientation, rather than cognitive ability, serves as useful tool for practitioners to use to predict job performance.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{goal setting}} theory has {{primarily}} {{been concerned with}} performance goals. Locke and Latham summarize 25 years of goal setting research by stating {{that as long as}} an individual is committed to a goal and has the ability to achieve it, specific, high (hard) goals lead to a higher level of task performance than vague or easy goals. However, the vast majority of goal setting studies have been conducted with a specific performance goal and often in laboratory settings where the task was fairly simple. It is possible that when tasks are more complex or require a long-term commitment, adopting a learning goal may lead to higher performance. Fan, Meng, Billings, Litchfield and Kaplan found that the relationship between trait learning goal orientation and goal-setting was moderated by self-efficacy such that individuals high in learning goal orientation and self-efficacy set higher goal that those high in learning goal orientation but low in self-efficacy. This finding suggests that while learning goal orientation can influence goal setting, the relationship also depends on other factors such as the individual's level of self-efficacy. Fan et al. also found that learning and prove <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> facilitated challenge striving, suggesting that either orientation can effectively facilitate motivation for goal attainment. Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of complexity inherent in the situation or task. In situations with more complex tasks, it appears that [...] "do your best" [...] goals may actually lead to higher performance than specific goals. It is possible that in complex tasks, a specific, difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees, making {{it difficult for them to}} learn the complex task due to this increased pressure. [...] Kanfer and Ackerman found that in an air trafﬁc controller simulation (a highly complex task), having a performance-outcome goal actually interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task. People performed better when they were asked to do their best. This suggests that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings. However, it may be possible to set a specific, difficult learning goal. Latham and Brown found that when MBA students set specific, difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material, they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA. Locke and Latham claim that creating a specific, difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance, such as in an MBA program.|$|E

50|$|Just over {{a decade}} after Dweck {{conceptualized}} the two-factor model of <b>goal</b> <b>orientation,</b> VandeWalle proposed that <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> is better conceptualized as a three-factor model, further dividing performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> into the dimensions of avoidant performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> (APGO) and prove performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> (PPGO). APGO is centered on the goal of avoiding failure and negative judgment from others centered on lack of competence while PPGO is centered on demonstrating performance to prove competence.

Method: Participants were 116 competitive tennis players (mean age = 19. 99, SD = 5. 82), who completed questionnaires measuring <b>goal</b> <b>orientations,</b> effort, enjoyment, and psychological skill use in training and competition, perceived improvement in training, and perceived performance in competition. Results: Dependent t-tests revealed that athletes reported higher task orientation in training than in competition and higher ego orientation in competition than in training, while Pearson product-moment correlations revealed a high cross-contextual consistency for both task and ego <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> between training and competition. Regression analyses indicated that task orientation predicted positively effort, enjoyment, self-talk, and goal setting in both contexts, perceived improvement in training, and perceived performance in competition. An interaction effect also emerged whereby ego orientation predicted positively effort in competition only when task orientation was low or average.

It was also investigated whether the effects of global <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> generalize across contexts. Method: Participants were middle school students (N = 351, N = 580 and N = 658) who completed the two <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> instruments, measures of self-regulation, affect and beliefs at the global level of generality and specific to the physical education domain and measures of exercise and academic behaviours. Results: Multi-sample factor analysis established the factorial validity of the global goal orientations' instrument and the distinctiveness of global goals from achievement goals in physical education. Controlling for social desirability effects, the partial correlations of <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> in life with global intrinsic-extrinsic motivation, life satisfaction, pleasant and unpleasant affect in life, purposes of life and perceived purposes of physical education, locomotion and assessment, metacognition in physical education, exercise and academic behaviours, were in the expected direction.

The sample included 381 elementary school teachers. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and hierarchical multiple regression were used to examine the relationships between and among high-stakes testing and issues teachers perceive to be related to these tests, stress related to high-stakes tests, school accountability status, teachers’ achievement <b>goal</b> <b>orientations,</b> teaching self-efficacy, and perceptions of teacher help-seeking. Results suggest that, for this sample, dimensions of teachers’ achievement <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> differ from the dimensions characterized by Butler and colleagues (Butler, 2007; Butler 2 ̆ 6 Shibaz, 2008; Nitsche et al., 2010; Cho 2 ̆ 6 Shim, 2013; Shim et al., 2013). Specifically, teachers in this sample exhibited mastery and work-avoidance goals, as characterized by Butler (2007), but not performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals. Teachers here distinguished between personal performance orientation, or motivation driven by external factors (e. g., recognition from administrators) and using others as the referent to which they compared their own performance (e. g., colleagues). Additionally, class performance orientation emerged as a distinct dimension of teachers’ achievement <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> for this sample. Those who espoused this orientation sought for their classes to compare favorably with other classes and were motivated by external factors, such as their class scoring high on state-wide tests. Teacher achievement <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> were related to high-stakes testing, but school issues related to high-stakes testing and stress associated with these tests were more salient predictors of teachers’ achievement <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> than whether teachers taught in testing grades or not.

Appraisals of task importance, demand, performance, and confidence predict discrete emotions as expected. <b>Goal</b> <b>orientations</b> predict average emotional experience across people. Within-person, <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> moderate relationships between task importance and concurrent emotions. Those low on learning, high on prove, or high on avoid goal orientation become more stressed and sad and less happy more rapidly as task importance rises...|$|E

Using 25 students from the University of Western Ontario, the research assessed performance on a memory recall task and compared this to a measure of <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> using the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales. No significant results were found, thus predictions relating to post-task performance cannot be safely made using <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> theory...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Goal</b> <b>orientation</b> is an [...] "individual {{disposition}} toward developing or validating one's {{ability in}} achievement settings". [...] Previous research has examined <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> as a motivation variable useful for recruitment, climate and culture, performance appraisal, and selection. Studies have also used <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> to predict sales performance, goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors in training, and leadership. [...] Due {{to the many}} theoretical and practical applications of <b>goal</b> <b>orientation,</b> {{it is important to}} understand the construct and how it relates to other variables. In this entry, <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> will be reviewed in terms of its history, stability, dimensionality, antecedents, its relationship to goal setting and consequences, its relevance to motivation, and future directions for research.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} attends to a {{broad range}} of practically significant employee achievement goals and provides insight into how to enhance individual-level performance by examining the antecedents to individual-level state <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> in organizational work groups. State <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> is defined here as a temporary achievement goal, and it is theorized that leadership and work group climate processes parallel each dimension of state <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> to cue and ultimately induce the corresponding achievement goal among individual work group members. The leader's achievement priority is argued to drive the formation of work group climate consistent with this priority. The resulting work group climate signals and compels group members to adopt the ascribed form of state <b>goal</b> <b>orientation.</b> The quality of the leader-member exchange (LMX) relationship is viewed as a means to internalize cues from the work group climate in the emergence of state <b>goal</b> <b>orientation.</b> Results from experimental and field studies provide evidence that (1) leadership and climate perceptions are related to their parallel form of state <b>goal</b> <b>orientation,</b> (2) the relation between individual perceptions of a climate for learning and state learning <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> is stronger when group members enjoy higher quality exchange relationships with their leader, and (3) state <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> may be validly and reliably assessed using the measure created especially for this research...|$|R
