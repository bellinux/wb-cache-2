2500|$|On March 20, 2009, {{the town}} of Esparto, California was shaken and windows were {{shattered}} by a blast created by [...] of ANFO during filming of the myth [...] "Knock Your Socks Off". Some residents were upset that the blast took place without [...] "telling anyone". Chief Barry Burns, of Esparto Fire Department, had several firefighters {{on hand for the}} explosion. He said he made the decision not to notify anyone in town for safety's sake. [...] "MythBusters {{is supposed to be a}} really popular show. Everybody would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> We would have had to cancel it because it would have been too dangerous." [...] Representatives from the show replaced some of the windows that same day. The experiment did air, but the hosts recounted in a 2011 special episode ("Location, Location, Location") that they have never returned to the Esparto quarry as a result of the mishap.|$|E
2500|$|On May 22, 2009, a video went viral of Hamilton freestyling, {{and then}} getting {{assaulted}} by his former girlfriend/fellow rapper Briana Latrise, the stepdaughter of Mary J. Blige, due to Hamilton rapping, [...] "OK, call me irresponsible and immature, but you're beautiful, {{what the hell}} else would I hit it for? Now I can say that I hit it raw, but {{that would mean that}} you will have to get an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk to you about it. I {{just wanted to tell you}} I apologize because I know what I shouldn't have said", and with Latrise remarking, [...] "I'm going to thank you for your apology. I'm going to apologize for acting outside of the norm. We're going to talk about our personal business, on our personal time." ...|$|E

I have heard those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> say that in such cases everything depends upon getting the first shot. I am anxious about you, and shall not be easy until I see you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|When he had gone, Noel {{looked at}} her visitor {{drinking}} his coffee. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> too, and he was alive; with only a little limp. The visitor smiled and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He unquestionably knew {{many of the}} officers, for uncle {{told me that he}} {{recognized}} several men who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> when he met them at the club, and went up and addressed them by name." ...|$|R
50|$|No one <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> The desert, {{as far as}} the Department Dept of Suppy was concerned... was an unknown, as it was to {{the whole}} of Western Australia. The Warburton Ranges were as far as anybody got. People in those days knew {{absolutely}} nothing about Aborigines.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} that exactly," [...] Hunterleys replied. [...] "Unfortunately, my enemies are {{suspicious}} and they have taken to watching me closely. They pretty well know what I am going to tell you--that I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> at the urgent request of the Secret Service Department of the present Government. I have been in Greece and Servia and Roumania, and, although I don't think there's a soul in the world knows, I have also been in St. Petersburg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] said Mr. Butt warmly, [...] "I don't {{mind that}} a bit. The way I {{look at it}} is, here are these two young people, only married a few weeks, just moving into their new house, {{everything}} probably upside down, no one there but themselves, no one to cheer them up,"--he was wriggling into his raincoat as he spoke and working himself into a frenzy of benevolence,--"good gracious, I only learned at dinner time that {{they had come to}} town, or I'd <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> days ago,--days ago--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are hunters," [...] {{the other}} said briefly, [...] "and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> more or less, {{since we were}} boys. We knows what Injins is, and have fought them agin and agin; {{but none of us}} have ever made this journey,--indeed there warn't five men who had ever crossed the Rockies by the {{northern}} track afore the gold scare began. But I know enough of the country to know as it will be a fearful journey, and full half of these people as you see fooling about here as if they were out for a summer excursion will leave their bones by the way." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{a minute}} longer, I think {{somebody}} would have shot him," [...] said one witness. [...] "People were booing him, flipping him off." [...] For his own safety, Cohen was escorted from the venue (much {{of the event}} appears in the movie). A credible news report about the incident, aired on a local television station, {{is included in the}} DVD extras.|$|R

"I have learned, lads," [...] he said, [...] "from a Spaniard who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> {{of a land}} abounding with gold, {{lying to}} the west of the Spanish Islands. As yet, none of them have ventured thither; and I mean that we shall be the first to reap the harvest. Why should these Spaniards keep every good thing to themselves? We are as good sailors as they are, and better; as good men, and better. Therefore, I say, we will have a share of the prizes.|$|R
5000|$|Tazewell County Coroner Dennis Conover {{and other}} experts {{concluded}} that Montoya likely exhibited blatant symptoms of hepatitis and cancer, most notably dramatic weight loss, a swollen abdomen and yellow eyes. They said that those symptoms, {{as well as the}} severe pain Montoya complained of, should have prompted staff to transport the prisoner immediately to the hospital. The Associated Press quoted Conover as stating, [...] "He shouldn't have died in agony like that...he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> long enough that he should have at least died in the hospital." ...|$|R
60|$|Peter went {{on until}} he found a new patch of sweet clover. Then he forgot all about Yellow-Wing. He was too busy filling that big stomach of his to think of {{anything}} else. When he couldn't find room for another leaf of clover he went home to the dear Old Briar-patch, and there in his favorite spot he settled himself to rest and think or dream as the case might be. Presently his thoughts returned to Yellow-Wing, and he chuckled again {{at the memory of}} his fright that morning. And then for the first time it struck Peter as queer that Yellow-Wing should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on the Green Meadows on the ground. He often had seen Yellow-Wing on the ground, but until that moment there never had seemed anything queer about that. Now, however, it suddenly came to Peter that Yellow-Wing belonged in trees, not on the ground.|$|E
6000|$|It {{has been}} of the {{greatest}} interest, it has been delightful, to me to receive to-night your so generous and informing letter. The poor little pamphlet for which you [...] "thank" [...] me is a helpless and empty thing--for which I should blush were not the condition of its production so legibly stamped upon it. You can't say things unless you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to learn them, and if you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to learn them you can say them less than ever. With all but utterly nothing to go upon I had to make my remarks practically of nothing, and {{that the effect of}} them can only be nil on a subscribing public which wants constant and particular news of the undertakings it has been asked to believe in once for all, I can but too readily believe. The case seems different here--I mean {{on this side of the}} sea--where scores and scores of such like corps are in operation in France--the number of ambulance-cars is many, many thousand, on all the long line--without its becoming necessary for them that their work should be publicly chronicled. I think the greater nearness--here--the strange and sinister nearness--makes much of the difference; various facts are conveyed by personal--unpublished--report, and these sufficiently serve the purpose. What seems clear, at all events, is that there is no devisable means for keeping the enterprise in touch with American sympathy, and I sadly note therefore what you tell me of the inevitable and not distant end. The aid rendered strikes me as having been of the handsomest--as is splendidly the case with all the aid America is rendering, in her own large-handed and full-handed way; of which you tell me such fine interesting things from your own experience. It makes you all seem one vast and prodigious workshop with us--for the resources and the energy of production and creation and devotion here are of course beyond estimation. I imagine indeed that, given your more limited relation to the War, your resources in money are more remarkable--even though here (by which I mean in England, for the whole case is I believe more hampered in France) the way the myriad calls and demands are endlessly met and met is prodigious enough. It does my heart good that you should express yourself as you do--though how could you do anything else?--on behalf of the simply sacred cause, as I feel it, of the Allies; for here at least one needs to feel it so to bear up under the close pressure of all that is so hideous and horrible in what has been let loose upon us. Much of the time one feels that one simply can't--the heart-breaking aspect, the destruction of such masses, on such a scale, of the magnificent young life that was to have been productive and prolific, bears down any faith, any patience, all argument and all hope. I can look at the woe of the bereft, the parents, the mothers and wives, and take it comparatively for granted--that is not care for what they individually suffer (as they seem indifferent themselves, both here and in France, in an extraordinarily noble way.) But the dead loss of such ranks upon ranks of the finest young human material--of life--that is an abyss into which one can simply gaze appalled. And as if that were not enough I find myself sickened to the very soul by the apparent sense of the louche and sinister figure of Mr. Woodrow Wilson, who seems to be aware of nothing but the various ingenious ways in which it is open to him to make difficulties for us. I may not read him right, but most of my correspondents at home appear to, and they minister to my dread of him and the meanness of his note as it breaks into all this heroic air.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Steve Leggett awarded the album 4.5 stars, stating: [...] "Mobley might not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> pushing the {{envelope}} with his instrument, but here he plays with confidence and lyrical economy, making this easily {{one of his best}} outings." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the dusk}} {{of the evening}} he wandered out to his {{favourite}} spot, the cable-tank {{on top of the}} aft wheelhouse. Here he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> all alone, and his loneliness had the added advantage that from the isolated elevation he could see if anyone approached. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> during the day, and the Captain, who had noticed his habit had had rigged up a canvas dodger on the rail on the weather side. When {{he sat down on the}} coiled hawsers in the tank he was both secluded and sheltered. In this peaceful corner his thoughts ran freely and in sympathy with the turmoil of wind and wave.|$|R
50|$|Dirksen said in February 1964:First I {{agree that}} {{obviously}} we cannot retreat from our position in Vietnam. I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> three times, once {{as something of}} an emissary for then President Eisenhower. I took {{a good look at}} it. It is a difficult situation, to say the least. But we are in to the tune of some $350 million. I think the last figure I have seen indicates that we have over 15,500 military out there, ostensibly as advisers and that sort of thing. We are not supposed to have combatant troops, even though we were not signatories to the treaty that was signed at Geneva when finally they got that whole business out of the fire. But {{we are going to have}} to muddle through for a while and see what we do. Even though it costs us $1.5 million a day.|$|E

60|$|We did {{not stay}} very long with the captain, for {{he wanted to}} take a nap, and when we went out, we stood a little while by the railing, to see the storm. The wind nearly took our heads off, and the waves dashed right up over the bow of the ship, so that if any one <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> I suppose they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> soaked in a few minutes, if not knocked down. But we saw two men at the wheel, in the pilot-house, {{steadily}} holding her head to the wind, and we felt that it was all right. So we ran below and reported, and then we all went to bed.|$|R
5000|$|Espey {{described}} {{the world of}} his Shanghai childhood {{in a series of}} humorous though sometime rueful sketches in The New Yorker magazine which he collected into several books. Minor Heresies (New York: Knopf, 1945). Tales Out of School (New York: Knopf, 1947) described life and education at the Kuling American School and his experiences {{as a member of the}} Pine Tree Patrol, a Boy Scout troop. The Other City (New York: Knopf, 1950). These memoirs of missionary life in pre-revolutionary Shanghai were both affectionate and skeptical in their descriptions of an earnest Presbyterian effort to uplift China and the resistance of local society to those efforts. Selections from these books were included in Minor Heresies, Major Departures (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), which collects “all that he wishes to retain” of these writings. He waited until well after the death of his parents to write longer and franker treatments - Strong Drink, Strong Language (1990), a nonfiction book which was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the novel Winter Return (1992). [...] "I loved this man," [...] he recalled to the Los Angeles Times, but when he visited his father in a Pasadena retirement home, he needed the fortification of whiskey. [...] "I felt greatly hurt that, even at the end of his life, we didn't communicate. He felt that my work was frivolous.

40|$|So here {{it comes}} – the moment {{to look back at}} what I have been through in the past few years: from the very first day, when I opened the doors of a place that would become my second – and {{sometimes}} first, literally! – home, to the mo-ment of typing this text. Something has been achieved and realised, somewhat more has been discussed and tried out, but a lot more has been learned. I have been surrounded with people who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to support me profes-sionally, culturally, socially, personally, and anyhow else that I was walking with side by side while taking this journey; and who have helped me – in either way – make this PhD what it has become.

Kris Luyten; and in the first place for letting me take this opportunity to pursue a degree.

40|$|This is an {{exciting}} time in Africa. Yes, {{of course it is}} true that the rise of fundamentalist political movements, armed conflict, epidemic diseases, and extreme poverty will challenge the continent for decades to come. I don’t need to tell you that. Yet at the same time, we are witness to what many call an “African Renaissance. ” In many domains, including the arts, civil society, social provision, and democratic governance, African nations are beginning to take their place in a newly configured globe. One of these domains of energy, innovation, and hope is a new human rights movement. This movement emerged out of three converging trends: new capacities and institutions for democratic governance, a new vibrancy of civil society and grassroots participation, and a new enthusiasm among young, determined, and iconoclastic human rights lawyers who have embraced pragmatic rather than formalistic approaches to law. These young lawyers have taken on the most challenging area of human rights practice: that of vindicating people’s core rights to food, health care, housing, education, and a decent livelihood—indeed, to life itself. These lawyers have embraced the impossible, reworking human rights to bring sustainable improvements to people’s lives. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> when others have given up, hewing “stones of hope” from what others had wrongly called a “mountain of despair. ...|$|E
