40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of yield differentials between sovereign bonds in the Euro area. There is a common trend in yield differentials, which is correlated {{with a measure of}} aggregate risk. In contrast, liquidity <b>differentials</b> <b>display</b> sizeable heterogeneity and no common factor. We propose a simple model with endogenous liquidity demand, where a bond’s liquidity premium depends both on its transaction cost and on investment opportunities. The model predicts that yield differentials should increase in both liquidity and risk, with an interaction term of the opposite sign. Testing these predictions on daily data, we find that the aggregate risk factor is consistently priced, liquidity differentials are priced for a subset of countries, and their interaction with the risk factor is in line with the model’s prediction and crucial to detect their effect. ...|$|R

While northern blot or q-PCR are often used to confirm results, both techniques have drawbacks. Northern blot is limited by its ability to only probe with one mRNA at a time, while q-PCR requires transcripts to be long enough to generate primers for the sequence and probes can be costly. Therefore, reverse northern has been used as one means of confirming hits from DD-PCR, or sequences with altered expression levels. In this case, the membrane will be coated with amplified DD-PCR products which have been cloned into vectors, sequenced, and reamplified.|$|E

By exploring human gene databases, a human homologue of the mouse gene was identified. This explained why dietary sterols, which are structurally similar to cholesterol, are not absorbed in normal individuals. By scanning sitosterolemic individuals for this gene, it was found that all of them had a mutation in this gene responsible for their uncontrolled hyperabsorption of dietary sterols.|$|E

50|$|Quantitative PCR and DNA {{microarray}} are modern methodologies {{for studying}} gene expression. Older methods {{were used to}} measure mRNA abundance: <b>Differential</b> <b>display,</b> RNase protection assay and Northern blot. Northern blotting {{is often used to}} estimate the expression level of a gene by visualizing the abundance of its mRNA transcript in a sample. In this method, purified RNA is separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a solid matrix (such as a nylon membrane), and probed with a specific DNA or RNA probe that is complementary to the gene of interest. Although this technique is still used to assess gene expression, it requires relatively large amounts of RNA and provides only qualitative or semi quantitative information of mRNA levels. Estimation errors arising from variations in the quantification method can be the result of DNA integrity, enzyme efficiency and many other factors. For this reason a number of standardization systems (often called normalization methods) have been developed. Some have been developed for quantifying total gene expression, but the most common are aimed at quantifying the specific gene being studied in relation to another gene called a normalizing gene, which is selected for its almost constant level of expression. These genes are often selected from housekeeping genes as their functions related to basic cellular survival normally imply constitutive gene expression. This enables researchers to report a ratio for the expression of the genes of interest divided by the expression of the selected normalizer, thereby allowing comparison of the former without actually knowing its absolute level of expression.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To use the {{technique}} of <b>differential</b> gene <b>display</b> to analyze changes in gene expression that occur during the development of and recovery from form-deprivation myopia. METHODS: The differential display-reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique was used to detect cDNAs that are differentially expressed after 24 h (including 12 h in the light) after fitting with a diffuser to induce form-deprivation myopia. Messenger RNA levels were determined by quantitative Northern blotting in retinas after 11 days of form deprivation or in retinas where the diffusers had been removed the previous day. RESULTS: Twenty-six differentially expressed genes were processed in our initial screen. Two of these, alphaB-crystallin and retinoic acid receptor-alpha, were studied further. Levels of alphaB-crystallin mRNA were increased on day 11 in retinas from form-deprived eyes relative to eyes of control chickens and were reduced to below those levels within 6 to 12 h after removal of the diffusers. Levels of retinoic acid receptor-alpha mRNA showed similar changes, except that after removal of the diffusers, the levels further increased. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of <b>differential</b> gene <b>display</b> {{can be used to}} detect changes in gene expression during the regulation of eye growth.
