5|$|Based on its {{appearance}} <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> the Andromeda Galaxy {{is classified as}} an SA(s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs–Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies. However, data from the 2MASS survey showed that Andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar oriented along its long axis.|$|E
5|$|Located near Alnair is NGC 7213, a face-on type 1 Seyfert galaxy located {{approximately}} 71.7 million {{light years}} from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.1. Appearing undisturbed <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> it {{shows signs of}} having undergone a collision or merger when viewed at longer wavelengths, with disturbed patterns of ionized hydrogen including a filament of gas around 64,000 light-years long. It {{is part of a}} group of ten galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of Uranus, which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (the smallest of the five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and geometric albedo <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> of approximately 0.11.|$|E
50|$|The {{scattering}} and extinction ("dimming") of {{the radiation}} gives useful {{information about the}} dust grain sizes. For example, if the object(s) in one's data is many times brighter <b>in</b> forward-scattered <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> than <b>in</b> back-scattered <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> then we know that a significant fraction of the particles are about a micrometer in diameter.|$|R

30|$|As well known, {{reflection}} {{spectra of}} almost all crystal types of titanium dioxide are in the ultraviolet region below 400  nm [27, 28]. Therefore, titanium dioxide frequently appears in many sunscreen cosmetics aiming to reduce the damage of ultraviolet rays to human skin. However, <b>in</b> the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> region, its efficiency decreases as the transmittance increases. There is great significance {{on how to improve}} the reflection efficiency of titanium dioxide <b>in</b> the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> region.|$|R
5|$|The Sun is the Solar System's {{star and}} by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses) {{produces}} temperatures and densities in its core {{high enough to}} sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star. This releases {{an enormous amount of}} energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the closest}} planet to Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

5|$|Seyfert {{galaxies are}} one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of {{electromagnetic}} radiation) with very high surface brightnesses but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly detectable. Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies. Seen <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, but when studied under other wavelengths, the luminosity of their cores is equivalent to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Very-high {{redshift}} objects (Lyman-break galaxies) {{cannot be}} seen <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> and generally are detected in infrared or submillimetre wavelength {{surveys of the}} HDF instead. Observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation. Infrared observations have also been made with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution. Observations have also been made with the Subaru telescope in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} supernovae have been {{discovered}} in Coma Berenices. Four (SN 1940B, SN 1969H, SN 1987E and SN 1999gs) were in the NGC 4725 galaxy, and another four were discovered in the M99 galaxy (NGC 4254): SN 1967H, SN 1972Q, SN 1986I and SN 2014L. Five were discovered in the M100 galaxy (NGC 4321): SN 1901B, SN 1914A, SN 1959E, SN 1979C and SN 2006X. SN 1940B, discovered on 5 May 1940, was the first observed type II supernova. SN 2005ap, discovered on 3 March 2005, is the brightest known supernova to date with a peak absolute magnitude of about −22.7. Due to its great distance from Earth (4.7 billion light-years), it was not {{visible to the naked}} eye and was discovered telescopically. SN1979C, discovered in 1979, retained its original X-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{sound waves}} in air, {{the speed of}} sound is 343m/s (at room {{temperature}} and atmospheric pressure).

As a result, determining its distance has been particularly difficult.|$|E
25|$|A special far {{ultraviolet}} camera, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph, {{was taken to}} the lunar surface on Apollo 16 and operated {{in the shadow of the}} Apollo Lunar Module (LM). It took photos of Earth and of many stars, some of which are dim <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> but bright in the ultraviolet. These observations were later matched with observations taken by orbiting ultraviolet telescopes. Furthermore, the positions of those stars with respect to Earth are correct for the time and location of the Apollo 16 photos.|$|E

In three dimensions, the nebula {{is thought to be}} shaped like a prolate spheroid. The filaments are the remnants of the progenitor star's atmosphere, and consist largely of ionised helium and hydrogen, along with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, neon and sulfur. The filaments' temperatures are typically between 11,000 and 18,000K, and their densities are about 1,300particles per cm3.|$|E

Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.|$|E
25|$|Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS): The ISS is {{a remote}} sensing {{instrument}} that captures most images <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> {{and also some}} infrared images and ultraviolet images. The ISS has taken {{hundreds of thousands of}} images of Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The ISS has a wide-angle camera (WAC) that takes pictures of large areas, and a narrow-angle camera (NAC) that takes pictures of small areas in fine detail. Each of these cameras uses a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as its electromagnetic wave detector. Each CCD has a 1,024 square array of pixels, 12μm on a side. Both cameras allow for many data collection modes, including on-chip data compression. Both cameras are fitted with spectral filters that rotate on a wheel—to view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 1.1μm.|$|E
25|$|Ethane, {{acetylene}} and diacetylene condense in the colder {{lower part}} of stratosphere forming haze layers with an optical depth of about 0.01 <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b> Condensation occurs at approximately 14, 2.5 and 0.1mbar for ethane, acetylene and diacetylene, respectively. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets—the upper atmosphere of Uranus is very clean and transparent above the haze layers. This depletion is caused by weak vertical mixing, and makes Uranus's stratosphere less opaque and, as a result, colder than those of other giant planets. The hazes, like their parent hydrocarbons, are distributed unevenly across Uranus; at the solstice of 1986, when Voyager 2 passed by the planet, they were concentrated near the sunlit pole, making it dark in ultraviolet light.|$|E
