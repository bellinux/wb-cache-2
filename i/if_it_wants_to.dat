Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me.

2500|$|Big Love {{was also}} studied {{as a part}} of Andrew Atkinson's study of HBO {{programs}} and the post-secular humanistic themes they elicit. In writing of Big Love, Atkinson too draws on the parallel between gay rights and polygamist rights illuminated by the series, but focuses more on the series' influential humanistic elements. In fact, he somewhat rebuffs earlier assertions made: [...] "The attention that is paid to the minute details of Mormon ritual, theology, and historical disputes demonstrates that HBO's writers are uncomfortable with the supposed dichotomy that constructs homosexuality as by default areligious." [...] Atkinson focuses on the ending, interpreting Barb's blessing of Bill as a [...] "ritual innovation [...] indicates that FLDS Mormonism must shed the trappings of patriarchy <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> legitimate polygamy in a post-feminist society", and the fall of Alby, the closet homosexual, as a powerful interpretation of [...] "the future theo-political and sexual tensions that Mormonism, and by extension, the broader American polity, will face as the post-secular matures". In concluding, Atkinson makes the case that Big Love and other HBO shows like The Sopranos, The Wire and Six Feet Under [...] "contribute to a fuller conception of humanity" [...] than other forms of art and entertainment.|$|E
