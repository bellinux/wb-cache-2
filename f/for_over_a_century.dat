5|$|<b>For</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> {{the water}} was {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality. As Hagley's water was not fully treated, {{from time to time}} contamination required boil-water notices. Sedimentation damaged hot-water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the water delivery system. Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013, supplying filtered and treated water to Hagley.|$|E

5|$|In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster {{bought the}} castle. <b>For</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> Bodiam Castle and its {{associated}} manor descended through the Webster family. It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy. Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures.|$|E

5|$|An early {{governor}} of Gaza Sanjak was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former jannissary (member {{of a military}} corps) who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. He received the governorship of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died {{a short while later}} and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza <b>for</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later and returned to the governorship of Gaza. After becoming {{governor of}} Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakir in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of Anatolia where he died in 1585.|$|E
