Our goal is to evaluate the OWD and packet loss characteristics with respect to payload size and data rate from the collected network level traces. To collect these traces an experimental testbed is setup with Endace Data Acquisition and Generation (DAG) cards, for accurate measurements Endace DAG cards together with Global Positioning System (GPS) synchronization is implemented. The experiments are conducted for three different Swedish mobile operator networks and further the statistics of OWD measurements and packet loss for different data rates and payload sizes are evaluated.

40|$|According to {{the related}} {{agreements}} accepted by China on accessing World Trade Organization, {{it has become}} reality for foreign banks to enter domestic financial markets. The diversity of financial markets and trades will make Chinese banking industry face greater challenges on the aspects of talents, operations, techniques and management. In addition, risk factors will become more complicated, such as market risks, operational risks and credit risks. Therefore, facing this new challenging situation, Chinese banking industry needs to learn to improve the ability of <b>gaining</b> <b>profits</b> {{and the level of}} efficiency through constantly perfecting their own corporate governance mechanism without the complete paternal care of Chinese government. Consequently, the research of commercial banks’ efficiency in China draws great attention in both theoretical and practical circles. Nevertheless, comparing to foreign similar efficiency researches, there are certain shortages of the theories and methods used in Chinese banking industry. So, this dissertation seeks to improve the existing efficiency researches while investigating the internal relationship between bank efficiency and structural determinants of banking industry in China. By doing so, it can be helpful to support feasibility of some Chinese banking innovations, as well as perfecting current theoretical systems.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the state of enforcement of the principle of self-financing of companies (one of the 3 basic principles of the economic reform in Poland) and of its connection with the undertaking initiative of industrial companies. The analysis was {{made on the basis of}} materials published in 4 periodicals over the period of 3 years: 1982 - 1984. By "entrepreneurship is meant an undertaking initiative in the sphere of economy, mainly in the field of production, with the prospect of profit and of non-routine (and thereby risky) character. The state of enforcement of the reform legislation in the field of self-financing is far from satisfactory. Among the most popular practices is the so called "soft financing" expressed mainly in subsidizing and conceding tax (and other) exemptions without objective justification. This has certain negative effects in the sphere of economic behavior of companies, especially with regard to their entrepreneurship. Most generally, instead of undertaking profitable initiatives which could establish their position on the market the companies concentrate their efforts on the "game" with agencies of the Government in view of <b>gaining</b> <b>profits</b> without carrying out their proper activity. Thus make-believe entrepreneurship supersedes real initiative.

40|$|Global {{economic}} crisis started in 2007 had revealed two main problems which appeared and grew within pre-crisis period. The {{first one is}} lack of entrepreneurial activity which leads to decrease in workplaces and progress (high tech sphere or biotechnology growth {{seems to be an}} exception which only proves the rule) – it can be easily seen from statistics analysis that {{there are only a few}} countries where entrepreneurial activity is growing while in the others even people with some entrepreneurial spirit prefer to become employees at big corporations. The second one is the misbalance in economic activities of real, financial and virtual sector enterprises. As far as statistics shows maximum profitability can be seen in banking (including investment banking) or virtual sector while both of them are in a certain way distributing tomorrow’s payments into today’s quickly achieved profits. Such attitude seem to suit shareholders who achieve extra income but is completely opposite to real entrepreneurial attitude since entrepreneurs are mainly concerned with making the world a better place to live instead of earning money quickly. Therefore the two stated problems are interrelated. This relation reveals the main problem of pre-crisis world which lead to global crisis: since social value produced by entrepreneurial units cannot be measured, it was considered unimportant and all the emphasis was put by entrepreneurs and especially hired managers into <b>gaining</b> <b>profits</b> as quick as possible (this can also be seen in economi...|$|E

40|$|The base of {{the world}} {{economic}} pyramid, generally called the {{base of the}} pyramid (BoP), consists of four billion people with average daily income of four dollars. Over the past several years, the design and development of products and services for BoP markets has been investigated by several authors from different disciplines. While some authors suggest a systems approach to design and develop products and services for these markets, a little work has been carried out in this area. Specifically, no studies have been found in the reviewed literature that systematically explain how businesses bring about systemic changes in BoP markets. This study methodically explains how businesses bring about systemic changes in these markets through the design and development process. In order to explain these systemic changes, the study first describes the development of a causality-model for socio-technical systems by modifying a causality-model of technical systems. It then explains the developed causality model for the BoP. Lastly, it tests this model by an in-depth investigation of a case study from the BoP. The findings systematically explain the need of: gaining an in-depth understanding of the existing BoP system to bring about desired actions (e. g. <b>gaining</b> <b>profits,</b> satisfying under-served or un-met needs of BoP customers, etc.); including different stakeholders from the BoP in the design and development process; and appropriately modifying existing BoP system before deploying products and services. In addition, this study proposes some applications of the developed causality-model to support practitioners involved in designing, developing and assessing interventions (i. e. products and services) for BoP markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} regressions in the {{per capita}} income of the Sudanese people have triggered many suggestions to ameliorate their productive capabilities. One {{of them was the}} facilitating in financing programs through official channels. However, there are many structural impediments that inhibit those programs. One of the financial programs was the Small or miniature financing in addition to the establishment to specialized Banks as the Family Bank. The current paper discusses issues of financing in Sudan as part of programs initiated to improve income per capita. Islamic and regular financing systems are analyzed in order to explain existing impediments. Then Family Bank systems and financing facilities are discussed. Results explained in this paper clear the facts that there are other macroeconomic impediments and distortions that have negative impacts on feasibility of conducting normalized productive activities. One of them is the accelerating inflation rates and foreign currencies exchange rates. That is in addition to the indigenous distortions of inflated taxation rates that render smaller capitals from <b>gaining</b> <b>profits</b> on small scale. The expected productive cycles and variables are not subjected to the rule of Ceteris Paribas where cost can change. That adds to the difficulties in gaining the financing per se which are represented in the required time, bureaucratic processes, required collateral and higher interest rates. Even in the Islamic financing, the methodologies applied do not differ from the traditional in interest rates. Both are subtracted from final productive outputs. The expected Zero Interest Rates expected from such small production/income improvement financing projects do not exist. The final results are manifested in lesser beneficiaries, less expected incomes with diminishing internal return rates. ...|$|E

This essay draws its {{data from the}} most important primary source of information on sales promotion letters and company profiles namely words, phrases, and clauses taken from the SPLs and CPs of batik written in Indonesian. Secondary sources were also consulted in this research, among these transcribed data obtained from in-depth interviews with the text writers and buyers. Three SPLs and two batik CPs were analyzed. In addition, two informants (marketing and promotion managers) typifying the text production perspective and two buyers typifying the text consumption perspective were interviewed. This research was guided by theories of genre analysis which focuses on patterns of rhetorical organization and genre-specific language features. This study employed the multi-dimensional and multi perspective model of analysis focusing on textual, socio-cognitive and ethnographic aspects of the texts. This study concludes that the strong Javanese cultural influence has made the underlying intention of <b>gaining</b> <b>profits</b> to be less explicitly stated. Secondly, the textual analysis and the in-depth interviews supported the view that CPs of batik had been ideally {{used to create a}} favorable image of the company.

Fourthly, the chemistry between writers and readers of SPLs and CPs built a strong foundation for mutual understanding and thus paved the way for making purchases. To conclude, this study has shown how the wider culture and the culture of the discourse community has contributed to the framing and formatting of SPLs and CPs of batik in terms of lexico-grammar, cognitive structuring, intertextuality and interdiscursivity...|$|E
