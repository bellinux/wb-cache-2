5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on the <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> but {{the final}} day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|England {{set about}} {{extending}} their first innings lead {{for the remainder}} of the <b>fourth</b> <b>day.</b> For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. Johnston removed Washbrook for 65 before Johnson removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, leaving England at 129/2. Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off, adding 103 for the third wicket before Lindwall trapped Edrich for 54. Crapp came in and added 18 before Lindwall bowled him at 260/4 and precipitated a mini-collapse. Yardley made seven before Johnston removed him. Johnston then removed Cranston caught behind for a duck with only a further run added to leave England at 278/6. When Johnston removed Compton for 66, caught by Miller, England were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining. They had lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans was joined by Bedser, and the pair added 37 before Miller removed the latter.

5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon {{on the third}} day. Australia batted {{strongly}} and on the <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> Johnson came in at 6/445, with Australia already ahead by 580. He made nine before his partner Ray Lindwall was stumped, which prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460. This left England a victory target of 596, which would require a world record run chase.|$|E
5|$|England {{came out}} for their second innings, and with Bradman {{predominantly}} reliant on his seamers, Johnson bowled only seven overs on the third afternoon as the hosts closed at 3/174 from 69 overs. Late in the day, Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80. Washbrook reached stumps unbeaten on 85, and Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the <b>fourth</b> <b>day</b> was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.|$|E

Gilchrist failed to pass 25 {{in the last two}} Tests, but it had been a productive season; he scored centuries in both of Australia's county matches.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's {{departure}} at 5/294 {{meant that}} {{the first of the}} bowlers, Johnson, entered the ground. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting him into the crowd for four more sixes. Loxton hit two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 6/329. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93. Loxton appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Lindwall then made 77 to propel Australia to 458 on the <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> just 38 runs in arrears.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{took the}} new ball with Miller and {{delivered}} 59 overs {{in the second}} innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled without success {{in the first half}} of the innings; the closest he came to a wicket on the third afternoon when Len Hutton and Denis Compton were putting on a century partnership was when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point. On the <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> England continued to make steady progress and Johnston was unsuccessful although he was able to make the ball move sideways in the morning under cloudy conditions. He was then attacked by Hardstaff, who drove several fours through the off side and forced Bradman to remove Johnston. He returned to remove Barnett and English captain Norman Yardley late on the <b>fourth</b> <b>day</b> as the hosts’ neared 300. Barnett was caught by Miller in the slips and Johnston took a return catch to remove the English skipper. Johnston bowled 30 overs, the most of any bowler for the day, as England reached the penultimate evening on 345/6, a lead of one run. The next morning, Johnston removed Evans and bowled Jack Young to end England's innings at 441 on the final day. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 10 leadthe Australian batsmen reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.|$|E

5|$|The {{circumstances}} {{around the}} death of Michael Shishman are unclear. According to the Byzantine emperor and historian John Kantakouzenos the emperor was mortally wounded in the battle and soon died while another Byzantine historian suggests that Michael Shishman lived for three more days not able to gain consciousness and died on the <b>fourth</b> <b>day.</b> The Serbian chronicles state that his horse fell during the battle and crashed his body. When his body was taken to Dečanski, he mourned him but pointed out that he preferred war to peace. The early 15th-century Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak says that Michael Shishman was captured and killed by {{the son of the}} Serbian king, Stephen Dušan. He was buried in the Church of St George in Staro Nagoričane.|$|E
5|$|The rest day was {{followed}} by the <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> which was abandoned due to persistent rain. Yardley declared {{at the start of the}} fifth day, leaving Australia a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire first session was lost. Young removed Johnson for six to leave Australia 10/1, but the tourists thereafter batted safely in a defensive manner to ensure a draw. They ended at 92/1 in 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, which was the slowest innings run rate to date in the series. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series. The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test.|$|E
5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never {{played a significant role in}} the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E
