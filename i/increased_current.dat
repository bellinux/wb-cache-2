25|$|While some {{mutations}} in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, see table 1, {{at least one}} mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Others include {{the introduction of a}} sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased calcium permeability. When mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability. While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca2+ leads to ACHM, one hypothesis is that this <b>increased</b> <b>current</b> decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1 region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface. Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the cone cell's ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1 region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the medical}} and {{scientific}} communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that [...] "drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity)." [...] Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has <b>increased.</b> <b>Current</b> evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences. Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood. 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol. Under the DSM's new definition of alcoholics, that means about 37 percent of college students may meet the criteria.|$|E

Structure and the Morphology of the film were studied using X-Ray diffractometer (XRD) and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Elemental compositions of the film were studied using Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Films are shiny and smooth. The deposited Cobalt (Co) increased from about 77 to 97 Mass % with <b>increasing</b> <b>current</b> density until 7 mAcm- 2 whereas the deposited Manganese (Mn) decreased from about 0. 67 to 0. 17 Mass % with <b>increasing</b> <b>current</b> density till 7 mAcm- 2.

The X-Ray diffraction measurement showed that all peaks of CoMnP films were {{consistent with those of}} a typical Co hcp phase. An <b>increase</b> in the <b>current</b> density yielded a decreased sharpness of the major peaks.

2500|$|Since the {{armature}} windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field, {{they have a}} voltage induced in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called [...] "back electromotive force (emf)". The voltage {{is proportional to the}} running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This <b>increased</b> <b>current</b> provides the additional torque to balance the new load.|$|E

5000|$|The VFS can be {{designed}} such {{that any of these}} forces act in either axial direction.

The <b>increased</b> <b>current</b> generates increased losses in motor resistances. The higher the resistance value the higher the braking energy dissipation inside the motor. Typically, in low power motors(below 5 kW) the resistance value of the motor is relatively large in respect to the nominal current of the motor.

40|$|THz and millimeter-wave length {{radiation}} {{is widely used}} in imaging, detection and plasma heating. Vacuum electronic devices are the most efficient sources of high power radiation in the THz and millimeter range. Efforts to increase power by <b>increasing</b> <b>current,</b> are hampered by self-field effects and instabilities. Two examples of these effects are considered: the reduction in bunching efficiency in orotrons (a slow wave device), and the excitation of backward wave instabilities, in gyrotrons (a fast wave device). The goal of producing THz radiation from miniature electron beam devices has refocused interest in orotrons. The efficiency of these devices improves with <b>increasing</b> <b>current</b> density. However, with <b>increasing</b> <b>current</b> density, self-fields become more important. Here, the theory of self-fields in a planar orotron is developed.
