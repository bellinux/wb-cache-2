Individual farms that exceed certain levy-free surpluses for N and P (expressed in kg per ha per year) are charged with a <b>financial</b> <b>levy,</b> so as to encourage farmers to decrease the N and P surpluses.

40|$|The {{application}} of nutrients affect {{the quality of}} the environment which justifies the consideration of regulations regarding their use in agriculture. In the early 1990 s The Netherlands decided to use the indicator `nutrient surplus at farm level¿ as the basis for a regulation which was called the mineral accounting system (MINAS). Exceedance of specified nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) surpluses (`N and P loss standards¿), resulted in a <b>financial</b> <b>levy</b> per kg exceedance. This NP surplus approach is a `goal-oriented regulation¿ rather than a `means-oriented regulation¿, giving farmers maximum freedom to stop nutrient leaks where they considered measures to be most effective in their specific situation. In 2003, however, the European Court of Justice ruled that The Netherlands Action Programme, of which MINAS was part, was in conflict with the EU Nitrates Directive. Important consideration here was that the legislation in The Netherlands contained as yet no specified application rates for N. The Netherlands was also reproached for implicitly allowing application rates of more than 170 kg N in the form of animal manure per ha per year without possessing formal permission by the European Commission to deviate from this threshold, a so-called `derogation¿. A new, and meanwhile by the European Commission accepted Netherlands Action Programme defines the required N application rates, N fertilizer replacement values of various organic manure types, and periods in which the use of fertilizers and manures is forbidden. All these aspects will be sharpened in the years after 2006...|$|E

40|$|In 1760, when British {{victory was}} all but assured and {{hostilities}} in the northeastern colonies of North America came to an end, {{the future of the}} southeastern colonies was not nearly so clear. British authorities in the South still faced the possibility of a local French and Indian alliance and clashed with angry Cherokees who had complaints of their own. These tensions and events usually {{take a back seat to}} the climactic proceedings further north. I argue that in South Carolina, by destabilizing relations with African and Native Americans, the Cherokee Indians raised the social and political anxieties of coastal elites to a fever pitch during the Anglo-Cherokee War. Threatened by Indians from without and by slaves from within, and failing to find unbridled support in British policy, the planter-merchant class eventually sought to take matters into its own hands.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the administration of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (ARPA) 2 ̆ 7 s <b>financial</b> industry <b>levies.</b> Overall conclusionAPRA was established in 1998 as part of a package of measures to strengthen consumer protection functions in the financial system. To meet APRA’s resourcing needs, the Government decided to ‘establish an administratively simple and uniform funding scheme based on the principle of full cost recovery’ from those industries it would prudentially regulate. APRA is subject to the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines (the Guidelines) and, in 2011 – 12, was the fifth largest cost recovery agency in the Commonwealth, raising 101. 3  million in levies. The Guidelines require, among other things, that APRA recovers only those costs that are integral to prudential regulation and are the minimum necessary to deliver services, and that industry is consulted about the levy methodology and its application. APRA’s administration of <b>financial</b> industry <b>levies</b> has been generally effective. The methodology developed to apply the levies has met the Government’s intent of recovering the full costs of APRA’s administration, and been administratively simple and uniform. APRA, and the Treasury, have continued to apply the principles of equity and competitive neutrality when imposing <b>levies</b> on <b>financial</b> entities. This has been an ongoing process, involving review of the levy methodology and its application, stakeholder consultation and feedback. In an environment where it is difficult to set levies precisely to reflect the cost of regulation and equity considerations, the ANAO has identified three aspects of the levy methodology that would benefit from further analysis and could be considered as part of the levy methodology review being conducted by the Treasury and APRA throughout 2013 : the levy methodology is based on the activities of staff from four of APRA’s five divisions and excludes many indirect costs (such as property and information technology) as inputs to the model. While the approach adopted over the past 15 years of allocating these indirect costs to industry sectors according to the allocation of staff activities may be reasonable, there is some risk of cross-subsidisation between sectors;the methodology includes ‘restricted’ and ‘unrestricted’ components, which respectively relate to prudential supervision and ‘system impact and vertical equity’. However, as the model is currently specified, some activities included in the unrestricted component do not always bear a close relationship with functions addressing system impact and vertical equity; andthe significant increase in levies funding for other Australian Government agencies dealing with financial institutions in recent years has introduced additional complexities in setting the APRA levies according to the cost of its prudential regulation. It has also brought into question whether the methodology for setting the APRA levies is an appropriate approach for calculating these other levies. APRA advised the ANAO that all activities funded through the <b>financial</b> industry <b>levies</b> relate to its regulatory role. It provided information about a range of activities to contain costs, noting that the cost of industry regulation has declined in recent years when measured with regard to the cost of assets regulated. There is scope, however, for APRA to provide more information to stakeholders to demonstrate that it is charging the minimum costs necessary and that these are directly related to prudential regulation. More broadly, the majority of stakeholders consulted by the ANAO raised some concern about the level of information provided about APRA’s costs and activities and the specification of the levy methodology. Also raised was the short time frames to respond to the annual processes and the methodology reviews. One option to address these shortcomings could be to establish an industry consultative committee or panel, which could meet periodically outside the levies determination cycle to broadly consider and discuss levies and resourcing matters. Stakeholders did not raise any concerns about APRA’s billing and collection arrangements, which the ANAO found to be effective. The ANAO has made two recommendations to improve the administration of the APRA <b>financial</b> industry <b>levies.</b> The first recommendation is aimed at the Treasury and APRA improving consultation with stakeholders about the levy methodology and its application. The second recommendation involves the two agencies’ further considering aspects of the levy methodology as part of their current review...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} the {{equivalent}} martingale measures in Lévy market models. One {{of the important}} questions in financial modelling is the choice of an appropriate model for <b>financial</b> assets. <b>Lévy</b> processes {{have proved to be}} particularly suited for modelling market price fluctations. The existence and uniqueness of martingale measures is an important problem in financial modelling. Because, this problem is related to the absence of arbitrage and completeness of the corresponding models of price evolution. Lévy models include jumps. Jumps are useful to capture unexpected changes in the market that other diffusion processes are not capable to sketch. Since, the inclusion of jump Lévy processes in the model leads to incomplete markets. In an incomplete market, the set of the martingale measure is infinite and some also be the set of prices for a single derivative. In this case, one needs to specify in some way one martingale measure {{in order to get a}} pricing rule and uniqueness of prices for derivatives...|$|R
