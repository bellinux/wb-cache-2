40|$|A 4 -year-old girl {{developed}} tetanus {{after she}} had fallen on the street a week before. She had never been vaccinated and despite pressure from the family practitioner, the parents refused {{to allow her to}} be given <b>human</b> <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> as a matter of principle after the wound had been stitched. Seven days later she was admitted to hospital with trismus and risus sardonicus. Upon initial treatment with <b>human</b> <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> and penicillin, and subsequently metronidazole, her clinical condition deteriorated with opisthotonus and life-threatening respiratory insufficiency, upon which she was moved to the intensive-care department where she was intubated and mechanically ventilated for two weeks. Finally she made a complete clinical recovery. Thanks to the extensive national vaccination program, tetanus has become a rare disease in the Netherlands.

40|$|Plasma {{membrane}} {{changes during}} {{the interaction of}} human eosinophils with large, antibody-coated, non-phagocytosable surfaces have been investigated in a model system. Human peripheral blood eosinophils were incubated with layers of agar into which tetanus toxoid and <b>human</b> <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin,</b> together with an eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF), were incorporated. Changes in organization of the eosinophil plasma membrane proteins during interaction with the agar layer were detected by lactoperoxidase-catalysed iodination with [125]iodide. A protein of apparent mol. wt 55000 became newly accessible on the eosinophil surface as a specific consequence of interaction with antigen-antibody complexes in the agar layer. This protein appeared in the early attachment phase of the interaction which preceded extracellular degranulation. Cytochalasin D enhanced its appearance, while Mg 2 +-deficiency prevented it. A second newly accessible protein of apparent mol. wt 58000 was blocked when ECF was present and may therefore be a receptor for ECF. Other proteins of apparent mol. wt 68000 and 46000 newly appeared at the surface of eosinophils even after incubation in suspension, apparently {{as a consequence of}} the rapid cycling of membrane components which occurs in eosinophils...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To emphasise that tetanus still {{occurs in}} the United Kingdom, {{particularly}} in elderly people-as illustrated by two case reports-and to examine the state of tetanus immunity in elderly people. METHODS [...] 111 elderly people (over 65 years) were studied: 43 males, mean age 77. 7 years, range 67 - 94; 68 females, mean age 81. 3 years, range 67 - 95. They were either attending the accident service or were hospital inpatients. An {{attempt was made to}} obtain an immunisation history and antitetanus antibody titres were measured. RESULTS [...] Immunisation history was uncertain and unreliable. Measurement of antibody titres showed that they were inadequate to ensure protection in 50 % of those studied. Low levels were particularly prevalent in the over 80 age group and in females. Questioning about military service confirmed that this had predominantly involved males. CONCLUSIONS [...] Elderly people are at risk of contracting tetanus and should be targeted for community immunisation. Extra precautions in the form of passive immunisation with <b>human</b> <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> should be used in this age group in addition to the usual wound management measures when the elderly sustain tetanus prone injuries...|$|R

40|$|The {{safety issues}} of <b>human</b> {{intravenous}} <b>immunoglobulin</b> preparations {{are particularly important}} in modern pharmacotherapy for immunodeficiencies, hematologic and neurologic diseases, like as at transplant centers. Upon massive infusions of these media some complications are detected {{that are associated with}} spontaneous activation of complement system accompanied by production of anaphylatoxins, as well as activation of kallikrein/kinin, plasmin, and blood coagulation systems, changed blood rheology, initiation of intravascular hemolysis. For distinct groups of patients, these complications may be due to presence of some anti-erythrocyte antibodies (e. g., anti-A and anti-B haemagglutinins, anti-D antibodies) in the intravenous <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> preparations. In the present review article, we show development of current quality standards for <b>human</b> intravenous <b>immunoglobulins</b> based on determination of antibody contents. Antibodies to erythrocytes represent a special safety index aiming to minimize risk of possible adverse effects connected with transfusions of human blood preparations. Different haemagglutination tests were compared to assess contents of anti-A, anti-B haemagglutinins and anti-D antibodies for specific safety of <b>human</b> intravenous <b>immunoglobulins.</b> Analysis of haemagglutination techniques for evaluation of <b>human</b> intravenous <b>immunoglobulin</b> preparations revealed their relative advantages and disadvantages. Various modifications of the methods are discussed, thus allowing to optimize process of quality control for these preparations based on detection of haemagglutinins and anti-D antibodies. We demonstrate a necessity to adjust regulations and to improve evaluation techniques for haemagglutinin determination in <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> preparations at amounts of 100 mg/ml of protein. Special features of Russian national quality standards for <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> preparations are considered with respect to assessment of haemagglutinins and anti-D contents. One may conclude that haemagglutination methods present the most informative and economically substantiated approach when assessing specific safety of <b>human</b> intravenous <b>immunoglobulins</b> by measuring contents of anti-A, anti-B haemagglutinins, and anti-D antibodies. </p...|$|R

40|$|The focal form {{of mixed}} tick-borne encephalitis-Borrelia {{infection}} (MTBEBI) {{is characterized by}} a nervous system lesion with the developmentÂ of permanent neurological disorders and a possible fatal outcome. Uniform approaches to treating MTBEBI have not been currently elaborated. Â Obviously, adequate treatment of the mixed infection requires a comprehensive approach and simultaneous action on tick-borne encephalitisÂ and tick-borne borreliosis. Its promising treatment is immunocorrection with normal <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> that contains a wide spectrumÂ of antibodies and exerts an immunomodulatory effect. Objective: to evaluate the efficiency of combination (etiotropic and pathogenetic) therapy with normal <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> for the focal formÂ of MTBEBI. Patients and methods. The results of the treatment were analyzed in 57 patients with MTBEBI with a nervous system lesion, who had been notifiedÂ in the Kemerovo Region in 2000 to 2014. Results and discussion. It was shown that the use of normal <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> in a treatment regimen for the focal form of MTBEBI couldÂ considerably reduce the incidence of residual neurological deficit.

40|$|We {{have studied}} somatic cell hybrids between P 3 x 63 Ag 8 mouse myeloma cells {{deficient}} in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2. 4. 2. 8) and either human peripheral lymphocytes or human lymphoblastoid or myeloma cells {{for the production}} of <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> chains and for the expression of enzyme markers assigned to each of the different human chromosomes. Human chromosome 14 was the only human chromosome present in all independent hybrids producing mu, gamma, and alpha human heavy chains. In two of the independent hybrids that produced human heavy chains, human chromosome 14 was the only human chromosome present in the hybrid cells. Loss of human chromosome 14 from these hybrids resulted in the concomitant loss of their ability to produce <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> heavy chains. In view of these results, we conclude that the genes for <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> heavy chains are located on human chromosome 14 in immunoglobulin-producing human cells...|$|R
40|$|One {{approach}} {{to the production of}} human monoclonal antibodies focusses on the creation of transgenic mice bearing <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene miniloci. Whilst such loci undergo lymphoid-specific gene rearrangement, only a small proportion of mouse B cells express the <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> chains; the miniloci thus contribute poorly to serum immunoglobulin. Attributing this poor performance to competition between the transgenic and endogenous immunoglobulin loci, we crossed mice bearing a <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> heavy-chain (HulgH) minilocus with animals that had been rendered B cell-deficient by disruption of their endogenous heavy-chain locus. The results were dramatic: the human minilocus rescued B cell differentiation such that effectively all B cells now expressed human mu chains. The concentration of antibody in the mouse serum recognised by anti-human mu increased to a concentration about one sixth that in human serum. The HulgH antibodies are heterogenous with diversity being generated by both combinatorial and junctional processes. Following antigen challenge, specific antibody is elicited but at low titre...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesDespite over {{a century}} of {{research}} and the careful scrutiny of many promising targets, there is currently no vaccine available {{for the prevention of}} Streptococcus pyogenes infection. Through analysis of the protective, anti-streptococcal components of pooled <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin,</b> we previously identified ten highly conserved and invariant S. pyogenes antigens that contribute to anti-streptococcal immunity in the adult population. We sought to emulate population immunity to S. pyogenes through a process of active vaccination, using the antigens targeted by pooled <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin.</b> MethodsSeven targets were produced recombinantly and mixed to form a multicomponent vaccine (Spy 7). Vaccinated mice were challenged with S. pyogenes isolates representing four globally relevant serotypes (M 1, M 3, M 12 and M 89) using an established model of invasive disease. ResultsVaccination with Spy 7 stimulated the production of anti-streptococcal antibodies, and limited systemic dissemination of M 1 and M 3 S. pyogenes from an intramuscular infection focus. Vaccination additionally attenuated disease severity due to M 1 S. pyogenes as evidenced by reduction in weight loss, and modulated cytokine release. ConclusionSpy 7 vaccination successfully stimulated the generation of protective anti-streptococcal immunity inÂ vivo.

40|$|Some {{pathogens}} {{have evolved}} to produce proteins, called B-cell superantigens, that can interact with <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> variable regions, independently of the combining site, and activate B lymphocytes that express the target immunoglobulins. However, the in vivo consequences of these interactions on human B-cell numbers and function are largely unknown. Using transgenic mice expressing fully <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulins,</b> we studied the consequences of in vivo exposure of protein L of Peptostreptococcus magnus with <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulins.</b> In the mature pool of B cells, protein L exposure resulted in a specific reduction of splenic marginal-zone B cells and peritoneal B- 1 cells. Splenic B cells exhibited a skewed light-chain repertoire consistent with the capacity of protein L to bind specific kappa gene products. Remarkably, these two B-cell subsets are implicated in innate B-cell immunity, allowing rapid clearance of pathogens. Thus, the present study reveals a novel mechanism {{that may be used}} by some infectious agents to subvert a first line of the hostâ€™s immune defense. Throughout evolution, the continuous interactions between the mammalian host and infectious agents have produced an array of innate and adaptive immune effectors able to combat insults by pathogens (30).
