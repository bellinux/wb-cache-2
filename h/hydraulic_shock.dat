25|$|A turbo charged, liquid cooled, multi-fuel {{diesel engine}} is used, which can develop 510bhp. The vehicle has eight-wheel drive {{and has an}} {{automatic}} reversible hydro mechanical transmission, which is capable of providing different speeds to {{each side of the}} vehicle. Duplicated electrical and compressed air engine start systems are also used. The wheels are utilized with independent torsion-bar suspension and the traverse arms have high capacity telescopic <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers.|$|E
25|$|The BMP-3 has a {{range of}} 600km, an {{altitude}} of operation of up to 3,000m and it is transportable by train, truck, sea, and air. The BMP-3 engine is a diesel four-stroke, liquid-cooled design. The transmission is a four-speed hydromechanical power unit, with power takeoff to its water jets. The suspension is independent, with a torsion bar and six <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers. Steering is by gear differential with hydrostatic drive. The track adjusting mechanism is remotely controlled from the driver's station, with tension force indication. The water-jet propulsion unit is single-stage, axial, auger-type.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the stressed-skin construction, Reggiane introduced several advanced features on the Re.2000, such as a modern structure, which was considerably more advanced than the ones used in Macchi's and other Italian fighters of the time, along with an elliptical wing profile. Overall, the design possessed greater aerodynamic sophistication in comparison to other Italian rivals rivals such as the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200. The Re.2000 was furnished with retractable landing gear; the main gear retracted via the Curtiss method, the wheels rotating around to face flat within the wheel wells when retracted. The atypical fairing covered the landing gear's actuation mechanism, while the legs incorporated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers and drag struts to effective absorb loads; pneumatic brakes were also fitted. The tail wheel was both retractable and steerable.|$|E

500|$|The Baker shot {{produced}} so many unusual {{phenomena that}} a conference was held {{two months later}} to standardize nomenclature and define new terms for use in descriptions and analysis. The underwater fireball {{took the form of}} a rapidly expanding hot gas bubble that pushed against the water, generating a supersonic <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> wave which crushed the hulls of nearby ships as it spread out. Eventually it slowed to the speed of sound in water, which is one mile per second (1600m/s), five times faster than that of sound in air. On the surface, the shock wave was visible as the leading edge of a rapidly expanding ring of dark water, called the [...] "slick" [...] for its resemblance to an oil slick. Close behind the slick was a visually more dramatic, but less destructive whitening of the water surface called the [...] "crack".|$|E

2500|$|Depending on {{customer}} options, the SD50 {{was available}} with {{a multitude of}} traction-motor gearing ratio and wheel size options, {{the most common of}} which being the 70:17 ratio with [...] wheels, this allowed for a top speed of [...] Other gearing options for the SD50 with [...] wheels include 69:18 for , 67:19 for [...] and 66:20 for [...] [...] wheels were also available. Customers of the SD50 also had the option of either HT-C trucks (identified with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> {{on the side of the}} middle axle of each truck) or the earlier Flexicoil trucks, which only Conrail opted for. Some investigators implicated the HT-C truck in derailments in Amtrak's SDP40F locomotive fleet and Conrail chose to order SD40-2s and their first order of SD50s with the earlier Flexicoil C truck. The controversy surrounding the HT-C truck was eventually disproved, and Conrail's second order of SD50s as well as their SD60 variants were all HT-C equipped.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930 the Ordnance Department {{modified}} {{one of the}} T1E1 {{tanks to}} create the T1E3. In some ways this was a hybrid of the T1E1 and T1E2; it had the high-velocity long-barreled Browning gun, thickened armor, and more powerful engine of the T1E2, but it retained the hull, turret, dimensions, and transmission gear ratios of the T1E1. The T1E3 weighed [...] Since it had the T1E2's more powerful engine and the T1E1 gearing, this gave it both a higher power-to-weight ratio and greater speed than any previous T1 version, with a maximum speed of [...] The most important feature of this version, however, was its suspension, which was completely redesigned. All previous T1 versions had a totally unsprung suspension which used multiple equalizing links between the bogies to spread out impacts from rough terrain. This still gave a very rough ride. The T1E3's suspension had coil springs and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers, and its ride was much smoother.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrostatic shock or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> {{is a term}} which {{describes}} the observation that a penetrating projectile can produce remote wounding and incapacitating effects in living targets through a hydraulic effect in their liquid-filled tissues, in addition to local effects in tissue caused by direct impact. Just as force applied by a pump in a hydraulic circuit is transmitted throughout the circuit because of the near incompressibility of the liquid, so the kinetic energy of a bullet can sometimes send a shock wave through the body, transferring physical shock to tissues whose physiologic function may be disrupted by it (especially in the circulatory or nervous systems). (Other kinds of shock, namely circulatory and psychological, may follow, but mechanical shock is the immediate disruptor.) There is scientific evidence that hydrostatic shock can produce remote neural damage and produce incapacitation more quickly than blood loss effects. In arguments about the differences in stopping power between calibers and between cartridge models, proponents of cartridges that are [...] "light and fast" [...] (such as the 9×19mm Parabellum) versus cartridges that are [...] "slow and heavy" [...] (such as the [...]45 ACP) often refer to this phenomenon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired road wheels with the drive sprocket {{at the rear}} and the idler at the front. The road wheels are hollow to minimize weight. These hollow road wheels increase the tank's buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last road wheels have a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shock</b> absorber and the steel tracks have 96 links each when new, each link has a single pin. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. Its straight 6-cylinder, 4-stroke water-cooled diesel engine was developed under the designation [...] "V-6" [...] by halving the [...] "V-12"-engine from the T-54/55. It develops 240hp (179kW) at 1,800rpm which gives it a road speed of 44km/h {{and a range of}} 370km to 400km. The vehicle can cross 1.1 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches and climb 52° gradients. The engine has a cooling system and an initial heater (intended for use when the air temperature is -20°C or colder). The PT-76 has a 5-speed manual shaft-type transmission system similar to the one in the T-34/85. The gearbox has four forward gears and one reverse. The vehicle has a side clutch that enables it to make turns and a handbrake. The tank has four mounts for additional external fuel tanks {{at the rear of the}} hull. The two on the corners are for flat type external tanks and the two in the center are for a drum type. These additional tanks increase the range from 370km – 400km to 480km – 510km. The PT-76 is a reliable, simple to operate and highly mobile reconnaissance vehicle and is ideally designed for amphibious operations, but it has many limitations as a fighting vehicle.|$|E

40|$|LectureThe {{dynamics}} (movement) of {{the check}} valves in a reciprocating power pump {{determine whether the}} pump will operate quietly and smoothly, or noisily with pulsation and vibration. Although piping pulsation and vibration are, to a degree, function of the system design, improper pump valve dynamics contribute {{a significant portion of}} the pulsation problems in many installations. Many reciprocating power pumps, operating in industrial installation, have been found to be fitted with suction and discharge valve springs that are too weak. The weak springs do not close the valves soon enough, as the plunger reverses, causing the valves to be slammed onto their seats, creating a noisy pump, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shocks,</b> and possible damage to the valves and/or seats. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shocks</b> can also cause damage to other pump components, the drive train, and to the system. Suction and discharge pipes may vibrate, piping and instruments may be damaged, and pump net positive suction head (NPSH) requirements may be high. To reduce the pulsations and vibrations, owners frequently resort to the installation of pulsation dampening equipment in the piping, when stronger valve springs may have been adequate to produce a quiet, smooth-running pump. Starting with either the maximum valve lift, or the maximum closing impact velocity, simple equations of motion can approximate the displacement (lift), velocity, and acceleration of the valve, all based on crankshaft rotative speed. The maximum lift can then be used to calculate the NPSH required by the pump...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{changes were}} made for 1965. Though the 1.5 L SP310 {{continued}} in production through January, a new 1.6 L R16-powered SP311 and SPL311 joined it. The new model was first shown at the 1964 Tokyo Motor Show, but did not enter production until March 1965. The restyling was executed in part by Count Albrecht Goertz, who would later be involved with designing the first Fairlady Z. Marketed as the Fairlady 1600, or the Datsun Sports 1600 in many export markets including North America, it featured 14 inch wheels and minor exterior changes. The SPL311 was also known in the United States, on the West Coast, as the [...] "Roadster". The front suspension was independent, utilizing coil springs over <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shocks.</b> Rear suspension was a common leaf springs design, dampened with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shocks.</b> The 1600 SPL311 came {{with a pair of}} SU carburators. The engine produced [...] The R16 is an in-line four cylinder OHV engine. Early SPL311 came with a high compression engine that had three main bearings, hydraulic lifters, a cast iron block and cast iron head. Timing of the distributor could be easily adjusted to reduce pre-ignition knock and thereby tune for questionable quality gasoline. Engines in later SPL311 had 5 main bearings and this addressed a design weakness. Top speed for the SPL311 with approximately 91 octane gasoline was approximately 105 mph. The axle gearing suffered from design limitations and Datsun performance parts offered a cooling system as a retofit. Steering utilized a worm gear design. The hood badge said [...] "Datsun" [...] in individual letters, the rear badge said [...] "Datsun 1600", and the side badges said [...] "Fairlady" [...] (Japanese market) or [...] "Datsun 1600" [...] (export market). The SP311 continued in production through April 1970.|$|R
