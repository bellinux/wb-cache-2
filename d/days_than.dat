5|$|During {{its opening}} {{weekend at the}} Lagoon Cinema in Minneapolis, Into Temptation sold more tickets in three <b>days</b> <b>than</b> any other film during its debut weekend, and sold twice the tickets of such major studio films as Taking Woodstock and Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. This {{resulted}} in an extended run and strong word-of-mouth that led to exhibitions in other cities. The film earned a total of $97,457 in gross revenue in the United States. The Into Temptation DVD was released on October 27, 2009, with no bonus features.|$|E
5|$|The new {{officers}} {{hired in}} the wake of the strike received higher salaries and more vacation <b>days</b> <b>than</b> the strikers had. They enjoyed a starting salary of $1,400 along with a pension plan, and the department covered the cost of their uniforms and equipment. The population of Boston raised $472,000 to help pay for the State Guards until new police officers could be recruited.|$|E

5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick <b>days</b> <b>than</b> men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Veerangan {{now finds}} himself saddled {{with the role}} of king for more <b>days</b> <b>than</b> he had {{initially}} bargained for because of Marthandan's sudden disappearance. He does not let this setback deter him and puts the opportunity to good use by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is troubled {{by the fact that he}} is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. Unable to keep it a secret from her, he tells her the truth. Perceiving his noble character, Manohari accepts him as her brother.|$|E
25|$|The {{humidity}} and temperature determines {{the amount of}} foraging that occurs in Parachartergus fraternus nests. There was almost double the amount of foraging on sunny <b>days</b> <b>than</b> on cloudy days. This means {{that the number of}} wasps leaving and returning to the nest was lower on cloudy <b>days</b> <b>than</b> on sunny days. On cloudy days there was a milder temperature and a higher relative humidity. On sunny days there was lower humidity, a warmer temperature, and higher brightness levels. The temperature has positive effects on foraging while humidity had negative effects. Wasps are also less likely to forage on windy days. They must consider the amount of energy it takes to leave the nest, find and subdue the prey, and carry it back to the nest. Windier weather makes this harder. There may be metabolic adjustments to seasonal changes of temperature and humidity. Time of day also factors into foraging behavior. Longer days are more favorable for flight. Wasps are also exposed to more predation on sunny days because predators are usually more active too. This variation in foraging levels is also seen in other wasp species like P. lanio lanio.|$|E

25|$|Wales has warmer {{temperatures}} {{throughout the}} year than Scotland, and has milder winter minima than England, but cooler winter maxima than Northern Ireland. Wales is wetter {{throughout the year}} than Northern Ireland and England, but has fewer rainy <b>days</b> <b>than</b> Northern Ireland; meaning that rainfall {{tends to be more}} intense. Wales is also drier than Scotland in every month apart from May, June and December, and there are fewer days with rain than in Scotland. Sunshine totals throughout the year are more than that of Scotland and Northern Ireland, but less than that of neighbouring England. May is the sunniest month, averaging 186.8 hours.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine {{was granted}} leave {{to contest the}} General Election in October that year; {{according}} to Ian Josephs this had been his plan from the start. Afterwards he applied on business grounds for exemption from return to the Army, {{in part because of}} difficulties caused by an employee's embezzlement, and partly including the need to sort out his father's affairs, and was exempted from his remaining sixteen months of service. During the 1980s his habit of wearing a Guards regimental tie, sometimes incorrectly knotted with a red stripe on the neck, was the subject of much acerbic comment from military figures and from older MPs with distinguished war records. Crick estimated that he must have worn the tie on more <b>days</b> <b>than</b> he actually served in the Guards.|$|E
25|$|Pain and {{discomfort}} also increase aggression. Even {{the simple act}} of placing one's hands in hot water can cause an aggressive response. Hot temperatures have been implicated as a factor in a number of studies. One study completed {{in the midst of the}} civil rights movement found that riots were more likely on hotter <b>days</b> <b>than</b> cooler ones (Carlsmith & Anderson 1979). Students were found to be more aggressive and irritable after taking a test in a hot classroom (Anderson et al. 1996, Rule, et al. 1987). Drivers in cars without air conditioning were also found to be more likely to honk their horns (Kenrick & MacFarlane 1986), which is used as a measure of aggression and has shown links to other factors such as generic symbols of aggression or the visibility of other drivers.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} rainfall {{in the history of}} the United States has occurred in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. On April 5, 1926, a rain gauge in the San Gabriels collected one inch in one minute. In January, 1969, more water fell on the San Gabriels in nine <b>days</b> <b>than</b> New York City sees in a year. In February 1978, almost a foot of rain fell in 24 hours, and, in one blast, an inch and a half in five minutes. This storm caused massive debris flows throughout the region, one of them unearthing the corpses in the Verdugo Hills Cemetery and depositing them in the town below. Another wiped out the small town of Hidden Springs in a tributary of the Big Tujunga River, killing 13 people.|$|E
500|$|Storms and {{occasional}} cyclones also affect the island. Rainfall records are maintained {{in the north}} where rainfall is less than in the frequently cloud-shrouded mountains of the south. There can be wide variation in rainfall from year to year. July and August are the coldest months with average minimum temperatures of about [...] and no frost. Average maximum temperatures range from [...] in the winter to [...] in the summer. The humidity averages in the 60–70% range year round becoming more noticeable on warmer summer <b>days</b> <b>than</b> in the cooler winter months.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the first round}} in season two, each team {{had a chance to}} earn 25 additional points. Before the show, a question was asked to 100 YouVersion users (e.g. [...] "Would you rather fast for 40 days or eat manna for 40 years?"). A question with three possible choices was then asked about the percentage of people who answered (e.g. [...] "What percentage said they would rather fast for 40 <b>days</b> <b>than</b> eat manna for 40 years?"). During the break, each team wrote their answer on a tablet computer, and each team that submitted the correct answer earned 25 points. This round was removed from the game in the third season and replaced with another opening round-style game played for ± 100 points a question.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the moderately negative feedback {{the third and fourth}} seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: [...] "Overall, it feels more like the good old <b>days</b> <b>than</b> Grey's Anatomy has in a long time." [...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did." ...|$|E
500|$|Klein's {{government}} had received criticism {{for reducing the}} importance of the legislature by sitting it fewer <b>days</b> <b>than</b> any other province's legislature and for directing business through standing policy committees of the Progressive Conservative caucus. These committees met in private, unlike the legislature's all-party committees, which fell almost entirely out of use during the Klein years. In April 2007, Stelmach initiated the creation of four new legislative [...] "policy field committees" [...] which would include opposition representation. The same month, his government introduced new legislation on conflicts of interest, such that former cabinet ministers would have to wait one year before doing business with the government or lobbying it on behalf of third parties (up from six months). It also created a similar cooling-off period for senior bureaucrats, which lasted six months. [...] However, an Order in Council passed by Stelmach's cabinet shortly before the 2008 election delayed the implementation of these rules until one month after the election, meaning that cabinet ministers who retired or lost their bids for re-election would be exempt from the new rules.|$|E

500|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) is {{the water temperature}} close to the ocean's surface. [...] The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between [...] and [...] below the sea surface. [...] Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea {{surface temperature}}s within a short distance of the shore. [...] Localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass. [...] Warm sea surface temperatures {{are known to be}} a cause of tropical cyclogenesis over the Earth's oceans. [...] Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper [...] of the ocean. [...] SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy <b>days</b> <b>than</b> on calm days. [...] In addition, ocean currents such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales, a major impact results from the global thermohaline circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called [...] "Get Back" [...] a [...] "welcome girl-rock hit". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and said, [...] "She wrote {{this with the}} Jonas Brothers, but it sounds more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or {{the sort of thing}} Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I {{want to get back to}} the old days,' what she means is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older <b>days</b> <b>than</b> that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E
