40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{address the problem}} of pricing options in the {{presence}} of transaction costs. A known approach to this problem is a so-called superhedging approach. I suggest an idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> and, based on it, a new algorithm to implement the superhedging approach. As far as I know, only European options were discussed in the literature on pricing derivatives when there are transaction costs. The proposed algorithm, however, can be applied to price American options as well. It is also more efficient compared with the previous methods. The superhedging approach is based on the problem of finding the cheapest portfolio now for which there is a trading strategy with consumption such that for every possible outcome the value of the portfolio {{at the time of the}} option exercise is not less than the value of the option (when the short position in the option is considered). A notion of a hedging set is introduced in the article to help to solve this problem. A discrete time economy is considered with price movements of an underlying asset being modeled by a recombining tree. At the current tree node a hedging set is defined as a set of portfolios that can hedge the considered option in the sense of superhedging. It is easy to build <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> for every tree node at the time of the option exercise. I also show how to build <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> for the current tree nodes given <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> of the next tree nodes when there are proportional transaction costs. Thus the solution to the stated problem comes from building <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> backward the tree and then finding the cheapest portfolio in the first hedging set. I discuss in detail the idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> and how to price European and American options under the presence of proportional transaction costs. Appropriate numerical examples are also given. I believe that the idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> is versatile as it allows using a tree of any type to model price movements of an underlying asset when pricing and hedging derivatives using the superhedging approach. Also, multidimensional <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> may allow pricing and hedging derivatives that depend on several random factors...|$|E

Then hypergraph H is invertible iff {{there exists a}} permutation pi of V such that for all E belongs to H(edges) intersection of(pi(E) and E) = 0. H is invertibility critical if H is not invertible but every hypergraph obtained by removing an edge from H is invertible. The degree of H is d if |{E belongs to H(edges) |x belongs to E}| =< d for each x belongs to V Let i(d) be {{the maximum number of}} edges of an invertibility critical hypergraph of degree d. Theorem: i(d) =< (d- 1) { 2 d- 1 choose d} + 1. The proof of this result leads to the following covering problem on graphs: Let G be a graph. A family H is subset of (2 ^{V(G) } is an edge cover of G iff for every edge e of G, there is an E belongs to <b>H(edge</b> <b>set)</b> which includes e. <b>H(edge</b> <b>set)</b> is a minimal edge cover of G iff for H' subset of H, H' is not an edge cover of G. Let b(d) (c(d)) be the maximum cardinality of a minimal edge cover <b>H(edge</b> <b>set)</b> of a complete bipartite graph (complete graph) where <b>H(edge</b> <b>set)</b> has degree d. Theorem: c(d) =< i(d) =<b(d) =< c(d+ 1) and 3. 2 ^{d- 1 } - 2 =< b(d) =< (d- 1) { 2 d- 1 choose d} + 1. The proof of this result uses Sperner theory. The bounds b(d) also arise as bounds on the maximum number of elements in the union of minimal covers of families of sets. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

40|$|We derive a risk-neutral {{pricing model}} for {{discrete}} dynamic guaranteed funds with geometric Gaussian underlying security price process. We propose a dynamic hedging strategy {{by adding a}} gamma factor to the conventional delta. Simulation results demonstrate that, when hedging discretely, the risk-neutral gamma-adjusted-delta strategy outperforms the dynamic delta hedging strategy by reducing the expected hedging error, lowering the hedging error variability, and improving the self-financing possibility. The discrete dynamic delta-only hedging not only causes potential overcharge to clients but also could be costly to the issuers. We show that a naive application of continuous-time hedging formula to a discrete-time <b>hedging</b> <b>setting</b> tends to worsen these possibilities.

Inputs to the network consist only of the ten prior quarterly percentage changes in price and in earnings for each equity (by quarter, not accumulated), converted to a relative rank scaled around zero. Thirty simulated portfolios are constructed respectively of the 10, 20, [...] ., and 100 top ranking equities (long portfolios), the 10, 20, [...] ., 100 bottom ranking equities (short portfolios) and their <b>hedged</b> <b>sets</b> (long-short portfolios). In a 29 -quarter simulation {{from the end of}} the third quarter of 1994 through the fourth quarter of 2001 that duplicates real-world trading of the same method employed during 2002, all portfolios are held fixed for one quarter. Results are compared to the S&P 500, the Value Line universe itself, trading the universe of equities using the proprietary ``Value Line Ranking System'' (to which this method is in some ways similar), and to a Martingale method of ranking the same equities. The cumulative returns generated by the network predictor significantly exceed those generated by the S&P 500, the overall universe, the Martingale and Value Line prediction methods and are not eroded by trading costs. The ANN shows significantly positive Jensen's alpha, i. e., anomalous risk-adjusted expected return. A time series of its global performance shows a clear antipersistence. However, its performance is significantly better than a simple one-step Martingale predictor, than the Value Line system itself and than a simple buy and hold strategy, even when transaction costs are accounted for. ...|$|R

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that firms attach call options to debt issues to manage interest rate risk.

Consistent with this idea, we document that first time issuers in bond markets and small firms are more likely to hedge using call options in bonds, contrary to virtually all received evidence that large firms are more likely to hedge. The role of the supply side in hedging is further underlined by our evidence of a secular and robust shift away from calls in the 1990 s, a period of rapid growth and increased availability of OTC derivatives. ...|$|R

For normal distributions the censored mean is synonymous with the statistical hazard function, but this is not true for fat-tailed distributions. The latter turn out to imply much tighter bounds for the admissible portfolio set and indeed for the logistic, an upper bound for the portfolio variance that yields a simple portfolio choice rule. The choice theory in GVaR is in general not consistent with classic Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions for money. A re-specification is suggested to make it so that gives a clearer picture of the economic role of the respective constraints.

Results are compared to the S&P 500, the Value Line universe itself, trading the universe of equities using the proprietary Value Line Ranking System (to which this method is in some ways similar), and to a Martingale method of ranking the same equities. The cumulative returns generated by the network predictor significantly exceed those generated by the S&P 500, the overall universe, the Martingale and Value Line prediction methods and are not eroded by trading costs. The ANN shows significantly positive Jensen's alpha. All three active trading methods result in very high levels of volatility. But the network method exhibits a distinct kind of volatility: Though overall it does the best job of segregating equities in advance into those that will rise and those that will fall relative to one another, there are many quarters when it does not merely fail, but rather inverts: It disproportionately predicts an inverse rank ordering and therefore generates unusually large losses in those quarters. The same phenomenon occurs, but to a greater degree, with the VL system itself and with a one-step Martingale predictor. An examination of the quarter to quarter performance of the actual and predicted rankings of the change in equity prices suggests while the network is capturing, after a delay, changes in the market sampled by the equities in the Value Line index (enough to generate substantial gains), it also fails in large measure to keep up with the fluctuating data, leading the predictor to be often out of phase with the market. A time series of its global performance thus shows antipersistence. However, its performance is significantly better than a simple one-step Martingale predictor, than the Value Line system itself and than a simple buy and hold strategy, even when transaction costs are accounted for.

40|$|Motivated by an {{aggregate}} production-planning problem {{in an actual}} global manufacturing network, we {{examine the impact of}} exchange-rate uncertainty on the choice of optimal production policies when the allocation decision can be deferred until the realization of exchange rates. This leads to the formulation of the problem as a two-stage recourse program whose optimal policy structure features two forms of flexibility denoted as operational hedging: (1) production hedging, where the firm deliberately produces less than the total demand; and (2) allocation hedging, where due to unfavorable exchange rates, some markets are not served despite having unused production. Our characterization of the optimal policy structure leads to an economic valuation of production and allocation hedging. We show that the prevalence of production hedging is moderated by the degree of correlation between exchange rates. A comprehensive examination under the following four generalized settings provides the depth, scope, and relevancy that our proposed operational hedges play to facilitate aggregate planning: (1) multiple periods, (2) demand uncertainty, (3) price setting or monopolistic pricing, and (4) price setting under demand uncertainty. We show that production and allocation hedging are robust for these generalizations and should be integrated into the overall aggregate planning strategy of a global manufacturing firm. exchange-rate uncertainty, international operations management, production planning, production hedging, allocation <b>hedging,</b> price <b>setting...</b>|$|R
