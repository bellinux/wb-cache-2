[...] I had to think about that and that I'm not really a free hitter of the ball, so the choice I made was I was going {{to be more of a}} grafter.|$|E

5000|$|In a 1987 {{fan club}} interview, Holder {{explained}} {{the song and}} its release: [...] "Well, the situation here is that, although {{all the members of}} Slade really like this new song and want to see it released as the next single, RCA don't want to release it themselves. They have, however, given us the option to release it independently on our own label, with RCA distributing it. Our deal is not up yet at RCA, they've just agreed to let us release this one single on our own. CBS really like the song as well, so it looks like the American version of the album will include this song as the title track. The song is an up-tempo rock thing in the Beastie Boys sort of ilk. The B-side will probably be an instrumental version of the same song. There will also be a 12" [...] extended version. At the moment there are several different versions of this song with different lyrics, so we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> on which ones we are going to use." ...|$|R
50|$|At this point, Pichegru and Jourdan <b>got</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> on a plan. Jourdan {{wanted to}} mass the two French armies near Mannheim, placing them between Clerfayt's army {{and a second}} Austrian army under General der Kavallerie Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser that was advancing from the south. Using the strategy of the central position, Jourdan hoped to defeat the Austrian armies one after the other. After Pichegru rejected the plan, both generals waited upon new orders from Paris. After the loss of Mannheim, Clerfayt took his army south to block further moves by Pichegru against his Heidelberg base. In response, Jourdan ordered his army to move south to the Main River. This move completely isolated Mainz by surrounding it {{from both sides of}} the Rhine.|$|R
500|$|In the future, {{society is}} divided between 'low-drives' that equate with the labouring classes and 'hi-drives' {{who control the}} {{government}} and media. The low-drives are controlled by a constant broadcast of pornography that the hi-drives are convinced will pacify them, though one hi-drive, Nat Mender (Tony Vogel), believes that the media {{should be used to}} educate the low-drives. After the accidental death of a protester during the Sex Olympics gets a massive audience response, the co-ordinator Ugo Priest (Leonard Rossiter) <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> commission a new programme. In The Live Life Show, Nat Mender, his partner Deanie (Suzanne Neve) and their daughter Keten (Lesley Roach) are stranded on a remote Scottish island while the low-drive audience watches.

40|$|The {{euthanasia}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} debated issues in the world. The main focus of the debate has been weather euthanasia should be legalized or not. Euthanasia generally means a mercy killing. Contrary views and arguments exist in this regard. The present paper is a moderate attempt to examine these contrary arguments. The paper concludes with the observations that debate on euthanasia is still grappled with dilemma. This debate is continuing one as some people are of the view that the life is sacred and no one has <b>got</b> the right <b>to</b> end it whereas others say that life belongs to oneself so each person has <b>got</b> the right <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> what he or she wants to do with it even if it amounts to dying.

We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> these things for ourselves. But I tell you one thing, Forster, I've found the way. I've found out the biggest hazard in the world--a game of chance that never is concluded, a venture that may end in the highest heaven or the blackest pit. It will keep a man on edge until the clods fall on his coffin, because he will never know--not until his last day, and not then will he know. It is a voyage without a rudder or compass, and you must be captain and crew and keep watch, every day and night, yourself, with no one to relieve you. I have found the VENTURE. Don't bother yourself about leaving Mary Marsden, Forster. I married her yesterday at noon." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will go back}} to the Army. Last {{year when}} I {{referred}} to this subject, I told the House that it would be my object to remove any defects that I and those who advise me might discover in the Army system, and more especially, of course, in the schemes of Lord Kitchener. Since then, with the assistance of two very important Committees, well qualified by expert military knowledge, I {{came to the conclusion that}} an improved equipment was required. Hon. Gentlemen may think that my opinion alone would not be worth much; but, after all, civilians have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> these questions, and, provided that they arm themselves with the expert knowledge of military authorities, it is rightly their voice that settles the matter. Certain changes were necessary in the allocation of units in order to enable the troops to be better trained, and therefore our final conclusion was that the special military expenditure shown in the financial statement must go on for some years more. But the House will see that we have arranged to cut down the rate of the annual grant, and we have taken care--and this, I think, ought to be set down to our credit--that every estimate for every item included in the programme shall be submitted to vigilant scrutiny here as well as in India. I have no prepossession in favour of military expenditure, but the pressure of facts, the pressure of the situation, the possibilities of contingencies that may arise, seem obviously to make it impossible for any Government or any Minister to acquiesce in the risks on the Indian frontier. We have to consider not only our position with respect to foreign Powers on the Indian frontier, but the exceedingly complex questions that arise in connection with the turbulent border tribes. All these things make it impossible--I say nothing about internal conditions--for any Government or any Minister with a sense of responsibility to cancel or to deal with the military programme in any high-handed or cavalier way.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1970s, {{traveling}} {{was considered}} {{an aspect of the}} counterculture and Tony Wheeler said in 2013: [...] "The boomers were setting off to places their parents hadn't gone." [...] What became known as the [...] "hippie trail" [...] was a popular route for such travelers, as the price of travel dropped and numerous Asian travel companies were launched. Cadwalladr explained in 2007 that the introduction of the Across Asia on the Cheap booklet was [...] "a generational call to arms", as it contained Tony Wheeler's motivational cry: [...] "All you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do is <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> go and the hardest part is over. So go." [...] Cadwalladr further states that Wheeler's peers throughout the world subsequently made the decision to travel, regardless of whether they possessed a Lonely Planet guide. Other travel guide brand names also emerged in the early 1970s, such as Rough Guides and Bradt.|$|R
