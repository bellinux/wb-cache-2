5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E

25|$|Sir James Paget had {{the gift}} of eloquence, {{and was one of}} the most careful and most {{delightful}} speakers of his time. He had a natural and unaffected pleasure in society, and he loved music. He possessed the rare gift of the ability to turn swiftly from work to play, enjoying his holidays like a schoolboy, easily moved to laughter, keen to get the maximum of happiness out of very ordinary amusements, emotional in spite of incessant self-restraint, and vigorous in spite of constant overwork. In him a certain light-hearted enjoyment was combined with the utmost reserve, unfailing religious faith, and the most scrupulous honour. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> his life profoundly indifferent toward politics, both national and medical; his ideal was the unity of science and practice in the professional life.|$|E
25|$|At 1030 {{hours on}} the morning of 24 November Seneca hailed Tomoka in {{latitude}} 40° 21.6' North, longitude 73° 49.7' West and ordered her to heave to and be prepared to be boarded and examined. A surfboat with an armed boarding party in charge of Lieutenant L. W. Perkins was sent to go on board and take charge of the vessel. At first Tomoka broke out the British flag and cruised about so that the boarding party would not overtake her. Seneca called her gun crews to quarters, cast loose the number one gun, and then ordered Tomoka to permit the boat to board. The master then complied. At 12:00 the boarding officer reported that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> right and requested the Seneca to go ahead and he would follow with Tomoka. Seneca shaped a course for the Ambrose Channel lightship, but by 12:30 Tomoka had still not started to follow. Heading back for the rum-runner Seneca was met by her boarding party, which had been chased off Tomoka with a machinegun.|$|E
25|$|Karunanidhi always {{appeared}} to prefer his younger son, M. K. Stalin, {{former mayor of}} Chennai and former Deputy Chief minister of Tamil Nadu, for succeeding him {{as the leader of}} Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Azhagiri shifted his base to Madurai during 1989 and did not hold any post officially in the party. In spite of holding no posts, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> in command in the Madurai region and senior leaders in the party were unhappy about the factionalism created within the party. The DMK general secretary, K Anbazhagan, in 2001, directed the party men to have any contact with Azhagiri. During the period of 2008, Azhagiri was instrumental in the party winning three by-elections, the notable of which was Thirumangalam, where the party won with a massive difference. Based on the victory, Azhagiri was appointed as the organizing secretary of the party for southern districts. Following the by-poll victories in the state, Azhagiri was given the ticket for Madurai Lok Sabha Constituency in 2009 general elections, which he won eventually and later {{went on to become a}} cabinet minister.|$|E

500|$|The {{attention}} of the FDA triggered belligerent responses from Reich, who called them [...] "HiGS" [...] (hoodlums in government) and the tools of red fascists. He developed a delusion that he had powerful friends in government, including President Eisenhower, who he believed would protect him, and that the U.S. Air Force was flying over Orgonon {{to make sure that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> right. On 29 July 1952 three inspectors arrived at Orgonon unannounced. Sharaf writes that Reich detested unannounced visitors; he had once chased some people away with a gun just for looking at an adjacent property. He told the inspectors they had to read his work before he would interact with them, and ordered them to leave.|$|E
500|$|Upon Alston's death, MLB {{commissioner}} Peter Ueberroth {{referred to}} {{him as one of}} baseball's greatest managers. Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run-ins with Alston, but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team that he managed. Tommy Lasorda, who played and coached under Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager, commented on {{how easy it was to}} play for Alston. Broadcaster Vin Scully said, [...] "I always imagined him to be the type who could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> man and two yards tall. He was very quiet, very controlled. He never made excuses. He gave the players the credit and he took the blame. He was so solid, so American." ...|$|E

It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character.

Just then, Doofenshmirtz's ice cream cone falls and lands on Phineas's head. Buford is {{satisfied}} now that Phineas is embarrassed and calls off the match. [...] The audience who was watching cleans up the mess (due to Doofenshmirtz's machine accidentally telling them to). At the parking lot a few minutes later, Phineas thanks Holyfield for his help and Holyfield walks off. Ferb makes a comment which accidentally offends Buford and {{he is about to}} be beaten up, but he knocks Buford out with a Vulcan nerve pinch, to Phineas's surprise.

500|$|On February23,2011, it was {{announced}} that Glee, for the first time, would feature two original songs, entitled [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] and [...] "Get It Right" [...] on their March15,2011 episode. The series' music producer, Adam Anders, called the song a [...] "Gleek anthem," [...] and it was [...] "a very uptempo, kind-of-summery hit". It was also revealed that pop music producer, Max Martin, known for his work with Britney Spears, among other singers, would produce [...] "Loser Like Me". Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called this a [...] "major pop music coup" [...] by Glee. Anders also went on to comment, [...] "The thing about Max is that he’s a huge fan of pop culture and he just loved the idea of being part of something that’s such a cultural phenomenon.

500|$|When Rhodes was {{involved}} in matches, Cardus believed that [...] "he {{was not a man}} given to affability", showing annoyance on the field and being critical of the performances of others. According to historian Anthony Woodhouse, Rhodes was a [...] "dour, methodical and calculating cricketer." [...] Not popular in the way that a player like Hirst was popular, Rhodes [...] "commanded respect rather than plaudits" [...] in the words of Bowes. An introvert, he did not always get along with the more extrovert Hirst, possibly owing to mutual jealousy and some of Hirst's jocular comments, and was rarely pictured smiling. However, Rhodes became more relaxed and approachable in later life, particularly after his eyesight failed. Cardus was surprised, after meeting him in 1950, at how much more readily Rhodes engaged in conversation, commenting that [...] "history comes from his mouth in rivers". His obituary in The Times concluded: [...] "Gruff or mellow, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> of a piece, a fighting Yorkshireman, superbly gifted." ...|$|E

[...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 1976, {{childhood}} friends Sumner and Hook separately {{attended a}} Sex Pistols {{show at the}} Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy his first bass guitar. Sumner later said that {{he felt that the}} Pistols [...] "destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship". Inspired by the performance, Sumner and Hook formed a band with their friend Terry Mason, who had also attended the show. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he [...] "knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in".|$|E
500|$|As skirmishers {{from the}} 77th Ohio Infantry approached, having {{difficulty}} clearing the fallen timber, Forrest ordered a charge. The wild melee, with Confederate troops firing shotguns and revolvers and brandishing sabers, nearly resulted in Forrest's capture. As Col. Jesse Hildebrand's brigade began forming in line of battle, the Southern troopers started to retreat {{at the sight}} of the strong force, and Forrest, who was well in advance of his men, came within a few yards of the Union soldiers before realizing <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> alone. Sherman's men yelled out, [...] "Kill him! Kill him and his horse!" [...] A Union soldier shoved his musket into Forrest's side and fired, striking him above the hip, penetrating to near the spine. Although he was seriously wounded, Forrest was able to stay on horseback and escape; he survived both the wound and the war. The Union lost about 100 men, most of them captured during Forrest's charge, in an incident that has been remembered with the name [...] "Fallen Timbers". After capturing the Confederate field hospital, Sherman encountered the rear of Breckinridge's covering force, but determined the enemy was making no signs of renewing its attack and withdrew back to the Union camps.|$|E

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

[...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want to remember it. It's tough. It's tough. I'll miss these guys. I'll miss this game. I just want every one to know that...I didn't plan on doing this. Way to put me on the spot."

500|$|In 1959, Lawrence Wien, {{owner of}} New York City's Plaza Hotel {{purchased}} the hotel, but signed a management deal for Clark {{to remain as}} manager. In the early 1960s, the mafia-financed casino hotels of the Las Vegas Strip and Nevada came under close scrutiny by the FBI, and they placed increased pressure on the Nevada Gaming Control Board to force the mobsters out of Las Vegas. After Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises of Frank Sinatra's Cal Neva Lodge & Casino at Lake Tahoe, his gambling license was removed by the Board and {{he was forced to}} sell up and forfeit his share in the Sands Hotel and Casino. The Desert Inn faced similar scrutiny by the FBI, attracting controversy at the same time for the involvement of Dalitz and his mobster associates, but simultaneously called for the prosecution of the FBI for illegal wiretapping. In 1964, Clark sold his remaining share in the hotel to Dalitz and business associates Morris Kleinman, Thomas McGinty and Sam Tucker. He {{died of a heart attack}} the following year. The bell captain of the Desert Inn, Jack Butler, remembered Clark: [...] "Wilbur was the greatest guy. Without him this town never would've got off the ground.
