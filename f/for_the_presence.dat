5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E

5|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{classification scheme}} {{has been suggested}} by Ogilvy and Carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy.

5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} species can be very dangerous to humans, medical researchers are investigating {{the use of these}} venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of the alkene {{functional group}} is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin {{with some of}} the dibromoalkane also produced.

5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} can affect dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom of}} the hold shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect.

5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and {{it was probably the}} first time anyone had been tested <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of 210Po in their body.

5|$|Sufficient habitat {{complexity}} is {{a crucial}} requirement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of this species, {{in order to support}} its various behaviours-basking, foraging, and hibernation—as well as to offer some protection from predators and human harassment.

It will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human activity in the area is {{the remains of a}} Roman road which served as the route between Roman camps at Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). The road ran to the north of Astley, past Keeper Delph and through Tyldesley. Evidence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Anglo-Saxons in the sparsely populated, heavily wooded and isolated region is provided by place names incorporating the Old English suffix leah, such as in Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{signs of}} human activity in Leigh are evidenced by a Neolithic stone axe found in Pennington and a bronze spearhead from south of Gas Street. A single Roman coin was found at Butts in Bedford. After the Roman departure from Britain, and {{into the history of}} Anglo-Saxon England, nothing was written about Leigh. However evidence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Saxons in what was a sparsely populated and isolated part of the country is provided by local township place names that incorporate the Old English suffix leah, such as Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E
