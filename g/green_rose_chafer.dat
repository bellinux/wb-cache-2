50|$|Cetonia aurata, {{called the}} rose chafer or the <b>green</b> <b>rose</b> <b>chafer,</b> is a beetle, 20 mm (¾ in) long, {{that has a}} {{metallic}} structurally coloured green and a distinct V-shaped scutellum. The scutellum is the small V-shaped area between the wing cases; it may show several small, irregular, white lines and marks. The underside of the beetle has a coppery colour, and its upper side is sometimes bronze, copper, violet, blue/black, or grey.|$|E
50|$|Cetonia aurata {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the North American <b>rose</b> <b>chafer,</b> Macrodactylus subspinosus, or with the rarely seen noble chafer, Gnorimus nobilis, which is very similar to the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer.</b> One way to identify Cetonia aurata is to look at its scutellum; on the noble chafer the scutellum is an equilateral triangle, but on the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> it is an isosceles triangle.|$|R
50|$|After adult <b>rose</b> <b>chafers</b> {{emerge in}} late May to mid-June, they {{aggregate}} on leaves, buds, flowers, and fruit, {{in order to}} feed and mate. By chewing on plant tissues, the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> induces the release of volatile compounds from the plant. Using their antennae, <b>rose</b> <b>chafers</b> can detect the plant compounds {{in the air and}} orient themselves {{in the direction of the}} feeding conspecific, leading to an aggregation of the beetles. Male <b>rose</b> <b>chafers</b> also orient themselves preferentially toward virgin females as opposed to mated females, though it is unknown whether they are detecting pheromones released by virgin females, or the release of plant volatiles induced by the feeding virgin females.|$|R
5000|$|Guldbagge is the Swedish {{name for}} Cetonia aurata, a beetle {{also known as}} <b>rose</b> <b>chafer.</b> Karl Axel Pehrson gave the {{following}} description of why he chose a <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> beetle as his inspiration when designing the award: [...] "The <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> likes to fly in the summer sunshine. It shimmers much like a film strip as it flies by. Something about its behaviour and its way of living can be likened to that of film." ...|$|R

50|$|Cetonia is a genus of beetles {{in family}} Scarabaeidae. One {{of the most}} {{familiar}} species is the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> (C. aurata).|$|R
50|$|<b>Rose</b> <b>chafers</b> {{are capable}} of fast flight; they fly with their wing cases down. They feed on pollen, nectar, and flowers, {{especially}} roses. They can be found among roses on warm sunny days from May until June or July, and occasionally as late as September. <b>Rose</b> <b>chafers</b> are found in southern and central Europe and {{in the southern part}} of the United Kingdom, where they sometimes seem to be very localized. They are a beneficial saprophagous species (detritivores).|$|R

50|$|The adult beetle {{feeds on}} the foliage, flowers, and fruit of many plants {{including}} grapes, apples, peaches, roses, and other garden flowers and fruits. On roses it skeletonizes the leaves, {{which can be}} rather bothersome for avid gardeners. <b>Rose</b> <b>chafers</b> are also a problem for vineyards as they eat the grapes at bloom as well as skeletonize the leaves. They also tend to appear suddenly and in swarms, and vines with over 100 <b>rose</b> <b>chafers</b> per plant have been observed. This huge amount of damage can result in almost total loss of photosynthetically active leaf area as well as reducing or prohibiting pollination. The larvae also cause damage as they feed on {{the roots of the}} plants, which can limit growth.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> has a yellowish-tan {{coloured}} {{body that}} is about 8 - 13 mm in length, with wings that do not completely cover the abdomen. The beetle has six long, spiny, reddish-brown legs that gradually become darker {{towards the end of}} the appendage. It has two short lamellate antennae that end in a club of flat plates and it has chewing mouthparts. <b>Rose</b> <b>chafers</b> are covered in dull yellow hairs which give the body its characteristic colour, however with age and with normal activity the hairs are worn off the head and thorax revealing a black colour. It is thus possible to distinguish between older and younger beetles, as older beetles will have fewer hairs and thus be darker in colour. Females tend to lose more hairs, especially on the thorax due to the mating process, and can also appear darker in colour. Females also tend to be more robust than the male. The eggs of the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> are about 1 mm in length and are oval, white and shiny. The larvae are white C-shaped grubs that when mature develop a brown head capsule and three distinct pairs of legs. The pupae are yellowish-brown in colour and are about 15 mm in length.|$|R
5000|$|Larvae {{develop in}} hole of various host plants, mainly ash (Fraxinus excelsior), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and elm (Ulmus spp.). The life cycle lasts 4-6 years.

50|$|As {{a member}} of the order Coleoptera, the <b>rose</b> <b>chafer</b> {{undergoes}} complete metamorphosis during its development. In late May, white-bodied larvae, about 18 mm long, pupate after having overwintered deep in the soil. Once they have emerged from their pupal case, adults live for 3-6 weeks, during which time they will feed on plant material and mate. Their eggs are laid in sandy soils, 15 cm deep, and hatch in 1-3 weeks. This new generation of larvae will feed on the roots of grasses, weeds, and some ornamental garden plants {{during the rest of the}} summer, before they burrow deep in the soil to overwinter; these larvae will emerge as adults in the following year.|$|R
