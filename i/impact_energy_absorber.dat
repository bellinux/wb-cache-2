Consideration to the environmental problem has been a concern recently, therefore utilization of a waste material as construction materials has been spreading widely. Volcanic pumice as one of waste materials having a high porosity can possibly be utilized as an aggregate replacement material on porous concrete to improve its porosity without much reducing the strength. The purpose {{of this research is}} to evaluate the effect of varying proportion of volcanic pumice as an aggregate replacement (VP/A) and proportion of aggregate to cement (A/C) with a constant water to cement ratio (WCR) to the mechanical properties of volcanic pumice porous concrete, and to those porous concrete with normal aggregate as a control. The result shows that by using volcanic pumice the porosity increases and the modulus of elasticity decreases, even though slightly decreasing in strength is also found. However, it showed a possibility of volcanic pumice porous concrete as <b>impact</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorber</b> structures. This research is a preliminary study which is expected to be developed for future research related to the dynamic and impact test. In addition, ACI 318 - 08 developed equation (Ec = 0. 043 W 1. 5 f’c 0. 5) can be used to rapidly estimate the modulus of elasticity of porous concrete, where it is necessary, due to experimental difficulties to measure it...|$|E

Non-linear finite element code Abaqus/Explicit was employed to evaluate the response of a single slotted square column subjected to impact in the axial direction. The study found that the slot geometry has a prominent effect on the impact response. However, the size of the slot which affects the structural stiffness of the column is not directly proportional to the reduction in initial peak force. It can be seen that a specific slot size is most effective in reducing the initial peak force at a particular impact speed.

Unlike conventional materials, they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio when subjected to a uniaxial loading. This present research experimentally investigates the crush response and energy absorption performances of auxetic foam-filled square tubes under axial loading. For comparison, the crush response and energy absorption of empty and conventional foam-filled squares tubes have also been examined with respect to deformation modes and force displacement curve. Standard compression tests were conducted on a series number of thin-walled tube samples.

The mechanical properties of these woods at dynamic loading have been evaluated {{by the use of}} Hopkinson Split Pressure Bar Test and Charpy Impact test. The minimum thickness of the wood at which no damage occurs has been evaluated. These thickness are in a reasonable agreement with the mechanical properties determined by the tests mentioned above. The same conclusion is valid for the experiments on the explosive l o a m of wood beams. The results of the pre- numerical simulation of the used tests are also discussed It seems that the obsewed wood specimens behaviour may be explained in terms of the Tsai- Wu strength model. Wood is an anisotropic cellular material such as honeycombs, metal ring systems, polymeric foams and some others. These materials are very convenient for the design of <b>impact</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> and as core materials in lightweight structures.

40|$|Metal foams are {{lightweight}} {{structures and}} have large use in many components acting as <b>impact</b> <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers.</b> They have exceptional mechanical, thermal and acoustic properties. The design or selection of foam for packaging {{is done on}} the basis of impact loads to be sustained or energy to be absorbed. For transportation of nuclear material, metal foams {{can be used as a}} packaging material. It may be noted that apart from other qualification requirements, a package containing nuclear material, has to be certified for drop test. Foam can serve the purpose by providing proper cushioning. Metal foams are still under development and need to be accurately characterized in terms of their mechanical properties as well as cell morphology. The aim of this work is to develop, characterize and model foam using experiments and analysis. Aluminum foam has been developed by powder metallurgy technique and the effect of addition of varying amounts of Mg and Alumina on the strength and energy absorption has been studied. Foams of varying densities have also been developed. The reason for going for higher density is to obtain higher plateau stress. If a package is designed with lower density foam, it may become very bulky and even impractical. The characterization part of the work includes study of porosity distribution, cell wall structure, microscopy, SEM images, etc. Mechanical testing (uniaxial compression) was performed on foam samples to get load deflection curve of foams. Area under a given curve i. e. energy absorbed per unit volume has been compared for various compositions and densities. The analysis part of the work presents effect of specimen size on bulk properties of foam. 2 D honeycomb and 3 D cases have been discussed. To model the porosities, spherical cavities have been assumed. Uniaxial compression cases with different combinations of porosities have been analyzed. The properties like Young’s modulus, plateau stress, Poisson’s ratio, tangent modulus, etc. have been evaluated. The effect of variation in yield strength and tangent modulus of base material on foam has been studied. It appears that if the model is based on uniform porosity distribution, it may lead to lower bound values of physical properties and give conservative result.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades {{increasing}} focus {{has been paid to the}} impact of structures where <b>energy,</b> during the <b>impact</b> event, needs to be absorbed in a controlled manner. This has led to considerable research being carried out on <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers,</b> devices designed to dissipate <b>energy</b> during an <b>impact</b> event and hence protect the structure under consideration. <b>Energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> have found common usage in applications such as vehicles, aircraft, highway barriers and at the base of lift shafts. A type of <b>energy</b> <b>absorber</b> which has received relatively limited attention in the open literature is the tapered rectangular tube. Such a structure is essentially a tube with a rectangular cross-section in which one or more of the sides are inclined to the tube's longitudinal axis. The aim of this thesis was to analyse the <b>impact</b> and <b>energy</b> absorption response of tapered and non-tapered (straight) rectangular tubes. The energy absorption response was quantified for both axial and oblique loading, representative of the loading conditions typically encountered in <b>impact</b> applications. Since <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> are commonly used as components in energy absorbing systems, the response of such a system was analysed which contained either straight or tapered rectangular tubes as the energy absorbing components. This system could typically be used as the front bumper system of a vehicle. Detailed finite element models, validated using experiments and existing theoretical and numerical models, were used to assess the energy absorption response and deformation modes of straight and tapered tubes under the various loading conditions. The manner in which a thin-walled tube deforms is important since it governs its energy absorption response. The results show that the energy absorption response of straight and tapered rectangular tubes can be controlled using their various geometry parameters. In particular, the wall thickness, taper angle and the number of tapered sides can be effectively used as parameters to control the amount of absorbed energy. Tapered rectangular tubes display less sensitivity to inertia effects compared with straight rectangular tubes under impact loading. This is beneficial when the higher crush loads associated with inertia effects need to be reduced. Furthermore, though the energy absorption capacity of thin-walled rectangular tubes diminishes under oblique impact loading, the capacity is more maintained for tapered rectangular tubes compared with non-tapered rectangular tubes. Overall, the results highlight the advantages of using tapered rectangular tubes for absorbing <b>impact</b> <b>energy</b> under axial and oblique loading conditions. Understanding is gained as to how the geometry parameters of such structures can be used to control the absorbed energy. The thesis uses this knowledge to develop design guidelines for the use of straight and tapered rectangular tubes in energy absorbing systems such as for crashworthiness applications. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of analysing thin-walled <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> as part of an energy absorbing system, since the response of the absorbers may be different to when they are treated on their own...|$|R

Thin-walled circular tube plays a vital role as <b>energy</b> <b>absorber</b> due to its high energy absorption capacity.

This work evaluates the capability of concentric circular tubes in reducing the peak load that is exerted to the protected structures and occupants during impact. Clearance and thickness of the structure were varied and different materials such as aluminum alloy, high strength steel and stainless steel were used. The study found that aluminum alloy has great potential to be utilized as energy absorbing system due to its high specific energy absorption capacity and long stroke. For all materials, increasing the clearance between the inner and outer circular tubes resulted in a reduction of peak load and a significant increase of specific energy absorption (SEA).

Only a few micro-mechanical models, as the Gibson model, take into account the density effects. These models could result quite complex to manage because of the need of, at least, a rough analysis of the actual foam structure. Conversely, most of the models used for numerical simulations are phenomenological models and have simple parameter identification based on fitting of experimental data, but they do not account for density effect. Experimental uniaxial compression tests performed for several types of foams, namely EPP, PUR (Bayfill EA), EPS and PPO/PS (Noryl GTX), at different density levels are used in order to identify, with an optimisation procedure devoted to the minimisation of the fitting residual evaluated by the least square method, the parameters of four cellular solid models. The considered models are four: the Gibson model [Gibson LJ, Ashby MF. Cellular solids. Structure and properties. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1997], the Rusch model [Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of flexible foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1969; 13 : 2297 - 311; Rusch KC. Energy-absorbing characteristics of foamed polymers. J Appl Polym Sci 1969; 14 : 1133 - 47; Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of brittle foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1970; 14 : 1263 - 73], a modified version of the Gibson model and a new empirical model. The third and fourth models have been developed in order to better fit the experimental stress-strain curve. The obtained improvements in terms of weighted sum of the squared errors are shown. The experimental data are a good representation of the typical behaviour of these kinds of foams and can be useful for the validation of models and the comparison of their performance. Moreover the large basis of experimental data for different types of foams at different densities could be used for the analysis of the influence of the density on the model parameters. Explicit empirical formulations are proposed to express the dependency of the phenomenological model parameters on the foam density. These relationships permit the identification of whatever density foam derived from the same solid material and with the same micro-structure by means of a minimum set of experimental tests. At the same time the availability of a large quantity of experimental data is helpful to reach a higher level of confidence in the model parameter values. Finally the identified parameters vs. density laws for the considered types of foam could be used in order to assist the design of a given absorber and to find the optimum density for the specific application. Closed form expression for the specific energy W and the efficiency E can be obtained, based on the resulting identified phenomenological model...|$|R

One concept utilizes an inflated air bag, and the other, a convoluted sheet metal bellows. Prototypes of both were designed, built, and tested. Both concepts demonstrated the necessary features of an <b>energy</b> <b>absorber</b> (load-limiter); however, the air bag concept is particularly encouraging because of its light weight. Several seat frame concepts also were investigated {{as a means of}} resisting longitudinal and lateral loads and of guiding the primary vertical stroke of the underseat <b>energy</b> <b>absorber.</b> Further development of a seat system design using the underseat <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> is recommended because they provide greatly enhanced crash survivability as compared with existing general aviation aircraft seats...|$|R
