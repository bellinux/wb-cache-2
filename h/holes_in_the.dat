Established <b>in</b> 2005, Team <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wall offers entrance into {{more than two dozen}} marathons and cycling events, including the New York City Marathon, Boston Marathon and AngelRide cycling event in Connecticut. New Canaan resident and Newman's Own Vice President of Marketing Michael “Mike” Havard ran <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ING New York City Marathon prior to 2004, but in that year he decided to use his participation to raise funds for <b>The</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wall Gang Camp, raising nearly $40,000.

5|$|Since a {{partially}} filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling fore or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; small <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E

The fenestrations on the wing added in the late 18th century differed from those used in earlier parts of the structure, being larger and more regular in appearance.|$|E

He had some {{of the leaders of the}} unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (<b>holes)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E

5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil {{in the place of}} water.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E

5|$|During {{a raid on}} the {{northern}} Italian city of Verona on 12 October 1944, Raw's aircraft was hit by two anti-aircraft shells that destroyed its hydraulics system and an engine, wounded the radio operator and opened 166 <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. Despite this damage, Raw was able to return the B-24 safely to its base. He suffered frostbite to his feet, as damage to the plane's nose caused icy winds to enter the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck and huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, glacier caves were {{discovered}} on the then-smooth glacier surface. Many of these glacier caves were {{big enough to}} explore, like the glacier caves on the summit of Mount Rainier. Most of the glacier caves were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot steam and volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground caves and passageways in the glacier were mapped and studied.|$|E

Most white government officials actually did consider him to be head chief in Minnesota. This was due to his ambition {{to be involved in}} most, if not all, important negotiations and other dealings between the Minnesota Ojibwe and the US government, and that he presented himself in an articulate and stately manner. However, many of the other Ojibwe leaders in Minnesota did not recognize him as the head chief.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and <b>holes)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E

The main buildings of the complex were structurally intact, but the boundary walls had been breached in several places. The building had bullet marks in its cement structure. The two courtyards inside the school were filled with shattered glass and spent rounds. Piles of the girls' bed rolls and stacks of books were piled against walls.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} {{are thought to}} occur in the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E
