40|$|Data are {{presented}} on {{the properties of}} alkali metal and alkaline earth hydrofiuor-ides. Melting, thermal decomposition and interaction of <b>hydrofluorides</b> with various classes of inorganic substances are discussed. Some regularities of changes in thermal properties within the sequences of the above <b>hydrofluorides</b> are established. Future directions of {{research in this field}} are outlined. In view of the increasing interest in the thermal properties of <b>hydrofluorides</b> [1], it appears timely to summarize some results and outline the future prospects in this field. In the present paper, we attempt to survey the data available, aiming at critical analysis, systematization a d generalization. When <b>hydrofluorides</b> are heated, different ypes of behaviour are observed: some <b>hydrofluorides</b> melt congruously, others melt incongruently, while a num-ber of <b>hydrofluorides,</b> including e. g. lithium and sodium bifluorides and alkaline earth <b>hydrofluorides,</b> decompose before melting.

The experiments prove {{the presence of}} molecular fluorine in gas inhibits the process of formation of the sodium <b>hydrofluorides</b> containing more than two molecules of HF. We offered an empirical formula to calculate the estimate of decomposition temperature for alkaline metals <b>hydrofluorides.</b> Settlement decomposition temperature of NaF· 4 HF, is confirmed experimentally...|$|R

This {{white crystalline powder}} is more soluble than the diiodide, but less than the dibromide and the dichloride. No coordinated lead fluorides exist (except the unstable PbF+ cation). The tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is unstable.|$|E
50|$|Techniques for {{preparing}} and handling molten salt were first developed at Oak Ridge National Lab. The purpose of salt purification was to eliminate oxides, sulfur and metal impurities. Oxides {{could result in}} the deposition of solid particles in reactor operation. Sulfur had to be removed because of its corrosive attack on nickel-based alloys at operational temperature. Structural metal such as chromium, nickel, and iron had to be removed for corrosion control. A water content reduction purification stage using HF and helium sweep gas was specified to run at 400 °C. Oxide and sulfur contamination in the salt mixtures were removed using gas sparging of HF - H2 mixture, with the salt heated to 600 °C. Structural metal contamination in the salt mixtures were removed using hydrogen gas sparging, at 700 °C. Solid ammonium <b>hydrofluoride</b> was proposed as a safer alternative for oxide removal.|$|E

40|$|Alkyl and {{aromatic}} amines and their salts were evaluated for inhibitory activity against Streptococcus mutans 6715. Antiplaque ac-tivity {{was correlated with}} the physicochem-ical properties, lipophilicity and basicity. The {{results indicate that the}} basicity of the amine is the primary requirement for activ-ity. The lipophilic character then exerts a modulating effect on amines with the proper pKa values. Alkylamines have been known to lhave anti-bacterial activity for more than 30 years. l More recently, this class of compounds has been shown to have possible applications in the dental area. Initial studies by Green and Waalsh 2 showed that a number of alkylamines with chain lengths of from 12 to 18 carbons were able to retard solubility of tooth enamel subjected to acid treatment. It was postulated that these compounds exerted their effect by forming a protective coating on the tooth. Muhlemann, Schmid, and Konig 3 expanded these studies by testing a isumber of alkylamine hydrofluorides and found these salts were more active than the corresponding alkylamines in retarding enamel dissolution. In addition, dentifrices containing two alkylamine hydrofluorides, hexadecylamine <b>hydrofluoride</b> and dieth-anol aminopropyl-N-etlhanol octadecylamine dihydrofluoride, were found by Marthaler 4 to have a caries-inhibiting effect. Finally Shern, Swing, and Crawforda reported that oleylamine <b>hydrofluoride</b> and diethanol ami-nopropyl-N-ethanol octadecylamine dihydro-This investigation was supported by the Nationa...|$|E

The preparation technique for fluoride fusions uses the process of hydrofluoration of fluorides from lithium and sodium non-aqueous HF with the allocated decomposition of potassium <b>hydrofluoride</b> is given. The processes occurring during the electrolysis of titanic powders from fluoride fusions with the use of tetrafluoride as a reagent for the titanium are described...|$|E
30|$|As pH is {{less than}} pHZPC (Table  1), the net charge on surface of the solid {{activated}} carbon adsorbents is positive due to adsorption of excess H+, which favors adsorption due to columbic attraction. So, {{it is expected that}} acidic conditions favor the fluoride adsorption on {{to the surface of the}} solid activated carbon adsorbent. But according to fluoride speciation, neutral <b>hydrofluoride</b> which has less affinity towards active carbon adsorbents is predominant in the pH at less than 3 (Lagergren 1898), and so, less adsorption is observed at low pH conditions. At low pH values, the fluoride ion converts into neutral HF, and thereby anion exchanging nature is lost.|$|E

40|$|Inductively coupled hydrogen-added {{fluorocarbon}} (CF[4]∕Ar∕H[2] and C[4]F[8]∕Ar∕H[2]) plasmas {{were used}} to etch HfO[2], which is a promising high-dielectric-constant material for the gate of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. The etch rates of HfO[2] and Si were drastically changed depending on the additive-H[2] flow rate in C[4]F[8]∕Ar∕H[2] plasmas. The highly selective etching of HfO[2] over Si {{was done in the}} condition with an additive-H 2 flow rate, where the Si surface was covered with the fluorocarbon polymer. The results of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the carbon content of the selectively etched HfO[2] surface was extremely low compared with the preetched surface contaminated by adventitious hydrocarbon in atmosphere. In the gas phase of the C[4]F[8]∕Ar∕H[2] plasmas, Hf hydrocarbide molecules such as metal-organic compounds and Hf <b>hydrofluoride</b> were detected by a quadrupole mass analyzer. These findings indicate that the fluorine species, carbon, and hydrogen can work to etch HfO[2] and that the carbon species also {{plays an important role in}} selective etching of HfO[2] over Si...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical etching {{of silicon}} in <b>hydrofluoride</b> {{containing}} electrolytes leads to pore formation for low and to electropolishing for high applied current. The transition between pore formation and polishing {{is accompanied by}} a change of the valence of the electrochemical dissolution reaction. The local etching rate at the interface between the semiconductor and the electrolyte is determined by the local current density. We model the transport of reactants and reaction products and thus the current density in both, the semiconductor and the electrolyte. Basic features of the chemical reaction at the interface are summarized in law of mass action type boundary conditions for the transport equations at the interface. We investigate the linear stability of a planar and flat interface. Upon increasing the current density the stability flips either through a change of the valence of the dissolution reaction or by a nonlinear boundary conditions at the interface.

40|$|In {{the present}} communication, we have {{successfully}} synthesized the efficient NLO material of glycine <b>hydrofluoride</b> (GHF) by conventional chemical reaction, and grown the single crystal by adopting slow evaporation solution growth technique. In order to know its suitability for device fabrication, different characterization analyses have been performed. The lattice constants have been determined from powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) method {{and found that}} it crystallizes in orthorhombic crystal system. Its crystalline perfection was evaluated by high-resolution X-ray diffraction technique (HRXRD) and the value of FWHM indicates the presence of low angle structural grain boundaries. Its luminescence behaviour has been analysed by photoluminescence (PL) analysis and found maximum luminescence in the lower wavelength region. Its relative second harmonic generation efficiency was evaluated from Kurtz powder technique. The phase matching angle of GHF was determined by using Nd:YAG laser as a source.

40|$|The {{reactivity}} of a geometrically constrained phosphorus(III) complex bearing the N,N-bis(3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 2 -phenolate) amide pincer ligand towards oxidants and reductants is explored. This compound {{can be readily}} oxidized to the phosphorus(V) dihalo-derivatives P(ONO) X 2 (X = Cl (2), Br (3) and I (4)). Attempts at isolating the analogous difluoride were unsuccessful yielding only the <b>hydrofluoride</b> P(ONO) (H) F (5), however P(ONO) F 2 (6) can be accessed via a halide exchange reaction of 2 with KF. Compound 2 can be employed as a precursor to novel cationic species through chloride ion displacement. Reaction of 2 {{with two or three}} molar equivalents of dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) affords [P(ONO) (Cl) (DMAP) 2]+ (7) and [P(ONO) (DMAP) 3] 2 + (8). Reaction of 2 with 2, 2 '-bipyridine (bipy) affords [P(ONO) (Cl) (bipy) ]+ (9), although this species was only accessible upon addition of a halide abstracting agent. The dicationic tris(pyridine) adduct [P(ONO) (py) 3] 2 + (10) is also accessible by reaction of 4 with pyridine. Oxidation of 1 using oxygen gas proceeds slowly and allows for the observation of two compounds, a mixed valence dimeric phosphorus(III) /phosphorus(V) (11) and the fully oxidized species (12). Finally, reaction of 1 using potassium graphite results in the dimerization of the putative radical anion through formation of a P-P bond to afford [P(ONO) ] 22 - (13).

40|$|U radu su opisani rezultati opažanja pojave teleangiektazije kože u radnika eksponiranih fluoridima i aluminiju. Ukupno je analizirane 122 radnika zaposlenih u elektrolizi aluminija, 119 ljevača aluminija i rezultati su uspoređeni s onima dobivenim u 121 neeksponiranog radnika zaposlenog u prometnoj djelatnosti. Teleangiektazije su utvrđene u 47 % pregledanih radnika elektrolize aluminija, dok je postotak teleangiektazije među ljevačima aluminija bio značajno manji (16 %) i bio sličan onome među radnicima u prometu (14 %). Broj teleangiektazija bio je veći što je trajanje ekspozicije bilo duže. U radnika zaposlenih na elektrolizi aluminija, popratna pojava bila je i svrbež kože s pojačanim znojenjem što je vjerojatno povezano s povećanom ekspozicijom fluoridima, a čini se da je ta pojava reverzibilne prirode jer nestaje nakon kratkotrajnog izbivanja s radnog mjesta. Aluminium potroom {{workers are}} exposed to toxic effects of {{numerous}} technological resources. The most abundant and the most adngerous are fluorine and its compounds, especially <b>hydrofluoride,</b> which has toxic effects upon the body as a whole. Skin teleangiectasias develop {{as a result of}} these effects in a considerable number of workers, whereas heavy sweating and diffuse itching are less common. The paper deals with the results of a study carried out among 122 workers working in the electrolytic extraction of aluminium, 119 aluminium rolling mill workers and 121 non-exposed transportation workers. Teleangiectasias were found in 47 per cent of the examined electrolysis workers. Their percentage in rolling mill workers was significantly smaller (16 %) and comparable to the one in transportation workers (14 %). The percentage of teleangiectasias tended to increase with the duration of exposure. Another symptom present among the electrolysis workers was skin diching and heavy sweating which was probably a result of increased exposure to fluorides. The phenomenon seems to have been reversible because it tended to disappear after a short leave of absence from the workplace. Several features of skin teleangiectasias, which can be observed objectively, indicate that they are fully dependent on the concentration of fluorides released into the work atmosphere as well as on exposure time. Objective observation is not possible in cases of heavy sweating and diffuse Itching but there exist strong indications of the relation with fluorides, especially a spontaneous regression during a 7 - 10 -day sick-leave...|$|E
