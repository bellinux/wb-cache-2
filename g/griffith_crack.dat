50|$|From {{this work}} Griffith {{formulated}} his own theory of brittle fracture, using elastic strain energy concepts. His theory described the behaviour of crack propagation of an elliptical nature {{by considering the}} energy involved. The equation, Griffith's criterion, basically states that when a crack is able to propagate enough to fracture a material, that the gain in the surface energy {{is equal to the}} loss of strain energy, and is considered to be the primary equation to describe brittle fracture. Because the strain energy released is directly proportional to the square of the crack length, it is only when the crack is relatively short that its energy requirement for propagation exceeds the strain energy available to it. Beyond the critical <b>Griffith</b> <b>crack</b> length, the crack becomes dangerous.|$|E

Here, we describe a method for constructing realistic polycrystalline graphene samples for atomistic simulations, and apply it for studying their mechanical properties.

40|$|Biot's {{theory of}} plane strain surface {{instability}} of an isotropic elastic body under initial stress in finite strain is extended to include higher order strain-gradients. Higher order strain-gradients are properly {{introduced in the}} definition of the strain energy density, leading to an anisotropic gradient elasticity theory with surface energy. Accordingly the present theory includes two material lengths characterizing the volume strain energy and the surface energy of the elastic body. The consideration of these two material lengths leads to the occurrence of a boundary layer. This in turn, gives rise to interesting phenomena related to the stability of the half-space, i. e. extra surface instability modes, thin skin effects and significant weakening of the half-space. It is also shown that the appearance of surface instability is associated with the vanishing velocity of propagation of Rayleigh waves. Furthermore, results derived {{in the context of the}} present theory on the dependence of the critical buckling stress of the layer on the thickness, suggest that it can be used effectively for the homogenization of elastic bodies containing periodic arrays of collinear <b>Griffith</b> <b>cracks.</b> (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|We {{consider}} first {{a homogeneous}} fiber bundle model {{where all the}} fibers have got the same stress threshold beyond which all fail simultaneously in absence of noise. At finite noise, the bundle acquires a fatigue behavior due to the noise-induced failure probability at any stress. We solve this dynamics of failure analytically and show that the average failure time of the bundle decreases exponentially as the stress increases. We also determine the avalanche size distribution during such failure and find a power law decay. We compare this fatigue behavior with that obtained phenomenologically for the nucleation of <b>Griffith</b> <b>cracks.</b> Next we study numerically the fatigue behavior of random fiber bundles having simple distributions of individual fiber strengths, at stress less than the bundle's strength (beyond which it fails instantly). The average failure time is again seen to decrease exponentially as the stress increases and the avalanche size distribution shows similar power law decay. These results are also in broad agreement with experimental observations on fatigue in solids.
