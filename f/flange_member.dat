40|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{stresses and}} the stiffness of <b>flange</b> <b>members</b> - I-beams, channels, and Z-bars - were investigated when these members {{were subjected to}} torque with constraint against cross-sectional warping. Measured angles of rotation agreed with corresponding calculated values in which the torsion bending factor of the cross section was involved; the agreement was better for the I-beam and the Z-bar than for the channel. Longitudinal stresses measured at the mid-span were found {{to agree with the}} calculated values that involved unit warping as well as the torsion-bending factors: the channel showed the greatest discrepancy between measured and calculated values. When commonly given expressions for rotations and maximum longitudinal stresses in a twisted I-beam were applied to the channel and to the Z-bar, values were obtained that were in reasonably good agreement with values obtained by the method of torsion-bending constant and unit warping...|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Saurav Shrestha, for the Masters of Science {{degree in}} CIVIL ENGINEERING, {{presented}} on November 22, 2016, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: VERIFICATION OF SHEAR LAG IN LONGITUDINALLY WELDED TENSION MEMBERS. MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. J. Kent Hsiao, Ph. D., P. E. (CA), S. E. (UT) Tension members are used broadly as bracing members in buildings and truss. When double channels or double tees are welded to a gusset plate, stresses are distributed non-uniformly in connected members since {{only a part}} of its cross-section is connected. Shear lag factor describes this phenomenon. The main objective {{of this study is to}} verify shear lag factor of tension steel members with welded connections using the finite element computer analysis and the current design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC 2010). The provision for calculating shear lag factor, U, is given by AISC Specification as 1 -x ̅/L for angles, tees, channels and wide <b>flange</b> tension <b>members.</b> Weld size and length of the weld are the main parameters studied here. The current AISC design provision over-estimates the design tensile strength of double channel shapes. While, for WT Shapes it under-estimates one. The increase in weld size and decrease in weld length shows slight change in shear lag factor. Comparison is also made with the equation proposed by Fortney and Thornton (2012). The equation under-estimates the design tensile strength of both sections...|$|R
40|$|Low cycle fatigue (LCF) life is an {{essential}} aspect in aircraft engine component design, particularly concerning structural members. Realistic finite element modeling is critical in obtaining life predictions that accurately represent fielded parts. One {{of the most challenging}} designs to model accurately is the bolted joint. Bolted joints are critical in aircraft engines as they connect parts and transfer loads. In complex joints, modeling can be difficult and is often simplified with the use of conservative assumptions. Recent commercial experience on structural hardware exposed to high engine temperatures and pressures has indicated that fielded part life for bolted joint members may be significantly higher than simplified finite element modeling, which includes a number of conservative assumptions, would predict. Several factors are critical to the quality of a finite element model of a bolted joint. These factors can significantly impact the results for predicted LCF life and can include: proper geometric matching with the actual hardware, appropriate material properties, realistic boundary conditions and suitable heat transfer. This paper will compare simplified 2 D modeling of a three flange bolted joint with more accurate analysis taking into account flange separation and leakage. This paper will also attempt to demonstrate that leakage assumptions can impact LCF life predictions. For the joint of concern in this paper, flange leakage is shown to reduce thermal gradients and improve LCF life by approximately 50 %. While this paper focuses on only one of the many important facets in bolted joint methodology, effort is made to show the benefit in the inclusion of flange leakage assumptions. The successfully fielded bolted joint considered in this paper will be examined thoroughly with industry standard methodologies. Finite element models and approaches will be compared between an original model, developed for certification of the hardware, and an updated model which uses the latest in modeling technology. The original model, which used beam elements to simulate the bolt in the joint, did not allow for the full range of flange motion and separation witnessed on fielded hardware. As a result, the applied thermal model did not account for any joint separation or leakage. Temperatures at the joint assumed the flanges were essentially fused together. This resulted in increased thermal gradients on the <b>flange</b> <b>members</b> and lower LCF life then would be expected if the joint were allowed to open. The significant thermal strain resulting from these gradients yields lower LCF life than field experience would suggest. In fact, examination of high life hardware shows no sign of fatigue and this hardware seems capable of service of well beyond the original designed life of the part. This is undoubtedly due to the reasonably conservative nature of the analysis. Again, this paper will seek to understand how the assumptions surrounding joint leakage can impact this analysis. More detailed modeling techniques were recently applied that allow for appropriate separation. Complex thermal models were also modified to rationally account for flange leakage. Although these models yield increased LCF life, flange leakage {{is only one of the}} conservative assumptions necessary in bolted joint design. This paper will also touch on how pairing leakage with material property and convection multiplier assumptions can impact predicted life. Although conservatism is imperative in aircraft component design, this paper will attempt to strip away some of the essential moderation and achieve life predictions that more accurately represent fielded hardware. Future work will focus on quantifying how these assumptions impact life analysis as engineers strive to create detailed models of bolted joints...|$|R
40|$|A {{saddle clamp}} {{assembly}} is presented. The assembly {{is comprised of}} a hollow cylindrical body centered about a longitudinal axis and being diametrically split into semicircular top and bottom sections. Each section has a pair of connection flanges, at opposite ends, that project radially outward. A pair of bolts are retained on the top section flanges and are threadable into nuts retained on the bottom section <b>flanges.</b> A base <b>member</b> is anchored to a central underside portion of the bottom clamp body section and has a pair of connection tabs positioned beneath the bottom clamp body section connection flanges {{on opposite sides of}} the clamp axis. A pair of bolts are retained on the base member connection tabs and are threadable into a pair of nuts retainable on a support structure. The connection tab and connection flanges on each side of the clamp body are axially offset in a manner permitting downward installation/removable tool access to the lower bolts past the connection flanges. An elongated retention tether is used to connect the top clamp body section to the balance of the clamp assembly. This prevents loss of the top clamp body section when it is removed from the bottom clamp body section...|$|R
40|$|To reduce dynamic {{response}} of a steel frame of bolted connections, energy dissipation materials may be placed at {{a connection between}} the end plate and column flange or between the angle and <b>member</b> <b>flange.</b> By idealizing bolted connections and energy dissipation materials as rotational spring and damper respectively, this paper derives the mass matrix, stiffness matrix and damping matrix for the frame using a combination of the finite element method and the direct stiffness method. The complex modal analysis is then carried out to determine dynamic characteristics of the frame and to investigate the effects of connection stiffness and rotational damper on natural frequency and modal-damping ratio. By further introducing a generalized pseudo-excitation method, the vibration analysis of the frame subject to earthquake excitation is performed in the frequency domain to see how the connection stiffness and rotational damper affect the seismic performance of the frame. The parametric studies on the example frame with and without the connection dampers show that there is an optimal damper damping coefficient by which the modal-damping ratio of the frame can be considerably increased and the seismic responses, including both lateral displacements and internal forces, can be significantly reduced.

40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of seat backrest of car. Computer aided design and finite element analysis are essential in order to predict accurately for the safety performance of automotive seat in an event of crash. In this work, finite element analysis is {{used to evaluate the}} strength, deflection and maximum stress characteristics of a reference automotive seat in an event of vehicle rear impact. The safety function is measured based on a backrest moment test in accordance with (ECE R- 17) regulations and FMVSS 2 O 7 regulations which is particularly for rear impact. In first stage, the bending moment test of the reference seat backrest frame is done by using a complete model formed on CATIA V 5 R 17 by integrating the major structural components including the connector, vertical side <b>flange,</b> top cross <b>member</b> and supporting plates and the maximum pressure to be apply on top cross member of the seat back frame of seat as per regulation of bending moment test.

40|$|Advanced Cementitious Materials (ACM’s) are {{products}} with materials found in conventional concrete (cement, silica fume, sand, superplasticizer, and water) plus distinctive materials like fibers (steel, carbon) and quartz. The superiority of ACM’s {{in terms of}} strength, ductility, and durability marks it as high potential replacement of traditional concrete. The growing expansion of ACM applications and technical experience gained {{in the last two}} decades in counties including Japan, Germany, Austria, Australia, USA, Denmark, Canada, France, and the Netherlands results in new frontier of cement materials used in infrastructure. The economic feasibility of ACM’s has been demonstrated in footbridges, outstanding bridges, and large pre-cast series. Furthermore safety and durability of ACM’s, especially of Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) has been proven encouraging further research efforts. This research is one part of an ongoing research under the supervision of Professor D. A. Hordijk at the Technical University of Delft on the application of ACM’s in infrastructure. The biggest potential for new infrastructure with ACM’s is in precast girders and thin plates. Throughout utilizing the excellent properties of ACM’s like UHPC, a new lighter- weight, durable, efficient, and adaptable superstructure has been developed in this study to replace the existing traditional design of bridges in the nearby future. One example of the approach taken in this thesis is the benefit of long life-cycle. Due to dense matrix, which prevents the ingress of detrimental substances apply UHPC selectively in the superstructure where it required to sustain high level of durability. Another example of the mindset of this thesis is lightweight design, means material distribution follows the forces distribution. In this thesis the outcome of an extensive material study was an overview of the ACM’s properties, time depended behavior, non-linear behavior, design standards, and field of application. Based on the material study different parameters are analyzed to enhance the understanding of the behavior of structure with ACM. It has been found that structural elements from UHPC are far more efficient then their corresponded traditional concrete structures. The maximum crack size is significantly lower, the slenderness is much higher which result in higher efficiency and reduction of the dead loads. Also the shrinkage and creep of ACM’s is studied. The time-depended imposed deformation of UHPC elements (plate, <b>flange,</b> truss <b>member)</b> with different sizes cause stresses in the model ends up as transverse cracks when the deformation is restrained. Based on the drawn conclusion of the parametric study, the design stage of the new ACM superstructure was initiated complying with requirements & boundaries according to the NEN norms and SETRA (French recommendation for UHPC). The new superstructure is 35 % lighter than traditional solution, with efficient material distribution, built only from concrete, with elegant simple solutions. The low reliability of the fibers as replacement for reinforcement well-thought-out in the design. Some suggestion for future research in the field of modular adaptable superstructure have promising potential as far as applying ACM’s.
