This time-consuming and exhausting work assured only the highest standards in every copy but sometimes delayed the mailing of the issues since Stieglitz would not allow anyone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The visual quality of the gravures was so high that when a set of prints failed to arrive for a Photo-Secession exhibition in Brussels, a selection of gravures from the magazine was hung instead. Most viewers assumed they were looking at the original photographs.|$|E

The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience {{it would be for}} Stan. This is most strongly illustrated {{at the end of the}} episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of [...] "natural causes", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, [...] "Basically, it is OK to kill yourself, but you shouldn't ask someone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and put someone else through the trip." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN staff rated [...] "The Moth" [...] as the 36th best {{episode in}} all of Lost, explaining, [...] "The moth of the episode's title appears both as a metaphorical and {{physical}} symbol of the struggle to find strength within yourself, as Locke explains to Charlie, and {{to take charge of}} your own life without relying on anyone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for you." [...] In a review focusing solely on [...] "The Moth", Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, writing that the episode [...] "does a great job of utilizing screen time for most the major characters on the show", and that [...] "Locke's analogy of 'The Moth' in comparison to Charlie's situation perfectly encapsulates what many of the characters are going through on the island." [...] In a ranking of all of Losts episodes, Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times placed [...] "The Moth" [...] at number 102, complimenting Monaghan and O'Quinn's acting, but criticizing the storyline for containing [...] "nonsensical drug abuse storytelling." [...] "The Moth", along with [...] "Pilot" [...] and [...] "House of the Rising Sun", won a PRISM Award for Charlie's drug storyline.|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1966 Burton and Taylor enjoyed their {{greatest}} on-screen success in Mike Nichols's {{film version of}} Edward Albee's black comedy play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, in which a bitter erudite couple trade vicious barbs {{in front of their}} guests, Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis). Burton wanted Taylor for the character of Martha [...] "to stop everyone else from playing it". He didn't want anyone <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as he thought it could be for Elizabeth what Hamlet was for him. Burton was not the first choice for the role of George. Jack Lemmon was offered the role initially, but when he turned it down, Warner Bros. president Jack L. Warner agreed on Burton and paid him $750,000. Nichols was hired to helm the project at Taylor's request, despite having never directed a film. Albee preferred Bette Davis and James Mason for Martha and George respectively, fearing that the Burtons' strong screen presence would dominate the film. Instead, it proved to be what Alpert described as [...] "the summit of both Richard's and Elizabeth's careers".|$|E
