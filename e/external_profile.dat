40|$|Mémoire de thèseThis PhD thesis in {{computer}} science belongs to the computer supported learning field. Various information on the learner, or {{on a group of}} learner, related to the learning  knowledge, skills, conceptions or behavior  are collected to compose a profile. Existing profiles differ in their intent, content or structure. Moreover, various learning actors are involved and concerned by these profiles. As of today, there is no technical solution in place for reusing these heterogeneous profiles. This PhD thesis aims at providing models and tools allowing the various actors to reuse learners' profiles created by others. In this work, we propose the REPro model (Reuse of <b>External</b> <b>Profiles)</b> to represent the profiles management process. To allow reuse of <b>external</b> <b>profiles,</b> we rewrite them according to a common formalism through a profile modeling language, the PMDL language (Profiles MoDeling Language). We also introduce some transformation operators on the harmonised profiles or their structure, such as the addition of elements to a profile or the creation of a group profile from individual profiles. This approach has been implemented in the EPROFILEA environment (PERLEA project) and experimented in laboratory with teachers. ([URL]...|$|R

40|$|Tries (from retrieval) {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular data {{structures}} on words. They are pertinent to (internal) structure of stored words and several splitting procedures used in diverse contexts. The profile of a trie is a parameter that represents the number of nodes (either internal or external) with the same distance from the root. It is a function of the number of strings stored in a trie and the distance from the root. Several, if not all, trie parameters such as height, size, depth, shortest path, and fill-up level can be uniformly analyzed through the (<b>external</b> and internal) <b>profiles.</b> Although profiles represent one of the most fundamental parameters of tries, they have been hardly studied in the past. The analysis of profiles is surprisingly arduous but once it is carried out it reveals unusually intriguing and interesting behavior. We present a detailed study of the distribution of the profiles in a trie built over random strings generated by a memoryless source. We first derive recurrences satisfied by the expected profiles and solve them asymptotically for all possible ranges of the distance from the root. It appears that profiles of tries exhibit several fascinating phenomena. When moving from the root to the leaves of a trie, the growth of the expected profiles vary. Near the root, the <b>external</b> <b>profiles</b> tend to zero in an exponentially rate, then the rate gradually rises to being logarithmic; the <b>external</b> <b>profiles</b> then abruptly tend to infinity, first logarithmicall...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe current {{evaluation}} of {{heating and cooling}} system performances {{has become a major}} issue in European buildings sector. A promising method for measuring heat pump performances on-field has been previously developed and published. However, the accuracy of the method is strongly dependent on the {{evaluation of}} heat transfer from compressor towards the ambient air. In this paper a developed compressor heat transfer model that couples integral and differential formulations is presented. The model consists of three fundamental steps: thermodynamic analysis of the compression process, detailed thermophysical flow analysis using a CFD software, and finally compressor thermal network analysis consisting of integral equations that describe heat transfer of solid-fluid interfaces. Temperature distribution of the compressor shell is the main output of the model. Internal and <b>external</b> thermal <b>profiles</b> obtained from the numerical model and experimental measurements are compared in one operating condition at two compressor speeds. The RMS errors of <b>external</b> <b>profiles</b> are 3. 20 °C and 1. 96 °C, at 30 rps and 60 rps, respectively. The model can be used to determine the minimum number of surface temperature sensors and their locations on the compressor shell necessary to measure heat losses on-field. More accurate evaluation of compressor heat losses towards the ambient air will improve the accuracy of the performance measurement method...|$|R
50|$|The British Museum Library {{constructed}} a new reading {{room in the}} courtyard of its museum building between 1854 and 1857. The round room, about 42.6 meters in diameter and inspired by the Pantheon, was surmounted by a dome with a ring of windows at the base and an oculus at the top. Hidden iron framing supported a suspended ceiling made of papier-mâché. A cast iron dome was built between 1860 and 1867 over the reading room of the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris. Inspired by the prestigious British Museum reading room, the first iron dome in Canada was built in the early 1870s over the reading room of the Library of Parliament building in Ottawa. Unlike the British Museum room, the library, which opened in 1876, uses the Gothic style. The dome of the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress, also inspired by the reading room dome at the British Museum, was built between 1889 and 1897 in a classical style. It is 100 feet wide and rises 195 feet above the floor on eight piers. The dome has a relatively low <b>external</b> <b>profile</b> to avoid overshadowing the nearby United States Capitol dome.|$|E

The proposed system is based on two thermopiles for {{the identification of the}} internal temperature profile and a thermal camera for the measurement of the <b>external</b> temperature <b>profile.</b> The adopted sensors have been individually calibrated and the measurement uncertainty budget proved that the sensor's instrumental uncertainty is not the actual limiting factor for the system accuracy.

40|$|In 1960, Rényi {{asked for}} the number of random queries {{necessary}} to recover a hidden bijective labeling of n distinct objects. In each query one selects a random subset of labels and asks, what is the set of objects that have these labels? We consider here an asymmetric version of the problem in which in every query an object is chosen with probability p > 1 / 2 and we ignore "inconclusive" queries. We study the number of queries needed to recover the labeling in its entirety (the height), to recover at least one single element (the fillup level), and to recover a randomly chosen element (the typical depth). This problem exhibits several remarkable behaviors: the depth D_n converges in probability but not almost surely and while it satisfies the central limit theorem its local limit theorem doesn't hold; the height H_n and the fillup level F_n exhibit phase transitions with respect to p in the second term. To obtain these results, we take a unified approach via the analysis of the <b>external</b> <b>profile,</b> defined at level k as the number of elements recovered by the kth query. We first establish new precise asymptotic results for the average and variance, and a central limit law, for the <b>external</b> <b>profile</b> in the regime where it grows polynomially with n. We then extend the <b>external</b> <b>profile</b> results to the boundaries of the central region, leading to the solution of our problem for the height and fillup level. As a bonus, our analysis implies novel results for analogous parameters of random PATRICIA tries.
