50|$|Transcript: Q. In {{relation}} to secondary devices, you were aware, I think, during your {{time at the}} scene, in {{relation to}} secondary devices, of the attendance of a Metropolitan Police explosives unit, explosives officer. Is that right?A. That's correct. Q. I think, to use the phrase that you did in your recent statement in which you went over your actions on the day itself, you noted that the box that you considered may have contained a secondary device—which would be the microwave oven, as it transpired to be — was neutralised by the explosives officer. There was a controlled explosion at one stage carried out by explosives officers that day. Was that subsequent—put it another way, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> occurred or that didn't occur while you were there?A. Sorry? Q. The question is probably poorly phrased. Were you aware of a controlled explosion?A. Yes. Q. -- or simply the attendance of explosives officers? A. I heard the controlled explosion, yes. Q. Right. I don't suppose you can provide a time for that, can you, or can you? A. After 30 minutes. That's my guess, I can't know. Q. All right. That's all I want to ask about that.|$|R

40|$|This CD-ROM {{offers an}} account of the Systems and the Information Society Network {{activities}} from November 2000 to October 2002. The network’s origin was an EPSRC/BT sponsored workshop on “Speculative Approaches for Systems Research ” at Slaley Hall in February 1999. One of the outcomes of this workshop was an EPSRC call for proposals to constitute System Networks. SISN was one of the successful proposals. A question posed to participants to the workshop was: “In your area of interest, where are the current limits of what can be made systematic, and what are the limiting factors and challenges to expanding those limits? My interpretation of this question at the time <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> cannot <b>be</b> made systematic was beyond design, and therefore if I wanted to increase the scope for design reflecting upon limiting factors in order to remove them was necessary. This view perhaps appropriate for engineering issues is inadequate when our concerns are social problems and organisational design. For social problems the issue is not producing systematic but systemic knowledge, and in practice this means that the focus of the inquiry is on processes and not on procedures. The complexity of social issues is too large to lend itself to procedural analysis. Self...|$|R
