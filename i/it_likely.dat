Intuitively, it seems that both sentences are of the form: <b>it’s</b> <b>likely</b> that x, where, in the first case, x = Georgia will join the E.

The natural way would be to assume i) that in each case the particular sentence x expresses a proposition, and ii) that sentences of the form <b>it’s</b> <b>likely</b> that x are true iff x expresses a proposition that has a probability greater than one-half. In other words, in general, <b>it’s</b> <b>likely</b> that x is true iff p(x) >. 5. This simple proposal leaves various questions unanswered. For instance, what does it mean for x to have a probability greater than one-half? Is it that the speaker has a credal state that assigns a subjective probability of more than one-half to x, or is that there is a more objective or intersubjective probability at stake? I will put this question aside, though, as a more basic problem confronts the proposal...|$|R

Vision is of little importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom.

5|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{astronomy}} {{has been the}} identification of supernova progenitors. Direct observation of a progenitor would provide useful constraints on supernova models. As of 2006, the search for such a progenitor had been ongoing for longer than a century. Observation of the supernova SN 2011fe has provided useful constraints. Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope did not show a star at {{the position of the}} event, thereby excluding a red giant as the source.

5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make <b>it</b> <b>likely</b> that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Carroll was {{the second}} of four sons born to Daniel Carroll of Aghagurty and Littermurna (c. 1642–1688), a Catholic Irishman whose family lost much of their land and wealth in the English Civil War. The exact place of his birth is unclear, though <b>it</b> <b>likely</b> {{occurred}} near {{the small town of}} Aghagurty that Carroll's father took as part of his name. Some of the family property near Aghagurty was obtained by a friend, Richard Grace, who made Daniel Carroll the head tenant. This action gave the family a livelihood, but the family continued to have limited means compared to their former status. It is likely that Charles Carroll was fostered by the wealthier Grace, who had no son; his greater resources could provide for the child's education.|$|E
5|$|During the 9th century AD, {{the central}} Maya region {{suffered}} major political collapse, {{marked by the}} abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties, and a northward shift in activity. No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but <b>it</b> <b>likely</b> had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought. During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal showed increased activity. Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.|$|E
5|$|England experimented {{briefly with}} milled coinage, but it wasn't until Peter Blondeau brought his method of minting coins {{there in the}} mid-seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country. Blondeau also invented a {{different}} method of marking the edge, which was, according to him, faster and less costly than the method pioneered by Olivier. Though Blondeau's exact method was secretive, numismatists have asserted that <b>it</b> <b>likely</b> resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing. Castaing's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers, which, when a coinage blank was forced between them, imprinted legends or designs on its edge. Castaing's device found favour in France, and it was eventually adopted in other nations, including Britain and the United States, but it was eventually phased out by mechanised minting techniques.|$|E

5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider <b>it</b> <b>likely</b> that they were on the island by 300,000 BP.

5|$|In {{the last}} weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages.

Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon.

5|$|Middle Anglia as a {{political}} entity may have been created by Penda {{as an expression of}} Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to {{have been a number of}} small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered <b>it</b> <b>likely</b> that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.|$|E
