40|$|<b>Dative</b> <b>bonding</b> of {{nitrogen-containing}} heterocycles {{offers a}} strategy for the controlled attachment of aromatic molecules to silicon surfaces. However, while scanning tunneling microscopy shows that pyridine on clean Si(100) initially binds via a <b>dative</b> <b>bonding</b> configuration, slow conversion to a more stable bridging state, destroying the aromaticity, is observed. To restrict adsorption to the <b>dative</b> <b>bonded</b> form, we investigated the interaction of pyridine with isolated reactive sites on partially H-terminated Si(100).

Arginine presents a unique reactivity not previously explored on semiconductor surfaces. Arginine <b>dative</b> <b>bonds</b> to the surface dimer through its imine lone pair, resulting in two adsorbed conformations with adsorption energies of 30. 7 and 33. 8 kcal/mol, significantly stronger than amine <b>dative</b> <b>bonds</b> on Ge(100) - 21. We predict a N-H dissociation and an ene reaction pathway from each of these two conformers with the ene reactions kinetically favored over N-H dissociation of the imine N-H bond and the ene reaction from the cis state favored both kinetically and thermodynamically over the trans ene reaction. Our results for the {{reactions of}} the hydroxyl, carbonyl, and amine functional groups are similar to previous observations for analogous reactions of small organic molecules on Ge(100) - 21. We find that O-H dissociation from the carbonyl <b>dative</b> <b>bonded</b> state is the most favorable pathway.

50|$|A Lewis acid is a {{chemical}} species that contains an empty orbital which {{is capable of}} accepting an electron pair from a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct. A Lewis base, then, is any species that has a filled orbital containing an electron pair which {{is not involved in}} bonding but may form a <b>dative</b> <b>bond</b> with a Lewis acid to form a Lewis adduct.

50|$|The pairs often {{exhibit a}} {{negative}} polar character with their high charge density and are located {{closer to the}} atomic nucleus on average compared to the bonding pair of electrons.

50|$|N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are {{particularly}} common carbene ligands. They are popular {{because they are}} more readily prepared than Schrock and Fischer carbenes. In fact many NHCs are isolated as the free ligand, since they are persistent carbenes. Being strongly stabilized by π-donating substituents, NHCs are powerful σ-donors but π-bonding with the metal is weak. For this reason, the bond between the carbon and the metal center is often represented by a single <b>dative</b> <b>bond,</b> whereas Fischer and Schrock carbenes are usually depicted with double bonds to metal. Continuing with this analogy, NHCs are often compared with trialkylphosphine ligands. Like phosphines, NHCs serve as spectator ligands that influence catalysis through a combination of electronic and steric effects, but they do not directly bind substrates. Carbenes without a metal ligand have been produced in the lab.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the geometry changes involved in the dative bonding from the metal to the Z-ligand complex, the bond itself can differ greatly {{depending on the type}} of buttresses involved. Typical boron-boron bonds are around 1.59 Å. However, due to the <b>dative</b> <b>bond</b> character, the metal-boron bond distance can vary greatly depending on the bonding motif, as well as the various ligands attached to the metal. The boride and borylene motifs tend to have the shortest bonds, typically from 2.00-2.15 Å. Boryl complexes have metal-boron bond distances from 2.45-2.52 Å, and borane complexes have the largest range of metal-boron bond distances, 2.07-2.91 Å. In addition, for the metal base-stabilized borane complexes, the L-ligand that donates to the metal center plays an important role in the metal-boron bond length. Typically, the donor buttresses with sulfur and nitrogen donor ligands have metal-boron bond lengths of 2.05-2.25 Å, and donor buttresses with phosphorus donor ligands have metal-boron bond lengths of 2.17-2.91 Å.|$|E
