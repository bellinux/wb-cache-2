This paper (Part I) aims to have a comparative study between the predictions by codes of practice of BS 8110 and EC 2 and those equations by Darwin et al, Morita and Fuji, Batayneh and Nielsen and results of 164 tests from literature. In this part the case of straight <b>anchorage</b> <b>bars</b> without transverse pressure is considered. Some major parameters including compressive strength, and in terms of ratio of concrete cover to bar diameter and ratio of <b>anchorage</b> length to <b>bar</b> diameter, are addressed in detail. Although various parameters are involved in anchorage design equations, it is observed that every code has merit over the other codes in some aspect. The presented discussion highlights the major areas of differences which need attentions in the future for more investigations.

40|$|Environmental, political, {{and other}} {{considerations}} are {{leading to the}} installation of growing numbers of wind turbines for electricity generation. The present paper concentrates on onshore installations, in which the turbine is placed {{at the end of}} a tower founded on the ground. A serious problem with the foundation or its connection with the tower entails a global failure. A worrying percentage of the towers built before 2010 is ill designed, often with obvious manifestations of the design problem. On the other hand the new designs attempt to optimise material quantities and costs while providing an adequate behaviour under the demands imposed. Principia has gathered considerable experience in both the identification and remediation of the problems experienced by older foundations and the optimisation of new designs. The problem is particularly suitable for numerical simulations with Abaqus and the paper provides the necessary concepts and methodological approach for a reliable and satisfactory solution. More specifically, the concrete geometry is meshed with solid elements. Surface elements including rebar layers are embedded. Other parts of the structure as the steel cylinder, welded studs, <b>anchorage</b> <b>bars,</b> etc. are also included.

Hence the assumption of the development of uniform bond stress along the anchorage length is used to calculate <b>anchorage</b> lengths of <b>bars</b> regardless of the variations in <b>anchorage</b> lengths or <b>bar</b> diameter. This paper describes an ongoing experimental research program in the Centre for Infrastructure Engineering and Safety (CIES) at the University of New South Wales, Sydney aimed at assessing the effects of different structural factors on the anchorage requirements of modern high strength steel reinforcing bars, including the cases of end development and lapped splices of deformed bars in tension. While the fundamental assumption of uniform bond stress development could be justified for relatively shorter anchorage length, the study found that an increase in <b>anchorage</b> length and <b>bar</b> diameter leads to a reduction of average ultimate bond stress which might be due to the non-uniformity in the development of bond stress along the anchorage zone.

40|$|The {{conditions}} {{favorable for}} the development of uniform bond stress in a short anchorage length of a reinforcing bar in a pull-out test are rarely present in practical reinforced concrete (RC) members. The determination of a representative average ultimate bond stress for use when designing the <b>anchorage</b> of tensile <b>bars</b> in RC flexural members is complicated by fluctuating bond stress conditions arising from the presence of cracks crossing the anchorage length. This research is aimed at assessing typical bond failures at the <b>anchorages</b> of tensile <b>bars</b> in RC beams and slabs, and hence determining the representative value of average ultimate bond stress for designing the anchorages. An experimental study was conducted to assess the impacts of monotonically increasing loads on the anchorage requirements of small diameter deformed bars in tension, including the cases of end development and lapped splices. The study revealed that the value of the average ultimate bond stress that develops at failure in an anchorage is not only heavily dependent on the bar diameter, but is also dependent on the anchorage length. The measured value of average ultimate bond stress for shorter anchorage lengths is higher than that for longer anchorage lengths. Analytical modelling based on the structural mechanics of bond has been undertaken to reasonably represent the variable degree of plasticity in the concrete around an anchored bar, and to calculate a more reliable estimate of the average ultimate bond stress. The practical implications of the mean local bond stress-slip models for modelling longer anchorages have been assessed, and the bond-slip models have been recalibrated to account for the variations of average ultimate bond stress for different <b>anchorage</b> lengths and <b>bar</b> diameters. The recalibration of the bond-slip laws for selected RC anchorage specimens has been undertaken according to a viable analytical modelling procedure, and a modified model of the peak bond stress has been proposed for the splitting type bond failures typically observed in RC flexural members. Finite element modelling of the RC anchorage specimens has been undertaken using the recalibrated bond-slip laws and the numerical results are in good agreement with the laboratory measurements. The analytical and numerical modelling provides for rational simulations of the strength and failure modes of <b>anchorages</b> of tensile <b>bars</b> in RC flexural members...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{investigates the}} {{laboratory}} test results of 12 deep beams {{available in the}} literature, where the longitudinal reinforcement was anchored into the support using short straight <b>bar</b> <b>anchorages.</b> Four different specimen groups with three different shear span-to-depth ratios (a/d) were selected {{and most of the}} deep beams failed by strut crushing after yielding of the main longitudinal reinforcement. In order to investigate the behavior of the selected deep beams, an enhanced strut-and-tie model assuming geometrical adaptability (possibility of update in the dimensions of the struts and ties as the main tie starts to yield) is proposed. The analytical results obtained using this approach may be considered as much as accurate than some conducted complex nonlinear analysis considering smeared fixed cracking model and bond-slip behavior. However, an improvement on the effective strength factor of bottle-shaped struts by means of an iterative strut-and-tie model is needed, once the effective strength factor prescribed by NBR 6118 (2014) has shown to be over conservative for all ranges of span-to-depth ratio (a/d) investigated. Finally, the obtained results indicated that short <b>bar</b> <b>anchorages</b> did not seem to influence significantly the shear strength of the deep beams investigated, especially the strength of bottled-shaped struts when appropriate crack control reinforcement is present...|$|R

Conversely, consensus is lacking for implant-supported maxillary overdentures. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the treatment outcome of concepts used for implant-supported maxillary overdentures, focusing on the survival of implants, survival of maxillary overdentures and condition of the implant surrounding hard and soft tissues after a mean observation period of at least 1 year. Material and methods: MEDLINE (1950 to December 2013), EMBASE (1966 to December 2013) and CENTRAL (1800 to December 2013) were searched to identify eligible studies. Two reviewers independently assessed the articles using specific study design-related quality assessment forms. Results: Out of 195 primarily selected articles, 24 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis showed an implant survival rate of 98. 1 % and overdenture survival of 99. 5 % per year in the case of 6 implants and a splinted (<b>bar)</b> <b>anchorage.</b> In the case of 4 implants and a splinted (<b>bar)</b> <b>anchorage,</b> implant survival rate and overdenture survival were 97. 0 % and 96. 9 % per year, respectively.

The condition of the pen-implant tissues was not reported in most studies. Conclusions: An implant-supported maxillary overdenture (all studies 4 implants) provided with a splinted anchorage is accompanied with a high implant and overdenture survival rate (both > 95 % per year), while there is an increased risk of implant loss when 4 implants with a non-splinted anchorage are used...|$|R
