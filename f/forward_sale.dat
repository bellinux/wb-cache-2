40|$|Developers often conduct <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> (or presales) before {{building}} completion to relieve financial risk and burden. However, there are worries that housing units sold {{in this way}} {{will turn out to}} be substandard because developers, who have been paid for the unfinished units, may have incentives to cut costs by lowering the quality. This is a typical moral hazard problem. Nonetheless, <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> have been very popular in some Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. A plausible explanation is that the market has efficiently adjusted the forward price for this potential quality problem according to developers’ reputations. This paper aims to theoretically explain and empirically test (1) whether reputation is reflected in forward prices and (2) whether the expected quality level matches with the actual quality level. Using the <b>forward</b> and spot <b>sales</b> data of the Hong Kong real estate market, we found that even though housing quality was not observable during presales, the market was able to capitalize developers’ reputations into forward prices accurately.

40|$|In many industries, firms pre-order {{input and}} forward sell output {{prior to the}} actual {{production}} period. It is known that forward buying input induces a "Cournot-Stackelberg endogeneity" (both Cournot and Stackelberg outcomes may result in equilibrium) and forward selling output induces a convergence to the Bertrand solution. I analyze the generalized model where firms pre-order input and forward sell output. First, I analyze oligopolists producing homogenous goods, generalize the Cournot-Stackelberg endogeneity to oligopoly, and show that it additionally includes Bertrand in the generalized model. This shows that the "mode of competition" between firms may be entirely endogenous. Second, I consider heterogenous goods in duopolies, which generalizes existing results on <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> of output, and derive the outcome set in general duopolies. This set does not contain the Bertrand solution anymore, but it is well-defined and shows that <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> increase welfare also when goods are complements. ...|$|R

40|$|Cotton exports {{account for}} a {{significant}} share of total commodity exports in francophone African countries, suggesting that these countries have a large exposure to volatility in cotton prices. An analysis of the cotton marketing systems in these countries revealed {{that most of the}} price risk is borne by the parastatals and ultimately by the government. This has led to problems in years of low cotton prices when the government maintained high producer prices. In recent years, these countries introduced some flexibility in their pricing policies to deal with that problem. As a means of managing their cotton price risk, francophone African countries have been using <b>forward</b> <b>sales.</b> Between a quarter and a third of exported cotton has been sold forward before harvesting. <b>Forward</b> <b>sales</b> have provided only limited coverage against price risks. The use of cotton futures and options could increase this risk coverage. Futures and options contracts can also give these countries flexibility in their sales strategies. Countries planning to privatize their cotton marketing sectors should consider the use of futures and options because <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> are likely to decline significantly in a privatized system. The authors examined the feasibility of using New York cotton futures and options contracts as hedging instruments and found that there were benefits of reduced price volatility. Simulations for 1989, 1990, and 1991 show in every case that hedging was effective in reducing price risk from 30 percent to 60 percent.

40|$|There {{has been}} a long-standing {{controversy}} between the authors writing for the law regarding the validity of signing a purchase contract concerning the under-construction buildings. All of the law systems have come to this general agreement that the objective of signing a sale contract is the seller’s transfer of ownership to the buyer. Nevertheless, the law authors have been found having disagreements regarding {{the time and the}} quality that the ownership should be conveyed. The ratification of the <b>forward</b> <b>sale</b> contract of construction law in 2010 almost put an end to such disputes and the <b>forward</b> <b>sale</b> of the buildings under construction was considered as legally correct and seamless. Although there are yet these questions remaining that “when the ownership should be transferred in such transactions? Should the ownership transfer be taking place with formally establishing and signing a <b>forward</b> <b>sale</b> contract of construction and/or via the final title deed transfer after the building has been completely constructed?” The answers provided by the jurists to these two questions differ in many respects, some of whom know the ownership transfer as the direct and immediate effect of sale and some others, besides sale contract, necessitate other law actions to be taken in order for the ownership transfer to be fully actualized. <b>Forward</b> <b>sale</b> contract of a building is not a newly emergent contract and besides the general rules authenticate for the various types of contracts such agreements follow the specific ordains made in that code of law.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{laboratory}} experiment that examines the strategic effect of forward trading on market power in infinitely repeated duopoly games. Two competing theories motivate the experimental design. In their seminal paper, Allaz and Vila (1993) argue that forward trading increases market efficiency as quantity-setting sellers will find themselves in a prisoner's dilemma which limits their ability to exercise market power. Their model predicts that introducing a forward market is analogous to squaring the number of firms. Conversely, Liski and Montero (2006) argue that <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> can soften competition as sellers can sustain collusive profits that could not be achieved in duopolies without <b>forward</b> <b>sales.</b> By strictly imposing forward-spot price parity and by limiting sales choices to pure strategies, the experiment provides a first simultaneous test of these rival theories.

40|$|The {{restructuring}} of power markets has given large generating firms significant price-setting ability.

When entry is considered, and profit opportunity {{is determined by the}} cost of entry, this “curse of market power ” is not just a comparative curse – the long-run profits of large firms can be reduced because of their incentive to push up prices.

Past research has demonstrated that <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> indicate commitment to aggressive behavior to a competing duopolist.

40|$|Many of the {{consequences}} of issuing and purchasing options on publicly traded property have been well understood since Black and Scholes developed a model for option pricing. No model of options, however, provides an accurate economic analysis of the actual transactions that issuers and purchasers engage in when options are bought and sold. One consequenceof this gap in understanding is that the rules for taxing options remain poorly developed. This Article provides a transactional analysis of option sales for the first time. The focus is on covered options, but the analysis also has implications for options in which the underlying property serves merely as a reference obligation and is owned by neither party to the transaction. The analysis demonstrates that while all options have as one component a swap of variable risks or returns on the underlying property for a fixed payment, 2 ̆ 2 in the money 2 ̆ 2 options involve, in addition, a forward transfer of the benefits and correlative burdens of a part of the underlying property that is equivalent to a <b>forward</b> <b>sale</b> of that part. Commentators have not identified this embedded <b>forward</b> <b>sale</b> because the payment arrangement between the parties to the option transaction obscures it; however, a comparison of option prices derived under the Black-Scholes model with the theoretical prices of such forwards demonstrates that the transactions are identical.

Market reforms {{over the past}} 10 years have somewhat succeeded in making domestic and foreign marketing more transparent and competitive. But they have not done much to raise producer prices in real terms or {{as a share of}} the FOB (free on board) price. Maintaining fixed producer prices and marketing costs and margins has encouraged rent-seeking and led to efficiency losses. New reform will fully liberalize the country's export marketing system by eliminating public management of exports.

The new reform is expected to improve producers'incomes. The authors find that the benefits from the new reform (in terms of lower implicit taxes, lower marketing costs and margins, and higher producer prices) will outweigh the costs from eliminating public <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> and fixed producer prices. Results from a general equilibrium model indicate that reducing export taxes would have a small negative effect on aggregate income but would improve income distribution for poorer rural areas.

40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, the {{government}} of Côte d’Ivoire has pursued various reforms to cut its role in domestic and export marketing of cocoa, to create a competitive environment for the private sector, and to raise producer prices. Despite some success, those reforms did not contributed much in raising producer prices. The maintenance of fixed producer prices and marketing costs and margins encouraged rent-seeking activities and led to efficiency losses. In August 1999 the government liberalized the export marketing system by eliminating public management. The reform package included: the end to mandatory export authorization, the abolition of public <b>forward</b> <b>sales,</b> {{and the elimination of}} fixed minimum producer prices and marketing margins. The paper finds that the benefits from liberalizing the export marketing system, in terms of lower marketing costs/margins and higher producer prices, outweigh costs from eliminating the public <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> program and fixed producer prices. Additional results from a general equilibrium model indicate that reducing marketing costs would have had a small negative effect on aggregate welfare, but would have improved income distribution toward poorer rural areas.

40|$|International audienceAbstractForeknowledge about {{sugarcane}} crop size {{can help}} industry members make more informed decisions. There exists many {{different combinations of}} climate variables, seasonal climate prediction indices, and crop model outputs that could prove useful in explaining sugarcane crop size. A data mining method like random forests can cope with generating a prediction model when the search space of predictor variables is large. Research that has investigated the accuracy of random forests to explain annual variation in sugarcane productivity and the suitability of predictor variables generated from crop models coupled with observed climate and seasonal climate prediction indices is limited. Simulated biomass from the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) sugarcane crop model, seasonal climate prediction indices and observed rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, and radiation were supplied as inputs to a random forest classifier and a random forest regression model to explain annual variation in regional sugarcane yields at Tully, in northeastern Australia. Prediction models were generated on 1 September {{in the year before}} harvest, and then on 1 January and 1 March in the year of harvest, which typically runs from June to November. Our results indicated that in 86. 36  % of years, it was possible to determine as early as September in the year before harvest if production would be above the median. This accuracy improved to 95. 45  % by January in the year of harvest. The R-squared of the random forest regression model gradually improved from 66. 76 to 79. 21  % from September in the year before harvest through to March in the same year of harvest. All three sets of variables—(i) simulated biomass indices, (ii) observed climate, and (iii) seasonal climate prediction indices—were typically featured in the models at various stages. Better crop predictions allows farmers to improve their nitrogen management {{to meet the demands of}} the new crop, mill managers could better plan the mill’s labor requirements and maintenance scheduling activities, and marketers can more confidently manage the <b>forward</b> <b>sale</b> and storage of the crop.

40|$|With {{the current}} {{downturn}} in traditional livestock farming investment New Zealand {{a great deal}} of interest is being shown in diversification. It is becoming increasing apparent that few options are open to many farmers. Deer and goats are the two most quoted livestock alternatives, but both are constrained by biological factors. Goats are still in a feral updating phase, but the era of feral deer recovery is possibly over. Those deer required to build the herds of the future are predominately domesticated livestock. This last season (1985 / 86) has seen a dramatic decline in the value of female deer. Controversy exists as to the causes of this decline, as changes to the livestock taxation system were announced during the season. The declared intention of these livestock tax changes has been to obtain neutrality of the taxation system across investment decisions. It is not {{the purpose of this paper}} to address the taxation issue, and we will assume that neutrality has been achieved. Weaner hind prices have declined from a <b>forward</b> <b>sale</b> value of some $ 2, 600 in November 1985 for March to May 1986 delivery to some $ 800 to $ 1, 200 for the same animals at sales over the March-June 1986 period. (See Appendix 1). Declines of weaner values of this nature will have very little impact upon the future time path of the New Zealand deer herd. Until such time as some female weaners are culled for meat, the expansionary phase of the industry will continue. The major impact the decline will have on herd growth is via an expected decline in live capture animals. These animals are becoming less and less important to the New Zealand deer herd, so this effect will be minimal. The most important effect of the decline in values is that of equity. Those farmers in deer farming before the decline in values have seen the value of their animals drop dramatically. For those selling this has been a real loss, for those building up herds the drop has been a substantial paper loss. Gainers have been those buying at the reduced prices and those contemplating purchasing deer. The purpose of this report is to examine the determinants of the economic valuation of female deer and to obtain a valuation to aid those contemplating investing in red deer. Specifically, adult and weaner hind values will be calculated and some sensitivity analyses conducted around the base assumption used...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a T-stage {{model of}} oligopoly where firms build up capacity and conclude <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> in stages t < T, and they choose production quantities in t = T. We {{consider the case}} of n firms with asymmetric marginal costs. In the two-stage game, the set of outcomes is a quasi-hyperrectangle including Cournot, Allaz-Vila, and all two-stage Stackelberg outcomes. In general, it consists of T − 1 such hyperrectangles where the lower bound approaches the Bertrand outcome as T tends to infinity. In the limit, a range of outcomes stretching from Cournot via Stackelberg to Bertrand can result in equilibrium, i. e. the mode of competition is entirely endogenous...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} spot and futures markets for tradeable pollution permits on the potential polluters' compliance decisions. Polluters can buy permits, invest in pollution abatement, or else stop production or source out. We show that stand-alone spot markets induce excessive investment. The introduction of a futures market reduces this incentive to invest, but is not the optimal way to control pollution. A menu of options on pollution rights, possibly coupled with intertemporally bundled sales, yields higher welfare. Because of its focus on long-run demand elasticities and rent extraction, this paper {{can be applied to}} a variety of situations such as demand-side management, public transportation, bypass in telecommunications, or <b>forward</b> <b>sales</b> by a private monopolist...|$|R
