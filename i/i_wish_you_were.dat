500|$|In her memoir, Stanton {{credits the}} Cadys' neighbor, Rev. Simon Hosack, with {{strongly}} encouraging her intellectual development and academic abilities {{at a time}} when she felt these were undervalued by her father. Writing of her brother Eleazar's death in 1826, Stanton remembers trying to comfort her father, saying that she would try to be all her brother had been. At the time, her father's response devastated Stanton: [...] "Oh, my daughter, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a boy!" [...] Understanding from this that her father valued boys above girls, Stanton tearfully took her disappointment to Hosack, whose firm belief in her abilities counteracted her father's perceived disparagement. Hosack went on to teach Stanton Greek, encouraged her to read widely, and ultimately bequeathed to her his own Greek lexicon along with other books. His confirmation of her intellectual abilities strengthened Stanton's confidence and self-esteem.|$|E
500|$|Zaion: <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> Here had a mixed reception. Patrick king of Anime Fringe wrote, [...] "On the surface, it {{may appear}} to be merely another sci-fi mecha action show. However, Zaion {{introduced}} apocalyptic themes similar to those found in Michael Crichton's novel Andromeda Strain and the film 28 Days Later". According to King, the real story of Zaion occurs when Yuuji and Ai develop their relationship, and [...] "we begin to think less of the nanomachine technology and viral invasion of the planet and focus more upon the potential love between these two lonely people, trapped in a labyrinth devoid of an exit". The series was produced with high audio and visual qualities, and was designed with [...] "plausible technical details". King also praised the fitting soundtrack, which was composed by Kenji Kawai and incorporated the sounds of progressive rock.|$|E
500|$|Baseball people revere Hoffman for how {{he treats}} people. [...] Ausmus says Hoffman {{goes out of}} his way to engage fans. [...] Beyond shaking hands or signing autographs, he has {{extended}} conversations with fans who want to talk baseball. When Hoffman passed on the Indians in free agency to stay with the Padres, he still sent an autographed jersey as a baby gift to then-Indians manager Eric Wedge. After Hoffman saved the game to clinch the NL West on the last day of the 1996 season, he called Randy Smith, who traded for Hoffman as Padre GM before moving on to the Detroit Tigers. [...] "Randy, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here", Hoffman said. [...] "You're a part of this." [...] While celebrating his record setting 479th save against the Pirates, Hoffman tipped his cap to the Pittsburgh dugout, particularly Pirates manager Jim Tracy, who managed Hoffman in Cincinnati's Double-A Chattanooga farm team in 1991 after he was converted to a pitcher. Despite losing his role as a closer in his final season, Hoffman took pleasure in supporting his teammates and [...] "not being a cancer just because I was having trouble." ...|$|E

6000|$|Edward {{shook his}} head. [...] "I was merely envying Miss Drewitt her {{possession}} of you," [...] he said, carelessly, [...] "and I {{was just about}} to remark that <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> my uncle too, when she came indoors.
