Since the atomic clocks on board the GPS satellites are precisely tuned, it makes the system a practical engineering application of the scientific theory of relativity in a real-world environment. Placing atomic clocks on artificial satellites to test Einstein's general theory was proposed by Friedwardt Winterberg in 1955.|$|E
25|$|In modern radio systems, {{modulated}} {{signals are}} generated via {{digital signal processing}} (DSP). With DSP many types of AM are possible with software control (including DSB with carrier, SSB suppressed-carrier and independent sideband, or ISB). Calculated digital samples are converted to voltages with a digital-to-analog converter, typically at a frequency less than the desired RF-output frequency. The analog signal must then be shifted in frequency and linearly amplified to the <b>desired</b> <b>frequency</b> and power level (linear amplification must be used to prevent modulation distortion).|$|E

Based on the results, respondents were given a score ranging from 0 to 100 for hetero-eroticism and from 0 to 100 for homo-eroticism.

2500|$|The oldest {{method of}} system {{calibration}} involves {{a set of}} healthy ears, test program material (i.e. music or speech), a graphic equalizer, and last but certainly not least, a familiarity with the proper (or <b>desired)</b> <b>frequency</b> response. One must then listen to the program material through the system, take note of any noticeable frequency changes or resonances, and subtly correct them using the equalizer. [...] Experienced engineers typically use a specific playlist of music that they have become very familiar with every time they calibrate a new system.

2500|$|The mixer will process {{not only}} the desired input signal at fRF, but also all signals present at its inputs. There will be many mixer {{products}} (heterodynes). Most other signals produced by the mixer (such as due to stations at nearby frequencies) can be filtered out in the IF amplifier; that gives the superheterodyne receiver its superior performance. However, if fLO is set to fRF+fIF, then an incoming radio signal at fLO+fIF will also produce a heterodyne at fIF; the frequency [...] fLO+fIF is called the image frequency and must be rejected by the tuned circuits in the RF stage. The image frequency is 2fIF higher (or lower) than the <b>desired</b> <b>frequency</b> fRF, so employing a higher IF frequency fIF increases the receiver's image rejection without requiring additional selectivity in the RF stage.|$|E
2500|$|When the DFT is {{used for}} signal {{spectral}} analysis, the [...] sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal , where t represents time. [...] The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying Fourier transform of x(t) into a discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called aliasing. [...] Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see Nyquist rate) {{is the key to}} minimizing that distortion. [...] Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called leakage, which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT. [...] Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect. [...] When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the <b>desired</b> <b>frequency</b> resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a spectrogram. [...] If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the variance of the spectrum (also called a periodogram in this context); two examples of such techniques are the Welch method and the Bartlett method; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called spectral estimation.|$|E
