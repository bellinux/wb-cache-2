5|$|Sheesh Mahal is flanked {{on either}} side by the Raja Mahal and the Jahangir Mahal. This has royal accommodation, which was built for king Udait Singh. It has now been {{converted}} into a hotel. The interior of this edifice consists of a huge impressive hall with high ceiling, which is the dining hall. Its recent colour scheme renovations are an <b>eyesore.</b> But staying in two of its royal suites on the upper floor, which provide scenic views of the town, gives the guest a feeling of royalty.|$|E
5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst <b>eyesore</b> in Britain in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{sought to}} erect a new {{building}} to address the increasingly cramped conditions of the original Boylston Street campus located near Copley Square, in the increasingly fashionable and crowded Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. Because the stipulations of the original land grant prevented MIT from covering more than two-ninths of its current lot, Walker announced his intention to build the industrial expansion on a lot directly across from the Trinity Church fully intending that expected opposition would lead to favorable terms for selling the proposed land and funding construction elsewhere. With the financial health of the Institute only beginning to recover, Walker began construction on the partially-funded expansion, fully expecting the immediacy of the project to be a persuasive tool for raising its funds. The strategy was only partially successful, as the 1883 building had laboratory facilities that were second-to-none but also lacked the outward architectural grandeur of its sister building and was generally considered an <b>eyesore</b> on its surroundings. Mechanical shops were {{moved out of the}} original Rogers Building in the mid-1880s to accommodate other programs, and in 1892 the Institute began construction on another Copley Square building.|$|E

5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an <b>eyesore</b> given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E

25|$|The old {{elevated}} railways {{proved to}} be an <b>eyesore</b> and required several sharp curves in Boston's twisty streets. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed in 1938 amidst declining ridership and was demolished in 1942. As rail passenger service became increasingly unprofitable, largely due to rising automobile ownership, government takeover prevented abandonment and dismantlement. The MTA purchased and took over subway, elevated, streetcar, and bus operations from the Boston Elevated Railway in 1947.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} 1960s {{passenger terminal}} {{was regarded as}} an <b>eyesore,</b> particularly as it was set in view of Sydney's most prominent waterfront. Since the revitalised building opened in 1988 however, it has been praised as one which increased public usage and access through a successful process of adaptive reuse. As a result, the building was also the winner of several prestigious Australian architectural prizes, presented by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects Awards (now known as the Australian Institute of Architects) in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Although some locals {{welcomed the}} fence and {{regarded}} it as a tourist attraction, others viewed it as an <b>eyesore</b> and embarrassment, and as a potential hazard to drivers using the road. Frequent legal attempts were consequently made to see it removed. These attempts were increased in early 2006, accompanied by a further removal of some 200 of the bras. Some locals claimed {{that a number of}} Japanese students who are being educated in nearby Wanaka could get offended by the fence, as well as many other Asians or South Africans.|$|E
25|$|The bio-toilets, {{which have}} been {{developed}} by the railways and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), have a colony of anaerobic bacteria, kept in a container under the lavatories that convert human waste into water and small amounts of gases. The gases are released into the atmosphere and the water is discharged after chlorination on to the track. The railways currently uses flush toilets in trains, in which human waste is dumped directly on the track. This makes the environment unhygienic and railway stations an <b>eyesore,</b> apart {{from the fact that}} the faecal matter corrodes the tracks.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, the {{trustees}} acquired Mountaintop Farm (also {{known locally as}} Patterson's or Brown's Mountain), the only property that overlooks Monticello.

Jefferson had owned {{it as part of}} his plantation, but it was sold off after his death. In the 20th-century, its farmhouses were divided into apartments for many University of Virginia students. The officials at Monticello had long considered the property an <b>eyesore,</b> and planned to acquire it when it became available.|$|E
25|$|Connection to the River Witham at Brayford was {{hampered}} by the small bore and depth of High Bridge, a medieval structure just below the pool. The channel through it was made deeper in 1795, but John Rennie's plans to demolish it in 1803 were not adopted. The canal was leased to several generations of the Ellison family, who profited from the tolls but failed to maintain it. Although cargos of coal and wool moved to the railway, the carriage of grain continued, and the last commercial operation was in 1972. The Brayford Mere Trust have turned Brayford Pool from a rubbish-filled <b>eyesore</b> into an attractive marina, and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership are opening a footpath and cycleway from Lincoln to Torksey; the section to Saxilby was officially opened on 26 July 2011.|$|E
25|$|Like most Dutch cities, Utrecht has an {{extensive}} network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and popular. 33% of journeys {{within the city}} are by bicycle, {{more than any other}} mode of transport. (Cars, for example, account for 30% of trips). Bicycles are used by young and old people, and by individuals and families. They are mostly traditional, upright, steel-framed bicycles, with few or no gears. There are also barrow bikes, for carrying shopping or small children. As thousands of bicycles are parked haphazardly in town, creating an <b>eyesore</b> but also impeding pedestrians, the City Council decided in 2014 to build the world's largest bicycle parking station, near the Central Railway Station. This 3-floor construction will cost an estimated 48 million Euro and will hold 12,500 bicycles. Completion is foreseen in 2018.|$|E

500|$|After 16 {{years of}} controversy, {{during which the}} half-constructed Mamilla project {{remained}} an <b>eyesore</b> {{in the heart of}} the city, a revised plan drawn up by architect Moshe Safdie incorporating elements of Kroyanker's conservative design moved forward in 1986. The new plan called for the compound to be divided into four areas: an open-air mall with mixed-use 3-6 storey buildings and a multi-storey car park, terraced residential housing, and two hotels along its border with the downtown. The British Ladbroke Group plc, which controls the Hilton Hotels Corporation, won the bid to build the project's main hotel (originally Hilton Jerusalem and now David Citadel Hotel) and its housing, which it built as a luxury gated community named David's Village ( [...] , [...] ).|$|E
500|$|The {{proposal}} sparked {{protests from}} those who felt that the building would be too large and would be an <b>eyesore,</b> as well as worries about the pollution damaging local buildings, parks and even paintings in the nearby Tate Gallery.

He was a noted architect and industrial designer, famous for his design of the red telephone box, and of Liverpool Anglican Cathedral. He {{would go on to}} design another London power station, Bankside, which now houses Tate Modern art gallery.
