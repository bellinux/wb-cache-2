500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] is a groove-laden song, {{following}} a musical setting that is beat-oriented. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press, Simpson said that [...] "Irresistible" [...] is [...] "very sexy, more grown-up. I think you're {{going to see a}} new side of Jessica Simpson." [...] Lyrically, according to Birgisson, the song carries some feminine viewpoints that Sheyne had managed to incorporate through her contribution. Ben Graham, the author of Maximum Jessica Simpson, noted that the lyrics suggest that Simpson finds it hard to keep her famous virginity image intact. This can be inferred from the lines [...] "I know that I'm supposed to make him wait / Let him think I like the chase / But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> say no." [...] Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In pointed out that the verses [...] "I can't stop fanning the fire [...] Now inescapable" [...] refer to an [...] "imminent sexual compromise". [...] "She knows she shouldn't give in, but seems past the point of no return," [...] he explained. However, Taylor stated that lyrically, the song demands for [...] "total fulfillment". The version featured on Lizzie McGuire soundtrack replaces the lyric [...] "When he makes me weak with desire" [...] with [...] "When he makes me want to move closer" [...] and [...] "But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> say no" [...] with [...] "But it's time to stop this emotion / Right now I'm gonna say no." ...|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best. That's what <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> say. That's the whole message of the record." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} redone by the Will & Grace cast as [...] "He's Hot" [...] for the sitcom's soundtrack in 2004 and even {{includes}} vocal samples from Madonna herself. Almost {{all of the}} instrumental part of the song [...] "He's Hot!" [...] uses samples from the original song. The Canadian teen drama , which is known for naming each episode after an 80s hit song, named a two-part episode after [...] "Holiday". In 2006, critics noted strong similarity between [...] "Holiday" [...] and American singer Jessica Simpson's single [...] "A Public Affair". When criticized for its unoriginality, Simpson told MTV: [...] "I think people are ready to hear something that Madonna used to do. We all need to hear that every now and again. It wasn't a sample or something <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> do, but she did influence me and still does today." [...] In 2008, [...] "Holiday" [...] appeared on the video game [...] Kelis often performs a mash-up of her own hit [...] "Milkshake" [...] with [...] "Holiday" [...] live. In 2003, a snippet of the song appeared in the film Rugrats Go Wild, when the families went on their cruise.|$|E

500|$|Heywood {{opened his}} defence on 17 September {{with a long}} {{prepared}} statement read {{by one of his}} lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to [...] "appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his [...] "extreme youth and inexperience" [...] as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that [...] "...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears." [...] Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured [...] "by the least addition to their Number". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: [...] "...on hearing it suggested that I should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> do but was afterwards prevented." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 361, Julian led his army into the {{territory}} of the Alamanni, where he captured their king, Vadomarius. Julian claimed that Vadomarius had been in league with Constantius, encouraging him to raid the borders of Raetia. Julian then divided his forces, sending one column to Raetia, one to northern Italy and the third he led down the Danube on boats. His forces claimed control of Illyricum and his general, Nevitta, secured the pass of Succi into Thrace. He was now well out of his comfort zone and on the road to civil war. (Julian would state in late November that he set off down this road [...] "because, having been declared a public enemy, <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> frighten him [...] merely, and that our quarrel should result in intercourse on more friendly terms...") ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{white man}} was {{reported}} by a lone witness to have walked halfway up to King's door and thrown something against the door before running back to his car and speeding off. Ernest Walters, the lone witness, did not manage to get the license plate number because of how quickly the events transpired. Both of the couple's fathers contacted them over the bombing. The two arrived nearly at the same time, along with her husband's mother and brother. Coretta's father Obie said he would take her and her daughter back to Marion if his son-in-law did not take them to Atlanta. Coretta refused the proclamation, and insisted on staying with her husband. Despite Martin Luther King, Sr. also advocating that she leave with her father, King persisted in leaving with him. Author Octavia B. Vivian wrote [...] "That night Coretta lost her fear of dying. She committed herself more deeply to the freedom struggle, as Martin had done four days previously, when jailed {{for the first time}} in his life." [...] Coretta would later call it the first time she realized [...] "how much <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> Martin in terms of supporting him in what he was doing".|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld {{injected}} {{himself into}} the Chili Peppers/Patton feud taking shots at the Chili Peppers and Kiedis after Flea posted video of him and Koko the gorilla. Gutfeld said, [...] "As most musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the worst band on the planet. The ape is better than Anthony Kiedis. By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it." [...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I {{received a lot of}} flack from fans all over the world. What <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [...] the worst band in the universe. I’d like to apologize for that confusion. I want to explain {{that we live in a}} binary universe," [...] he continued. [...] "You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe." [...] Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying [...] "I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all. It's clearly a funny program. It doesn't faze me, not really. I heard that. It's funny. I don't care. They're all welcome to hate us. God bless 'em." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E
