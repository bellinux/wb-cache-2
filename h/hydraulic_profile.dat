50|$|Given {{that the}} turbine blades {{in a water}} turbine are {{constantly}} exposed to water and dynamic forces, {{they need to have}} high corrosion resistance and strength. The most common material used in overlays on carbon steel runners in water turbines are austenitic steel alloys that have 17% to 20% chromium to increase stability of the film which improves aqueous corrosion resistance. The chromium content in these steel alloys exceed the minimum of 12% chromium required to exhibit some atmospheric corrosion resistance. Having a higher chromium concentration in the steel alloys allows for a much longer lifespan of the turbine blades. Currently, the blades are made of martensitic stainless steels which have high strength compared to austenitic stainless steels by a factor of 2. Besides corrosion resistance and strength as the criteria for material selection, weld-ability and density of the turbine blade. Greater weld-ability allows for easier repair of the turbine blades. This also allows for higher weld quality which results in a better repair. Selecting a material with low density is important to achieve higher efficiency because the lighter blades rotate more easily. The most common material used in Kaplan Turbine blades are stainless steel alloys (SS). The different alloys used are SS(16Cr-5Ni), SS(13Cr-4Ni), SS(13Cr-1Ni). The martensitic stainless steel alloys have high strength, thinner sections than standard carbon steel, and reduced mass that enhances the hydrodynamic flow conditions and efficiency of the water turbine. The SS(13Cr-4Ni) has been shown to have improved erosion resistance at all angles of attack through the process of laser hardening. It is important to minimize erosion in order to maintain high efficiencies because erosion negatively impacts the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profile</b> of the blades which reduces the relative ease to rotate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is very {{important}} that the turbine blade <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profile</b> must be very close to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profile</b> defined during the design and adjusted during the tests with the experimental model, because this fact minimizes the effects of cavitation and vortex. In this work it is studied a viable alternative to solve such problems by using a measuring equipment with computerized software for surface reconstruction, which will create a digitized model of the current status of the blade, allowing the comparison with the mathematical model of the original surface. However, the original geometry is not always available and it must be recreated. Thus, as an alternative, a blade with few damages is selected and a smoothing algorithm is applied to determine the geometry. The proposed smoothing algorithm uses a probabilistic heuristic named simulated annealing. The smoothing algorithm searched for curves that approximate the measured points. The desired curve must be very close to the measured points and must have minimal length. This work develops a structural evaluation methodology and lifetime estimation for a hydrogenerator component using the ANSYS software. The main objective is to identify load regions and critical parameters to be inspected in the component. It predicts the mechanical components structural behavior subjected to different load conditions and the repair influence on the lifetime, in order to optimize the maintenance schedule, increasing its reliability by reducing the need of experimental tests. Optimization techniques are applied to evaluate the turbine wear. Some results are shown with data obtained from Jaguari Hydroelectric powe...|$|E

However, how much typical hydraulic conditions affect the mobilisation of discolouration material has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, results are presented from real turbidity and flow observations collected from three U. K. trunk main networks over a period of two years and 11 months. A methodology is presented that determines whether discolouration material has been mobilised by hydraulic forces and the origin of that material. The methodology found that the majority of turbidity observations over 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) could be linked to a preceding hydraulic force that exceeded an upstream pipe’s hydraulically preconditioned state.

40|$|The {{existing}} of bridge piers in river waterways causes {{backwater effect}} {{where there is}} an increase in water level at upstream. During monsoon season at East Coast of Malaysia, the amount of water flow in upstream of bridge increases due to long duration and high intensity of rainfall that effectively increases the backwater amount. Hence, the excessive amount of backwater resulted in flooding to vicinity area. Therefore, a research was carried on the basis of laboratory experimental as to analyse the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profile</b> and the significance of the backwater effect. The models incorporated different types and arrangements of piers for bridge model in three channel conditions (rectangular, floodplain and embankment channels) in subcritical flow.

Next, the feasibility of municipal wastewater treatment was tested with the SGBR in both lab and pilot scale systems. Finally, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profile</b> was measured for the SGBR to provide a basis for modeling.;Performance between the SGBR and UASB reactor was compared in a side by side study and an experimentally designed study, which was performed to show whether or not differences in performance were statistically significant. Performance excelled for both reactors in terms of soluble COD (sCOD) removal, which exceeded 95 % for the two systems. The statistical study found the SGBR to perform better than the UASB reactor.;Treatment of municipal wastewater was rigorously tested with the SGBR. The first study was conducted at room temperature in a lab scale reactor. Five-day, carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD 5) in SGBR effluent was less than 30 mg/L when the system was operated at HRTs of 48, 24, and 8 hours. A laboratory study of municipal wastewater treatment was performed at 8 and 15 °C to simulate colder weather conditions. During the low temperature study, solids entrapment appeared to be the primary organics removal mechanism for the system. Finally, a pilot reactor was set up to compare performance with initial success of the laboratory study at room temperature. Effluent CBOD 5 concentrations averaged near 50 mg/L and effluent TSS averaged less than 20 mg/L for the pilot scale study.;A tracer study was performed using lithium for the SGBR, and a parallel study performed with a UASB reactor to provide a basis for comparison.

40|$|Mapping {{hydraulic}} hazard is a ticklish procedure as {{it involves}} technical and socio-economic aspects. On {{the one hand}} no dangerous areas should be excluded, {{on the other hand}} {{it is important not to}} exceed, beyond the necessary, with the surface assigned to some use limitations. The availability of a high resolution topographic survey allows nowadays to face this task with innovative procedures, both in the planning (mapping) and in the map validation phases. The latter is the object of the present work. It should be stressed that the described procedure is proposed purely as a preliminary analysis based on topography only, and therefore does not intend in any way to replace more sophisticated analysis methods requiring based on hydraulic modelling. The reference elevation model is a combination of the digital terrain model and the digital building model (DTM+DBM). The option of using the standard surface model (DSM) is not viable, as the DSM represents the vegetation canopy as a solid volume. This has the consequence of unrealistically considering the vegetation as a geometric obstacle to water flow. In some cases the topographic model construction requires the identification and digitization of the principal breaklines, such as river banks, ditches and similar natural or artificial structures. The geometrical and topological procedure for the validation of the hydraulic hazard maps is made of two steps. In the first step the whole area is subdivided into fluvial segments, with length chosen as a reasonable trade-off between the need to keep the hydrographical unit as complete as possible, and the need to separate sections of the river bed with significantly different morphology. Each of these segments is made of a single elongated polygon, whose shape can be quite complex, especially for meandering river sections, where the flow direction (i. e. the potential energy gradient associated to the talweg) is often inverted. In the second step the segments are analysed one by one. Therefore, each segment was split into many reaches, so that within any of them the slope of the piezometric line can be approximated to zero. As a consequence, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profile</b> (open channel flow) in every reach is assumed horizontal both downslope and on the cross-section. Each reach can be seen as a polygon, delimited laterally by the hazard mapping boundaries and longitudinally by two successive cross sections, usually orthogonal to the talweg line. Simulating the progressive increase of the river stage, with a horizontal piezometric line, allow the definition of the stage-area and stage-volume relationships. Such relationships are obtained exclusively by the geometric information as provided by the high resolution elevation model. The maximum flooded area resulting from the simulation is finally compared to the potentially floodable area described by the hazard maps, to give a flooding index for every reach. Index values lower than 100...|$|E

O tratamento de águas residuais não é matéria que conste do atual Plano de Estudos do Mestrado em Engenharia Civil do ISEP. Este facto, associado à premente necessidade de dar resposta às expectativas da Entidade Acolhedora, obrigou a autora a um esforço de aprendizagem significativo. Nesta fase foi executada uma aprofundada pesquisa bibliográfica que permitiu à autora obter o nível de conhecimentos teóricos necessário para a plena integração na Equipa de Projeto. Já integrada na Equipa de Projeto o primeiro trabalho desenvolvido pela autora foi a análise detalhada do Caderno de Encargos e da respetiva Nota Técnica. Seguidamente a autora participou em todas as fases do Projeto tendo, por isso, colaborado na análise do Estudo Geotécnico, no dimensionamento dos órgãos da ETAR, no cálculo do perfil hidráulico, na definição de formas (plantas e cortes) dos órgãos, na elaboração da Lista de Equipamentos e do Mapa de Quantidades e, por último, na elaboração da Memória Descritiva e Justificativa do Processo de Tratamento e Equipamentos.

She has been assigned with the following tasks: i) study of the measurement tools of the wastewater treatment plants; and ii) study of wastewater treatment processes to be installed. Wastewater treatment {{is not part of the}} current study plan in the Civil Engineering Master Course in ISEP. This fact, together with the urgent need to meet the expectations of the company, forced the author to a significant higher learning effort. At this stage, a thorough literature research was performed in order to obtain the level of theoretical knowledge required for full integration in the Project Team. Once integrated in the Project Team, the first project developed by the author was a detailed analysis of the contract documents and the respective Technical Note. Then, the author participated in all phases of the Design and, therefore, collaborated in the analysis of the Geotechnical Study, in the design of the tanks of the WWTP, in the calculation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profile,</b> in the definition of the tank forms, plans and sections and in the elaboration of equipment lists and quantity tables and, finally, in the preparation of descriptive specification and justification texts of the treatment process and equipment.

A depth-averaged two-dimensional numerical model is employed, calibrated with observed data at the field site. From the computational outputs, the occurrence of longitudinally double peak zones of bed shear stress and velocity is found. In particular, at low discharge there exists a primary peak zone of bed shear stress and velocity at the riffle tail {{in line with the}} local maximum energy slope, in addition to a secondary peak at the pool head. As discharge increases, the primary peak at the riffle tail at low flow moves toward the upstream side of the riffle along with the maximum energy slope, showing progressive equalization to the surrounding <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profiles.</b> Concurrently, the secondary peak, due to channel constriction, appears to stand at the pool head, with its value increasing with discharge and approaching or exceeding the primary peak over the riffle. The existence of flow reversal is demonstrated for this specific case, which is attributable to channel constriction at the pool head. A dynamic equilibrium model is presented to reconstruct the pool-riffle morphology. A series of numerical modelling exercises demonstrates that the pool-riffle morphology is more likely produced by shallow flows concentrated with coarse sediments than deep flows laden with low concentrations of fine sediments. It is concluded that channel constriction can, but may not necessarily, lead to competence reversal, depending on channel geometry, flow discharge and sediment properties...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo gain {{insights}} into the natural variation of root hydraulics and its molecular components, genotypic differences related to root water transport and plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) aquaporin expression were investigated in 13 natural accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The hydraulic conductivity of excised root systems (Lp(r)) showed a 2 -fold variation among accessions. The contribution of aquaporins to water uptake was characterized using as inhibitors mercury, propionic acid, and azide. The aquaporin-dependent and -independent paths of water transport made variable contributions to the total hydraulic conductivity in the different accessions. The distinct suberization patterns observed among accessions {{were not correlated with}} their root hydraulic properties. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed, by contrast, a positive overall correlation between Lp(r) and certain highly expressed PIP transcripts. Root hydraulic responses to salt stress were characterized in a subset of five accessions (Bulhary- 1, Catania- 1, Columbia- 0, Dijon-M, and Monte-Tosso- 0 [Mr- 0]). Lp(r) was down-regulated in all accessions except Mr- 0. In Mr- 0 and Catania- 1, cortical cell hydraulic conductivity was unresponsive to salt, whereas it was down-regulated in the three other accessions. By contrast, the five accessions showed qualitatively similar aquaporin transcriptional profiles in response to salt. The overall work provides clues on how hydraulic regulation allows plant adaptation to salt stress. It also shows that a wide range of root <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profiles,</b> as previously reported in various species, can be observed in a single model species. This work paves the way for a quantitative genetics analysis of root hydraulics...|$|R
40|$|Clogging is {{the main}} {{operational}} problem associated with horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs). The measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity {{has proven to be}} a suitable technique to assess clogging within HSSF CWs. The vertical and horizontal distribution of hydraulic conductivity was assessed in two full-scale HSSF CWs by using two different in situ permeameter methods (falling head (FH) and constant head (CH) methods). Horizontal <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>profiles</b> showed that both methods are correlated by a power function (FH= CH 0. 7821, r 2 = 0. 76) within the recorded range of hydraulic conductivities (0 - 70 m/day). However, the FH method provided lower values of hydraulic conductivity than the CH method (one to three times lower). Despite discrepancies between the magnitudes of reported readings, the relative distribution of clogging obtained via both methods was similar. Therefore, both methods are useful when exploring the general distribution of clogging and, specially, the assessment of clogged areas originated from preferential flow paths within full-scale HSSF CWs. Discrepancy between methods (either in magnitude and pattern) aroused from the vertical <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>profiles</b> under highly clogged conditions. It is believed this can be attributed to procedural differences between the methods, such as the method of permeameter insertion (twisting versus hammering). Results from both methods suggest that clogging develops along the shortest distance between water input and output. Results also evidence that the design and maintenance of inlet distributors and outlet collectors appear to have a great influence on the pattern of clogging, and hence the asset lifetime of HSSF CWs...|$|R

40|$|The Glane River is a French stream highly artificialized. It {{displays}} 20 transversal structures inducing rupture in the continuity. In {{the context}} of the Water Framework Directive, several restoration works have been scheduled between 2014 and 2016. A station in the head of the watershed including 3 successive weirs intended for removal has been selected for evaluating the river response to incoming changes. A specific methodology has been applied in order to assess the morphological evolution of the stream. It includes regular measurements of transversal and longitudinal geometric key values, and granulometric composition. The serial of measurements made before the first removal have helped to highlight reductions of sediment and biological communities continuity across the linear implied in the study. Particular degradation among diversity of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profiles</b> and size classes of substrate have been identified in areas between weirs. The gradual decrease of the hydrological dynamics and the proportion of lotic fish species from downstream to upstream were observed. The first weir removal was conducted in July 2014, inducing direct release of large amounts of fines from the reservoir. Campaigns have been made between 3 and 5 months after the beginning of works upstream and downstream of the removed structure. A gradual deposition of fine sediments has been observed downstream while their withdrawal from the reservoir resulted in the emergence of coarser material. The most significant observation of these mid-term measurements is the channelization of the upstream linear in parallel with the reduction of the bed width and augmentation of lotic profiles encountered...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the disposal of short-lived low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste in a near-surface disposal facility in Dessel (Belgium), extensive characterization of the hydraulic conductivity (K) in the shallow Neogene aquifer has been performed at a regional scale. In the last few years the small-scale heterogeneity has been additionally characterized by outcrop analogue, hydraulic direct push, and borehole core air permeameter studies. The gathered data now include a) more than 350 hydraulic conductivity measurements on samples from 8 cored boreholes, mostly reaching depths of 50 m and data at 2 m intervals, b) more than 5000 air permeability measurements on the same borehole cores, c) more than 250 cone penetration tests (CPTs) with depths down to 40 m and data at 2 cm intervals, d) over 100 dissipation tests performed during the CPT campaigns, e) 17 direct push injections loggings, 6 <b>hydraulic</b> <b>profiling</b> tool logs, and 6 direct push slug tests, f) several hundreds of air permeability measurements on outcrop analogues of the aquifer sediments, and g) numerous grain size analyses. The current study aims to quantify the heterogeneity of K from the centimetre- to the kilometre-scale and to check the compatibility of the spatial variability revealed by the different datasets. This is achieved through gathering all K values (either direct measurements, calibrated relative K values, or K estimates from secondary data), and the use of variography to quantify spatial variability in terms of two-points geostatistics. The results are discussed, and the main differences between the different data sources are explained. In a final step, different multi-scale variogram models are proposed for capturing the main characteristics of multi-scale variability within the shallow Neogene aquifer in Belgium...|$|R
40|$|Heat as a tracer {{was used}} to {{estimate}} one-dimensional vertical infiltration at three study sites in Rillito Creek in Tucson, Arizona, by inversely determining the vertical saturated <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>profiles</b> beneath the streambed.

Results from the uppermost site indicated that a significant physical change had occurred at the streambed {{between the first and second}} model periods that lowered the hydraulic conductivity and the infiltration rate by up to four orders of magnitude. A similar change in conductivity is suggested by the simulation results from the two lower sites; however, these results indicated that changes in hydraulic conductivity and the infiltration rates occurred during a single flow event...|$|R
