5|$|During the Early Archaic period {{regional}} {{variation in}} point forms is seen <b>in</b> <b>Iowa,</b> and Indians adapted to more localized forms of {{hunting and gathering}} while probably maintaining seasonal movements from camp to camp. Common stone tool types are Corner-notched St. Charles points and Thebes Knives. Soon Hardin and Kirk points appear <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> as well. Excavated Early Archaic sites <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> include the Soldow Site, Horizons IIIa and II of the Cherokee Sewer Site, and the Simonsen Site.|$|E
5|$|During the Woodland period, many American Indians <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> shifted {{away from}} hunting and {{gathering}} and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important. Ceramics, the bow and arrow, burial mounds, and evidence {{of political and social}} hierarchy became common at Woodland sites <b>in</b> <b>Iowa.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Archaic is {{the longest}} period of Iowa prehistory, lasting about 8,000 years. Overall, populations appear to have {{increased}} <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> during the Archaic, despite a changing climate. During this time American Indians transitioned from highly mobile hunters and gatherers with large ranges towards a focus on local resources and ecosystems. Domesticated plants appeared <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> {{towards the end of}} the Archaic.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists {{have studied}} the {{prehistory}} of Iowa since the mid-19th century, when large American Indian mounds were first observed along the Mississippi. Early archaeologists such as S.V. Proudfit and Theodore Lewis documented large sites such as earthworks, mounds, and earthlodges. Truly systematic recording of Iowa sites began with Charles R. Keyes and Ellison Orr’s surveys and excavations beginning in the 1920s. Documenting hundreds of sites, often just before they disappeared under the plow, Keyes’ and Orr’s work {{led to the formation}} of the Iowa Archaeological Survey, the Iowa Archeological Society, and the designation of Effigy Mounds National Monument. After their deaths in 1951, the Survey was disbanded, and their efforts were continued by the University of Iowa’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology, which formed the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) in 1959. The OSA maintains an extensive list of more than 23,000 recorded archaeological sites <b>in</b> <b>Iowa,</b> and conducts survey and excavation across the state. Other institutions conducting archaeological research <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> include the State Historical Society of Iowa, the Iowa Archeological Society, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, Grinnell College, Luther College, and private archaeological firms. Professional archaeologists <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> are represented by the Association of Iowa Archaeologists. Iowa archaeology grew dramatically beginning in the 1960s with the introduction of Cultural Resources Management legislation that required archaeological survey and excavation at many federal projects <b>in</b> <b>Iowa.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements <b>in</b> <b>Iowa.</b> However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E

5|$|In the Late Archaic {{the climate}} became {{more similar to}} modern {{with the end of}} the Hypsithermal. The number of Late Archaic Sites {{increased}} <b>in</b> <b>Iowa,</b> perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies. The Late Archaic sees the first indication of mound building <b>in</b> <b>Iowa,</b> as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants, and large, long-term settlements. The Red Ocher Culture appeared in northeast Iowa, associated with copper artifacts and mound building. Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa, some showing the gradual adaptation of cultigens, including squash, little barley, marsh elder, and barnyard grass. Sites with evidence for early cultigens <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> include the Edgewater Park Site in Coralville, the Gast Spring Site, and the Sand Run Slough West Site. In western Iowa, Late Archaic sites are common, however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before, and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants.|$|E
