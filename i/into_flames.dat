5|$|While {{the freeway}} was under {{construction}} in 1983, {{it was discovered that}} it ran through Native American burial grounds in Deptford. This revelation led to unsuccessful lawsuits to cease construction of the route.

The agents search for Jacob, finding him in a synagogue with the hanged body of the last remaining boy. Although Jacob admits to both of the murders, Mulder believes that a Golem—a creature from Jewish mysticism—is the true murderer.|$|E
5|$|Xigbar's {{telescopic}} sight was {{changed from a}} crosshair and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles. An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, {{which is used to}} shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun. The death of Organization XIII member Axel was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E

5|$|In 1922 the American film Hope, {{directed}} by Legaren à Hiller and starring Mary Astor and Ralph Faulkner, {{was based on}} the imagined origins of the painting. In it Joan, a fisherman's wife, is treated poorly by the rest of her village in her husband's absence, and has only the hope of his return to cling to. His ship returns but bursts <b>into</b> <b>flames,</b> before he is washed up safe and well on shore. The story is interspersed with scenes of Watts explaining the story to a model, and with stills of the painting. By the time the film was released, the fad for prints of Hope was long over, to the extent that references to it had become verbal shorthand for authors and artists wanting to indicate that a scene was set in the 1900s–1910s. Watts's reputation continued to fade as artistic tastes changed, and in 1938 the Tate Gallery removed their collection of Watts's works from permanent display.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, JG51 was {{transferred}} East {{to take part}} in Operation Barbarossa with 1 staffel. On the morning of the 22 June, Bär and his wingman Oberfeldwebel Heinrich Höfemeier were escorting a damaged Heinkel He 111 over German lines when they made contact with 18 Tupolev SB bombers from the 39 SBAP (Skorostnoy Bombardirovohchnyy Aviatsionny Polk—high speed bomber aviation regiment) and 10 SAD (Smeshannaya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya—composite aviation regiment). The German pilots attacked; Höfemeier claimed four, Bär two—though the former was wounded in the arm. The Germans noted the vulnerability of the Soviet aircraft which lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and had a propensity to burst <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b> More JG51 Bf 109s appeared and claimed six more. None of the 39 SBAP or 10 SAD aircraft returned home. Bär had achieved his 19th and 20th victory.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{locates the}} elderly man and confronts him; however, he injects {{her with the}} {{chemical}} after explaining that Lisa {{will be responsible for}} the coming future. Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa. Jason confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where the old man has erased all of Jason's files from the computer. The old man tells Jason that the success of their research made time travel possible, but also plunged the world into chaos. Jason lunges at the old man, choking him. Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man bursts <b>into</b> <b>flames,</b> and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E

5|$|On September 2009, Glickenhaus {{announced}} {{his intention to}} race {{a new version of}} the P4/5 in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring. The car, called the P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis, VIN and drivetrain. On May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races. The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring (after bursting <b>into</b> <b>flames)</b> and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b> The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of air-to-air {{exercises}} and practice the Wing undertook a Circus operation on 3 August 1941. In the evening the Wing crossed out over Manston at 18,000ft and then dropped to 13,000ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf 109Fs were sighted one thousand feet above and in front travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf 109 into cloud while following the Bf 109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another burst from 200 yards the Bf 109 burst <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b> He sighted another formation of 18 Bf 109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the tail unit of one which went down vertically and into a cloud layer at 2,000ft at which point contact was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. The operation elevated his tally to 7. The day was best remembered in Fighter Command {{for the loss of}} Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock who was shot down by ground-fire in the morning patrol.|$|E
