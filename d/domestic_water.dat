5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of <b>domestic</b> <b>water</b> buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E
5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the <b>domestic</b> <b>water</b> buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{independence}} resumption of Latvia in 1990, water {{consumption in the}} country has decreased few times. Accordingly, <b>domestic</b> hot <b>water</b> consumption in the household sector reduced. Water consumption decrease was caused by extensive water consumption meters’ installation, increased heat supply tariffs, and <b>domestic</b> hot <b>water</b> savings activities. In this paper there are presented the results of <b>domestic</b> hot <b>water</b> consumption measurements, which were done in a dwelling house in Riga. The results were worked up using the prescribed formulas of building normative LBN 221 - 98.

25|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of Irish Water, all water charges for domestic use in urban areas in Ireland were paid for by general taxation. Domestic use is defined as drinking, washing, heating and sanitation. There were approximately 1.35million <b>domestic</b> <b>water</b> connections served by public water supplies. Members of rural group water schemes usually pay for <b>domestic</b> <b>water</b> and wastewater services. As part of a Programme of Assistance agreed with the EC-ECB-IMF 'troika' in November 2010, the Fianna Fáil-Green Party government committed to introducing <b>domestic</b> <b>water</b> charges in 2012/2013. This followed a commitment made in the Renewed Programme for Government, published in October 2009, to introduce charges based on a system of a free allowance per household, with charges on usage above the allowance. One month before the government's agreement with the troika,the administration's 'National Recovery Plan 2010–2014' stated that metering would form part of charges and be introduced by 2014. <b>Domestic</b> <b>water</b> charges, a requirement under the EC-ECB-IMF's Programme of Assistance, were to be introduced in Quarter 4 2014, with households receiving their first bills in Quarter 1 2015.

Recently <b>domestic</b> solar hot <b>water</b> systems have been economically identified as an option in commercial applications. Commercial building owners {{in the corporate world}} generally base decisions on economic reasons, therefore this research investigates the need to economically optimise the size of <b>domestic</b> solar hot <b>water</b> systems for eight separate commercial applications within Christchurch. All modelling has been completed using Consol’s heat pipe evacuator tube panels orientated North at an angle of 45 degrees. The TRNSYS simulation program is utilised to model the <b>domestic</b> solar hot <b>water</b> system in the eight commercial applications. Each commercial application has a unique <b>domestic</b> hot <b>water</b> load profile. The heat pipe evacuated tube is locally available from Consol New Zealand Limited. A common proportional relationship was utilised to define the relationship between the size of the storage tank and area of solar panels, which enables a range of <b>domestic</b> solar hot <b>water</b> system sizes {{to be used in the}} simulations. A proportional relationship is identified to economically optimise the size of commercial <b>domestic</b> solar hot <b>water</b> systems in Christchurch. This proportional relationship enables engineers and designers of commercial <b>domestic</b> hot <b>water</b> systems to confidently implement <b>domestic</b> solar hot <b>water</b> system designs. This provides an economically optimal solution in regards to the size of the solar component that should be installed during the rebuild of Christchurch...|$|R

The origins of the <b>domestic</b> <b>water</b> buffalo types are debated, although results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the swamp type may have originated in China and was domesticated about 4,000 years ago, while the river type may have originated from India and was domesticated about 5,000 years ago.

Four house tap water samples from residents, whose contact lens storage cases had been contaminated by Acanthamoeba, were also found to be contaminated with Acanthamoeba.

For non-domestic users, the policy required the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from these users. It also foresaw the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006. Domestic operational costs were to be paid for through a local government fund, and capital costs were to be financed through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.|$|E
