40|$|A {{few years}} ago, {{chickens}} were dying right- and left on farms with a disease called range paralysis, <b>fowl</b> <b>paralysis</b> and various technical names. At {{that time we}} little understood the diseaseâ€”its cause or {{what to do about}} it. Probably in the last 10 years this disease has caused more losses to the poultry raiser than any other single disease of adult poultry...|$|E
40|$|The {{filterable}} {{agent that}} will be described here produces in chickens leukosis of types that hitherto have not been successfully transmitted, namely lymphomatosis and myelomatosis, sometimes with leukemia and sometimes with tumor formation. In many chickens inoculated with this strain leukosis {{was associated with the}} formation of tumors that histologically resembled endothelioma. Infiltration of nerves often occurred among chickens inoculated with this strain, and in a few birds paresis or paralysis of legs or wings was noted. Thus this transmissible strain possesses characteristics ascribed to three different types of filterable agents; namely, (a) the agent of Ellermann and Bang (1) that causes leukosis of chickens; (b) the agents of Rous that stimulate connective tissues of chickens to neoplastic growth and may cause endothelioma (Begg (2)); and (c) the agent of Pappenheimer, Dunn, and Cone (3) that produces <b>fowl</b> <b>paralysis.</b> In this article evidence will be presented to show that lymphomatosis, myelomatosis, endothelioma, and <b>fowl</b> <b>paralysis</b> occurring among the passages of this strain are caused by filterable agents. In the paper that follows, the relationship of these diseases and the anatomical lesions associated with them will be discussed. The available evidence is in favor of the assumption that a single agent can produce lymphomatosis, with or without paralysis, myelomatosis, and endothelioma. * This investigation has been supported by a Fund for the Study of Leukemia...|$|E
40|$|THE U. S. Regional Poultry Research Laboratory {{has as its}} {{objective}} {{the improvement}} of viability in poultry. In formulating the research program of the laboratory {{it was determined that}} the avian-leukosis complex, of which <b>fowl</b> <b>paralysis</b> is a common manifestation, con-stitutes the most hazardous disease prob-lem confronting the poultry industry. After due delibertaion a coordinated program of research in genetics, pathology, nutrition, and management was recommended as the most likely means of determining the cause of the disease complex, its method of trans-mission, and the development of measures for its control. In developing studies of th...|$|E

The terminology in many instances has been very satisfactory for some expres-sions of the disease but not satisfactory for a nomenclature of the complex as a whole.

40|$|THE {{relationship}} between the iris color of the dam and mortality of her progeny is of considerable interest to the poultry breeder. This interest is prompted {{by the fact that}} an association of abnormal iris color of the dam and a high rate of mortality of the progeny would offer an immediate, practical means of reducing mortality. One of the most comprehensive studies of the subject has been that of Lee and Wilcke (1941). They demonstrated that females with pearl-gray irises which were irregular at the pupillary border gave progeny which developed symptoms of <b>fowl</b> <b>paralysis</b> more frequently than did the dams wit...|$|E
40|$|CONSIDERABLE {{work has}} been done {{recently}} on <b>fowl</b> <b>paralysis</b> in an at-tempt to understand the disease and to de-termine its cause. Since coccidial infection is of such common occurrence in cases of paralysis, it is the opinion of many that it is the cause or a contributing factor {{in the development of the}} disease. Since the writer has had the opportunity to observe rather closely a number of cases while carrying out artificial inoculations with coccidia un-der controlled conditions, it has seemed ad-visable to report certain data which have accumulated with the hope that it will add to the information about this disease and especially clarify the question as to its re...|$|E
40|$|Two {{chickens}} with Marek's disease (MD) (<b>Fowl</b> <b>paralysis)</b> and one apparently normal chicken, {{which were}} diagnosed by clinical features and histopathology, were observed by electron microscopy. One bird with lymphoid leukosis was also examined for comparison. Association and multiplication of virus particles (VP) in the peripheral nerves and the skeletal muscles accompanied by degenerative changes were unexpectedly observed. Mature VP measuring from 80 to 100 mp in diameter, covered with double membranes (inner and outer), had an electron opaque central nucleoid measuring 40 to 55 mp and had numerous peripheral knobs {{on the outside}} of the particles. In the cytoplasm, there was viroplasm consisting of immature small VP (virospheres, from 70 to 80 mp) surrounded by granules of the size of ribosomes (virosomes), viral matrix consisting of aggregates of electron opaque granules, and gray bodies, involving a few VP, surrounded by a single membrane. These VP matured by budding from the cytoplasmic membrane. Numerous VP were found in the lumen and intercellular spaces of the capillaries, in the endothelial cells, in the pericytes, in the intracytoplasmic vesicles of emigratin...|$|E
40|$|ONE {{method of}} {{decreasing}} mortality in adult chickens is by breeding strains which {{are resistant to}} diseases and disor-ders. An experiment to determine the feasi-bility of this method was started at the' Alabama Experiment Station in 1935 ^ The results of the first 6 years of work are re-ported in this paper. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE The objective of the experiment, as outlined in 193 S, was the development of strains of fowls resistant primarily to <b>fowl</b> <b>paralysis,</b> since at that time paralysis ac-counted for {{a large part of}} the adult mor-tality. Later, when mortality from paraly-sis was reduced considerably, the objec-tive was expanded to include resistance to other diseases and disorders. Selection oj breeders for resistant strain. The breeding females for the 1935 season consisted of hens two years of age or older and pullets. None of these were progeny tested and most of them were not pedi-greed. They were mated to old cocks and cockerels. In 1936, the old hens were used again in the breeding pens and likewise pullets which were sib 1 tested for a period of four to six months. Adult mortality for those hatched in 1935 and 1936 was very high and consequently few desirable fami-lies were developed. In succeeding gen-erations, however, an increasing number of progeny-tested and sib-tested birds was available and only those with better tha...|$|E
40|$|IT HAS {{been known}} for a long time that {{resistance}} to infectious diseases, in many cases, has been dependent upon hereditable differences. Indeed Hypocrates stressed the fact that some individuals are endowed with a greater constitutional re-sistance than others. Today practicing physicians regard certain families of in-dividuals among the human race as pos-sessing marked ability to "ward off " cer-tain prevalent infections. Mohr (1934) in "Heredity and Disease " discusses this phase of heredity and resistance to in-fections affecting the human race in a most interesting manner. The resistance of sheep and horses to tuberculosis and similar types of resistance among various other domestic animals has been known to exist for a long time. Hereditary resistance to abortion was found to exist among cer-tain strains of rabbits at the Wisconsin Station. Perhaps the first scientific report of hereditary resistance to a specific poultry disease was that of Frateur, who reported at the 1924 World's Poultry Congress upon a probable genetic basis of resistance to fowl diphtheria. At the 1930 Congress, Card and Roberts reported that resistance to pullorum disease existed in the fowl and their subsequent work has given us a very careful genetic analysis of the prob-lem. The Iowa investigators, in numerous publications from 1928 up to the present, have reported on hereditable resistance to typhoid. The Kansas workers have re-ported a possible genetic difference in re-sistance to roundworm infestation, while the Cornell workers have reported breed differences in resistance to vitamin Bl de-ficiency. Inheritance of resistance to <b>fowl</b> <b>paralysis</b> was reported by Asmundson and Biely in 1932. Their work showed that differences in susceptibility to paralysis existed among the progeny of different families. Evidence substantiating their findings and indicating the possibility of breeding for resistance to the paralysis complex has been added particularly b...|$|E
