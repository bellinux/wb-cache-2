5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Above all, {{he possessed}} a {{resolute}} decision of character, which, however unfortunately {{it may have}} operated under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind, and was prepared to abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to bespeak <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.|$|E

5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, and some have been punished <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of the church was pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area. Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated that the church was in compliance with local laws.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} {{happening}} in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E
5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

5|$|Craterellus pusio {{was first}} {{described}} by Miles Joseph Berkeley in an 1859 publication by James Hooker. Otto Kuntze transferred {{it to the}} genus Merulius in 1891. Until the 1960s, however, it was known as Craterellus multiplex, a species described by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke and George Edward Massee in 1889, and moved to Cantharellus by Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1920. In 1958, British mycologist R.W.G. Dennis collected the species in Venezuela during an expedition financed by the Percy Sladen Memorial Trust. Derek Reid, attempting to identify the species, rediscovered Berkeley's name, which had priority, and described the new genus Podoserpula <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1963 while simultaneously describing four varieties of it.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake was accidentally {{discovered}} by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers {{arrived at the}} lake in the 1790s and 1800s. Early industries in the area included lumbering and farming, but it became well known as a summer resort {{in the latter part}} of the 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, {{while working}} on Ghare Baire (Home and the World), Ray {{suffered}} a heart attack; it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining 9 years of his life. Ghare Baire was completed in 1984 {{with the help of}} Ray's son (who operated the camera from then on) because of his health condition. He had wanted to film this Tagore novel on the dangers of fervent nationalism for a long time, and wrote a first draft of a script <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s. In spite of rough patches due to Ray's illness, the film did receive some critical acclaim. It had the first kiss fully portrayed in Ray's films. In 1987, he made a documentary on his father, Sukumar Ray.|$|E

5|$|Morris oversaw {{production}} of the League's monthly—soon to become weekly—newspaper, Commonweal, serving as its editor for six years, during which time he kept it financially afloat. First published in February 1885, it would contain contributions from such prominent socialists as Engels, Shaw, Paul Lafargue, Wilhelm Liebknecht, and Karl Kautsky, with Morris also regularly writing articles and poems <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> Commonweal he serialised a 13-episode poem, The Pilgrims of Hope, which was set {{in the period of}} the Paris Commune. From November 1886 to January 1887, Morris' novel, A Dream of John Ball, was serialised in Commonweal. Set in Kent during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, it contained strong socialist themes although proved popular among those of different ideological viewpoints, resulting in its publication in book form by Reeves and Turner in 1888. Shortly after, a collection of Morris' essays, Signs of Change, was published.|$|E

5|$|The {{first chapter}} places the player {{in control of}} either Jennifer or Helen, {{escaping}} from Scissorman within the university research building. The second chapter will have the player retrieve the Demon Idol, {{a clue to the}} murder investigation. The scenario in which the idol is retrieved can change depending on choices made by the player earlier. Helen may search for it within the city library, or reporter Nolan Campbell or detective Stan Gotts will search <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the home of a Barrows family butler. The final chapter occurs at Barrows Castle, putting the player in control of the same character they controlled in chapter one. Jennifer or Helen must use the Demon Idol to open a vortex in the castle basement and destroy Scissorman. Depending on the narrative followed and choices made along the way, 10 different endings can be seen.|$|E
