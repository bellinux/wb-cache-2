[...] Passenger trains were operated by Furness rolling stock, but all internal WISC traffic over the LLR and over CWJR metals to Moss Bay and Derwent ironworks was handled by WISC using their own locos and wagons, an arrangement which survived until closure in 1973.

Delay also leads to speculation, with entrepreneurs taking out licences to obtain the option of immediate entry if they later observe the industry to be profitable enough...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{substantial}} financial commitments incurred by European and other UMTS network operators in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> fees, licensees have turned to network sharing as a means of reducing the capital requirements needed to bring 3 G services to market. The reception from European regulators has been mixed, due to concerns that this inhibits competition, slow buildout, or otherwise result in reduced consumer benefits.

40|$|Unlicensed {{driving is}} a serious problem in many Australian states, with {{unlicensed}} drivingrelated crashes (UDC) costing up to $ 300 million per year in Queensland, and $ 171 million in Victoria.

The goal is to provide preliminary recommendations as to which technology is the most beneficial and should be implemented as part of a government-led program increasing the functionalities of Queensland electronic driving licenses (EDL). Fingerprints and finger vascular patterns recognition technologies are found to systematically have the best BCRs. The most beneficial implementation scenarios involve a mandatory system for all banned drivers (suspensions & disqualifications), and a mandatory system for banned drivers under the age of 21 only. This latter scenario performs extremely well, with returns up to 16 times the investment with a simple fingerprints-based interlock. Although often more modest, all systems are found to have BCRs above 1 in all our scenarios expect one...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} based on {{empirical}} research conducted by the author in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The research comprised licence agreements (for both export and import), concluded between 1981 - 1987 by Polish enterprises with partners from the CMEA countries. Analysing the contents of the contracts the author takes into account the stipulations of the CMEA documents which in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> "directives" regulate the circulation of so-called „. scientific and technical works". Taken into account were the stipulations of Organizational, Methodical, Economic and Legal Foundations for Scientific and Technological Co-operation of the CMEA Member States of 1972 (in the 1986 version) and the provisions <b>of</b> „model <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>licencing</b> agreements" issued by the CMEA Secretariat in 1975. The purpose of the analysis was to establish to what degree the solutions recommended for application within the CMEA influence the praxis of shaping the contents of contracts. It should be emphasized that licence relations have not yet been regulated in the acts of the so-called „CMEA common '' law". Besides, the author analyses the contents of particular clauses, especially those of importation contracts, from the viewpoint of their agreement with Polish norms regulating the transfer of technology contained in the 1986 Regulation on Principles and Procedure of Exportation and Importation of Scientific and Technical Achievements issued by the Minister of Foreign Trade. The author aims at establishing to what degree Polish licencees are able to secure for themselves preferred elements of the contents of contracts and to what degree contracts for importation of technology from the CMEA countries are tainted with restrictive practices. The author carries out a survey <b>of</b> typical <b>licence</b> clauses, in particular clauses regulating the extent and character <b>of</b> a <b>licence,</b> the transfer <b>of</b> technical documentation, the exchange of technological improvements, the licensor's legal and technical protective measures and the liability for infringing them, technical assistance, licence fees and their payments, measures to protect the secrecy of know- -how, the clauses regulating the settling of disputes and the choice of applicable law. Then, the author turns her attention to the areas of inadequate contractual regulation (especially the problems of liability and the choice of applicable law). She also discovers in importation contracts. concluded with the CMEA countries the existence of practices restricting the economic activity <b>of</b> Polish <b>licences.</b> From among the restrictive clauses indicated in the Regulation of 1986 the author finds the restrictions as to the right of granting sublicences, exportation restrictions and interdictions to question the licensor's protective title. In that connection the author deals with the character of Polish legal norms regulating the transfer of technology and analyses the relation of these provisions to the norms of the Law on Counteracting Monopolistic Practices. She concludes that restrictive licence clauses may be subject to, sanctions provided for in the Law. The last part of her article is devoted to the problem of transfer of technology within joint ventures carried out with partners from the CMEA countries. Legal foundations <b>of</b> such a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> co-operation and means of transfering the technology within joint ventures have been discussed.

To analyse how the current practices and discourses associated with the socio-technical assemblages of online social worlds work within the broader political economy this article considers discourses associated with risk and security (Dean 2010), practices and discourses associated with algorithms (Gillespie forthcoming 2014) and the new shape of ‘predictive surveillance’ in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> panspectralism (Palmås 2011). The emerging patterns of governance through contractual law and algorithms are enabling the discursive construction of a differently balanced set of relations between citizens, governments and corporations. The overlapping interests of these stakeholders are considered, and the strong alliances between corporations and the security arms of governments are identified. Sal Humphrey...|$|R

50|$|This {{represented}} {{a shift from}} the prevailing thinking of the 1990s, when the affiliations were arranged. At that time, particularly during the early 1990s recession, many clubs' finances were tight, so operating costs drove many decisions. At that time, some Victorian AFL clubs favoured {{the establishment of a}} WAFL/SANFL style of affiliation, with reserves players scattered throughout the VFL, because it would result in minimum management costs for the AFL club. The desire for teams to re-establish stand-alone reserves teams came {{at a time when most}} clubs were in a much stronger financial position. The total licence and running costs for a stand-alone team were estimated to be $500,000 per year in 2011. Through the 2000s, the AFL preferred that its Victorian clubs retained VFL-affiliations, and offered a disincentive in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> an inflated <b>licence</b> fee for fielding a stand-alone team; however, the AFL did not otherwise prevent teams from fielding stand-alone reserves teams if they are willing and able to pay the fee.|$|R
