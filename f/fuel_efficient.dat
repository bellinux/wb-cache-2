5|$|The CFM56-5A {{series is}} the initial CFM56-5 series, {{designed}} {{to power the}} short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500lbf (98kN and 118kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% more <b>fuel</b> <b>efficient</b> than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|The new 3-litre engines under {{development}} by competing team Ferrari had 12 cylinders. Jack Brabham, owner and lead driver of BRO, {{took a different}} approach to the problem of obtaining a suitable engine. He persuaded Australian company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more <b>fuel</b> <b>efficient.</b>|$|E

The hybrid photovoltaic and diesel aggregates island's power supply with maximal power of 80 kW and daily energy of 400 kWh is shown in this paper. The advantages of this system are: reduced consumption of fossil <b>fuels,</b> <b>efficient</b> use of fossil fuels, reduced emissions, improved energy system reliability, ensuring continuous electric supply and increasing life of diesel engines. The working concept is such that hybrid system uses photovoltaic panels for prime power and diesel generators as a secondary source of energy.

5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In less developed nations {{it may be the}} only fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further afield in the search for fuel. It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very <b>fuel</b> <b>efficient</b> and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more <b>fuel</b> <b>efficient,</b> causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{took over}} the IMSA GT Championship {{operation}} in 1988 and one model– Jaguar XJR-9– was launched to compete in both series. The XJR-9, which retained the Jaguar V12 engine, {{went on to win}} the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans and World Sportscar Championship in the same year. The poor fuel consumption of the Jaguar V12 combined with new rules restricting refueling during races forced the replacement of the V12 engine in the XJR-9s successors, the XJR-10 and XJR-11. The normally-aspirated Austin Rover V64V engine, designed for the MG Metro 6R4 had recently been made redundant thanks to the Group B rally ban in 1987, and the design rights were for sale. The compact, lightweight and <b>fuel</b> <b>efficient</b> nature of the small-displacement, turbocharged engine was investigated by TWR, who considered it an ideal basis for a new engine to power the XJR-10 and purchased the design rights from Austin Rover Group.|$|E

5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and <b>fuel</b> <b>efficient</b> vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002, after {{airlines}} expressed {{reservations about}} {{its emphasis on}} speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20percent more <b>fuel</b> <b>efficient.</b> The new jetliner was {{the first stage of}} a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.|$|E

40|$|Solar energy {{conversion}} {{is essential to}} address the gap between energy production and increasing demand.

To achieve efficient photocatalysis for overall water splitting, all of the parameters involved at different time scales should be improved because the overall efficiency is obtained by the multiplication of all these fundamental efficiencies.

40|$|Concerns about Peak Oil, {{political}} {{instability in the}} Middle East, health hazards, and greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuels have stimulated interests in alternative fuels such as biofuels, natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen. Alternative fuels are expected {{to play an important}} role in a transition to a sustainable transportation system.

In order to improve energy efficiency, the following measures have been recommended by the Government: Upgrading product quality. Changing the structure of industry. Changing the structure of the national fuel and energy balance by optimising energy use for certain purposes (supply diversification enabling the choice of most efficient energy carrier). Using modern, energy-efficient devices and technologies, both in production and housing sectors, especially in households.
