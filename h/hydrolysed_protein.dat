40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract of marine fish larvae undergoes extensive changes during the larval stage. The success in weaning increases as the juvenile stage approaches and the {{gastrointestinal tract}} attains a more adult-like form and functionality. In the present study, intestinal maturation in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippolgossus) larvae was compared with weaning studies {{to give an}} indication whether intestinal maturation and weaning success were correlated. Activities of the brush border membrane (bbm) enzymes alkaline phosphatase (AP) and leucine aminopeptidase N (LAP) were used as markers for for intestinal maturation. In addition, the activity of intestinal leucylalanine peptidase (Leu-ala) {{was used as a}} marker for larval mode of digestion, but this marker gave no information in decline in larval digestive features in cod and halibut. The specific activities of AP and LAP increased abruptly from 30 to 40 - 50 dpff in both species, corresponding to 50 - 120 mg wet weight in halibut and 7 - 9 mm standard length (SL) in cod. These increases mark the time when the intestine achieves a more adult-like functionality, and thus, the fish larvae were considered to be better prepared to digest microparticulate diets. Comparison of intestinal maturation with early weaning studies with cod and halibut indicated that intestinal maturation was important for succeeding in weaning of these two species. However, several factors are supposed to influence the weaning results, and in particular the suitability of the diet. Marine fish larvae absorb <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> more efficiently than intact protein. Thus, including part of the dietary protein in a hydrolysed form is thought to enhance growth and development during the larval stage when the gastrointestinal tract is not fully mature. Graded levels of pepsin <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> (from 0 to 40 - 45 %) were included in the weaning diets for cod (11 mg wet weight) and halibut (120 and 220 mg wet weight) in order to define the optimal level of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein.</b> Cod obtained the highest survival rate when 40 % of the dietary protein was exchanged with pepsin <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein.</b> Higher inclusion levels were not tested. In contrast, the diets added none or 10 % pepsin <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> supported the highest survival rates in halibut. Specific activities of AP and LAP showed positive correlation with the survival results, supporting that cod and halibut took benefit of high and low levels of dietary <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein,</b> respectively. Dietary <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> did not affect growth significantly. The main reason for the different results obtained with cod and halibut {{is considered to be a}} combination of different feeding practise in cod and halibut, and high leaching rates of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> from microparticulate diets. Determination of leaching rates from three microparticulate diets showed that nutrient losses were extensive, but to some extent dependent on type of feed, feed particle size and molecular size of the dietary peptides (i. e. amino acids>hydrolysed protein>intact protein). Halibut ingests diet particles slowly, allowing extensive losses of nutrients from the diet prior to ingestion. Cod ingests diet particles rapidly, and thus when the particles still contain some <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein.</b> The protein content in the diets offered to halibut was probably reduced comparatively with <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> inclusion level, and since juvenile halibut is considered to have a high dietary protein requirement, a sub-optimal level of protein may have been reached when the diets contained high levels of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein.</b> This may explain the low optimal level of dietary <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> to halibut...|$|E

Considering the operational stability, AL showed better results than AC for papain, since the enzyme activity remained unchanged after 15 and 5 times, respectively.

This effect is not due to a different stoichiometry of metal ion binding, since one metal ion is sufficient for full enzymatic activity. To determine the role of the metal ion, the crystal structure of p 21 (G 12 P) ·GppCp complexed with Mn 2 + was determined and shown to be very similar to the corresponding p 21 (G 12 P) ·GppCp·Mg 2 + structure. Especially the coordination sphere around the metal ions is very similar, and no second metal ion binding site could be detected, consistent with the assumption that one metal ion is sufficient for GTP hydrolysis. In order to explain the biochemical differences, we analysed the GTPase reaction mechanism with a linear free energy relationships approach. The result suggests that the reaction mechanism is not changed with Mn 2 + but that the transition metal ion Mn 2 + shifts the pKa of the γ-phosphate by almost half a unit and increases the reaction rate due to an increase in the basicity of GTP acting as the general base. This suggests that the intrinsic GTPase reaction could be an attractive target for anti-cancer drug design.

Whey proteins included a non-hydrolysed, whey protein isolate control and three <b>hydrolysed</b> whey <b>protein</b> powders (WPH), with DH values of 8, 11 and 32, where DH = degree of hydrolysis.

Laboratory rearing techniques are based on the development of artificial diets for larvae consisting predominately of the pulp of locally available fruits including pawpaw, breadfruit and banana. The pawpaw diet is the standard diet and is used in seven countries for rearing 11 species. Diet ingredients are standard proportions of fruit pulp, <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> and a bacterial and fungal inhibitor. The diet is particularly suitable for post-harvest treatment studies when larvae of known age are required. Another major development in the laboratory rearing system is the use of pure strains of Enterobacteriaceae bacterial cultures as important adult-feeding supplements. These bacterial cultures are dissected out of the crop of wild females, isolated by sub-culturing, and identified before supply to adults on peptone yeast extract agar plates. Most species are egged using thin, plastic receptacles perforated with 1 mm oviposition holes, with fruit juice or larval diet smeared internally as an oviposition stimulant. Laboratory rearing techniques have been standardised for all of the Pacific countries. Quality control monitoring is based on acceptable ranges in per cent egg hatch, pupal weight and pupal mortality. Colonies are rejuvenated every 6 to 12 months by crossing wild males with laboratory-reared females and vice versa.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several studies {{investigated}} whether <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> can induce {{tolerance to}} cow's milk (CM) in {{children at risk}} of developing CM allergy. Due to methodological problems and inconsistent findings, the evidence for a tolerogenic effect is limited. A major problem is that different hydrolysates may give different outcomes due to variations in their production and composition. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the effect of the degree of hydrolysis on the allergenicity and immunogenicity of whey hydrolysates. METHODS: The hydrolysis of whey was stopped at different time-points between 1 and 60 min. In 18 CM allergic patients, the allergenicity of the hydrolysates was determined by immunoblot and the basophil activation test. To test immunogenicity, CM-specific T cell lines were generated. RESULTS: In most patients, increasing time of hydrolysis decreased IgE recognition and basophil activation. However, in five patients, <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> induced more basophil activation than non-hydrolysed proteins. The immunoblot data indicated that these patients recognized either a 25 - to 30 -kDa degradation product of casein or a 10 -kDa degradation product of whey. Although T cell activation was decreased in all patients over time, half of them still showed a positive response to the proteins after 60 min of hydrolysis. CONCLUSION: Increasing the time of hydrolysis reduces both allergenicity and immunogenicity of whey hydrolysates in most but not all patients. This indicates that not the degree of hydrolysis is decisive but the presence and stability of IgE and T cell epitopes in the hydrolysate recognized by individual patients...|$|R
