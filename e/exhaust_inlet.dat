40|$|AbstractExhaust {{efficiency}} in tunnel fires with mechanical means was discussed. Heat exhaust efficiency and smoke exhaust efficiency were defined and studied under two different exhaust modes (longitudinal exhaust and transverse exhaust) respectively. Exhaust efficiency depends on smoke generation rate, exhaust rate, heat loss through walls of tunnel, configuration of extraction installations and so on. Under smoke extraction, smoke exhaust efficiency equals 1 if a quasi-steady vented stage without upstream outflow forms, otherwise smoke exhaust efficiency {{is less than}} 1. Heat exhaust efficiency is always less than 1 since part of the heat released by the fire is lost through the solid boundaries of tunnel by radiative and convective heat transfer between the smoke and ceiling lining. Based on experimental data obtained {{from a series of}} fire tests in a model tunnel, heat exhaust efficiency was estimated and influencing factors were discussed. In tunnel fires with transverse mechanical exhaust system, heat exhaust efficiency varies from 20 % to 50 %. Heat exhaust {{efficiency in}}creases along with the reduction of the number of exhaust inlets turned on while extracting and decreases along with the increase of the area of <b>exhaust</b> <b>inlet.</b> However, quantitative influence of inlet position on exhaust efficiency still need further study and will be reported later...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{investigation}} of the fluid mechanics of the Aaberg exhaust hood is presented. The Aaberg exhaust hood is unique in its design as the speed of the air flow towards the <b>exhaust</b> <b>inlet</b> is enhanced by the entrainment of fluid into the hood's jet flow. The complex air flow pattern of the hood is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. However, in this thesis modelling techniques have been developed {{in order to reduce the}} complexity of determining the fundamental air flow pattern. The modelling procedure adopted considers the hood's overall air flow to be composed of three component flows, namely, (i) the flow in the jet region, (ii) the jet-induced flow and (Ui) the suction flow. In practice the fluid flow pattern generated by the hood is such that the Reynolds number is very large, and hence the suction and jet-induced flows are modelled as potential flows with the boundary conditions governing the jet-induced flow coming from the solution of the shear-layer equations. This solution procedure enables the parameters which govern the hood's air flow to be identified and their effect on the flow produced by the hood may then be determined. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional axisymmetric exhaust designs have been examined and for the latter case a new numerical model for the axisymmetric radial flow of a fluid from the space between two identical concentric discs, for laminar and turbulent flows, has been developed. Agreement between the turbulent radial jet model developed and the results of numerous other established theoretical and experimental investigations is very good. The inviscid models for the overall air flow have been developed in terms of the stream functionand. except for in the simplest case considered where an analytical solution is possible. the equations of motion which govern the fluid flow in the region of interest have been solved numerically using finite-difference techniques. The models developed illustrate all of the flow phenomena observed experimentally and comparisons made between the predictions of both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional axisymmetric mathematical models and (i) the available experimental data and (ii) the commercially available CFD code FLUENT. which solves the full turbulent Navier-Stokes equations. show good agreement. thereby confirming the credibility of the cost-effective modelling approach adopted in this thesis...|$|E

50|$|In {{practice}} TVO {{had most}} of the properties of paraffin, including the need for heating to encourage vapourisation. As a result, the <b>exhaust</b> and <b>inlet</b> manifolds were adapted so that more heat from the former warmed the latter. Such a setup was called a vaporiser. To get the tractor to start from cold, a small second fuel tank was added that contained petrol. The tractor was started on the expensive petrol, then - once the engine was warm - the fuel supply switched over to TVO or paraffin. So long as the engine was working hard, as when ploughing or pulling a load, the TVO would burn well.

The piston surface, cylinder head, <b>exhaust</b> and <b>inlet</b> valves of a single cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine were coated with Al 2 O 3 -TiO 2 (87 - 13) oxide based ceramic composite. The surface coating was applied to a thickness of 250 Âµm using an atmospheric plasma spray method. NiAl (50 Âµm thickness) was employed as bond layer for the piston and the valves.

Hot gas ingestion, the entrainment of heated engine <b>exhaust</b> into the <b>inlet</b> flow field, is a key development issure for advanced short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft. Flow visualization from the Phase 1 test program, which evaluated the hot ingestion phenomena and control techniques, is covered.

Hot gas ingestion levels were measured for the several forward nozzle splay configurations and with flow control/life improvement devices (LIDs) which reduced the hot gas ingestion. The model support system had four degrees of freedom - pitch, roll, yaw, and vertical height variation. The model support system also provided heated high-pressure air for nozzle flow and a suction system <b>exhaust</b> for <b>inlet</b> flow. The test was conducted at full scale nozzle pressure ratios and inlet Mach numbers. Test and data analysis results from Phase 2 and flow visualization from both Phase 1 and 2 are documented.
