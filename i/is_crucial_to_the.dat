The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film's main theme.

Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E

The game begins on May 25, 2496 as the player begins their employment with TetraCorp (a large interstellar megacorporation) who {{have set up}} a new asteroid mining franchise operation in the Fragmented Sectors. There are six alien races competing with Tetracorp for these resources.

5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} hippocampus <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.|$|E

25|$|Plato's Problem {{describes}} {{the disparity between}} input (poverty of the stimulus) and output (grammar).

Plato's Problem, as conceived here, informs much of the theory in this branch of linguistics.|$|E
25|$|The {{call for}} {{application}} of the subsidiarity principle to the CFP lies within the argument for its decentralisation.

The failure of this increasingly centralised reform has proved to de-centralisation advocates that stakeholder participation in the governance process <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future success of fisheries governance.|$|E

25|$|Flaviviruses have a (+) sense RNA genome and {{replicate}} in the cytoplasm of {{the host}} cells. The genome mimics the cellular mRNA molecule in all aspects except {{for the absence of}} the poly-adenylated (poly-A) tail. This feature allows the virus to exploit cellular apparatus to synthesise both structural and non-structural proteins, during replication. The cellular ribosome <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> replication of the flavivirus, as it translates the RNA, in a similar fashion to cellular mRNA, resulting in the synthesis of a single polyprotein. In general, the genome encodes 3 structural proteins (Capsid, prM, and Envelope) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). The genomic RNA is modified at the 5′ end of positive-strand genomic RNA with a cap-1 structure (me7-GpppA-me2).|$|E
25|$|In this XX/XO sex {{determination}} system, gene expression on the X chromosome is equalized by downregulating expression of genes on both X chromosomes of hermaphroditic XX organisms by half. In these XX organisms, the dosage compensation complex (DCC) is assembled on both X chromosomes {{to allow for}} this tightly regulated change in transcription levels. The DCC is often compared to the condensin complex, which is conserved across the mitotic and meiotic processes of many species. This complex <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> condensation and segregation of chromosomes during both meiosis and mitosis. Because data substantiates the theory that dosage compensation in other species is caused by chromatin-wide modifications, many theorize that the DCC in particular functions similar to the condensin complex {{in its ability to}} condense or remodel the chromatin of the X chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Transposon {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of transcriptional {{gene silencing}} targeting transposons. Transcriptional gene silencing is a product of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including hemophilia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|E
