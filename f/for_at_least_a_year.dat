5|$|In 1901, Wallis's aunt Bessie Merryman was widowed, and the {{following}} year Alice and Wallis moved into her four-bedroom house on West Chase Street, Baltimore, where they lived <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> until they settled in an apartment, and then a house, of their own. In 1908, Wallis's mother married her second husband, John Freeman Rasin, son of a prominent Democratic party boss.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|Governor-General Kerr was {{following}} the crisis closely. At a luncheon with Whitlam {{and several of his}} ministers on 30 October, Kerr suggested a compromise: if Fraser conceded supply, Whitlam would agree not to call the half-Senate election until May or June 1976, or alternatively would agree not to call the Senate into session until after 1 July. Whitlam rejected the idea, seeking to end the Senate's right to deny supply. On 3 November, after a meeting with Kerr, Fraser proposed that if the government agreed to hold a House of Representatives election {{at the same time as}} the half-Senate election, the Coalition would concede supply. Whitlam rejected this offer, stating that he had no intention of advising a House election <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but {{he would not be able}} to do the film <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|Pickett's first combat command {{was during}} the Peninsula Campaign, leading a brigade that was nicknamed the Gamecocks (the brigade would {{eventually}} be led by Richard B. Garnett in Pickett's Charge). Pickett led his brigade ably in the battles of Williamsburg and Seven Pines, earning commendations from his superiors. At Gaines's Mill on June 27 he was shot off his horse while leading his brigade in its first assault. Pickett continued {{to move forward with}} his men for a while, leading his horse on foot. A second assault by Pickett's brigade, led by Colonel Eppa Hunton, along with the brigade led by Cadmus M. Wilcox, broke the Union line. Pickett feared that he had taken a mortal blow to his shoulder, but the wound was initially assessed by others as minor. The shoulder wound turned out to be severe enough that, while not fatal, Pickett was out of action for the next three months, and his arm would remain stiff <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

Willoughby {{requests}} a private audience with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne, leading them both to expect that he will propose. However, Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London, and {{he may not be}} able to return to Devonshire <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Shortly after Willoughby's departure, Edward comes to visit, and the Dashwoods notice that he appears to be unhappy and distant. Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy (Anna Madeley) and Anne Steele (Daisy Haggard), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news that devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.|$|E

5|$|Citi Bike's massive, {{unexpected}} popularity caused {{problems within}} a year. In January 2014, the designer of Citi Bike's bicycles and docking stations {{filed for bankruptcy}} protection. Officials with Montreal, Quebec-based Public Bike System Company (also known as Bixi) said they were $46 million in debt, partly because the operators of Citi Bike and Chicago's Divvy bikeshare had withheld a combined $5 million in payments because of software glitches in the docking stations. Alta officials, who operate Citi Bike, Divvy, and Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., said they anticipated no interruptions of service, though they did want $20 million to expand the system to 10,000 bikes and 600 stations. However, due to Citi Bike's various problems, expansions to the Upper East and Upper West Sides were delayed <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Its general manager resigned in March. The new mayor, Bill de Blasio, stated {{that he wanted to}} expand Citi Bike's reach, but that he could not make city funds available for such an expansion at that time.|$|E
5|$|Most of Yap State was {{affected}} by the typhoon, and the eye of Typhoon Lupit passed near the small atoll of Ulithi. The typhoon also passed near Fais, producing estimated gusts of over 185km/h (115mph). On both islands, Lupit produced waves of , causing severe beach erosion, and sea spray and flooding contaminated water supplies. In Fais, there was little flooding {{because it is an}} elevated island, although several buildings were damaged, mostly to roofs. On Ulithi, areas along the coast were flooded up to 1.5m (5ft) deep. Crops were wrecked on both islands, and on Ulithi, it was estimated that the soil would be unfit for growing <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Stations on Ulithi reported wind gusts of 158km/h (98mph), and 263mm (10.35in) of rainfall. Lupit affected other islands in Yap State with coastal flooding of around 1m (3ft), severe beach erosion, and wrecked crops. Several islands' water supply were contaminated. On Woleai, the storm downed trees and power lines, and the runway was closed for a week after being covered with water. Damage in Yap State was least on Yap, where winds gusted to 93km/h (58mph) and rainfall totaled 128mm (5.02in) in a 24‑hour period. There, Lupit downed trees and damaged crops, while high seas flooded areas. There was moderate beach erosion, and some seawalls and coastal roads were damaged.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team, including Sierra Leone who did not play their first matches until around 1994 when they participated in the qualification phase of the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. In a game in Nigeria on 6 November 1994, Sierra Leone women's national football team lost 0–9 to Nigeria after being down 0–6 at the half. In a game in Freetown on 20 November 1994, Sierra Leone women's national football team lost 0–2 to Nigeria after being down 0–2 at the half. These two games represent half of all games the team has played in its history. The team's other two games took place during the preliminary rounds of the 2010 Women's Championship tournament in Africa, which was part of the Olympic qualification process, where Sierra Leone lost during the preliminary round once 2–3 to Guinea in Conakry on 7 March 2010 and tied Guinea 1–1 in Freetown on 20 March 2010. Following this match, the team did not play an international match on any level <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and did not participate 2011 All Africa Games. In March 2012, Sierra Leone was ranked the 135th best {{in the world and the}} 26th best in Africa. They improved their ranking to 130th best in the world in June 2012 but at still at the bottom of the world rankings alongside 46 other women's national teams. The team's best ever rank was 128th, which was in 2010, and their worst ever ranking was 136, which they were ranked in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
