2500|$|<b>Hammer</b> <b>drills</b> {{almost always}} have a lever or switch that locks off the special [...] "hammer clutch," [...] turning the tool into a {{conventional}} drill for wood or metal work. <b>Hammer</b> <b>drills</b> are more expensive and more bulky than regular drills, but are preferable for applications where the material to be drilledconcrete block or wood studsis unknown. [...] For example, an electrician would use a <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> for attaching items (such as an electrical box) to either wood studs (if used as a conventional power drill) or masonry walls (if used as a <b>hammer</b> <b>drill).</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the cam-type <b>hammer</b> <b>drill,</b> a rotary/pneumatic <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> accelerates only the bit. This is accomplished through a piston design, rather than a spinning cam. Rotary hammers have much less vibration and penetrate most building materials. They {{can also be used}} as [...] "drill only" [...] or as [...] "hammer only" [...] which extends their usefulness for tasks such as chipping brick or concrete. Hole drilling progress is greatly superior to cam-type <b>hammer</b> <b>drills,</b> and these drills are generally used for holes of 19 mm (3/4 inch) or greater in size. A typical application for a rotary <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> is boring large holes for lag bolts in foundations, or installing large lead anchors in concrete for handrails or benches.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{successful}} drills were the piston type, or [...] "reciprocators." [...] The drill steel piston and chuck moved together and reciprocated. In Leyner's <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> the steel was held loosely in a chuck {{attached to the}} cylinder itself, while the piston inside the cylinder reciprocated, striking blows on the blunt end of the <b>drill</b> steel. The <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> was lighter, speedier, and used less air than the reciprocating drill.|$|R

2500|$|Masonry bits {{typically}} are {{used with a}} <b>hammer</b> <b>drill,</b> which <b>hammers</b> the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow. [...] <b>Hammer</b> <b>drill</b> bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.|$|R

50|$|The SDS shank has the {{advantage}} of fitting into a simple spring-loaded chuck, so that bits are simply pushed into the chuck without tightening. This shank and chucks made for it are especially suited to <b>hammer</b> <b>drilling</b> with masonry drills in stone and concrete. The drill bit is not held solidly in the chuck, but can slide {{back and forth like a}} piston; it does not slip during rotation due to the non-circular shank cross-section, matching the chuck. The <b>hammer</b> of the <b>drill</b> acts to accelerate only the drill bit itself, and not the large mass of the chuck, which makes <b>hammer</b> <b>drilling</b> with an SDS shank drill bit much more productive than with other types of shank.|$|R
