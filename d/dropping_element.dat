In the case of thyristors, a tapped inverter (12) is employed to couple the inverter to a dc source to back bias the thyristors during commutation.

40|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} an extended version of Absolute Moment Block Truncation Coding (AMBTC) to compress images. Generally {{the elements of}} a bitplane used in the variants of Block Truncation Coding (BTC) are of size 1 bit. But it has been extended to two bits in the proposed method. Number of statistical moments preserved to reconstruct the compressed has also been raised from 2 to 4. Hence, the quality of the reconstructed images has been improved significantly from 33. 62 to 38. 12 with the increase in bpp by 1.

While the planning of these projects can be improved significantly using discrete-event simulation, most {{projects are}} still planned using traditional tools. Recent advances in general-purpose simulation tools for construction operations modelling, such as STROBOSCOPE, enable accurate and detailed modelling of any complex operation. These tools, however, demand a level of training that is beyond that {{which can be found}} in most current practitioners. Special-purpose simulators bring the benefits of discrete-event simulation to users with little or no training by providing an environment that is very close to the problem and geared towards a narrow domain.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the effect of {{perforated}} <b>elements</b> on pressure <b>drop</b> in a double skin facade cavity. This cavity separates the exterior and interior space as thermally controllable. The temperatures of the surfaces facing cavity with exterior and interior spaces have been determined experimentally under different airflow conditions. Two distinct perforated plates having different circular hole dimensions are positioned in the double skin facade cavity in order to create a pressure drop in the cavity. Pressure drops and temperature distributions in the cavity have been examined based on experimental measurements. The results show the surface and air temperature distributions in the cavity, the pressure drops under three different air flow rates and two different perforated plates. The dependence of the dimensionless pressure drop coefficient, Euler versus Reynolds numbers is investigated experimentally for different geometric characteristic of the perforated plates. So, Eu numbers independency after 30, 000 of the Re numbers approximately is shown graphically.

50|$|During {{the winter}} period, the {{physical}} environment of T. carnifex will change drastically, and a need for adaptation to this will arise. The replicatory processes of cells are lowered a great deal during hibernation, likely due to the decrease in metabolic activity and therefore a low need for replication. Cells will exhibit features associated with {{a process known as}} “aging”. This involves <b>dropping</b> <b>elements</b> that are less mature from the circulatory compartment. Aging is assisted by apoptosis (programmed cell death, “cell suicide”). As stated, metabolism is severely lowered during this winter period. This decrease is demonstrated by noticeable changes both in blood circulating cells and haemopoietic cells (these are cells involved in all blood cell production, stem cells found in bone marrow). There are other decreases seen in these cells, and these include enzymatic activity. Because it is necessary for some supplementation of this, the liver increases in activity during this period. It is as if there is a shift in responsibility from the haemopoietic cells to the liver. There is a high correlation between increased activity of the liver and decreased myelopoietic activity. Decrease in metabolic activity could be due to the low motility or movement of newts during winter. Cold temperatures seem to slow down their system.|$|R
