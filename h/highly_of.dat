5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> the service, surprising many observers. His attendance at the service was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, who felt that he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E
5|$|As {{opportunities}} for slow bowling became infrequent, he contemplated retirement. Although he dismissed Cyril Washbrook {{in the first}} over of Victoria's match against Wally Hammond's touring England team of 1946–47, he was skeptical about his pace bowling. After that match {{he did not take}} a wicket for the next two months. It took further encouragement from Australian captain Don Bradman after he played against Bradman's South Australians. Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> his potential as a medium-fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and that pace bowlers were in short supply, whereas spinners were plentiful. In the same season, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson, Bruce Dooland and George Tribe had all played in Tests as specialist spinners. Johnston ended the season with only 12 wickets at 33.16 from six matches.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of the New Zealand Government, in February 1916 Richardson {{returned}} to England to become the New Zealand representative at the War Office. Transferring to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), he also took responsibility for its administration. His responsibilities extended to the overall command of all NZEF personnel in the United Kingdom. This included wounded personnel receiving medical treatment, nurses and doctors, as well as soldiers undergoing training before being transferred to the front. The overall commander of the NZEF, Lieutenant General Alexander Godley, thought <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> Richardson's work and it was recognised in the June 1917 Birthday Honours with his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and going to his parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat. She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with {{what he saw as}} her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E
5|$|He {{was buried}} at Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Chicago. Upon hearing reports of Sebille's death, commanders in Korea {{did not think}} <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> Sebille's act, likening it to a kamikaze action. In spite of reluctance, Lieutenant Donald Bolt, the squadron's {{assistant}} awards officer, forwarded a citation of the event to Washington D.C. where Sebille would be evaluated for the Medal of Honor. Shortly after the incident, both Bolt and Sebille's second-in-command, Captain Robert Howell, were killed in separate combat engagements. A short obituary for Sebille appeared in Time Magazine after his death. The United States Air Force Academy also created a memorial to Sebille in Harmon Hall, the academy's administration building.|$|E

5|$|In 1841, a new Master of the Mint, William Ewart Gladstone was appointed. Gladstone thought <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> Pistrucci and {{corresponded with}} him in Italian, but was unwilling to grant him any new {{commissions}} while the Waterloo Medal remained outstanding. By 1844, the continued expense of Pistrucci was a concern to the Audit Office. Gladstone restored cuts in Pistrucci's pay {{that had been made}} for failure to train an apprentice, and offered him a bonus of £400 to complete the medal. Pistrucci was to work solely on the one project. He vacated his home at the Royal Mint, moving to Old Windsor, where he set up a workshop to attempt the medal's completion. Although Pistrucci worked constantly on the medal during some periods, he was slowed by a fall in his cottage, which incapacitated him for much of 1846. On 1 January 1849, Pistrucci submitted the matrices of the medal to the Royal Mint, and was paid £1,500.|$|E
5|$|Portions of {{at least}} three prints of the film survive: a {{complete}} nitrate print with the car sometimes painted red, given to Méliès's granddaughter Madeleine Malthête-Méliès by an American collector; an incomplete hand-colored nitrate print, bought by Malthête-Méliès from a Belgian collector; and some fragments at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In his book-length study of Méliès, the film historian John Frazer spoke <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> the film, noting its careful use of continuity of direction and comparing it to Mack Sennett's slapstick comedies and to the 1968 automobile film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Méliès made another film in a similar vein, Le Raid New York–Paris en automobile, in 1908; it was also received with success.|$|E
5|$|The stage {{premiere of}} She Has a Name was {{directed}} by Waldschmidt, who was also the scenic designer. Aaron Krogman was selected to portray Jason and the unnamed pimp, Sienna Howell-Holden to portray Mama, Glenda Warkentin to portray Marta, Denise Wong to portray Number 18, and Cari Russell to portray Ali. Waldschmidt suggested that Warkentin audition for the play after seeing her perform at Rosebud Theatre in Rosebud, Alberta. Wong, Krogman, and Kooman spoke <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> Waldschmidt's directing, and Kooman praised Waldschmidt's work as scenic designer. Waldschmidt praised the cast's acting. He said he found the play's opening scene, in which a rape occurs, {{the most difficult to}} stage, despite having previously performed a similar rape scene as an actor. The premiere of She Has a Name was produced by Burnt Thicket Theatre in partnership with Raise Their Voice. The office of Joy Smith, MP for Kildonan—St. Paul, released a statement advertising the premiere of She Has a Name.|$|E

However, on December 21, 1792, Williams accepted the Maryland State Legislature's invitation for him to serve as an Associate Justice for Baltimore County.|$|E
5|$|When {{he arrived}} in Spain, his former protector, regent and Cardinal Ximenez Cisneros, was ill and had become tired of Las Casas's tenacity.

Las Casas managed to secure {{the support of the}} King's Flemish courtiers, including the powerful Chancellor Jean de la Sauvage. Las Casas's influence turned the favor of the court against Secretary Conchillos and Bishop Fonseca. Sauvage spoke <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> Las Casas to the King, who appointed Las Casas and Sauvage to write a new plan for reforming the governmental system of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses {{to explain why the}} poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. But regardless of Proba's intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal. Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> Proba. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written more positively about it.|$|E

5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, Eichelberger {{was summoned}} to Sixth Army {{headquarters}} by Krueger. The Battle of Biak, where the 41st Infantry Division had landed in May, was going badly, and the airfields that MacArthur had promised {{would be available to}} support the Battle of Saipan were not in American hands. Eichelberger found that the Japanese, who were present in larger numbers than originally reported, were ensconced in caves overlooking the airfield sites. While the Americans were better trained and equipped than at Buna, so too were the Japanese, who employed their new tactics of avoiding costly counterattacks and exacting the maximum toll for ground gained. After seeing the situation for himself, Eichelberger concluded that Fuller's 41st Infantry Division had not done too badly. Nonetheless, as at Buna, Eichelberger relieved a number of officers that he felt were not performing as the battle ground on. His orders were to supersede Fuller as task force commander rather than relieve him as division commander, but Fuller requested his own relief, and Krueger obliged him. On Eichelberger's recommendation, Fuller was replaced by Brigadier General Jens A. Doe. Krueger was unimpressed with Eichelberger's performance on Biak, concluding that Eichelberger's tactics were unimaginative, and no better than Fuller's, and may have delayed rather than expedited the capture of the island. On the other hand, MacArthur thought sufficiently <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> Eichelberger's performance to award him the Silver Star.|$|E
5|$|Like that {{of almost}} every {{character}} from this period, Jocelin's year of birth is unknown to modern historians. It is known that he entered as a novice monk in Melrose Abbey during the abbacy of Waltheof (ab. 11481159), and from documentary evidence {{it seems likely that}} Jocelin entered Melrose about 50 years before his death in 1199. As the rules of the Cistercian order prevented entry as a novice before the age of 15, it is likely that he was born around the year 1134. Little is known about Jocelin's early life or his early career as a Melrose monk. He obviously successfully completed his one-year noviciate, the year in which a prospective monk was introduced to monasticism and judged fit or unfit for admittance. We know that Abbot Waltheof (Waldef) thought <b>highly</b> <b>of</b> him and granted him many responsibilities. After the death of Abbot Waltheof, his successor, Abbot William, refused to encourage the rumours which had quickly been spreading about Waltheof's saintliness. Abbot William attempted to silence such rumours, and shelter his monks from the intrusiveness of would-be pilgrims. However, William was unable to get the better of Waltheof's emerging cult, and his actions had alienated him from the brethren. As a result, William resigned the abbacy in April 1170. Jocelin was by this stage the Prior of Melrose, that is, the second in command at the monastery, and thus William's most likely replacement.|$|E
