Landing on 18 April, Blake's army moved to join General Francisco Ballesteros at the Spanish town of Xeres.|$|E

5|$|A {{pressing}} issue {{not resolved}} by Wilson {{was the question}} of policy towards Bolshevik Russia. The U.S. had been among the nations that <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> troops there after the Russian Revolution. Afterwards, Wilson refused to recognize the Russian SFSR. Under Harding, Commerce Secretary Hoover, with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on policy. When famine struck Russia in 1921, Hoover had the American Relief Administration, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians to provide aid. Soviet leaders (the U.S.S.R. was established in 1922) hoped in vain that the agreement would lead to recognition. Hoover supported trade with the Soviets, fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market, but Hughes opposed this, and the matter was not resolved under Harding's presidency.|$|E
