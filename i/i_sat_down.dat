5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I {{told him}} the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|Years later, when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{to write}} Tropic of Fear, a {{political}} thriller set in South America, I thought of those experiences. They {{became part of}} the background of a secondary character, “Dink” Denton, a former roughneck, ex-Apache helicopter pilot in both Panama and the First Gulf War, now undercover in Paraguay as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|E
60|$|Taking {{no notice}} of this remark, <b>I</b> again <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> beside my old woman.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} and almost {{expected}} fire from heaven. This coincidence was {{like the end of}} the world. <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> feeling that somehow or other Park-lane must be pulled down; and <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> beside the man who wanted to pull it down. I bowed in silence for an instant under the approaching apocalypse; and in that instant the man turned sharply and started talking like a torrent.|$|R
60|$|I {{have said}} that I began to laugh, and now I kept on. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and roared, so that the people looked at me.|$|R
25|$|Elizabeth Smart (December 27, 1913– March 4, 1986) was a Canadian {{poet and}} novelist. Her book, By Grand Central Station <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>Down</b> and Wept, {{detailed}} her romance with the poet George Barker.

25|$|Lamson and King {{settled in}} England, where she began {{work in the}} media and he worked as a {{television}} director. She worked in London as a script reader for Columbia Pictures in 1980. Soon after, she began focusing upon script writing and one of her first screenplays was a feature film adaptation of Elizabeth Smart's poem By Grand Central Station <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>Down</b> and Wept. Despite interest from various producers, the film was never made. However, the quality of the script opened doors for Lamson.|$|E
500|$|The end of {{the book}} finds Rita {{defeated}} by life: [...] "For the first time <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> defenseless to await life's next assault". [...] The book ends with an encounter with a drug addict who cared enough for her to show her the effects of his drug habit, which galvanizes her to reject drug addiction and to make something of her life for her and her son.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm nobody's boy," [...] said Fred, getting up, with {{a bitter}} choking in his throat; [...] "my mother's dead; <b>I</b> only <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> here to rest {{me for a}} while." ...|$|R
500|$|Hardly {{knowing what}} I was doing... <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{and started to}} work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I {{came to realize that}} in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E
500|$|She and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{and wrote}} this song about some serious insecurities {{that we had}} {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and we both had trust issues. We were getting over it, but we wrote this song about it. And it's perfect. I couldn't be happier about that song and the way it came about and the honest way ... It is like people getting a look at {{something}} personal for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{began writing}} an opinion column, [...] "The Priyanka Chopra Column", for the Hindustan Times in 2009. She wrote {{a total of}} fifty columns for the newspaper. She said after her first year of writing: [...] "I'm a private person and never thought that I could express my feelings. But strangely enough, {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore." [...] In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column.|$|E
60|$|To counterwork these baneful feelings, <b>I</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{to write}} to you; as I declare upon my soul I always find that the most {{sovereign}} balm for my wounded spirit.|$|R
60|$|I couldn't help it. I {{was tired}} and warm and so disappointed. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> right <b>down</b> on the rustic seat behind me and burst into tears, as the story-books say.|$|R
60|$|Not {{having this}} {{resource}} open to me, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself <b>down</b> in my bedroom, to consider--if {{the matter of}} Dubourg went any further--what it was my business to do next.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Nirvana {{frontman}} Kurt Cobain in April 1994, drummer Dave Grohl entered a state of depression, and {{found it difficult to}} both listen to music and play instruments. He was uncertain of what to do next, even considering abandoning his musical career despite a few invitations by bands such as Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to become their drummer, because [...] "it would just remind me of being in Nirvana; every time <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at a drum set, I would think of that." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} I {{was on the way}} to the bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm {{on the way to the}} bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know how we would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E
60|$|An usher set a {{chair for}} me, and <b>I,</b> too, <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> {{immediately}} facing the Emperor's Lieutenant. Then another {{usher in a}} loud voice summoned Cosimo to appear and state his grievance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw, sir, {{you talk}} nonsense," [...] said Mowbray; [...] "the tea-room is so infernally hot, that <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> here {{a moment to}} draw breath, when the young woman came in." ...|$|R

500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{discussed}} the cultural {{influences on the}} novel. He claimed inspiration from [...] (1984) by Studs Terkel, stating: [...] " [...] an oral history of World War II. I read it when I was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to write World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I {{wanted it to be}} in the vein of an oral history." [...] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the Return of the Living Dead films: [...] "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old Batman TV show did for the Dark Knight." [...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} the duet was first {{announced}} via Stefani's Twitter account, where she posted the album notes of If I'm Honest, which revealed her name in the track listing. In an interview with People, Shelton expressed that {{the best part of}} the duet was [...] "the honest way it came about". He stated: [...] "There's not a third ghost writer, there's not five writers on it. It's just she and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and wrote this song [...] and I couldn't be happier about [...]" [...] He further explained that the song was written about [...] "some serious insecurities that we had when we first started down this road with each other"; he called the end result [...] "perfect". The concept for [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] was developed by both singers, and began with Shelton writing the first verse, followed by Stefani creating the second, which Shelton described: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> frowningly <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook {{stood over}} me and poured out my tea--before I could touch the teapot--with {{the air of a}} benefactor who was {{resolved}} to be true to the last.|$|R

6000|$|Five {{minutes after}} <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to lunch, he flung open the dining-room door, and marched in. It is his {{customary}} [...] "entrance." [...] In a previous state of existence, his soul was probably {{that of an}} Actor-Manager.|$|R
500|$|The {{script was}} later rewritten and {{expanded}} when Lynch decided to {{transform it into}} a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, [...] "One night, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> the ideas came in, {{and it was a}} most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle... Now, looking back, I see that [...] always wanted to be this way. It just took this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is." [...] The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7million from French production company StudioCanal.|$|E
500|$|In Rolling With the Stones, Bill Wyman said: [...] "On 3 August {{we worked}} on 'Good Time Woman' and when I arrived the {{following}} day I found Mick Taylor playing bass. I hung around until 3am then left." [...] In the liner notes to , Richards stated, [...] "I remember writing the riff upstairs in the very elegant front room, and we took it downstairs the same evening and we cut it." [...] Jagger said of the lyrics, [...] "It's weird where your lyric things come from. On Tumbling Dice, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with the house keeper and talked to her about gambling. She liked to play dice and I really didn't know much about it, but I got it off her and managed to make the song out of that." [...] He concluded, [...] " [...] 'Tumbling Dice' [...] " [...] was written to fit Keith's riff. It's about gambling and love, an old blues track." ...|$|E
500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since {{listening to his}} group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous {{to work with him}} on the album: [...] "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." [...] " [...] On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished [...] "My Name Is" [...] in an hour. [...] Three other songs, including [...] "Role Model", were also recorded that day.|$|E

60|$|My {{friend and}} <b>I</b> now <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{in front of}} a {{comfortable}} fire, fed with logs from the roof of a neighbouring hut, but we had not chatted long before he asked me the object of my visit to headquarters.|$|R
