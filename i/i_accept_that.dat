In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I’ve learned more about the questions and issues at hand, <b>I</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> I have been wrongheaded {{on a number of}} topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I’m still learning. Please bear with me, folks.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 April 2010 {{the council}} {{released}} {{a joint statement}} with the families' solicitors announcing it was dropping its appeal and had agreed a financial settlement with 19 families. Chris Mallender said: [...] "The council recognises that it made mistakes in its clean-up of the former British Steel site years ago and extends its deepest sympathy to the children and their families. Although <b>I</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> money cannot properly compensate these young people for their disabilities {{and for all that}} they have suffered to date and their problems in the future, the council sincerely hopes that this apology coupled with today's agreement will mean that they can now put their legal battle behind them and proceed with their lives with a greater degree of financial certainty." [...] The financial terms of the settlement remained confidential, and the agreement forbids disclosure of the financial arrangements. On the subject of cost, Mallender said: [...] "Every £1m of cost involves a payment £5 per household in Corby on average, per year, for the next 20 years. So, simple maths: if the overall bill is £5m, it's £25 per household for 20 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his show}} on May 24, 2011, Schultz called Laura Ingraham both a [...] "right-wing slut" [...] and a [...] "talk slut." [...] Feminist {{organizations}} including the Women's Media Center called for his suspension. The following day he issued an apology {{by saying he}} [...] "used vile and inappropriate language when talking about talk show host Laura Ingraham. I am deeply sorry, and I apologize. It was wrong, uncalled for and I recognize the severity of what I said. I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness." [...] He offered an indefinite self-suspension without pay. Ingraham accepted his apology: [...] "Ed Schultz said something about me on his show that was not all that nice, to say the least. It was pretty crude. He apologized, and I accept his apology. It seemed heartfelt, {{it seemed like he}} really wished he hadn't said it and <b>I</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> apology." [...] MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change will give me more flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want to do here for The Ed Show here on MSNBC. This is on me, you know. I just don't want to do a three-hour talk show anymore." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When I {{was ordained}} a deacon, {{and then a}} priest, I took vows which {{would appear to be}} {{literally}} conflicting. Compelled to choose between these vows, <b>I</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> as supreme which I made when I affirmed that I would teach nothing which I should be persuaded might not be concluded and affirmed by the Scripture. The Creeds were derived from the Scripture--not the Scripture from the Creeds. As an individual among a body of Christians I am powerless to change either the ordinal vows or the Creeds, I am obliged to wait for the consensus of opinion. But if, on the whole, I can satisfy my conscience in repeating the Creeds and reading the service, as other honest men are doing--if I am convinced that I have an obvious work to do in that Church, it would be cowardly for me to abandon that work." ...|$|E

Here there can be nothing for me but Indians, hard work, privation, and trouble. Yet I could not get here quickly enough. Pshaw! What use {{to speak of the}} {{possibilities}} of a new country. I cannot deceive myself. It is she. I would walk a thousand miles and starve myself for months just for one glimpse of her sweet face. Knowing this what care I for all the rest. How strange she should ride down to the old sycamore tree yesterday the moment I was there and thinking of her. Evidently she had just returned from her visit. I wonder if she ever cared.

Feelings of guilt governed my world view: postcolonial guilt, white guilt, middle-class guilt, British guilt. But if I was guilty, 9/11 shattered my innocence...

6000|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{has changed}} from dark and sullen to hopeful, and I am sure your Lordships will allow me to be equally confident that nothing will be done at Westminster to overcloud that promising sky. The noble Marquess the other day said--and I was delighted to hear it--that he, at all events, would give us, with all the reservations that examination of the scheme might demand from him, a whole-hearted support here, and his best encouragement to the men in India. <b>I</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that,</b> and I lean upon it, because if anything were done at Westminster, either by delay or otherwise, to show a breach in {{what ought to be}} the substantial unity of Parliamentary opinion in face of the Indian situation, it would be a marked disaster. I would venture on the point of delay to say this. Your Lordships will not suspect me of having any desire to hurry the Bill, but I remember that when Lord Cross brought in the Bill of 1892 Lord Kimberley, so well known and so popular in this House, used language which I venture to borrow from him, and to press upon your Lordships to-day-- ...|$|E
6000|$|There is {{the power}} of moods, each setting at nought all but its own tissue of facts and beliefs. There {{is the power}} of complexions, {{obviously}} modifying the dispositions and sentiments. The beliefs and unbeliefs appear to be structural; and, as soon as each man attains the poise and vivacity which allow the whole machinery to play, he will not need extreme examples, but will rapidly alternate all opinions in his own life. Our life is March weather, savage and serene in one hour. We go forth austere, dedicated, believing in the iron links of Destiny, and will not turn on our heel to save our life; but a book, or a bust, or only the sound of a name, shoots a spark through the nerves, and we suddenly believe in will: my finger-ring shall be the seal of Solomon: fate is for imbeciles: all is possible to the resolved mind. Presently, a new experience gives a new turn to our thoughts: common sense resumes its tyranny: we say, [...] "Well, the army, after all, is the gate to fame, manners, and poetry: and, look you,--on the whole, selfishness plants best, prunes best, makes the best commerce, and the best citizen." [...] Are the opinions of a man on right and wrong, on fate and causation, at the mercy of a broken sleep or an indigestion? Is his belief in God and Duty no deeper than a stomach evidence? And what guaranty for the permanence of his opinions? I like not the French celerity,--a new church and state once a week.--This is the second negation; and I shall let it pass for what it will. As far as it asserts rotation of states of mind, I suppose it suggests its own remedy, namely, in the record of larger periods. What is the mean of many states; of all the states? Does the general voice of ages affirm any principle, or is no community of sentiment discoverable in distant times and places? And when it shows the power of self-interest, <b>I</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> {{as a part of the}} divine law, and must reconcile it with aspiration the best I can.|$|E

In short, as <b>I</b> <b>accepted</b> the rising of the sun, <b>I</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>that</b> up above me was all that was fine and noble and gracious, all that gave decency and dignity to life, all that made life worth living and that remunerated one for his travail and misery." ...|$|R

2500|$|Chrétien, taking {{advantage}} of the furor, likened the Tories to the children who teased him {{when he was a boy}} in Shawinigan.

[...] Chrétien's approval ratings shot up, nullifying the only advantage the Progressive Conservatives still had over him. The Tories also pointed out that Chrétien himself had used his half-paralyzed face in the campaign, with Liberal signs in Quebec that translated as [...] "Strange-looking face, but reflect on what's inside."
