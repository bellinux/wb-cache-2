5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the Magic Wand {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b>|$|E
5|$|Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Berrios {{regularly}} accepted {{hundreds of}} thousands of dollars a year in campaign contributions from lawyers who appealed property tax assessments before the Board. Berrios controls five personal political action committees, not including the fund for the Cook County Democratic Party, which he also controls. Berrios collected more than $3 million in political contributions between 2000 and 2010, 64 percent from property tax appeal lawyers. About one-third of Berrios’ campaign contributions in that decade came from the 15 property tax appeal law firms that gained the most <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> between 2006 and 2008, contributing almost $1 million to six political action committees controlled by Berrios and his daughter, Illinois State Representative Maria Antonia Berrios, Democrat of the 39th Illinois House district on Chicago's northwest side. Berrios started 2008 with $1.2 million in just one of his several campaign funds, much of it from attorneys who appeared before him.|$|E
5|$|During a {{night out}} in {{the one of the}} Zones – the cordoned off zone of {{decaying}} ghettos surrounding the City of London – Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike's former mistress. Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader might be a better option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to shop for arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Columbia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son.|$|E

25|$|Irish {{independence}} in 1921 was marked more by continuity with the British legal system than with change. The legal profession remained divided between barristers (or abhcóidí in Irish) and solicitors (or aturnaetha in Irish). There was some blurring {{of the distinction}} between their roles over the years. Notably, under Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971, solicitors were granted a right of audience in all courts, although in practice relatively few solicitors act as advocates <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> in the Superior Courts.|$|E
25|$|Politicians court mafiosi {{to obtain}} votes during elections. A mafioso's mere {{endorsement}} {{of a certain}} candidate can be enough <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients,</b> relatives, and associates to vote for that candidate. A particularly influential mafioso can bring in thousands of votes for a candidate; such is the respect that a mafioso can command. The Italian Parliament has {{a huge number of}} seats (945, roughly 1 per 64,000 citizens) and a large number of political parties competing for them, meaning that a candidate can win with only a few thousand votes. A mafia clan's support can thus be decisive for their success.|$|E

25|$|Abramoff also {{admitted}} that as one means of accomplishing results <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients,</b> he, Scanlon, and others {{engaged in a}} pattern of corruptly providing things of value to public officials, including trips, campaign contributions, and meals and entertainment, {{with the intent to}} influence acts by the public officials that would benefit Abramoff and Abramoff’s clients. For example, Abramoff and Scanlon provided things of value to a public official (described as Representative #1) and members of his staff, including, but not limited to, a lavish trip to Scotland to play golf on world-famous courses, tickets to sporting events and other entertainment, regular meals at Abramoff’s upscale restaurant, and campaign contributions for the Representative, his political action committee, his campaign committee, and other political committees on behalf of the Representative. At the same time, and in exchange for these things of value, Scanlon and Abramoff sought and received the Representative’s agreement to perform directly and through others a series of official acts, including but not limited to agreements to support and pass legislation, and agreements to place statements in the Congressional Record.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients,</b> particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the most}} {{successful}} property tax appeal law firms in Cook County have strong political connections. From 2006 to 2008, the tax appeal law firms that received the largest reductions <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> were those of Representative Michael J. Madigan (the Illinois House Speaker, a Chicago Democrat and close ally of Berrios), Patrick J. Cullerton (the brother of Illinois State Senator John Cullerton, the president of the Illinois Senate), and Chicago Alderman Edward M. Burke. Simultaneously, Berrios worked as a registered lobbyist to Illinois state government on issues such as legalizing video poker. Berrios lobbies Madigan and Cullerton in Springfield, while the Assessor is critical to the lucrative commercial real-estate tax appeals practices of law firms, including those of Madigan and Cullerton. [...] "Illinois, thy name is conflict of interest," [...] wrote Better Government Association Executive Director Andy Shaw in the Chicago Tribune in 2009. [...] "Even by Illinois’s loose conflict of interest standards, the obviousness of the Madigan-Berrios connection is stupefying," [...] wrote Chicago Magazine in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Custodian {{banks are}} often {{referred}} to as global custodians if they safe keep assets <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients</b> in multiple jurisdictions around the world, using their own local branches or other local custodian banks ("sub-custodian" [...] or [...] "agent banks") with which they contract to be in their [...] "global network" [...] in each market to hold accounts for their respective clients.

2500|$|The {{presiding}} adjudicator {{is normally}} called [...] "Mister/Madam Chair". As {{is the case}} in court, lawyers routinely appear in tribunals advocating matters <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> A person does not require a lawyer to appear before an administrative tribunal. Indeed, many of these tribunals are specifically designed to be more representative to unrepresented litigants than courts. Furthermore, some of these tribunals are part of a comprehensive dispute-resolution system, which may emphasize mediation rather than litigation. For example, provincial human rights commissions routinely use mediation to resolve many human rights complaints without the need for a hearing.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Elle {{surveyed}} the American leading stylists {{and asked them}} to name the star whose hair was a favourite <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>clients.</b> More than 50 percent gave Bündchen the title of best hair in Hollywood. In February 2008, a survey by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) asked the question, [...] "What influences do celebrities have on the decisions patients make"? The survey was sent to more than 20,000 plastic surgeons in 84 countries. Bündchen was among the most frequently mentioned celebrities. Bündchen won the abdomen and hair categories and placed second in the breasts category.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 the {{government}} mandated Unbundled Bitstream Service (UBS) at a maximum upstream bandwidth of 128 kbit/s. This allowed ISPs to bill <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>client's</b> data usage.

25|$|A {{protection}} racketeer cannot tolerate competition {{within their}} {{sphere of influence}} from another racketeer. If a dispute erupted between two clients protected by rival racketeers, the two racketeers would have to fight each other to win the dispute <b>for</b> <b>their</b> respective <b>client.</b> The outcomes of such fights can be unpredictable (not to mention bloody), and neither racketeer could guarantee a victory <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>client.</b> This would make their protection unreliable and of little value. <b>Their</b> <b>clients</b> might dismiss them and settle the dispute by other means, and their reputations would suffer. To prevent this, mafia clans negotiate territories {{in which they can}} monopolize the use of violence in settling disputes. This is not always done peacefully, and disputes over protection territories are at the root of most Mafia wars.|$|R
