50|$|About 1750, Granville {{began to}} become {{concerned}} about irregularities in the accounts from <b>his</b> <b>agents</b> {{in regards to}} the issuance of land grants.

Despite Granville's instructions, complaints (particularly regarding allegations of exorbitant fees) from land holders and prospective purchasers increased throughout the decade. One such problem involved Henry McCulloh, who had received a large royal grant of land, some of which lay within Granville's district. Granville gave McCulloh permission to settle the land. But in 1752, he learned that <b>his</b> <b>agents</b> had issued grants on McCulloh's land. McCulloh and Granville disputed the areas, sometimes threatening legal action. They eventually were able to negotiate a series of agreements.|$|R
