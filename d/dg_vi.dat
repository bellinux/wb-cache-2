40|$|The {{paper is}} a pre-study {{to a broader}} project on agenda-setting and {{policy-making}} as regards agri-environment in EU and five member states. The main hypotheses are that: 1) traditional agricultural agenda setting and policy-making {{takes place in a}} rather closed segment characterised by a fixed institutional set-up both in member states and at EU level, despite the many differences otherwise between national and EU policy-making; 2) that environmental agenda setting and policy-making is characterised by a much weaker segmentation and firm institutional set-up and that this will vary depending upon which environmental issue is on the agenda. It is claimed that this is the situation both in member states and at EU level; 3) that agri-environmental questions [...] together with other new issues like animal welfare and health [...] will contribute to erode the traditionally strong agricultural policy segment. Both in member states and at EU-level, agri-environmental issues are usually decided upon in the ministries of agriculture and at <b>DG</b> <b>VI</b> (agriculture) respectively. The new issues are in many cases put forward with so much vigour by environmentalists, experts [...] and some member states in the case of EU [...] that the old segments have been forced to open for new agendas, new lobby groups and new institutions if the ministries and <b>DG</b> <b>VI</b> want to keep the new issues within their authority. The paper leaves it as an open question if the policy network model will be the most appropriate theoretical point of departure when looking at the EU level. As long as the agri-environmental question is relatively new, it seems that the ‘garbage can model’ best captures the vivid reality...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{immunization}} of foxes against rabies, by distributing vaccine-baits in the field, {{has been}} in progress since 1993 {{in the whole of}} the infected area of Belgium (10 000 km²). A vaccinia-rabies recombinant virus (VR-G) was used as vaccine because of its efficacy, safety and heat-stability. The successive campaigns of fox vaccination have induced a drastic decrease in rabies incidence and in 1993 there were no cases of rabies detected in the fox population. A marked decrease of human post-exposure treatments and the elimination of the disease in domestic animals have been the consequence of fox rabies control.

40|$|In {{response}} to Brazil's {{threat of a}} WTO action against the EU sugar regime, the European Commission has accused Brazil of being responsible for recent low world sugar prices. Speaking at the Agra Europe Outlook Conference, Lars Hoelgaard, the Director for Crops in <b>DG</b> <b>VI,</b> pointed out that 'Brazil has been expanding its own production of sugar dramatically over the last ten years' and was now looking to increase its exports to an estimated 12 million tonnes from between 2 to 3 million tonnes. He maintained that Brazilian production is 'clearly outstripping the increase in demand and depressing prices and that's creating a further imbalance'. In contrast, the Commission has highlighted how its own export policy for sugar is entirely within WTO rules. Comment: The EU's sugar export may be entirely within WTO rules but this is largely because the rules were structured to accommodate the 5 to 6 million tonnes which the EU has been exporting to the world market in recent years, despite the EU {{being one of the}} highest cost sugar producers in the world. In {{response to}} Brazil's threat of a WTO action [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the capability of}} our previously published undoped Double-Gate (DG) MOSFET explicit and analytical compact model to also forecast {{the effect of the}} volume inversion (VI) on the intrinsic capacitances. For that purpose, we present simulation results for these capacitances. We show now that the model presents an accurate dependence on the silicon layer thickness, consistent with two-dimensional numerical simulations, for both thin and thick silicon films. As opposed to our previous work, here we test the capacitance model for three different film thicknesses and also show that the transition from VI regime to dual gate behaviour is well simulated. We demonstrate in this paper that even if the current drive and transconductance are enhanced in VI regime, our results show that intrinsic capacitances are higher as well, which may limit the high-speed (delay time) behaviour of <b>DG</b> MOSFETs under <b>VI</b> regime. The good agreement between the numerical simulations and our model shows the high potential of our complete DG MOSFET model. c 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Anglai...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents a}} description of the Community typology for agricultural holdings and the way how that is applied in Finland. The objective of the Community typology is to achieve a uniform classification of holdings in the European Union. The classification is based on the type of farming and the economic size, which are determined on the basis of standard gross margin. The Community typology for agricultural holding and the statistics where it is applied, the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community farm structure survey are based to the EU legislation. Joining to the EU in 1995 has meant that the stipulations concerning the typology and its applications entered into force also in Finland. The first half of this publication presents a thorough description of the Community typology as well as its main applications. This part also includes the description of the method of classifying the holdings in parallel statistics in Finland. In the empirical part of the publication the Finnish farms are classified according the Community typology rules. The physical characteristics of the holdings are based on the Rural Business Register. The standard gross margins for each characteristic are calculated for four geografical regions in a way agreed with Eurostat and <b>DG</b> <b>VI.</b> The outcome is the breakdown of Finnish farms by type farming and by economic size based on the Community typology. The first concrete applications of the new typology system in Finland are the determination of the sample needed for the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community Farm Structure Survey. In {{the last part of the}} publication the first sample for FADN in Finland is determined. The Community typology has many benefits in the future in Finland. It will be one important base for international comparations between holdings. It also facilitates for example the development of the calculation the results of Finnish bookkeeping farms. When the same typology is used the results of the bookkeeping farms can be extrapolated to those field of observation. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The community typology for agricultural holdings in Finlan...|$|E
