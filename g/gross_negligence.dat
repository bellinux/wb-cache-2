5000|$|The most {{culpable}} {{mens rea}} elements will have both foresight and desire on a subjective basis. Recklessness usually arises when an accused is actually {{aware of the}} potentially adverse consequences to the planned actions, but has gone ahead anyway, exposing a particular individual or unknown victim {{to the risk of}} suffering the foreseen harm but not actually desiring that the victim be hurt. The accused is a social danger because they gamble with the safety of others, and the fact they might have acted to try to avoid the injury from occurring is relevant only to mitigate the sentence. Note that <b>gross</b> criminal <b>negligence</b> represents such a serious failure to foresee that in any other person, it would have been recklessness. Hence, the alternative phrase [...] "wilful blindness" [...] acknowledges the link representing either that the accused deliberately engineered a situation in which they were ignorant of material facts, or that the failure to foresee represented such a danger to others that it must be treated as though it was reckless.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the scathing {{review of}} White's claims, the {{technological}} determinist {{aspect of the}} stirrup is still in debate. Alex Roland, author of [...] "Once More into the Stirrups; Lynne White Jr, Medieval Technology and Social Change", provides an intermediary stance: not necessarily lauding White's claims, but providing a little defense against Sawyer and Hilton's allegations of <b>gross</b> intellectual <b>negligence.</b> Roland views White's focus on technology {{to be the most}} relevant and important aspect of Medieval Technology and Social Change rather than the particulars of its execution: [...] "But can these many virtues, can this utility for historians of technology, outweigh the most fundamental standards of the profession? Can historians of technology continue to read and assign a book that is, {{in the words of a}} recent critic, [...] "shot through with over-simplification, with a progression of false connexions between cause and effect, and with evidence presented selectively to fit with White's own pre-conceived ideas"? The answer, I think, is yes, at least a qualified yes (Roland, 574-575)." [...] Objectively, Roland claims Medieval Technology and Social Change a variable success, at least as [...] "Most of White's argument stands... the rest has sparked useful lines of research (Roland, 584)." [...] This acceptance of technological determinism is ambiguous at best, neither fully supporting the theory at large nor denouncing it, rather placing the construct firmly in the realm of the theoretical. Roland neither views technological determinism as completely dominant over history nor completely absent as well; in accordance with the above criterion of technological determinist structure, would Roland be classified as a [...] "soft determinist".|$|R

5000|$|Lake (Max Beesley) realises {{that despite}} his friendly, {{professional}} demeanour and strong academics, his colleague, Hurley (Patrick Baladi), is an incompetent surgeon who regularly bungles surgical procedures, {{to the detriment}} of his patients. Hurley is, however, protected by the principle [...] "Doctors look after doctors", a phrase often repeated throughout the series. Initially, Lake is also protected by this principle, when his involvement in a death of a patient is covered up, although this death haunts him. Initially, Lake seeks to become a whistleblower, after seeing Hurley's <b>gross</b> incompetence and <b>negligence,</b> particularly after he badly mishandles a birth in which an abruption occurs, leaving the mother with substantial brain damage. The anaesthetist for the operation, Dr. Maria Orton (Susan Lynch), makes an official complaint against Hurley, but her colleagues close ranks around him. The pregnant Dr. Orton is ostracised, and the stress of the situation causes her to miscarry. She is eventually sectioned and admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Pressure from outside authorities, hospital politics and blackmail from Hurley eventually forces Lake into silence. Unable to oust him yet forced to work with him, Lake soon seeks a way out and finds a post at another hospital. But Hurley, despite agreeing that he should move on, changes his mind, ruins Lake's chance to escape by informing his new employers of Lake's mistakes and his real reasons for wanting to leave. At the end of the season, Hurley is shown to be in line for promotion as the hospital's clinical director. Lake, trapped in his job, comes clean to the relatives of the patient whose death he caused, so that, in his own words, he may be judged. The series ends on this cliffhanger.|$|R

500|$|There are {{two general}} types of homicide, murder and manslaughter. Murder {{requires}} an intention {{to kill or}} an intention to commit grievous bodily harm. If this intention is present {{but there are certain}} types of mitigating factors [...] loss of control, diminished responsibility, or pursuance of a suicide pact [...] then this is voluntary manslaughter. There are two types of involuntary manslaughter. Firstly, it may be [...] "constructive" [...] or [...] "unlawful act" [...] manslaugher, where a lesser but inherently criminal and dangerous act has caused the death. Alternatively, manslaughter may be caused by <b>gross</b> <b>negligence,</b> where the defendant has broken a duty of care over the victim, where that breach has led to the death, and is sufficiently gross as to warrant criminalisation.|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, Transocean {{agreed to}} pay US$1.4 billion for {{violations}} of the US Clean Water Act.

In September 2014, Halliburton agreed to settle {{a large percentage of}} legal claims against them by paying $1.1 billion into a trust by way of three installments over two years. On 4 September 2014, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ruled BP was guilty of <b>gross</b> <b>negligence</b> and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA). He described BP's actions as [...] "reckless," [...] while he said Transocean's and Halliburton's actions were [...] "negligent."

500|$|The typical {{case will}} be of a non-fatal offence against the person that causes death. There must be a {{criminal}} act, rather than an omission, following R v Lowe. Although acts and omissions may be equally culpable, the extension to omissions [...] {{where there is no}} need to show intent [...] would have made illegal a huge class of persons. Cases such as Lowe, which there was parental neglect, can be dealt with by <b>gross</b> <b>negligence</b> manslaughter. Judges have often failed to identify a single unlawful act on which the crime of manslaughter is to be constructed, rather assuming the presence of one in particular circumstances. There is a required mental element (mens rea) for this crime, but it has in some cases not actually been formally established. This mens rea might be very low, such as recklessness. The requirement of an unlawful act also means that no lawful defence must be available to the defendant in respect of the lesser crime.|$|E
500|$|The act must be {{inherently}} criminal [...] {{the case}} in point is that of R v Andrews, where the defendant had killed whilst driving dangerously. It was only the fact that the driving was dangerous that made it a crime, not the driving itself. Accordingly, Andrews removed driving and regulatory offences from the scope of constructive manslaughter. There are separate rules for causing death by dangerous driving and some regulatory offences. Some commentators took Andrews as excluding strict liability and negligence cases out of constructive manslaughter, although contrary to the exact wording in the judgment there; however, a separate case also called R v Andrews convicted the defendant of constructive manslaughter based on a strict liability offence and this alternative proposition cannot be supported. <b>Gross</b> <b>negligence</b> manslaughter exists as a complementary form, and, if a driver was sufficiently negligent, as well he might, he would be liable for it. This provides an additional reason to exclude such cases from constructive manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|In the end, {{none of the}} {{senators}} was charged with any crime. Instead, the Senate Ethics Committee investigated them. [...] Robert S. Bennett, who was the special investigator for the committee, wanted to drop any action against McCain and Senator John Glenn, {{on the grounds of}} insufficient evidence, but the committee disagreed. [...] After public hearings, McCain was mildly rebuked by the committee for exercising [...] "poor judgment" [...] in intervening with the federal regulators on Keating's behalf, but its 1991 report said that McCain's [...] "actions were not improper nor attended with <b>gross</b> <b>negligence</b> and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him....Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate." [...] (In later years, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated a contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target.) [...] On his Keating Five experience, McCain said: [...] "The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Once a {{duty of care}} (or duty to act, as required) {{has been}} shown, the jury should then be asked, {{following}} Lord Mackay in R v Adamoko: [...] "having regard {{to the risk of}} death involved, [...] the conduct of the defendant... so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to a criminal act or omission". This has two elements: firstly, the breach of the duty of care must relate to the risk of death (confirmed in R v Singh), and not to any lesser harm. In other words, the breach of the duty of care must cause the victim's death. Secondly the breach of the duty of care must be so egregious as to amount to a crime. For example, on the fact of Adomako itself, the defendant, an anaesthetist, failed to spot a problem with the victim's breathing tube for 11 minutes, something expert evidence suggested a competent anaesthetist would spot within thirty seconds or so. The defendant was convicted. This definition has been opposed as being circular, as defining the crime of manslaughter as <b>gross</b> <b>negligence</b> as being negligence to a criminal degree. The jury may, under this characterisation, be ruling upon a point of law and not a point of fact.|$|E
500|$|A {{homicide}} can {{be brought}} about through act or omission. Baker, notes [...] "R v Evans [...] EWCA Crim 650, [...] 1 WLR 1999 holds that if a person merely facilitates another to create a dangerous situation for himself, that person may be held criminally liable for a homicide offence if that self-endangerment results in death. Evans's sister made an intervening choice to self-inject {{and it was her}} independent self-injection that was the direct cause of the dangerous situation. Evans's pre-existing duty of care was grounded on her act of supply and her awareness of the fact that her act of supply had facilitated the creation of a dangerous and life-threatening situation. Evans did not create the dangerous situation, but rather she merely made an indirect causative contribution to the dangerous situation. Furthermore, if she had merely supplied the drugs and had left the scene, and therefore had remained ignorant of the fact that her act of supply had resulted in a dangerous overdose situation, her act of mere supply per se would not have been sufficient for a conviction of <b>gross</b> <b>negligence</b> manslaughter." [...] Baker, Dennis J, Omissions Liability for Homicide Offences: Reconciling R V Kennedy with R V Evans (May 21, 2012). (2010) 74 Journal of Criminal Law 310. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2063709 Elsewhere Baker argues: [...] "In R. v. Evans, [...] Gemma Evans, a 24-year-old woman, purchased heroin and supplied her 16-year-old sister, Carly. Carly self-injected in a house in which she resided with Evans (the defendant) and her mother. After injecting the drug she developed and complained of symptoms consistent with an overdose. Evans appreciated that Carly’s condition was very serious and indicative of an overdose and, together with her mother, Andrea Townsend, who was also convicted of manslaughter, believed that she was responsible for Carly’s care. “The appellant described in a later interview with the police that she had seen that Carly’s lips had turned blue, that she was ‘in a mess’, and was incapable of responding to attempts to speak to her. The appellant and her mother decided not to seek medical assistance because they feared that they themselves and possibly Carly would get into trouble.” [...] Instead, they put Carly in bed with the hope that she would make a miraculous recovery. The defendant and her mother checked on Carly occasionally and slept in the same room, but tragically, Carly died during the night. The medical evidence demonstrated that {{the cause of death was}} heroin poisoning. Evans and Townsend were charged with manslaughter.... Lord Judge C.J. held that Gemma Evans assisted Carly Evans to create a dangerous situation and was aware of the danger she assisted Carly to bring about for herself and that these two factors gave rise to a duty of reasonable rescue. [...] The mother was convicted on the basis of her parental duty, which required her to take reasonable steps to summon assistance. Since Evans was an older half-sister, she was not covered by the parental duty doctrine. Instead, a new law had to be minted to catch her conduct. [...] The new law being that mere assistance gives rise to duty of care. Since Evans assisted her sister’s overdose by supplying the drug she had a duty to summon help once she realised [...] her sister was in peril. This category of duty is a newly minted one. Arguably, the courts cannot create further situations (or declare further relationships such as roommate/roommate) [...] where a duty will be imposed the breach of which will amount to manslaughter. [...] Hence, the categories should be regarded as closed. [...] Cases not covered by the aforementioned duties should not give rise to a duty of care. It is arguable that since the conduct in R. v. Evans [...] (assisting another to create a dangerous situation for herself) is not covered by the R. v. Miller [...] doctrine (perpetrating an act that directly creates a dangerous situation), nor by the category of duty as set down in R. v. Stone, [...] the Court of Appeal should have held that Evans had no duty of care. There is nothing wrong with applying R. v. Miller [...] to a manslaughter case, but the court extended the R. v. Miller doctrine to cover mere facilitation, and then applied that new doctrine to manslaughter. The category of duty created in R. v. Evans seems to contravene the ruling in R. v. Rimmington, [...] which holds that judges cannot extend common law offences to cover new forms of conduct. It is one thing to apply an existing doctrine to new facts, and another to apply it to conceptually different conduct such as assistance rather than perpetration." [...] Dennis J.
