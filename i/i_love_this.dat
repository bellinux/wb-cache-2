We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

The lyrics deal with being completely intoxicated at a party.

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>this</b> {{song for}} many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs.

It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy.

The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>this</b> mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E

500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic complimented {{the opening}} scene with the gun purchase, which he called [...] "reminiscent of season one, when the show took the slow, {{fascinating}} steps that no other program would touch".

Craig McQuinn of The Faster Times enjoyed {{the slow pace of}} the episode and complimented the show's lack of predictability, claiming {{he had no idea how}} Walter's confrontation with Gus would end, [...] "and that’s why <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>this</b> show". Michael Arbeiter of Hollywood.com compared {{the opening scene}} to the works of Quentin Tarantino, and called the bar Mike frequents [...] "the most beautifully shot setting I've seen in TV lately". He also called the subplot between Marie and Hank a [...] "surprisingly interesting story". Carl Williott of CNN complimented the shows' [...] "clever pieces of misdirection" [...] by having Walter purchase a gun but never getting to use it, and by showing Mike's conflicted emotions but having him side with Gus against Walter. However, Williott said the episode ultimately felt like a [...] "placeholder" [...] for bigger developments in the storyline. Not all reviews were entirely positive. CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell said Walter's near-assassination of Gus was [...] "the highlight of the episode", but felt Jesse's story was [...] "less compelling [...] extremely repetitive", and he found the subplot with Hank and Marie difficult to enjoy because Hank was so unsympathetic.|$|E
