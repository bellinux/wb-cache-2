40|$|General Motors and the A C. Rochester Company, a {{subsidiary}} of General Motors (GM), {{has found that the}} robber <b>diaphragms</b> on automatic speed control mechanisms (servos) were gnawed by unknown rodents. House mice (Mus musculus), Peromyscus spp., and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were used to test gnawing behavior on 4 kinds of <b>diaphragms.</b> <b>Diaphragms</b> with or without a rodent proof cure formula, which are used by GM, did not influence the gnawing of all test rodent species. <b>Diaphragms</b> with a lubricant (Paricin) were more attractive to gnawing by house mice than <b>diaphragms</b> without a lubricant. Five objects with different texture were used to detect gnawing preference of house mice and 3 objects were used on Peromyscus. The textures of <b>diaphragms</b> and nylon discs were not significantly preferred by house mice compared to the textures of corks and wood blocks. Rubber stoppers were gnawed less than wood blocks and corks by house mice and Peromyscus, but the differences were not significant. Results indicate that the presence of a rigid and protective edge on the <b>diaphragms</b> was a critical factor in attracting rodent gnawing. To test this possibility, <b>diaphragms</b> on servos supported by aluminum piston heads with 3 different beveled edges were presented to captive Peromyscus. The amount of gnawing was not significantly different among the <b>diaphragms</b> supported by the different piston heads. Once the gnawing was initiated, continued gnawing was thought to be dependent on the texture of objects...|$|R

5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the <b>diaphragm,</b> which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the <b>diaphragm</b> flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the <b>diaphragm</b> has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the <b>diaphragm,</b> which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E

40|$|Slit <b>diaphragms</b> are {{essential}} {{components of the}} glomerular filtration apparatus, as changes in these junctions are the hallmark of proteinuric diseases. Slit <b>diaphragms,</b> considered specialized adherens junctions, contain both unique membrane proteins (e. g., nephrin, podocin, and Neph 1) and typical adherens junction proteins (e. g., P-cadherin, FAT, and catenins). Whether slit <b>diaphragms</b> also contain tight junction proteins is unknown. Here, immunofluorescence, immunogold labeling, and cell fractionation demonstrated that rat slit <b>diaphragms</b> contain the tight junction proteins JAM-A (junctional adhesion molecule A), occludin, and cingulin. We found these proteins in the same protein complexes as nephrin, podocin, CD 2 AP, ZO- 1, and Neph 1 by cosedimentation, coimmunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays. PAN nephrosis increased the protein levels of JAM-A, occludin, cingulin, and ZO- 1 several-fold in glomeruli and loosened their attachment to the actin cytoskeleton. These data extend current information about the molecular composition of slit <b>diaphragms</b> by demonstrating the presence of tight junction proteins, although slit <b>diaphragms</b> lack the characteristic morphologic features of tight junctions. The contribution of these proteins to the assembly of slit <b>diaphragms</b> and potential signaling cascades requires further investigation...|$|R

Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the <b>diaphragm</b> occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the <b>diaphragm</b> to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing.

5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the <b>diaphragm.</b> The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the <b>diaphragm.</b> It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
40|$|Glomerular visceral {{epithelial}} cells (podocytes) contain interdigitated processes that form specialized intercellular junctions, termed slit <b>diaphragms,</b> which provide a selective filtration barrier in the renal glomerulus. Analyses of disease-causing mutations in familial nephrotic syndromes and targeted mutagenesis in mice have revealed critical roles of several proteins {{in the assembly}} of slit <b>diaphragms.</b> The nephrin–podocin complex is the main constituent of slit <b>diaphragms.</b> However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these proteins to maintain the slit <b>diaphragms</b> are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the PAR 3 –atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) –PAR 6 b cell polarity proteins co-localize to the slit <b>diaphragms</b> with nephrin. Furthermore, selective depletion of aPKCl in mouse podocytes results in the disassembly of slit <b>diaphragms,</b> a disturbance in apico-basal cell polarity, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The aPKC–PAR 3 complex associates with the nephrin–podocin complex in podocytes through direct interaction between PAR 3 and nephrin, and the kinase activity of aPKC {{is required for the}} appropriate distribution of nephrin and podocin in podocytes.

Using a specific antibody to the extracellular domain of PV- 1, we have extended the survey on the presence of this protein at light and electron microscope level in several rat organs. Here we show that by immunofluorescence the antibody recognizes with high specificity the endothelium of the fenestrated peritubular capillaries of the kidney and those of the intestinal villi, pancreas, and adrenals. By immunolocalization at electron microscope level, the antibody recognizes specifically the <b>diaphragms</b> of the fenestrae and the stomatal <b>diaphragms</b> of caveolae and transendothelial channels in the endothelia of these vascular beds.

5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the <b>diaphragm,</b> and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the <b>diaphragm</b> will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously.

The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the <b>diaphragm</b> and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E

We investigated the expression of Fog 2 and proteins of myogenesis in a series of CDH and in <b>diaphragms</b> at different fetal ages, in order to clarify the role of muscular components during diaphragmatic development in cases with CDH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimen were obtained from seven <b>diaphragms</b> of CDH cases undergoing surgery, 3 entire <b>diaphragms</b> from non repaired CDH, 5 control <b>diaphragms</b> at different gestational ages (16, 17, 22, 32, and 40 g. w.), and 3 biopsy samples of normal voluntary muscle.

40|$|FAT is a {{component}} of glomerular slit <b>diaphragms.</b> BackgroundSlit <b>diaphragms</b> are intercellular junctions of podocytes of the renal glomerulus. The molecular composition of slit <b>diaphragms</b> is still elusive. Slit <b>diaphragms</b> are characterized {{by the presence of}} a wide intercellular space. The morphological feature is shared by desmosomes and adherens junctions, which contain members of the cadherin superfamily. Thus, we have hypothesized that some components of slit <b>diaphragms</b> belong to the cadherin superfamily. Consequently, we have isolated cDNA encoding FAT from reverse-transcribed (RT) glomerular cDNA by homology polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers based on conserved sequences in cadherin molecules. FAT is a novel member of the cadherin superfamily with 34 tandem cadherin-like extracellular repeats, and it closely resembles the Drosophila tumor suppressor fat. MethodsExpression of FAT was examined in glomeruli of the adult rat kidney by the ribonuclease protection assay and in situ hybridization. To localize the FAT protein in podocytes minutely, we prepared affinity-purified antibody against FAT by immunizing rabbits against an oligopeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids. ResultsExpression of FAT mRNA was detected in total RNA from glomeruli. In situ hybridization revealed significant signals in podocytes. Western blot analysis using solubilized glomeruli showed a single band, in which the molecular weight was more than 500 kD. Immunostaining of cultured epithelial cells from rat kidney (NRK 52 E) revealed FAT accumulation in cell–cell contact sites. In the glomerulus, FAT staining was observed distinctly along glomerular capillary walls. Double-label immunostaining using monoclonal antibody against slit <b>diaphragms</b> (mAb 5 - 1 - 6) showed identical localization of anti-FAT antibody and mAb 5 - 1 - 6. Furthermore, the double-label immunogold technique with ultrathin cryosections demonstrated that gold particles for FAT cytoplasmic domain were located at the base of slit <b>diaphragms</b> labeled by mAb 5 - 1 - 6 and that the cytoplasmic domain of FAT colocalized with ZO- 1, a cytoplasmic component associated with slit <b>diaphragms.</b> ConclusionThe molecular structure of FAT and its colocalization with 5 - 1 - 6 antigen and ZO- 1 indicate that FAT is {{a component}} of slit <b>diaphragms...</b>|$|R
