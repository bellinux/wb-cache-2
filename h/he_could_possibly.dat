He wrote his autobiography, entitled Playing to Win, in 1971. After {{several years in}} Britain, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, {{to help with the}} racial situation there. It was there that he met his wife Patricia, a local newscaster, with whom he had three daughters.|$|E
25|$|The elders {{circumscribed}} {{the power}} of the Ashantihene, and the chiefs of other divisions considerably checked {{the power of}} the King. This in practical effect created a system of checks and balances. As the symbol of the nation, the Ashantihene received significant deference ritually, for the context was religious in that he was a symbol {{of the people in the}} flesh: the living, dead or yet to be born. When the king committed an act not approved of by the counsel of elders or the people, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be impeached, and demoted to a commoner.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the loan}} spell, Schmeichel {{requested}} that he would be allowed to stay on at Cardiff for a longer period and on 22 November, the loan spell was extended until the new year, with manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stating that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> stay at the club {{for the rest of the}} season providing Manchester City do not suffer an injury crisis. After Eriksson named Joe Hart as the number one goalkeeper at Manchester City, however, Andreas Isaksson requested a transfer. This meant that Eriksson would not allow Cardiff to keep Schmeichel after his initial loan period ended on 2 January. On 31 December, Eriksson threw Cardiff a lifeline by opening talks for Schmeichel to stay at Ninian Park. Schmeichel would be allowed to stay for two more matches should Isaksson not move until late in the January transfer window. Schmeichel had stated he would like to play for Cardiff again in the future. Schmeichel, however, returned to Eastlands the day after his initial loan expired.|$|E
25|$|Two {{companies}} of 2/2nd KAR came {{up against the}} German vanguard's flank on the Lioma-Muanhupa road around 12.00, immediately starting a stubborn, but stagnant firefight with Abt Müller and Abt Göring. Other elements of the 2/2nd and 3/2nd KAR attempted to flank this vanguard and attack the German main body in order to scatter its carriers and capture its supplies, which would have meant a heavy logistical blow for the Schutztruppe. Well covered by the bush and the rugged hills, however, the German main body evaded the British {{to the west and}} managed to move eastwards along the road, and then on a trail into the northern hills. After encountering 2/2nd and 3/2nd KAR, Lettow-Vorbeck initially assumed that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> destroy them with a determinded counter-attack using all his forces; this plan was dropped, however, {{when it became clear that}} the German main body had already too far advanced northwards to be called back for an assault. Meanwhile, unknown to the Germans, 1/2nd KAR marched southwest along the Lioma-Muanhupa road, and encountered parts of the Schutztruppe's rearguard by 14.30. Completely surprising the defenders, 1/2nd KAR managed to overrun a whole enemy field hospital largely unopposed. Hindered in its advance only by a few snipers, 1/2nd KAR then moved into the northern hills, where the German main body and the remaining rearguard were located, and promptly came under machine gun fire. This only briefly halted the King's African Rifles soldiers, and overall the German rearguard offered only light resistance to 1/2nd KAR until it was forced to retreat northwards in disorder around 15.00.|$|E
500|$|He {{knew him}} to be not over-scrupulous. He had seen him at Knott Mill Fair and Dirt Fair (so called from its being held in muddy November), or at Kersal Moor Races, with more money to spend in pop, nuts, and gingerbread, shows and merry-go-rounds, flying boats and flying boxes, {{fighting}} cocks and fighting men, than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have saved out of the sum his father allowed him for pocket-money, {{even if he had}} been of the saving ...|$|E

500|$|The 1894 {{election}} campaign saw the Democrats divided, and the electorate further split {{by the new}} People's Party (or Populists), which had emerged from the agricultural discontent. There were more demands for McKinley to speak than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> fulfill. Campaigning throughout {{the eastern half of}} the country on behalf of Republican candidates, and venturing even to New Orleans in the Democratic Solid South, McKinley spoke to large, enthusiastic crowds as often as 23 times in a day. According to his biographer Margaret Leech, [...] "McKinley's fervor was irresistible to his audiences. He was better than a spellbinder. He was a vote-getter. The whirlwind campaign of the Governor of Ohio was a sensation of the autumn." [...] The 1894 elections saw the Democrats suffer the greatest losses by a majority party in congressional history, as the Republicans again took control of both houses.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Director's Cut" [...] {{restored}} roughly {{four minutes}} of deleted footage while cutting {{about five minutes}} of other material, leaving it about a minute shorter than the theatrical cut. Many of the changes were minor, such as altered sound effects, while the restored footage included the scene in which Ripley discovers the cocooned Dallas and Brett during her escape of the Nostromo. Fox released the Director's Cut in theaters on October 31, 2003. The Alien Quadrilogy box set was released December 2, 2003, with both versions of the film included along with a new commentary track featuring many of the film's actors, writers, and production staff, {{as well as other}} special features and a documentary entitled The Beast Within: The Making of Alien. Each film was also released separately as a DVD with both versions of the film included. Scott noted that he was very pleased with the original theatrical cut of Alien, saying that [...] "For all intents and purposes, I felt that the original cut of Alien was perfect. I still feel that way", and that the original 1979 theatrical version [...] "remains my version of choice". He has since stated that he considers both versions [...] "director's cuts", as he feels that the 1979 version was the best <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have made it at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Melville himself {{never saw}} these reviews, and Parker {{calls it a}} [...] "bitter irony" [...] that the {{reception}} overseas was [...] "all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have hoped for, short of a few conspicuous proclamations that the distance between him and Shakespeare {{was by no means}} immeasurable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bob Hoover {{believed}} that the rivalry of the Tu-144 and Concorde led the pilot of the Tu-144 to attempt a manoeuver that went beyond the abilities of the aircraft: [...] "That day, the Concorde went first, and after the pilot performed a high-speed flyby, he pulled up steeply and climbed to approximately 10,000 [...] before leveling off. When the Tu-144 pilot performed the same manoeuver he pulled the nose up so steeply l didn't believe <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> recover." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mau, who [...] "barely spoke English", {{decided that}} by {{reaching}} beyond his own culture, sharing {{what had been}} closely guarded knowledge, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> save it from extinction. Through this collaboration, Mau's mentorship helped [...] "spark pride in the Hawaiian and Polynesian culture", leading to [...] "a renaissance of voyaging, canoe building, and non-instrument navigation that has continued to grow, spreading across Polynesia (...) and reaching to its far corners of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Rapanui, Easter Island".|$|E
2500|$|On his arrival, he {{encountered}} Chateaubriand, who mentions {{him in his}} Mémoires d'Outre-tombe: [...] "M. de Vaublanc and M. Capelle joined us. The former said he had everything <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> need in his portfolio. You want Montesquieu? here you go; Bossuet? there you are." [...] He submitted to the King, via the Comte d'Artois, several essays {{on the state of}} the country, and predicted that His Majesty [...] "would be on his way back to Paris in two months or less." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2017, Bain {{appeared}} on the H3 Podcast, during which he discussed at length {{the current state of}} his cancer. He described his condition as [...] "stable" [...] (meaning the cancer was still present, but not spreading), as well as the mental and physical aspects of dealing with stage 4 cancer. During the podcast, he also discussed his opinions on the healthcare system in the United States, noting that without ObamaCare and its promise to cover preexisting conditions, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be left without health insurance.|$|E
2500|$|White and Lascaris hosted many {{dinner parties}} at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy {{part of the}} {{affluent}} eastern suburbs of Sydney. In Patrick White, A Life, his biographer David Marr portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends. Barrister Roderick Meagher, QC, despised White and described him as a [...] "great shit". He said White was terribly cruel to other people and as rude as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be, rude {{to all sorts of}} people who did not deserve it.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually a close {{friendship}} {{and a strong}} professional association developed between the elder Freud and Jung, which left a sizeable correspondence. For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (known in English as Psychology of the Unconscious), which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured—each stating that the other was unable to admit <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Henri Ellenberger called Jung's intense experience a [...] "creative illness" [...] and compared it favorably to Freud's own period of what he called neurasthenia and hysteria.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, Willis {{explained}} in a 1988 interview with KXAS-TV's entertainment reporter Bobbie Wygant that he acted out McClane with enough fear, anxiety, and vulnerability to make audiences believe that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> indeed <b>possibly</b> be killed {{because of what happened}} in the story, as Joseph Leland <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have died of his injuries in the book.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could see}} it," [...] said Rollo. And {{he looked as}} {{steadily}} and intently into the clear blue sky, as he could; but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>possibly</b> see the least sign of a star.|$|R
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} rise in his throat that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>possibly</b> swallow. <b>He</b> put his hand there, coughed, made faces, tried again to swallow it, coughed again, made faces again, looked all round the room, and fluttered his papers.|$|R
2500|$|In lines 1-8 {{the poet}} wonders how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> {{return to a}} happy from his travels as he is oppressed by the toil of work during the day, while emotionally and psychologically {{tortured}} by visions of the beloved by night. The cycle of misery {{is represented by the}} repetition of 'day…oppression…night…day…night…night…day…oppressed' in lines 3-4. Day and night are, in effect, [...] "tyrants ruling his own kingdom, each the enemy of the other, and encroaching on the other's boundaries." [...] This personification of tyranny is exhibited when the two kings [...] "shake hands" [...] in line 6; they make a truce to join in torturing the poet. Day tortures the poet [...] "by the toil of travel (27.1), and night tortures him to moan that the farther he goes as he toils, the farther he is from his beloved." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{no clear}} reason Scott took the dogs on 140miles further than {{originally}} planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) {{to feed the}} dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that {{it was discovered that}} the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot. He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot, within [...] of Scott, 4–10 March 1912 when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers, and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better.|$|E
2500|$|The Zohar {{compared}} Moses to Noah {{and found}} Moses superior. [...] For when God told Moses in [...] “Now therefore let me alone, that My anger may grow hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of {{you a great}} nation,” Moses immediately asked whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> abandon Israel for his own advantage. [...] Moses protested {{that the world would}} say that he had killed Israel and did to them as Noah did to his generation. [...] For when God bade Noah to save himself and his household from the Flood, Noah did not intercede on behalf of his generation, but let them perish. [...] It {{is for this reason that}} Scripture names the waters of the Flood after Noah, as [...] says, “For this is as the waters of Noah to me.” Thus, Moses sought mercy for his people, and God indeed showed them mercy.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately, Turgenev {{concludes that}} the truth is best left unstated. He concludes the novel by stating that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>possibly</b> explain what Lavretsky and Liza felt, {{and that it is}} better to point out these {{individual}} tragedies and pass them by.|$|R
60|$|He {{was not to}} {{be given}} much leisure, however, for fantastic reveries like this. As he leaned his head on his hands, gladly {{conscious}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>possibly</b> bear this incessant strain for long, Sheila opened the door. He started up.|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} a sight to see Mr. William shaking hands with his father, and patting him on the back, and rubbing him gently down with his hand, as if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>possibly</b> do enough to show an {{interest}} in him.|$|R
