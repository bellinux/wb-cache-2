Some of the convicts who were freed were engaged in agriculture, {{and those who were}} <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> service were given monetary compensation of US$25 per month.

5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained {{the right to vote}} in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E
5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|And Their Name Was Treason is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band A Day to Remember, {{released}} on May 10, 2005 through Indianola Records. It followed their second self-released EP, which was produced the same year. The album was the band's only release under Indianola; its success led the group sign to Victory Records. Several {{songs on the}} album were written during the band members' teenage years. Recorded in the producer's bedroom, the album contains audio excerpts from several films. The band toured in the United States to help promote the album. The album has since sold over 10,000 copies. A re-recorded version of the album, titled Old Record, was released in October 2008 by Victory. The band members later admitted that they were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the re-recording {{at the request of}} label owner Tony Brummel. The reissue charted at number 16 on the Heatseekers Album Chart in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Appearing {{as some of}} {{the more}} notable hostages are Ken Leung as Wing, who was distracted in the bank before the heist by the bosomy woman (played by Samantha Ivers) {{standing}} behind him and talking loudly on her phone; Gerry Vichi as Howard Kurtz, an elderly hostage suffering chest pains who is quickly released by the robbers; Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh bank clerk whose turban is removed by the cops, which is a religious sacrilege for a Sikh male; Peter Frechette as Peter Hammond, a bank employee whose attempt to hide his cell phone from Russell results in his getting beat; Amir Ali Said as Brian Robinson, an 8-year-old boy who speaks with both Russell and Frazier and who plays a killing video game; Ed Onipede Blunt as Ray Robinson, Brian's father; and Marcia Jean Kurtz, who plays an older woman who initially refuses to strip and is <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by Stevie. Kurtz's character is named Miriam Douglas; Kurtz played a hostage named Miriam in Dog Day Afternoon, a bank robbery film, which unlike Inside Man, contained significant violence. Lionel Pina, who also appeared in Dog Day Afternoon as a pizza delivery man, appears in Inside Man as a policeman who delivers pizzas at the bank's front doors.|$|E
5|$|While Carlito was {{recovering}} from an injury, {{he was involved in}} a comical angle with SmackDown!'s general manager, Theodore Long. The storyline consisted of Carlito being <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> demeaning chores around the arena, such as selling hot dogs, removing snow from parking lots with a shovel and mopping floors. As a result of these actions, Carlito created a petition in support of Long’s destitution, but was unsuccessful. On March 26, 2005, Colón performed {{for the first time in}} six months as Carlito, in a match against his younger brother Eddie Colón during an event in Caguas, Puerto Rico arriving to the stadium in a helicopter and under a massive standing ovation of the thousands of fans gather that night. Carlito made his WrestleMania debut in a non-wrestling role at WrestleMania 21, in which he interrupted an edition of Rowdy Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest. This event led to an angle in the World Wrestling Council, where Piper and Carlito were booked to wrestle a match on Friday Madness, a special event presented by the company, which Piper won. Following WrestleMania, Carlito created an interview segment entitled Carlito’s Cabana. Carlito then entered a feud with The Big Show after a spot where Show refused an offer to work in an enforcer role for Carlito. This feud involved Carlito tricking Show into eating a poisoned apple, and Matt Morgan becoming Carlito's enforcer. This feud ended with Carlito defeating Show at Judgment Day.|$|E

25|$|Due to the devadasi being equated to prostitutes, {{they also}} became {{associated}} with the spreading of venereal disease in India. During the British Colonial period, many British soldiers were exposed to venereal disease in the various brothels being operated at that time.

In efforts to control the spread of venereal disease, the British Government mandated that all prostitutes register themselves, with devadasis being <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this as well, as they were thought to be prostitutes by the British Government.|$|E
