5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background {{information for the}} band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned.

5|$|Since 1999 or earlier, an {{increasingly}} {{large number of}} migrants and refugees started to arrive {{in the vicinity of}} Calais, living in the Calais jungle, the nickname given to a series of makeshift camps. The people lived there while they attempted to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom by stowing away on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains travelling through the Port of Calais or the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal.

Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland plantation areas, but many households had domestic slaves, and many other slaves worked on the waterfront and on riverboats. The last slaves to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship Clotilde. Among them was Cudjoe Lewis, who in the 1920s was the last survivor of the slave trade.|$|E

The twelfth named storm and seventh hurricane of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season, Lester formed on August 20 from a tropical wave southwest of Mexico. The tropical storm moved generally northwestward while steadily intensifying. After turning to the north, approaching the Mexican coast, Lester attained hurricane status. The hurricane reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) before making landfall on west-central Baja California. The system weakened while moving across the peninsula and then over northwestern Mexico.

In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on {{an amendment to the}} War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets. He also co-sponsored legislation allowing {{hundreds of thousands of people}} displaced by the Nazis to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States legally.
