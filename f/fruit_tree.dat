5|$|Unsuitable {{backyard}} <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> netting also kills {{many animals}} and may {{bring them into}} close contact with humans, but can be avoided by using wildlife-safe netting. Barbed wire may also lead to casualties; this can be ameliorated by removing old or unnecessary barbed wire or marking it with bright paint.|$|E
5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E
5|$|The {{apple tree}} (Malus pumila, {{commonly}} and erroneously called Malus domestica) is a deciduous {{tree in the}} rose family {{best known for its}} sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a <b>fruit</b> <b>tree,</b> and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.|$|E

5|$|Carabane, {{also known}} as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme {{south-west}} of Senegal, {{in the mouth of}} the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the mangrove trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of Ziguinchor Region, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a dry season and a wet season. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of <b>fruit</b> <b>tree,</b> the most common of which are mangos and oranges. Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than mouse lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for <b>fruit,</b> <b>tree</b> gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland.|$|E

40|$|Productive <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> with an {{abundance}} of high quality fruit don 2 ̆ 7 t just happen. They result from good cultural practices, including pruning. Pruning is often neglected either {{due to a lack of}} pruning skills and knowledge or a fear that one is going to injure or kill the tree. A major requirement for the backyard farmer is a small tree open enough to allow effective spraying with home equipment and ready gathering of fruit. Pruning, combined with growing dwarf <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> will help accomplish this requirement. Although pruning is essential in development and maintenance of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> excessive pruning in young <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> will delay <b>fruiting...</b>|$|R

5|$|Overall, data on {{the social}} {{behaviour}} of the grey currawong is lacking, and roosting habits are unknown. It is generally shyer and more wary than its pied relative, but has become more accustomed to people in areas of high human activity in southwest Western Australia. Its undulating flight is rapid and silent. It hops or runs when on the ground. Birds are generally encountered singly or in pairs, but may forage in groups of three to eleven birds. Up to forty birds may gather to harvest a <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> if one is found. The black-winged subspecies is seldom seen in groups larger than four or five, while the clinking currawong may form groups of up to forty birds over the non-breeding season.|$|E

A number of wild relatives of cultivated <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> could be used in the future as rootstocks for fruit production, or for large-scale production, either organic or conventional. In addition, indigenous fruit species are carriers of genes for resistance to economically important diseases and pests, and they can be used in breeding of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> and grapevines.

25|$|Peaches are {{considered}} self-fertile because a commercial crop {{can be produced}} without cross-pollination, though cross-pollination usually gives a better crop.

25|$|Linda Melson Harrison {{was born}} in Berlin, Maryland. She was the third of five daughters of Isaac Burbage Harrison (1907–1989), a nurseryman, and his wife, Ida Virginia Melson (1914–2010), a beautician. She was the middle child, with two older sisters, Kay and Gloria, and two younger sisters, Jane and Joan. The Harrisons, like Linda's {{maternal}} Melson ancestors, {{had a long history}} in the Delmarva region. According to Ancestry.com, the Melson family were mid-17th century immigrants to Maryland from Melsonby St James in North Yorkshire. The Anglo-Welsh Harrisons had been resident for generations in West Kirby, Cheshire, when one Richard Harrison (1593–1653), son of another Richard Harrison (1559–1617), emigrated in the early 17th century from West Kirby to the New Haven Colony in what is now Connecticut, thence to Maryland. Richard's direct descendant, Harrison's paternal grandfather, Joseph G. Harrison, and Joseph's older brother, Orlando Harrison (Mayor of Berlin 1900–1910 and 1916–1918 and senator from Maryland), established , which were, at one time, the largest <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> nursery business in America, employing some five hundred workers.

Karaite Jews have always understood the Arba`at haMinim to be used for the purpose of constructing the roof of the Sukkah (pl. Sukkot); they are not made into a lulav and shaken in six directions, as is the Rabbinic practice. In the book of Nehemiah (8:15), the Israelites are instructed to construct their Sukkot out of the four species: olive branches and oil tree branches (fruit of splendorous tree), as well as date palm fronds, myrtle branches and branches of thickly leaved trees are mentioned in the same passage as materials for the Sukkah's construction.|$|E
