40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{economic}} integration in the Baltic Sea Region as it has emerged from mid- 1990 s. More importantly, we seek to assess the quality of integration as conferred by the development of intra-industry trade between the two groups of countries in the Baltic Sea region: Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany at the Western coast, and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland at the Eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. The analysis of the change in the quality of the traded goods reveals that the economic intergration in the Baltic Sea Region has so far not led to a vast increase of the competitiveness of industry at the relatively less developed Eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. The <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> market <b>prices</b> has predominantly taken place in the trade of raw materials, whereas the Eastern countries continue to trade with deficit in the majority of manufactured goods where the <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> unit <b>prices</b> has actually taken place. The above seems to support the results of our previous research, in which we have concluded that the economies of the Baltic States and Poland continue to act as lower value-added parts of the cross-border clusters in the Baltic Sea Region. Consequently, if catching up in living standards with the northern and western neighbours is envisioned, much more systematic investment into education and technology is needed in the Baltic States and Poland.

The study focuses on three main channels along which enlargement may affect labour markets in the EU, namely i) trade, ii) foreign direct investment, and iii) migration. A main conclusion of the study is that trade and capital movements are very unlikely to lead to an <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> factor <b>prices.</b> Thus, strong economic incentives to migration are bound to be present. The study indicates that such an influx of migrants will have only a moderate impact on wages and employment even in Austria and Germany. European leaders will soon have to formulate a joint position regarding this fundamental issue. The authors argue for keeping actual migration flows under control for a transitional period. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{carry out}} a {{detailed}} sensitivity analysis of border carbon adjustment (rates) by applying a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) GTAP 7 -based model. We find different incentives for the regions in the climate coalition to raise carbon-based border tax rates (BTAX) above the standard rate that mimics an <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>prices</b> across regions. Herein, the strategic use of BTAX (the manipulation {{of the terms of}} trade) is stronger for all coalition regions than the environmental use (the reduction of carbon emissions abroad). Higher BTAX can reduce carbon leakage but with a declining marginal effect. Furthermore, we find different incentives for regions outside the coalition to oppose high BTAX rates: Russia and the other energy exporters would oppose it, while the Low-Income Countries would not because of benefits from the trade diversion effect. Thus, BTAX encourages the former to join the coalition, while compensating transfers are necessary to encourage the other (developing) countries including China and India.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the thesis is to {{identify}} {{the nature of the}} relationship between the freedom and openness of the international trade and migration. My hypothesis says, that reduction in the level of trade barriers can, according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, lead to <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> the factor <b>prices</b> in particular economies. If the differences in wages are also reduced, decrease of the migration may occur, due to reduction in benefits and/or rise in costs of migration. The analysis is performed using two regression models looking for main determinants of the emigration and immigration. I estimated the models using panel data from selected European Union member countries over the past 15 years. The results shows, that trade openness is important factor which lowers the migration Given those results, set hypothesis was empirically verified...|$|R
40|$|Children {{accompanying}} their migrant {{parents for}} seasonal employment {{are the most}} “at risk” group of all in terms of educational vulnerability and capability formation. They are deprived of basic education and therefore become bonded to the low-skill–low-wage trap that their parents are currently in. Proper understanding of the magnitude and severity {{of the problem and}} suggesting innovative policies for breaking this vicious cycle is of utmost importance. Using findings from a Field Survey in Brick Kilns of Bardhaman district of West Bengal, this paper attempts to explore issues related to parental migration and condition of the children. The socio-economic condition of the migrant workers and their children in the kilns, the problems faced by these migrant children in accessing educational facilities, and the incidence of child labour have been explored. Effectiveness of policies taken by Sarva Shikhsa Abhiyan in ensuring education of these migrant children has also been examined. Children are observed to be growing up as replica of their parents and are inducted into the same low-skill profession from an early age. Contrary to neo-classical argument that labour migration in response to market forces will lead to <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> factor <b>prices,</b> no such trends are visible. Intervention programmes like mobile & residential schools are necessary to ensure not only basic learning of the children but also to teach them basic hygiene and livelihood techniques. Skill-formation among the children is urgent so that when they grow up they really have the freedom to choose their livelihood. ...|$|R

As a result, capital is attracted to that sector, production increases, and prices fall until the super profit has been competed away. The resulting <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production are via transformation from labor values into prices based on labor times.|$|R

40|$|This paper summarises the key {{findings}} of a recent study {{on the impact of}} Eastern Enlargement of the European Union (EU) on labour markets in the current Member States. The study focuses on three main channels, along which enlargement may affect labour markets in the EU, namely i) trade, ii) foreign direct investment, and iii) migration. A main conclusion of the study is that trade and capital movements are very unlikely to lead to an <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> factor <b>prices.</b> Thus, strong economic incentives to migration are bound to be present well beyond the date of accession. We estimate the migration potential associated with Eastern enlargement drawing on a time series model of immigration to Germany, which allows to estimate the long-term equilibrium migration potential, as well as the speed of adjustment at which the potential takes place. Our findings suggest that the long-run stock of immigrants from the CEECs- 10 in the EU will increase from 0. 85 in 1998 to a peak of 3. 9 million persons which is expected to be reached around 30 years after the liberalisation of labour movements. Net immigration inflows in the EU are bound to increase immediately reaching a maximum of about 335, 000 individuals per year, and subsequently decline to a modest 100, 000 to 150, 000 people per annum. Around 35 % of the migrants are expected to be workers. Microeconometric exercises carried out {{in the context of the}} study indicate that such an influx of migrants will have only a moderate impact on wages and employment even in the two most affected countries, Austria and Germany. Although we are dealing with relatively small numbers, they may have an impact on wages and employment in some neighbouring regions of Austria and Germany, where immigration from the CEECs- 10 is concentrated. In the final section of the paper, we argue for keeping actual migration flows from CEECs- 10 under control for a transitional period. Although the chapter in the accession negotiations on the free movement of labour has been already opened, a joint position of the present EU members regarding this fundamental issue is still missing. European leaders will soon have to come to terms with this issue...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new blind {{adaptive}} technique {{used for the}} <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> space-time block coded (STBC) signals transmitted over a dispersive MIMO channel. The proposed approach is based on minimising {{the difference between the}} probability density function (PDF) of the equalizer output — estimated via the Parzen window method — and a desired PDF based on the source symbols. The cost function combines this PDF fitting with an orthogonality criterion derived from the STBC structure of the transmitted data in order to discourage the extraction of identical signals. This cost function motivates an effective and low-cost stochastic gradient descent algorithm for adapting the equaliser. The performance is demonstrated in a number of simulations and benchmarked against other blind schemes for the <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> STBC over broadband MIMO channels. 1...|$|R

40|$|India’s {{future is}} in her farms. Agriculture has the {{potential}} to accelerate economic growth and social development in India”, says Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries. While emphasising the need for agricultural progress, Prof. Gunnar Myrdal once said: “It is in the agricultural sector that the battle for long-term economic development will be won or lost. ” Therefore, after the reforms, the policy focus turned to agriculture because the 1991 - 92 economic reforms removed the restrictive and protective licensing regime for industry. Having a very large percentage of population dependent on the agricultural sector, India felt the need for a certain degree of autonomy and flexibility in determining its domestic agricultural policies – so that these interventions could serve to improve productivity, enhance income levels, reduce vulnerability to market fluctuations and ensure price stability. In India the economic reforms in the agriculture sector have many aspects. First, the liberalisation of agriculture is synonymous with the <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> the domestic <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> the agricultural produce. Indian agriculture is still subjected to a number of controls as well as interventions by the State and Central Governments. These mainly include the procurement levies on rice and sugar, the monopoly cotton procurement schemes, and various laws to curtail the storage of commodities, licensing of numerous activities and administered prices. Thus, the liberalisation of agriculture in India also means the removal of various restrictions which are imposed on the domestic interstate marketing and the processing of agricultural produce. There is still a general impression that agriculture in India operates amidst several restraints and controls from the Central and State governments, and that, as a result, the farmers do not receive the benefits of free trade as other sectors of the economy. Therefore, this paper looks at the agricultural sector from various perspectives and evaluates its performance after the economic reforms. It analyses how much the globalisation and liberalisation process has brought diverse benefits to various levels of the agricultural sector over the years. Some of the contemporary problems in agriculture are also studied with reference to the policies implemented since 1991, as well as the adverse effects of the reforms on the poor...|$|R

The Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) was used as the foundation for deriving the tests. The results show that interference competition does not occur among vessels. Nevertheless, the prediction of the IFD <b>of</b> the <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> CPUE was confirmed in this fishery and indicates that the number of vessels in a specific area reflects stock density. Since there is no interference competition among vessels, the catchability coefficient (q) is not affected by this factor. Moreover, we infer that the CPUE from the whole area is not distorted as an index of abundance by the way effort is allocated in this fishery...|$|R
