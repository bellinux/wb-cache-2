25|$|LNG is shipped {{around the}} world in {{specially}} constructed seagoing vessels. The trade of LNG is completed by signing an SPA (sale and purchase agreement) between a supplier and receiving terminal, and by signing a GSA (gas sale agreement) between a receiving terminal and end-users. Most of the contract terms used to be DES or <b>ex</b> <b>ship,</b> holding the seller responsible for the transport of the gas. With low shipbuilding costs, and the buyers preferring to ensure reliable and stable supply, however, contracts with FOB terms increased. Under such terms the buyer, who often owns a vessel or signs a long-term charter agreement with independent carriers, is responsible for the transport.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, she was {{primarily}} involved in cruises. In 1973 P&O announced that their flagship, Canberra, {{was to be}} withdrawn from service, largely because her deep draught prevented her from berthing at many popular cruise ports. Orsova was to be rebuilt as a cruise ship and sail in tandem with Oriana. Many P&O directors were appalled that their flagship might be scrapped (P&O never sold ships for further service) and that the fleet would consist of <b>ex</b> Orient <b>ships.</b> After a boardroom battle, the decision was reversed and Orsova was instead withdrawn from service {{at the end of}} 1973. She was sold to shipbreakers in Taiwan and arrived at Kaohsiung on February 14, 1974 to be broken up.|$|R

Seeing this as a training opportunity, Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit (MDSU) ONE deployed a detachment to provide diving and ground support services to support the extraction. SUPSALV contracted with DONJON for commercial dredging services. This team, lead by SUPSALV salvage engineers, developed a plan, executed it over a 2 - 1 / 2 month period, and successfully restored the vessels to their proper positions. This task when coupled with the training opportunity for MDSU divers, provided a tangible benefit to both the Naval Research Laboratory and U. S. Coast Guard who where the “customers ” and the Navy salvage community who gained valuable hands-on experience in vessel extraction. ...|$|R
