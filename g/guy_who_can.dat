[...] The Broncos released him from their practice squad in September 1998, and he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars. [...] At the time, Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said: [...] "Chris Howard is a young man and he certainly still is developmental.

After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, [...] "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back.

Before the season started, Houtteman said, [...] "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.|$|E

He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him."

2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E

Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza. From the beginning, Murphy considered the role ideal for Morrison after being impressed by his Broadway bravado. The creators of Glee were initially looking for a song-and-dance man who could pass as a small-town high school teacher. Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk later commented about his casting process, [...] "You'd think {{there must be a}} lot of good-looking 30-year-old <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> sing, dance, and act, but there really aren't." ...|$|R

[...] "It takes a special linebacker to do that, a guy with speed," [...] wrote Pete Prisco, senior NFL writer for CBSSports.com. The cornerbacks protect the sidelines of the field from the line of scrimmage to anywhere between 15-20 yards out.

Among those transitions was at shortstop, where Freddy Galvis was expected to replace all-time Phillies' hits leader Jimmy Rollins. Also, the Phillies sought to piece together an outfield. Domonic Brown moved from left field to right field in the offseason, and Ben Revere was the presumptive starter in center field, which left several players vying for playing time as reserves and situational players. However, at one point Revere spent time in left field while Odubel Herrera played center field; Sandberg commented that Revere's arm may be a better fit in left, and that he was using {{spring training}} to experiment. [...] "Darin Ruf could be a surprise guy for me. Cody Asche and Sizemore might be <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> chip in. <b>Who</b> knows how many home runs they can hit?

[...] Phillies' manager Ryne Sandberg discussing Phillies lack of power hitters During spring training, the Phillies did not hit many home runs, which prompted Sandberg to note that throughout the season, the Phillies would play small ball to manufacture runs, especially via bunting and hit and run. As part of that strategy, Sandberg announced that both Revere and Herrera would make the opening day roster, with Revere playing left field and Herrera playing center.|$|R
