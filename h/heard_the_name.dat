25|$|Swanson and Walsh {{set about}} writing the script, and discreetly placed an ad announcing the film, {{thinking}} no one noticed, as Charles Lindbergh {{had just completed}} his historic transatlantic flight. However, the press picked up on it and sensationalized the story. United Artists received a threatening two-page telegram from the MPAA signed by all its members, including Fox (Walsh's studio) and Hays himself. In addition, {{the rest of the}} signers owned several thousand movie houses, and if they refused to screen the film it could be a financial disaster. This was the first time Swanson had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of Joseph P. Kennedy, with whom she later had an affair, and who arranged financing for her next few pictures, including Queen Kelly (1929).|$|E
500|$|Back at the studios, {{the taping}} of TGS is {{interrupted}} by Dr. Spaceman who desperately forces Jenna to sleep because she might die like one of his test rats. Tracy creates a diversion by dropping his trousers and exposing his buttocks, which {{he refers to as}} the [...] "Funcooker". Everyone realizes that this is where Kenneth <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name.</b> Fed up with the chaos, Liz sends the entire show's staff—including Kenneth and Dr. Spaceman—to her office. Liz ponders over a box of matches and thinks of the woman in court, in which she admitted to committing arson as a way of getting back at her out-of-control employees. She accidentally does start a small fire which is quickly put out but scares everyone out of their bad behavior.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist and bassist Carol Kaye has disputed Blaine's {{account of}} the name and stated, [...] "We were never known as that. Sometimes we were called 'the Clique', but [...] a Hal Blaine invented name for his own self-promotion in 1990..." [...] Regarding the matter, Songfacts stated: [...] "We couldn't find any {{references}} to 'The Wrecking Crew' in any publications from the era." [...] In response to Kaye's contention that Blaine invented the moniker to sell his book, Blaine denied that anyone had ever <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> [...] "The Clique". [...] Earlier, in the late 1950s, an embryonic version of the group was headed by Ray Pohlman that was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the First Call Gang", since they were the musicians many record producers would call first.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{surprise}} was not lessened when, {{at the entrance}} to <b>the</b> ballroom, she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of her conductor and herself announced as 'Mr. and Miss Brown.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{now will}} you tell me whether you have not <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of Jael and Miss Van Siever coupled together? I see you know all about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|ABSOLUTE Malaprop! Languish! I don't {{remember}} {{ever to have}} <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> before. Yet, stay--I think I do recollect something. Languish! Languish! She squints, don't she? A little red-haired girl? ...|$|R
2500|$|Sosa {{is known}} {{to family and friends}} as [...] "Mikey." [...] His {{maternal}} grandmother, who had suggested his birth name of Samuel, also came up with his nickname: [...] " [...] <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> on a soap opera she liked and decided from that moment on he would be Mikey." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told what}} {{happened}} in [...] after Moses asked to behold God's Presence in [...] Moses foretold that he would behold God's Glory and make atonement for the Israelites' iniquities on Yom Kippur. On that day, Moses asked God (in the words of [...] ) [...] "Show me, I pray, Your Glory." [...] God told Moses that Moses {{was not able to}} see God's Glory lest he die, as [...] reports God said, [...] "men shall not see Me and live," [...] but for the sake of God's oath to Moses, God agreed to do as Moses asked. God instructed Moses to stand at the entrance of a cave, and God would cause all God's angels to pass before Moses. God told Moses to stand his ground, and not to fear, as [...] reports, [...] "And He said, I will make all My Goodness pass before you." [...] God told Moses that when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>Name</b> that God had spoken to him, then Moses would know that God was before him, as [...] reports. The ministering angels complained that they served before God day and night, and they were unable to see God's Glory, but this man Moses born of woman desired to see God's Glory. The angels arose in wrath and excitement to kill Moses, and he came near to death. God intervened in a cloud to protect Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And the Lord descended in the cloud." [...] God protected Moses with the hollow of God's hand so that he would not die, as [...] reports, [...] "And it shall come to pass, while My Glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand." [...] When God had passed by, God removed the hollow of God's hand from Moses, and he saw traces of the Shechinah, as [...] says, [...] "And I will take away My hand, and you shall see my back." [...] Moses began to cry with a loud voice, and Moses said the words of [...] "O Lord, O Lord, a God full of compassion and gracious [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Moses asked God to pardon the iniquities of the people in connection with the Golden Calf. God told Moses that if he had asked God then to pardon the iniquities of all Israel, even to the end of all generations, God would have done so, as it was the appropriate time. But Moses had asked for pardon with reference to the Golden Calf, so God told Moses that it would be according to his words, as [...] says, [...] "And the Lord said, ‘I have pardoned according to your word.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Swiftly, {{he opened}} to their [...] "wondering eyes the vast treasures of European and, particularly, of English literature". It {{was at his}} feet that Sheehan first <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of Carlyle, Tennyson, and Browning.|$|R
6000|$|Larry {{listened in}} amazement. He had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> José Lupez and Benedicto, {{and knew that}} the two Spaniards were brothers. Could this Spaniard, Benedicto Lupez, be {{the man who had}} made off with the money Braxton Bogg had stolen from the Hearthstone Saving Institution? ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had come}} in {{towards the end of}} the performance, and so sat rather bewildered, unable to follow. The story was the {{inevitable}} Paladins of France--one <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> Rinaldo! Orlando! again and again. But the story was told in dialect, hard to follow.|$|R
6000|$|Five or {{six years}} ago I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> [...] "waahoo" [...] {{mentioned}} at Long Key. The boatmen were using it in a way to make one see that they did not believe there was such a fish as a waahoo. The old conch fishermen had never <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name.</b> For that matter, neither had I.|$|E
60|$|He {{seemed to}} have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> before, but still he hesitated. 'Ah--what did he paint?' he asked, with growing caution.|$|E
60|$|Anne Mie, in {{a remote}} corner of the hall, had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name,</b> and felt her very soul sicken at its sound.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] I answered, nettled at {{his words}} and manner. [...] "It would take me until to-morrow to <b>name</b> all <b>the</b> great men I have ever heard of. I suppose you have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of Napoleon, Wellington, Nelson, Dante, Luther, Calvin, Bismarck, Voltaire?" ...|$|R
50|$|An {{informal}} magazine, A-YA {{opened to}} the world the virtually unknown-to-the-public contemporary Soviet art and current Russian art, which for many years was to dominate the world's leading exhibition venues and auctions. It was from A-YA that people first <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> Eric Bulatov, Ilya Kabakov, Dmitry Prigov and many others.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Adam, [...] "I would fain know by {{what other}} {{influence}} or instigation you are perpetually {{at one end}} {{or the other of}} some bloody brawl? What, I pray, had you to do with these Seytons and Leslies, that you never <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of in your life before?" ...|$|R
60|$|Beaucourt {{started when}} he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name,</b> and {{instantly}} recovered himself. He had forgotten how many Marys {{there are in}} the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I remember. So it was. It's {{a curious}} thing, too, that it sounds familiar. I've <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> before somewhere." ...|$|E
60|$|Already Jan--who with Piet's {{help was}} busy with the rope--has <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name.</b> His wan, thin face has become the colour of ashes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! but Mary has not <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> {{of all his}} dogs. And Mary, he has cured Bustle {{of hunting}} my Puss. We held them up to each other, and Puss hissed horribly, but Bustle did not mind it a bit; and the other day, when Charles tried to set him at her, he would not take the least notice.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the party}} {{who were going}} down to-day were Mr. and Mrs. Binney, Mr. Sherman, {{and a number of}} {{distinguished}} names; among whom I recollect to have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of Lady Hatherton, and Lady Byron, widow of the poet. This would have been an exceedingly interesting scene to us, but being already worn with company and excitement, we preferred a quiet day at Windsor.|$|R
60|$|The colour {{rose to her}} cheeks, {{the reality}} was {{gradually}} dawning upon her. That man who spoke in the Great Hall beyond was a judge--there were other judges there too. When she arrived at Westminster she had seen a great concourse of people, <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of great legal dignitaries whispered round her, and of peers who had been summoned for a great occasion.|$|R
6000|$|Beatty! Where had he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name?</b> Suddenly {{it came to}} {{him that}} Beatty was the city boss, who had been eulogized by Mr. Plimpton! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Delaware young men!--the {{nation is}} women--even the deer walk {{when they hear}} their hunters coming! Who has ever <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of a young Delaware warrior?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucy Mokunui?" [...] I repeated, {{haunted by}} some {{familiar}} association. I shook my head. [...] "It {{seems to me}} I've <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name,</b> but I've forgotten it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend, Pete Scott," [...] said Foster. [...] "You have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> ladies' <b>names,</b> Pete, {{but this}} is my partner, Mr. Featherstone, from the Garth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my soul, sir," [...] {{replied the}} spectre {{with an air}} of bewilderment, [...] "I have never even <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of these various objects to which you refer, and so I am quite unable to answer your question. But if you mean to ask whether I have {{something}} beating just under my fob (excuse the antiquated word, but as I wear the thing in question I must necessarily use <b>the</b> <b>name),</b> why then, most undoubtedly I have." ...|$|R
60|$|They put up {{at a small}} inn and, as they partook of a meal, {{listened to}} the talk of those around them. But it was not here that they could expect to gather the news they required. They <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of {{many of those who}} had been killed, but these were all leaders of distinction; and as soon as they had {{finished}} their food, they started for the Louvre.|$|R
6000|$|But {{where had}} she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of Hathaway before? She puzzled her brain to remember. Did it belong {{to any of}} her schoolgirl friends? Or was it-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{where are}} your eyes?" [...] she cried at last. [...] "I was Miss Polly Hinton of the Haymarket Theatre. And perhaps you never <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Alvar. [...] I {{know him}} not. [...] And yet methinks, I have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> but lately. [...] Means he {{the husband of}} the Moorish woman? [...] Isidore? Isidore? ...|$|E
5000|$|Cape Laurens (...) is a cape which {{marks the}} northwestern {{extremity}} of Laurens Peninsula and <b>Heard</b> Island. <b>The</b> <b>name</b> was probably applied by Captain Franklin F. Smith, of the American bark Laurens, who visited Heard Island in 1855-56 and who, with Captain Erasmus Darwin Rogers, initiated sealing operations and longtime American sealer occupation of <b>Heard</b> Island. <b>The</b> <b>name</b> appears on a chart by the British expedition under George Nares, which visited {{the island in}} HMS Challenger in 1874 and utilized <b>the</b> <b>names</b> then in use by the sealers.|$|R
6000|$|... "At present I shall mention no names--if {{you only}} <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names,</b> {{what would you}} not think!--but I shall merely tell you how cleverly I did it. I was true to my {{employers}} then, and no doubt they will be true to me now. I hope so, and until I am convinced that they have betrayed me, these names, which would convulse Europe, shall not be divulged. But on that day ... well, I say no more! ...|$|R
60|$|He tried me awhile in the French, {{and then}} again in native, which he seemed to think was the best chance. I made out he was after more than passing {{the time of day}} with me, but had {{something}} to communicate, and I listened <b>the</b> harder. I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of Adams and Case and of Randall—Randall the oftenest—and the word “poison,” or something like it, and a native word that he said very often. I went home, repeating it to myself.|$|R
