5|$|Passengers {{said that}} the {{carriages}} of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing {{and most of the}} train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles</b> or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E

A Fendt Favorit tractor was also made. The trucks and heavy construction equipment were very similar to NZG and Conrad, though Cursor never matched their dizzying productivity. In fact, after producing about 40 different models over 18 years, Cursor seems to have produced nothing more after about 1987.|$|E
25|$|Modern or industrialized {{agriculture}} {{is dependent on}} fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1. direct consumption on the farm and 2. indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles</b> and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid propane, and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the automatic steering control of <b>farming</b> <b>vehicle</b> using GPS receiver. Automatic steering devices for <b>farming</b> <b>vehicles</b> like tractors, seeding vehicle, weed control vehicle, spraying machine vehicle etc. have the task {{to relieve the}} driver from the physical and mental stress of monotonous steering work. Simultaneously, {{they are intended to}} help him to exploit machines and <b>farming</b> <b>vehicle</b> closer to their full performance and improve the quality of work. Vehicles frequently have to be steered in and exact straight line and along rows in the farm land. GPS receiver fetches the information of positions (latitude and longitude) of the farm land which needs to be cultivated. With the help of GPS and microcontroller (Arm 9) we calculate the boundary of farm land, slope of straight line and angle of movement with the help of slope changes. The microcontroller generates the control signals to stepper motor for steering of vehicle...|$|R

40|$|A b s t r a c t : This paper {{presents}} a hybrid agent of behaviour architecture {{to deal with}} the autonomous navigation of a <b>farming</b> <b>vehicle.</b> To this end, a conventional vehicle was fitted with a set of sensors and actuators to acquire continuous location and environmental data to safely and appropriately interact with a dynamic environment. The vehicle autonomously performs local piloting, following a tentative path initially specified by the human operator through a set of intermediate positions. A wireless LAN is used to get a bi-directional communication between the <b>farming</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the human supervisor. Sensor-fusion algorithms are proposed to overcome the lack of GPS signals so as to obtain continuous and precise positioning. From a set of basic motion agents ADVANCE, TURN, STOP, AVOID OBSTACLE, more specific agents related to the agricultural operation are defined, such as FOLLOWSTRAIGHT LINE and CHANGE OF ROW.
