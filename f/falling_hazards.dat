40|$|Purpose: To provide {{guidance}} in minimizing employee exposure to <b>fall</b> <b>hazards</b> {{in the work}} place by the proper selection and use of fall protection systems. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has many controls and work procedures, including administrative and engineering controls in place which reduce employee exposure to <b>fall</b> <b>hazards.</b> These may include the use of guardrails, toe boards, warning lines, covers, and various travel restriction systems such as barriers and fences. However, when these types of controls are neither feasible nor practical to fully protect employees during work efforts involving minor construction and maintenance projects, a personal fall protection systems must be employed to prevent employee injuries from falls. Policy/Action: In order to provide for proper employee fall protection on the job, the following initiatives will be implemented. (Reference the attached policy for specific requirements.) 1. Supervisors are responsible to ensure that all employees are protected from <b>fall</b> <b>hazards</b> during the work day. All work sites must be evaluated to determine existing <b>fall</b> <b>hazards</b> and the means to eliminate these hazards identified.

30|$|In {{order to}} address some managers’ {{concerns}} for {{reducing the risk of}} crown fire propagation, alternative methods to commercial timber sales might include topping overstory trees rather than felling and removing them. This might sufficiently reduce crown fire potential by reducing crown bulk density and disrupting horizontal crown fuel continuity, while also retaining the habitat values of large standing snags. However, fuelbreak prescriptions typically involve the elimination of all snags in order to prevent <b>falling</b> <b>hazards</b> to firefighters. As well, it might behoove managers to think about mechanical fuels treatments that reduce fuel particle size (e.g. through chipping) or fuel bed depth (e.g. through crushing or compaction) rather than physically removing fuels. With these methods, treatments would be focused on qualitatively altering fuel profiles rather than quantitatively reducing the fuel loads.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to summarise the consultation process undertaken by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) during its review of earthquake-prone building policy. The document includes a summary of: 	the regional public information seminars 	submissions in response to: 	the proposals put forward by the MBIE to review New Zealand’s earthquake-prone building policy system under the Building Act 2004, and 	recommendations covering earthquake-prone building policy made by the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission. Context: The Government has decided to introduce legislation {{to change the system}} for managing earthquake-prone buildings. The changes follow recommendations by the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission and a comprehensive review (including consultation)  by the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE) Many earthquake-prone buildings in New Zealand are not being managed in a consistent, timely and cost effective way. A clear view has emerged that the current system is not achieving an acceptable level of risk in terms of protecting people from serious harm in moderate earthquakes. The new system is designed to strike a better balance between protecting people from harm in an earthquake and managing the costs of strengthening or removing earthquake prone buildings. It will give central Government a greater role in providing leadership and direction in relation to earthquake-prone buildings, to make better use of the resources and capability of central and local government. Key decisions 	To identify those that are earthquake-prone, territorial authorities will have to complete a seismic assessment of all non-residential buildings and all multi-unit, multi-storey residential buildings in their areas within five years of changes to the new legislation taking effect. 	All earthquake-prone buildings will have to be strengthened, or demolished, within 20 years of the new legislation taking effect (i. e. assessment by territorial authorities within five years and strengthening within 15 years of assessment). 	A publicly accessible register of earthquake-prone buildings will be set up by MBIE. 	Certain buildings will be prioritised for assessment and strengthening such as: 	 		buildings likely to {{have a significant impact on}} public safety,e. g. those with potential <b>falling</b> <b>hazards</b> 		strategically important buildings,e. g. those on transport routes identified as critical in an emergency. 	 	 	Owners of some buildings will be able to apply for exemptions from the national timeframe for strengthening. These will be buildings where the effects of them failing are likely to be minimal and could include farm buildings with little passing traffic. 	Owners of earthquake-prone category 1 buildings (listed on the register of historic places under the Historic Places Act 1993) and those on the proposed National Historic Landmarks List, will be able to apply for extensions of up to 10 years to the national timeframe for strengthening. The Government intends to introduce legislation to amend the Building Act (2004) into Parliament later this year. If the Bill is passed into law, it is likely there will be a transition period before the law takes effect while detailed implementation issues are worked through. MBIE will be working with Territorial authorities and engineers on implementing these changes...|$|E

The software computes 3 -dimensional rock fall trajectories starting from a digital elevation model (DEM), the location of rock fall release points, and maps of the dynamic rolling friction coefficient and of the coefficients of normal and tangential energy restitution. For each DEM cell the software calculates the number of rock falls passing through the cell, the maximum rock fall velocity and the maximum flying height. For the Yosemite Valley, a DEM with a ground resolution of 10 × 10 m was prepared using topographic contour lines from the U. S. Geological Survey 1 : 24 000 -scale maps. Rock fall release points were identified as DEM cells having a slope steeper than 60 °, an assumption based on the location of historical rock falls. Maps of the normal and tangential energy restitution coefficients and of the rolling friction coefficient were produced from a surficial geologic map. The availability of historical rock falls mapped in detail allowed us to check the computer program performance and to calibrate the model parameters. Visual and statistical comparison of the model results with the mapped rock falls confirmed the accuracy of the model. The model results are compared with a previous map of rockfall talus and with a geomorphic assessment of rock <b>fall</b> <b>hazard</b> based on potential energy referred to as a shadow angle approach, recently completed for the Yosemite Valley.

40|$|Abstract Volcanic ash {{is one of}} the farthest-reaching vol-canic {{hazards and}} ash {{produced}} by large magnitude explo-sive eruptions has the potential to affect communities over thousands of kilometres. Quantifying the <b>hazard</b> from ash <b>fall</b> is problematic, in part because of data limitations that make eruption characteristics uncertain but also because, given an eruption, the distribution of ash is then controlled by time and altitude-varying wind conditions. Any one location may potentially be affected by ash falls from one, or a number of, volcanoes so that volcano-specific studies may not fully capture the ash <b>fall</b> <b>hazard</b> for communities in volcanically active areas. In an attempt to deal with these uncertainties, this paper outlines a probabilistic framework for assessing ash <b>fall</b> <b>hazard</b> on a regional scale. The meth-odology employs stochastic simulation techniques and is based upon generic principles that could be applied to any area, but is here applied to the Asia-Pacific region. Average recurrence intervals for eruptions {{greater than or equal to}} Volcanic Explosivity Index 4 were established for 190 vol-canoes in the region, based upon the eruption history of each volcano and, where data were lacking, the averaged eruptive behaviour of global analogous volcanoes.

40|$|In a {{companion}} paper (this volume), the authors propose a methodology for assessing ash <b>fall</b> <b>hazard</b> on a regional scale. In this study, the methodology {{is applied to}} the Asia-Pacific region, determining the hazard from 190 volcanoes to over one million square kilometre of urban area. Ash <b>fall</b> <b>hazard</b> is quantified for each square kilometre grid cell of urban area in terms of the annual exceedance probability (AEP), and its inverse, the average recurrence interval (ARI), for ash falls exceeding 1, 10 and 100 mm. A surrogate risk variable, the Population-Weighted Hazard Score: the product of AEP and population density, approximates the relative risk for each grid cell. Within the Asia-Pacific region, urban areas in Indonesia are found to have the highest levels of hazard and risk, while Australia has the lowest. A clear demarcation emerges between the hazard in countries close to and farther from major subduction plate boundaries, with the latter having ARIs at least 2 orders of magnitude longer for the same thickness thresholds. Countries with no volcanoes, such as North Korea and Malaysia, also face ash falls from volcanoes in neighbouring countries. Ash falls exceeding 1 mm are expected to affect more than one million people living in urban areas within the study region; in Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines, this situation could occur with ARIs less than 40 years. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of coastal research at BRGM (French Geological Survey) two methods are being tested to monitor coastal evolution. The first method involves photogrammetric processing of ground-based optical imagery to measure sandy beaches topography. The system is both developed for hardware and software. The second method makes use of terrestrial laser scanner surveys to assess rock <b>fall</b> <b>hazard</b> of coastal cliffs. Concerning sandy beaches monitoring, this paper addresses {{the state of the}} system under development and addresses some practical issues encountered. The system still needs further developments both on the hardware and software side. For the second method, we present here the first results concerning rock <b>fall</b> <b>hazard</b> assessment at the experimental site of Mesnil Val, Normandy. The 700 -m-long chalk cliff site, made of “Upper Lewes nodular chalk” and “Seaford chalk”, has been surveyed with terrestrial laser scanning equipment every 3 - 6 months. Each survey was processed to build 5 x 5 cm grid-cell Digital Surface Models (DSM) of the entire cliff-face. Here, we present an analysis of the data from the first two campaigns. Differences between DSM qualify as rock fall event, with 1 chance over 1000 uncertainty, if the topographic difference is larger than 3. 3 cm, for a patch of 15 x 15 cm. 2202 such rock fall events occurred in the 101 days time span, between 7 December 2005 and 23 March 2006. Rock fall volumes span 6 orders of magnitude (from 7. 4 * 10 - 4 à 1. 7 * 102 m 3). To our knowledge, this is the most complete rock-fall catalogue published to date.

The youngest rhyolitic event erupted a tephra fall volume more than 2 times larger and covered a wider area northwest and southeast of the volcano (~A. D. 1315 Kaharoa eruption). We have used the Kaharoa scenario to assess the tephra <b>fall</b> <b>hazard</b> from a future rhyolitic eruption at Tarawera of a similar scale.
