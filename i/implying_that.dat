5|$|Arrian and Plutarch {{claimed that}} Alexander was {{speechless}} by this point, <b>implying</b> <b>that</b> {{this was an}} apocryphal story.

5|$|Countershading {{existed in}} marine {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, <b>implying</b> <b>that</b> its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned {{heavily on}} the {{platform}} that Carter was weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s. During this time Carter's defense secretary, Harold Brown, announced the stealth bomber project, apparently <b>implying</b> <b>that</b> this {{was the reason for}} the B-1 cancellation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to tidal heating, {{the interior of}} Europa could also be heated by the decay of radioactive material (radiogenic heating) within the rocky mantle.

Sutton won the match by DQ after Kai entered the ring and attacked her, before referees pulled her off.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat unusually among theropods, T.rex had a {{very long}} cochlea. The length of the cochlea is often related to hearing acuity, {{or at least the}} {{importance}} of hearing in behavior, <b>implying</b> <b>that</b> hearing was a particularly important sense to tyrannosaurs. Specifically, data suggests that Tyrannosaurus rex heard best in the low-frequency range, and that low-frequency sounds were an important part of tyrannosaur behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{significance}} of Ahimsa {{as the very}} first restraint {{in the very first}} limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga.

5|$|William's {{choice of}} Pevensey as a {{defensive}} location {{may not have been}} entirely due to practical military reasons. It also had political connotations, <b>implying</b> <b>that</b> the Normans were on a level with the Romans.

5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, <b>implying</b> <b>that</b> higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{scholars}} worked from 1040 to 1044 to compile the Wujing Zongyao {{with the intent}} to collect all known military knowledge and to disseminate it to a wider government audience. Its chief editor, Zeng Gongliang, was assisted by the prominent astronomer Yang Weide and the scholar Ding Du. After five years, the book was published with a preface authored by Emperor Renzong himself. Lorge remarks that Zeng Gongliang, the chief editor, was a government official rather than a military general, <b>implying</b> <b>that</b> the Wujing Zongyao was likely written for other government officials.|$|E
5|$|Anonymous's {{statement}} that Zoltán succeeded {{his father as}} grand prince, or even the idea that Zoltán ever ruled the federation of the Hungarian tribes have also been challenged.

Kristó also says that other Hungarian chroniclers do not make mention of Zoltán's rule, <b>implying</b> <b>that</b> Anonymous only inserted Zoltán into the incompletely preserved list of the grand princes because he knew that all Hungarian monarchs from the House of Árpád descended from him.|$|E
