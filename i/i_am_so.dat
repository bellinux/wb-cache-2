After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

[...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her.

500|$|During his career, Mercury's {{flamboyant}} stage performances sometimes led {{journalists to}} allude to his sexuality. Dave Dickson, reviewing Queen's performance at Wembley Arena in 1984 for Kerrang!, noted Mercury's [...] "camp" [...] addresses {{to the audience}} and even described him as a [...] "posing, pouting, posturing tart". In 1992, John Marshall of Gay Times expressed the following opinion: [...] " [...] was a 'scene-queen,' not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle'... It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>So</b> what?' And that in itself for some was a statement."

500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, {{but the point is that}} Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music.

[...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does it matter if <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> <b>So</b> be it.

D'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers—heavy cavalry of big men on big horses—thundered over the bridge and scattered the Russian rear guard. As the retreating infantry fled, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers captured four guns and two standards. Napoleon was so pleased with d'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers that he embraced the six-foot man in front of his division the next day. In his own turn, d'Hautpoul was so pleased that he announced first, to have such a compliment, he must be willing to die for his emperor, and second, to his troops: [...] "The Emperor has embraced me on behalf of all of you. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> pleased with you that I kiss all your arses." ...|$|E

[...] Discussing the ratings for EastEnders Live: The Aftermath, controller of BBC Three Danny Cohen appraised: [...] "It is an amazing testament to the EastEnders team and the brave and brilliant drama they provided." [...] Yorke responded to the high consolidated ratings with the statement: [...] "The best birthday present EastEnders could possibly have is to know that 25 years in it can still grab the biggest audience in the UK.

[...] "Unbroken" [...] was recorded at Artisan Studios in Birmingham, England, and Phil Tan mixed the record at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, Georgia. Walker was honoured by the opportunity to record a piece of Tedder's work. Walker told the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It is a privilege for me to record a song by the guy who wrote 'Halo' for Beyoncé and 'Bleeding Love' for Leona. He's the man, {{one of the best}} songwriters and producers in the world. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> blessed." [...] In an interview with MTV Australia he said, [...] "The song is so amazing. When I first heard the song I was like this is a beat song and then I read the lyrics and that's what won me over because it talks about my life, being nothing and being in pieces, but then becoming unbroken." [...] "Unbroken" [...] is a piano-driven pop music ballad, and features a repetitive chorus.|$|E

[...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else.

Mortimer's time was [...]07 second faster than her April Trials record, and [...]14 second faster than Pascoe's time; she went into the race [...] "a bit annoyed" [...] and [...] "mad at anyone who was going to take it from me".|$|E
500|$|... {{the cruel}} oppressions of this kingdom by England {{are not to}} be borne. You send what books you please hither, and the booksellers here can send nothing to you that is written here.
