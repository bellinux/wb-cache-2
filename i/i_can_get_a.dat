I have sometimes wondered why I must file papers showing I did not steal my car before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> license for it. But experience shows there are thieves among automobile drivers, and that there are Communists among labor leaders. The public welfare, in identifying both, outweighs any affront to individual dignity.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{securing}} a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in {{artists such as}} Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: [...] "From a word, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis." [...] She considered her music {{as a form of}} poetry, citing the album track [...] "Hazy Shades" [...] {{as an example of a}} poem turned into a song.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} over Marsh's bowling action again reared its head during the 1901–02 season, when MacLaren led his English tourists to Australia. The English {{played in a}} match at Bathurst where Marsh was selected, but MacLaren refused to play against him. Noble, who selected the New South Wales teams, used the complaints about Marsh to ignore growing calls to have the bowler selected for New South Wales and Australia. Without state backing, the remainder of Australia's selectors were happy to rely on Noble's state-level veto to ignore Marsh. Marsh's only first-class match of the season was against Queensland in Brisbane. At the time, Queensland was not yet in the Sheffield Shield, {{so it was a}} one-off match. The match was the subject of much media attention {{because it was the first}} time that two aborigines had played in opposing teams at first-class level. Queensland's Indigenous player was Alec Henry, another fast bowler who had been accused of throwing. The New South Wales team travelled north to the match by train, making a stop at Ipswich. As part of the media promotion of the match-up between the pair, Henry was taken to Ipswich station to meet Marsh. Marsh was reported in the media as having said [...] "Say old man, toss me up a soft one so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> smack at you". Marsh took 2/64 and 3/67 in a drawn match, and bowled three of his victims, who were unable to cope with his pace. Marsh and Henry dismissed one another, each being bowled for nine to create a symmetry in the scorecard.|$|E

At the time, Norton lived in Brentwood, Tennessee, which is located minutes outside of TNA's headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee and commented that wrestling is, [...] "something I enjoy doing. You miss it. I can still perform at a high level. [...] I’m still a big, strong man. I would like to give it another shot.

2500|$|Fred Kewley, Harry's manager, {{signed a}} five-week lease with the Village Gate in Greenwich Village to feature the Chapins (Tom and Steve's band on Epic Records), {{whom he was}} managing. Harry decided {{he would like to}} be the opening act because [...] "maybe <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{publishing}} deal." [...] Harry and three band members (playing cello, bass, electric guitar) who had never met before rehearsed for one week in Kewley's office and arranged the songs with cello parts and background vocals (much of which ended up on Harry's first album). On opening night, three people were in the audience and four musicians were on stage. Jac Holzman and Clive Davis showed interest.|$|E

Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> girl on each knee and bounce 'em along." [...] Log has distinctively used breasts as a theme in his performance and hired two [...] "professional women" [...] to use their breasts as percussion instruments on his song [...] "Clap Your Tits". Log {{is quick to point out}} that all of these acts are carried out between consenting adults and individuals familiar with his brand of humor, stating, [...] "First of all, if you come to my show knowing I've got a song called [...] "Boob Scotch" [...] and you get offended, I'm sorry but I've got to say just get out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late April 1918 Wedge was {{transported to}} El Paso, Texas, where {{after a few}} weeks he worked as a street car {{motorman}} for the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad. In May 1918 Wedge wrote: [...] "Whether I get well or die, I am going to keep smiling as long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> bit of air in these old lungs of mine". Needing funds to relocate from El Paso, Texas to Tucson, Arizona to enroll in the University of Arizona, and after extensive training which he believed cured him of tuberculosis, and hoping to be able to return to his position as a boxing trainer in the US Army, Wedge returned briefly to the ring by September 1918. After bouts with two border army corps men in preceding months, on January 1, 1919, Hedge fought Sergeant Tommy Murphy, the welterweight champion of the Southwestern United States, who was serving with the US 5th Cavalry at Fort Bliss,. but was knocked out early in the fight and lost the ten round fight on a points decision. Wedge remained in his job in El Paso until July 1919.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Scruggs {{was getting}} bored with {{repetition}} of the classic bluegrass fare. [...] By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, [...] "I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little bogged down and a little depressed". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. [...] Flatt was not happy with some of this material — he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying [...] "I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.|$|E
