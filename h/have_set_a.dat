5|$|By 2011, {{the year}} before Johnson took over as head coach, every women's sprint school record for {{distances}} still actively run, for both outdoor and indoor track and field, had been broken. The women's indoor program won its first NCAA title in 2010 and by 2017, had won seven of the previous eight national championships. In the 2017 indoor national championship, the sprinters excelled as the women's program set a record for points scored at 84, exceeding the previous record set by Texas by 13 points. The sprinters were so dominant that despite Deajah Stevens's lane violation in the 200m prelims which would <b>have</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> new collegiate record, the points accrued from Oregon women's sprinters alone would have been only two points shy of runner up Georgia's entire points total.|$|E
5|$|In his {{judgment}} of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet to release its subscribers' information {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were parties to the case. He explicitly denied Odex access to this information. He upheld District Judge Lau's decision that Odex was not the correct party to have asked for release of subscriber data. As a result, he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$20,000. Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies. The ruling may <b>have</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> precedent for online privacy in Singapore by {{making it more difficult}} for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders.|$|E

Finally, all players inducted into the Ipswich Town Hall of Fame, whose inaugural members were selected in 2007 by a ballot of former Ipswich players, are included.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Brooklyn Dodgers {{in the sixth}} game of the season. While the Dodgers had not won a game all season, they started off strong against Cleveland. The Browns took a 10–0 lead in the first quarter, but the Dodgers {{answered}} with 10 points of their own {{in the second quarter}} to tie the score at halftime. Edgar Jones ran for Cleveland's first touchdown, which Groza followed with a 53-yard field goal, the longest of his career at the time. Brooklyn's Mickey Colmer ran in the team's second-quarter touchdown after a 66-yard drive. The Browns came back with another touchdown in the third quarter, aided by two long Horace Gillom receptions, but the Dodgers again evened the score after a Groza field goal was blocked and returned by Hank Foldberg for a touchdown. Cleveland pulled away in the fourth quarter, however, with a fumble recovery for a touchdown by George Young and a short run by Motley. The Browns had 23 first downs in the game, setting a team record. Groza missed an extra point after one of Cleveland's touchdowns, breaking a long streak. He also narrowly missed a 57-yard field goal attempt that would <b>have</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> professional football record if it were good.|$|E
5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} redeem store product keys to add {{software}} from their library. The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, <b>have</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his second pole position of the season, his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:19.475. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Trulli who recorded a lap 0.271 seconds slower than the pole sitter and took his best qualifying performance of the season. Coulthard qualified third and said he could <b>have</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> better lap time as he saw a yellow flag out on the track. Trulli's teammate Frentzen qualified fourth but criticised Irvine for an apparent blocking manoeuvre. Häkkinen took fifth and suffered from understeer along with traffic during his second qualifying run. Barrichello secured the sixth place and reported his car was nervous. Alesi recorded the seventh-fastest time, despite experiencing alternator problems on his race car in the opening minutes of qualifying and switched to the spare Prost. Fisichella occupied the eighth position and reported his Benetton's handling had worsened. Ralf Schumacher and Irvine completed the top ten positions. Herbert set the eleventh fastest time, five one hundredths slower than his teammate and reported excessive oversteer on his car. He was ahead of Wurz in the slower of the two Benetton cars. Salo qualified in 13th position despite a misunderstanding with his race engineer over a yellow flag. Similarly, Jenson Button who took 14th in the other Williams, was caught out by the waved yellow flags. The two Arrows drivers filled the next two positions with Verstappen in 15th and Pedro de la Rosa in 16th; the latter crashed at the Raccasse chicane. BAR's Jacques Villeneuve started from 17th had an engine failure and was forced to use his team's spare car. Heidfeld took 18th and reported he experienced a lack of grip and understeer. He qualified ahead of Diniz and Ricardo Zonta in 19th and 20th respectively. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid; Marc Gené ahead of Gastón Mazzacane and both crashed at Raccasse.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} one hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher achieved his sixth pole position of the season, his second at Monza, with a time of 1:23.770. Although he was happy with his car and tyres, he said that he did not make the best of session because of making a mistake at the first chicane during his first run. Michael Schumacher was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap time 0.027 seconds slower and was happy to start alongside his teammate. Häkkinen qualified third, though he believed he could <b>have</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> faster time as he struggled with the handling on his car and his McLaren misfired on his final two timed laps. Villeneuve qualified fourth, nearly half a second behind Michael Schumacher, and stated that he was happy with his performance. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified fifth and was disappointed with his starting position because he encountered traffic during the session and was blocked by Frentzen. Trulli and Frentzen set the sixth and eighth fastest times respectively for Jordan; Trulli reported no problems while Frentzen was impeded by de la Rosa. Ralf Schumacher recorded the seventh quickest time and was disappointed in his performance. De la Rosa completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. His teammate Verstappen qualified eleventh having been forced to use two of his team's cars when they developed hydraulic and engine problems. Button qualified twelfth and said he overheated his tyres after running insufficient amounts of downforce. Wurz, who qualified in 13th, used the session to familiarise himself with Benetton's spare car. He was ahead of Irvine in the faster of the two Jaguar's, who set a best time that was one-tenth of a second faster than his own teammate Johnny Herbert in 18th; both were disadvantaged at the lack of straightline speed. Salo was 15th quickest for the Sauber team, ahead of his own teammate Diniz whose car handled badly under braking. The pair were marginally quicker than Zonta who encountered gear selection problems in his race car, and switched to his team's spare monocoque. The grid was completed by Alesi and Nick Heidfeld in the Prost's who qualified in front of the Minardi's of Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E

25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{leveled at}} this justification {{is that it}} does not fulfill one of the requirements of a just war and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might <b>have</b> <b>set</b> <b>a</b> precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.|$|E
