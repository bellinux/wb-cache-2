5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Quorn was founded, an {{anonymous}} organization calling themselves The Spooks was started. Each Christmas, the members provided free {{food and clothing}} to the needy in Quorn and then in Kingsley. Their membership was small and only the members themselves <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> {{a part of the}} organization. All members wear masks and they are still in operation in Kingsley. The Women's Kingsley Community Action Club was founded in June 1980 as a splinter group of the Men's KCAC. It was started with the plan to help summer programs for Kingsley's youth. The city once published the newspaper The Kingsley-News Times that began publication in 1887. The local newspaper was founded by J. H. Strief, who later became president of the Iowa State Federation of Labor. The Kingsley-News Times was later combined with two other newspapers to form The Record, spreading its coverage to include multiple nearby cities.|$|E

25|$|In 1989 Frank Salemme, a close confidant of {{the elder}} Patriarca's, was {{released}} from prison. Ferrara and the other Boston {{members of the family}} feared he would attempt to effectively take over the leadership by becoming Raymond Jr.'s underboss. They attempted to have him killed outside a Saugus restaurant, but he survived some serious gunshot wounds. No one has ever faced charges over that attack, although Salemme <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> responsible.|$|E
25|$|By sunrise, {{the firefighters}} were still battling {{the fire and}} trying to spray areas where people were seen trapped. The {{watching}} crowd were pushed back from the building because of falling debris. At 04:14, officials from the Metropolitan Police Service addressed the large crowd of onlookers and urgently instructed them to contact anyone they <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> trapped in the building—if {{they are able to}} reach them via phone or social media—to tell them they must try to self-evacuate and not wait for the fire brigade. At 05:00, the building was still burning and severely damaged.|$|E

[...] Colonel Monro died in November 1757, of apoplexy that some historians have suggested was caused by anger over Webb's failure to support him.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} {{move with the}} Yankees, Barrow brought Red Sox coach Paul Krichell with him to New York as a scout. He {{purchased}} {{a share in the}} club in 1924. He also discovered executive George Weiss, whom he mentored. [...] Barrow also orchestrated a series of trades with his former club, mainly to keep Frazee afloat. [...] These trades netted the Yankees such stars as Bullet Joe Bush, Joe Dugan and George Pipgras. [...] It has been argued that these trades only looked lopsided in favor of the Yankees only because the players sent to Boston suffered a rash of injuries. [...] However, this is belied by the fact that Barrow almost certainly <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> coming to New York in these deals; he'd managed nearly all of them in Boston.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were also}} {{critical}} of the Next Generation tie-in. Sci Fi Weekly's Patrick Lee said the framing story [...] "reduces [...] {{to the status of}} lab rats." [...] Lee further noted that even without the guest appearances, the episode did not live up to the best offerings of the season, including [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly". National Posts Alex Strachan called the Next Generation cameos reminders of better Star Trek, compared to the [...] "bad make-up effects, bad acting, bad music" [...] of the latest show. Rob Salem of the Toronto Star said the cameos served no narrative purpose, and that the episode [...] "robs [...] characters (and their fans) of any significant long-term development or satisfying sense of closure." [...] Reviewers also criticized the episode's ending, where viewers never got to see Archer's rousing speech. IGN said that the episode was [...] "Berman and Braga's parting shot, making sure that everyone <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> in charge," [...] and that the sharp contrast between [...] "These Are the Voyages..." [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] brought into relief the reason why both {{should not be allowed to}} produce Star Trek ever again.|$|E
500|$|At the end {{of season}} three, House dismisses Chase, while Foreman and Cameron resign. After an episode in which he [...] "borrows" [...] a janitor whom he calls [...] "Dr. Buffer" [...] to assist in a diagnosis, House must then recruit a new {{diagnostic}} team, for which he identifies seven finalists. The producers originally planned to recruit two new full-time actors, with Foreman, who returns in season four's fifth episode, bringing the team back up to three members; ultimately, {{the decision was made}} to add three new regular cast members. (Along with Epps, actors Morrison and Spencer remained in the cast, as their characters moved on to new assignments.) During production, the show's writers dismissed a single candidate per episode; as a result, said Jacobs, neither the producers nor the cast <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> going to be hired until the last minute. In the season's ninth episode, House's new team is revealed: Foreman is joined by doctors Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Remy [...] "Thirteen" [...] Hadley (Olivia Wilde). The candidates rejected by House did not return to the show, with the exception of the last one cut: Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), who appeared for the rest of season four as Wilson's girlfriend, and in seasons five and eight as a hallucination of House's. While Penn and Wilde had higher profiles than the actors who played the other finalists, Jacobs said they went through an identical audition process and stayed with the show based on the writers' interest in their characters. Kutner was written out of the series in episode 20 of season 5 after Penn took a position in the Obama White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs.|$|E

Rigdon reportedly [...] "rushed into the ring, sword in hand, {{and said that he}} would not suffer a lot of men to break the Sabbath day in that manner." [...] Smith [...] "dragged him from the ring, bareheaded, and tore Rigdon's fine pulpit coat from the collar to the waist".

2500|$|Cricket journalists gave a mixed {{opinion on}} the quality of the series, praising several good spells of bowling but criticising the poor {{standard}} of batting, which was seen as too aggressive and impatient for Test cricket. There was also disappointment that none of the matches lasted the full five days, with the result often obvious early on. Vic Marks said [...] "by the end of the second day of each match we always <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> going to win; sometimes that was obvious by the end of the first day; at Nottingham by the first interval".|$|E

His critics claimed {{he was given a}} psychiatric discharge for deliberately injuring himself in the heel. [...] Harvey angrily denied the accusation, but was vague about details: [...] "There was a little training accident...a minor cut on the obstacle course...I don't recall seeing anyone I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a psychiatrist...I cannot tell you the exact wording on my discharge." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{activists in}} the Iraqi Zionist {{underground}} were found guilty by an Iraqi court {{for a number of}} the bombings, and were sentenced to death. Another was sentenced to life imprisonment and seventeen more were given long prison sentences. The allegations against Israeli agents had [...] "wide consensus" [...] amongst Iraqi Jews in Israel. Many of the Iraqi Jews in Israel who lived in poor conditions blamed their ills and misfortunes on the Israeli Zionist emissaries or Iraqi Zionist underground movement. The theory that [...] "certain Jews" [...] carried out the attacks [...] "in order to focus the attention of the Israel Government on the plight of the Jews" [...] was viewed as [...] "more plausible than most" [...] by the British Foreign Office. Telegrams between the Mossad agents in Baghdad and their superiors in Tel Aviv give the impression that neither group <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the attack.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{started on}} May 6, 1935 with Chester Lyons as the cinematographer. Freund insisted on Gregg Toland, whom he got for a {{reported}} [...] "8 days of additional photography". Actress Frances Drake recalled difficulty between Freund, Toland and Considine. Drake said that [...] "Freund {{wanted to be}} the cinematographer at the same time", and that [...] "You never <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> directing. The producer was dying to, to tell you the truth, and of course he had no idea of directing." [...] Several titles for the film were announced, and on May 22, 1935, MGM announced that the title would be The Hands of Orlac. The Mad Doctor of Paris was also suggested, but the studio eventually settled on the original title of Mad Love. Shooting finished on June 8, 1935, one week over schedule. After the initial release, MGM cut about fifteen minutes of scenes from the film. Cut scenes included the surgery to get Rollo's hands, a pre-credit warning scene similar to the one in Frankenstein, and Isabel Jewell's entire portrayal of the character Marianne.|$|E

2500|$|The scandal, {{which was}} [...] great {{enough to be}} {{included}} in the Annual Registers [...] "Chronicle of Remarkable Occurrences", generated widespread publicity for the play, and, even without the makeup, everyone <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> really being portrayed. [...] In fact, wrote The Times, [...] "the Lord Chamberlain has proved a mighty instructor ... everybody perfectly knows whom [...] are intended to represent, and every line they utter is the signal for an approving roar." [...] The critics mostly praised the piece, although papers disagreed on whether or not the stage should be more subject to censorship than the press. For instance, The Manchester Guardian wrote that the satire made [...] "Many a brilliant sally at the supposed short-comings of the present government." [...] Meanwhile, Gilbert was having some trouble keeping up the pseudonym. Shirley Brooks may have thought F. Tomline was Henry Labouchère, but reviewers and others were beginning to link him with Gilbert. Worse, Gilbert's friend and collaborator Frederic Clay began vigorously defending him against the absolutely true allegations, forcing Gilbert to quietly take him into his confidence. The Athenaeum commented that the play was [...] "written with such talent, and catching very well the very spirit of Mr. Gilbert's manner and method that we cannot but suspect that the interest of Mr. Gilbert in it has not stopped with mere superintendence of stage management, as announced." [...] The play became one of the big hits of the season, running for 142 performances until the theatre closed for summer renovations on 9 August 1873. It then enjoyed a lengthy provincial tour and being immediately revived when the theatre reopened on 14 October 1873.|$|E
