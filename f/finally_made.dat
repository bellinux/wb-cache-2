5|$|Having {{missed the}} first half of the 2015–16 season as a result of a serious knee injury, Rosický <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> his first {{appearance}} on 30 January in a FA Cup tie with Burnley. After the match, it was revealed that he suffered a thigh injury during the encounter, with the result that he would spend at least another month on the sidelines.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 2014, Spain manager Vicente del Bosque {{included}} Costa in {{the squad}} for a friendly against Italy, {{but he was}} an unused substitute. He <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> his debut on 5 March, playing the full 90 minutes at his club ground, the Vicente Calderón Stadium, as the hosts won 1–0.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2013, Horton {{signed a}} seven-year free agent {{contract}} worth $37.1 million with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Off-season shoulder surgery, however, would sideline Horton until January 2, 2014 when he <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> his Blue Jackets debut and scored the game-winning goal in a 2–0 {{victory over the}} Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E

5|$|Saran has {{starred in}} Deepa Mehta's long delayed English project Midnight's Children, {{which is based}} on Salman Rushdie's highly {{acclaimed}} novel of the same name. It was filmed under the working title of Winds of Change. It was screened at several film festivals in late 2012 in Canada and <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> its general release in India on 1 February 2013.|$|E
5|$|The final leg of Gloucestershire's {{northern}} {{tour was}} at Trent Bridge where they played Nottinghamshire from Thursday, 1 August, to Saturday, 3 August. This match was drawn after rain intervened. Gloucestershire scored 165 (Grace 9) and 253 (Grace 116). Nottinghamshire scored 258 (Grace 2–91) and 10 for 1 (Grace (1–2). So Grace <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> his first (and only) century of the 1878 season, surprisingly against arguably the strongest bowling {{attack in the}} country.|$|E
5|$|Candace, back at {{the mall}} (having not further {{attempted}} to bust her brothers since the building implosion from earlier), is downtrodden until her crush, Jeremy, assures her to not let the boys' fun ruin her good time and that if she {{got the chance to}} sing, she ought to, so she joins with the band singing their hit song in a reunion concert. When she thinks she has <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> it, the band announces they have finished their career and the mall closes, leaving her in the dark.|$|E
30|$|The {{previous}} implementation {{is extended}} {{to support the}} search for a legal plan. And <b>finally,</b> we <b>made</b> some evaluation tests and propose some optimization tools using heuristics.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E
5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis {{suffered}} hip and groin injuries during pre-season {{training and}} {{was unable to}} take any further part in training until September. He <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> his debut for his new club on 20 October 2007, when he came on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 2–0 home victory over Charlton Athletic. After regaining full fitness, he became a first-choice player at Molineux, making a further 27 appearances during the 2007–08 season. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw with Leicester City in December 2007, in a season where the club missed out on a play-off place by virtue of goal difference.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{reasoned}} {{with the}} man, but didn't seem to soothe him, and <b>finally</b> he <b>made</b> a grab for the door-handle, so I knocked off his hat, {{and while he}} was retrieving it we moved on and escaped." ...|$|R
50|$|Paccard had a first, unsuccessful, {{attempt in}} 1783 with Marc Theodore Bourrit. In 1784, he made several {{attempts}} with Jacques Balmat. <b>Finally,</b> he <b>made</b> the first ascent of Mont Blanc with Jacques Balmat on 8 August 1786.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} bachelor thesis {{deals with}} arc welding of stainless steels by welding method TIG. It compares {{the influence of}} pulse and DC current on the welded component. Introduction analyzes the influence of arc welding on metallic materials, heat introduced into the weld and the heat affected area. Two experiments on S 235 JR and 1. 4301 steel were performed to verify theoretical assumptions. The effects of current on the material were evaluated using {{the analysis of the}} tests and the calculation and the conclusions were <b>made.</b> <b>Finally</b> I <b>made</b> recommendations for practice and possible further research on the issue...|$|R
5|$|Of all the {{responsibilities}} given the two ships, {{the most important}} was to guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a breakout by Goeben, but when Goeben and Breslau <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> their breakout attempt on 20 January 1918, Lord Nelson was away at Salonika and Agamemnon could not get steam up to depart Mudros in time {{to participate in the}} resulting Battle of Imbros. After both German ships struck mines, Breslau sank and Goeben returned to the Dardanelles before Agamemnon could arrive on the scene.|$|E
5|$|On the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, {{elements}} of five different companies had become entangled, {{and the situation}} was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, {{three of the four}} remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.|$|E
5|$|While {{stopped on}} the Biggerstaff land, the rebels convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners. Some were testified against by Patriots who had {{previously}} fought alongside them and later changed sides. Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought {{an end to the}} proceedings. His decision to halt the executions came after an impassioned plea for mercy from one of the Biggerstaff women, although accounts vary as to whether it was Martha Biggerstaff, Aaron's wife, or Mary Van Zant Biggerstaff, Benjamin's wife. Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days, while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led in single file through woodlands. The column <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> camp at Salem, North Carolina.|$|E

60|$|The {{dance of}} the magicians lasted fully {{a quarter of an}} hour. Then came a low chant, and a conference followed. Strange strings of beads were exchanged, and <b>finally</b> Pontiac <b>made</b> an address, in an Indian dialect of which neither Barringford nor Dave could {{understand}} a word.|$|R
5|$|According to naval {{historian}} Ian Buxton, {{the most}} important role of the Royal Navy was to blockade the Dardanelles and thus guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a breakout by Goeben. On 12 January 1918, Rear-Admiral Arthur Hayes-Sadler hoisted his flag aboard Lord Nelson at Mudros as the new commander of the Aegean Squadron. Needing transportation to Salonika for a conference with the British Army commander there, and finding his personal yacht unavailable, Hayes-Sadler opted to have Lord Nelson take him there, and thus she was not present when Goeben and Breslau <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> their breakout attempt on 20 January. The ship could not {{get back to the}} Dardanelles in time to participate in the resulting Battle of Imbros or intercept Goeben before she gained shelter in the Dardanelles. Lord Nelson was later given a short refit at Malta in October.|$|E
5|$|At only 21 Kydd was the {{youngest}} player on the tour of Jamaica and, while she toured with {{the remainder of the}} team, was overlooked for a Test position. She <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> her full début against South Africa not long afterwards, and managed to cement her position with a superb performance, managing an accuracy rate of 94% in the third Test. This performance, along with similar form in the national league, led to her selection in the starting squad for the 2003 Netball World Championships. She played every game in the world championships in July at the expense of ageing veteran Eloise Southby, a decision which was the cause of some controversy. She subsequently helped the Kestrels to the elimination final and, {{at the end of the}} season, was named as the team's new vice-captain, with predecessor Janine Ilitch assuming the captaincy. She also won the coveted Commonwealth Bank Trophy Player's Player Award, and tied for third in the Most Valuable Player count.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E

50|$|Pimentel's {{breakout}} role came in 2013, {{when she}} was cast as Maria Ruiz on the Netflix comedy-drama Orange Is the New Black. Pimentel was credited as a guest star {{for the first four}} seasons, before <b>finally</b> being <b>made</b> a part of the regular cast for Season 5.|$|R
50|$|Malhotra {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} director on Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001), Nikhil Advani's Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Amol Palekar's Paheli (2005) and Tarun Mansukhani's Dostana (2008). <b>Finally</b> he <b>made</b> his debut as an director with I Hate Luv Storys (2010), which he also wrote.|$|R
5|$|Balchen's fleet was {{successful}} in driving off the French, who retired {{in the face of}} his superior fleet without firing a shot, and Hardy's convoy was escorted safely to Gibraltar. On the way to the Portuguese Coast, Balchen <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> his fortune in prize money, capturing six heavily laden French West Indiamen. On his return journey however, the fleet was sailing through the Western Approaches in early October when it was hit by a violent storm. Scattered across the Channel, they one by one returned to England in a battered and leaking condition until, a few days later, only HMS Victory was missing. Victory, Balchen's flagship, was, at the time, one of the largest ships in the world, holding a broadside of 100 guns. She was also very new, having been completed less than seven years before.|$|E
5|$|By 1830, {{because of}} {{difficult}} economic conditions in Britain that reduced {{the demand for}} fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning Georg Scharf to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting, Duria Antiquior, portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her. It became the first such scene from what later became known as deep time to be widely circulated. In December 1830 she <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> another major find, a skeleton of {{a new type of}} plesiosaur, which sold for £200.|$|E
5|$|Donaldson {{was called}} {{up by the}} England National Game XI, who {{represent}} England at non-League level, for a European Challenge Trophy match against Belgium in November 2005. He was named in the initial 35-man squad for the Four Nations Tournament in May 2006, but {{did not make the}} final 18-man squad. Donaldson <b>finally</b> <b>made</b> the cut when being named in the final 16-man squad for the team to play the Netherlands in November 2006. He made his debut in this match, coming on as a substitute in the last 15 minutes, in which he set up Craig Mackail-Smith for the final goal of a 4–1 victory. Donaldson was included in the squad to play Northern Ireland in February 2007, although York manager McEwan contemplated withdrawing Donaldson from the squad, after his comeback for York against Altrincham in February 2007. Donaldson eventually started against Northern Ireland, but was substituted after 50 minutes for Paul Benson, who scored England's only goal two minutes after coming on in a 3–1 defeat. This was the final of two caps he earned for England National Game XI.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possibility}} was explored {{then with}} Aeritalia-Aermacchi, but the financial problems that it crossed the country they <b>made</b> <b>finally</b> abandon the project.|$|R
25|$|Liang Shuqing: Liang Shueng's {{younger brother}} became the second {{challenger}} to defeat Iron Chef Chen Kenichi in 30 minutes overtime {{battle with the}} theme ingredient Konnyaku.
