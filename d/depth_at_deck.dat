50|$|Beam on Centerline (BOC) - Used for multihull vessels. The BOC for vessels is {{measured}} as follows: For a catamaran: the perpendicular {{distance from the}} centerline of one hull to the centerline of the other hull, measured <b>at</b> <b>deck</b> level. For a trimaran: the perpendicular distance between the centerline of the main hull and the centerline of either ama, measured <b>at</b> <b>deck</b> level. This term in typically {{used in conjunction with}} LOA (Length overall; see below). The ratio of LOA/BOC is used to estimate the stability of multihull vessels. The lower the ratio the greater the boat's stability.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} {{drilling}} equipment and different access strategies {{to reach the}} miners with escape boreholes were tried in parallel. When the escape shaft reached the miners, there were three plans in operation—the Strata 950 ("Plan A", 702 meter target <b>depth</b> <b>at</b> 90°), the Schramm T130XD ("Plan B", 638 meter target <b>depth</b> <b>at</b> 82°), and a RIG-421 drill ("Plan C", 597 meter target <b>depth</b> <b>at</b> 85°).|$|R

40|$|<b>Depth</b> <b>at</b> {{homogeneous}} or weakly-textured image {{areas is}} difficult to obtain because such image areas suffer the well-known correspondence problem. In this paper, we propose a voting model that predicts the <b>depth</b> <b>at</b> such image areas from the depth of bounding edge-like structures. The <b>depth</b> <b>at</b> edge-like structures is computed using a feature-based stereo algorithm, and is used {{to vote for the}} depth of homogeneous image areas. We show the results of our ongoing work on different scenarios...|$|R

50|$|In some cases, {{such as the}} Capilano Suspension Bridge, {{the primary}} {{supports}} form the handrails with the deck suspended below them. This makes for more motion side-to-side in the deck than when the primary supports are <b>at</b> <b>deck</b> level, but less motion in the handrails.|$|R
