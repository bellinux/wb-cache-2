5|$|Born in {{an ancient}} noble <b>family</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Languedoc, he entered the French royal army as a {{volunteer}} in 1769. After having served in the Corsican legion, he transferred in 1771 to a Dragoon regiment. From 1777, he served as {{an officer in the}} Dragoon Regiment of the Languedoc.

5|$|He {{was born}} into a {{military}} landowning <b>family</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south of the Russian Empire, and followed the family tradition by entering the army. In 1903, he was noticed by Grand Duchess Olga during a military review, and they became close friends. Olga wanted to divorce her first husband, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, and marry Kulikovsky, but neither her husband nor her brother, the Tsar, would allow it.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble <b>family</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E

5|$|The Chakri Dynasty of Thailand has {{included}} marriages between royal relatives, but marriages between dynasts and foreigners, including foreign royals, are rare.

5|$|Although Domnall {{had earlier}} opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he possessed strong {{familial}} {{connections with the}} Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach. In fact, the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals {{that at least two}} apparent members of Echmarcach's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann. As a result of their demise, Domnall may well have become the leading male representative of his mother's <b>family.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> standpoint of the Uí Briain, the union of Domnall's parents would, therefore, seem to have been orchestrated in the context of extending Uí Briain authority into the Isles. In 1096, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, lost his life on Mann, apparently whilst supporting Domnall's undertaking in the Isles. This source not only corroborates Uí Briain intervention in the Isles, but suggests that Domnall {{and the rest of the}} Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there, possibly in the form of Lagmann's adherents. The chronicle credits Domnall with an oppressive three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his <b>family</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCreary's election, his wife Kate was the {{youngest}} first lady in the Commonwealth's history.

The program became popular at Stanford, and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in a rented garage.|$|E
