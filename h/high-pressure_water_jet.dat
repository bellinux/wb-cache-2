2500|$|A {{free jet}} water turbine or impulse water turbine, also {{commonly}} known as a Pelton's wheel, is a wheel that uses cups, or buckets, that are split down the middle by a metal divider, so that in effect two cups are mounted side-by-side at each [...] "spoke" [...] in the wheel. A <b>high-pressure</b> <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> aimed {{at the center of}} each bucket is split by the divider to hit each of cup, one on the left, the other on the right. The design of this water turbine takes advantage of a mechanics principle known as impulse, a force defined as the product of the force and the time during which it acts. In 1878, Lester Pelton invented his prototype known as the Pelton's wheel, first demonstrating it to miners in the Sierra Nevada. In 1880, Lester Pelton received a patent for his invention.|$|E

Scale is then jetted or scraped from the interior surfaces using a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> and rods of soft metal, such as copper. Areas particularly susceptible to scale buildup, such as the firebox crown and narrow water spaces around the firebox, are given special attention. The inside of the boiler is inspected by sighting through the plug holes, with a particular check paid to the integrity of the firetubes, firebox crown and stays and absence of pitting or cracking of the boiler plates. The gauge glass cocks and tubes and fusible plug should be cleared of scale; if the core of the fusible plug shows signs of calcination the item should be replaced.|$|E

The present paper provides a careful validation for the simulation of an impinging abrasive liquid jet, taking progressively into account the necessary features: impingement, free-surface, particles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} the effect of <b>High-Pressure</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Jet</b> Assisted Turning (HPWJAT) of {{austenitic}} stainless steels on chip shape and residual stresses. The machining of the austenitic stainless steels represents several difficulties. Recently, {{research has shown that}} the introduction of a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> into the gap between the tool and the chip interface is a very satisfactory method for machining applications. In this article, the effect of a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>water</b> <b>jet,</b> directed into the tool-chip interface, on chip shapes breakage and surface integrity in face turning operations of AISI 316 L steel has been investigated. Tests have been carried out with a standard cutting tool. The cutting speeds used were 80 and 150 m/min, with a constant feed rate of 0. 1 mm/rev and a constant cutting depth of 1 mm. Three jet pressures were used: 20, 50 and 80 MPa. Residual stress profiles have been analysed using the X-ray diffraction method in both longitudinal and transversal directions. The results show that jet pressure and cutting parameters influence the residual stresses and the chip shapes. Using a high-pressure jet, it is possible to create a well fragmented chip in contrast to the continuous chip formed using dry turning. It is also possible to control the chip shape and increase tool life. When the jet pressure is increased the residual stress at the surface decreases; however it is increased by an increase in cutting speed. It can be concluded that surface residual stresses can be reduced by the introduction of a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>water</b> <b>jet...</b>|$|E
