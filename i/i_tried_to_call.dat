He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

6000|$|... [Dictated, November 8, 1906.] I have {{a defect}} {{of a sort}} which I think is not common; {{certainly}} I hope it isn't: it is rare that I can call before my mind's eye the form and face of either friend or enemy. If I should make a list, now, of persons whom I know in America and abroad--say {{to the number of}} even an entire thousand--it is quite unlikely that I could reproduce five of them in my mind's eye. Of my dearest and most intimate friends, I could name eight whom I have seen and talked with four days ago, but when <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> them before me they are formless shadows. Jean has been absent, this past eight or ten days, in the country, and I wish I could reproduce her in the mirror of my mind, but I can't do it.|$|R
6000|$|Since the {{collection}} was first made, I have written little else quite of the kind, except {{the paper on}} Bret Harte, which was first printed shortly after his death; {{and the study of}} Mark Twain, which I had been preparing to make for forty years and more, and wrote in two weeks of the spring of 1910. Others of my time and place have now passed whither there is neither time nor place, and there are moments when I feel that <b>I</b> must <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> them back and pay them such honor as my sense of their worth may give; but the impulse has as yet failed to effect itself, and I do not know how long I shall spare myself the supreme pleasure-pain, the [...] "hochst angenehmer Schmerz," [...] of seeking to live here with those who live here no more.|$|R

6000|$|... [Thursday, March 28, 1907.] Some {{months ago}} I commented upon {{a chapter of}} Susy's Biography wherein she very elaborately {{discussed}} {{an article about the}} training and disciplining of children, which I had published in the [...] "Christian Union" [...] (this was twenty-one years ago), an article which was full of worshipful praises of Mrs. Clemens as a mother, and which little Clara, and Susy, and I had been hiding from this lovely and admirable mother because we knew she would disapprove of public and printed praises of herself. At the time that I was dictating these comments, several months ago, <b>I</b> was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> back <b>to</b> my memory some of the details of that article, but I was not able to do it, and I wished I had a copy of the article so that I could see what there was about it which gave it such large interest for Susy.|$|R
60|$|As to Mr. Nicholas B., {{sub-lieutenant}} of 1808, lieutenant of 1813 in the French Army, {{and for a}} {{short time}} Officier d'Ordonnance of Marshal Marmont; afterwards Captain in the 2nd Regiment of Mounted Rifles in the Polish Army--such as it existed up to 1830 in the reduced kingdom established by the Congress of Vienna--I must say that from all that more distant past, known to me traditionally and a little de visu, and called out by the words of the man just gone away, he remains the most incomplete figure. It is obvious that I must have seen him in '64, for it is certain that he would not have missed the opportunity of seeing my mother for what he must have known would be the last time. From my early boyhood to this day, if <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> up his image, a sort of mist rises before my eyes, a mist in which I perceive vaguely only a neatly brushed head of white hair (which is exceptional {{in the case of the}} B. family, where it is the rule for men to go bald in a becoming manner, before thirty) and a thin, curved, dignified nose, a feature in strict accordance with the physical tradition of the B. family. But it is not by these fragmentary remains of perishable mortality that he lives in my memory. I knew, at a very early age, that my grand-uncle Nicholas B. was a Knight of the Legion of Honour and that he had also the Polish Cross for valour Virtuti Militari. The knowledge of these glorious facts inspired in me an admiring veneration; yet it is not that sentiment, strong as it was, which resumes for me the force and the significance of his personality. It is overborne by another and complex impression of awe, compassion and horror. Mr. Nicholas B. remains for me the unfortunate and miserable (but heroic) being who once upon a time had eaten a dog.|$|R
6000|$|One night I {{heard one}} man say, [...] "Well, let's call up New York and offer them {{a quarter of}} a cent." [...] Great heavens! Imagine paying the cost of calling up New York, nearly five million people, late at night and {{offering}} them {{a quarter of a}} cent! And yet--did New York get mad? No, they took it.

Then I laid my head on my arms there in the saddle. I was afraid to look again, for I knew it was an hallucination, and I knew that if I looked the man would be gone. And so precious was the hallucination, that I wanted it to persist yet a little while. I knew, too, that as long as I did not look it would persist.|$|E

For five days this cruel imprisonment continued, with hardly enough food to hold body and soul together. This afternoon a good lunch was brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew that I had been drugged. In a sort of dream I remember being half-led, half-carried to the carriage; in the same state I was conveyed to the train. Only then, when the wheels were almost moving, did I suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own hands.

Suspension of judgement, epoch, brings about tranquillity, and sceptical arguments are so designed as to lead to the suspension of judgement.

Well here I am back in the wilds and I’m so goddamned disgusted I’m burning up. This morning I signed out and ate breakfast etc. and got to line at eight o. k. But, in the usual manner no one knew anything about where I was going or when. So I didn’t get off until nine o’clock after convincing them I wasn’t going A. W. O. L. A first Lt flew me down to Eglin itself first, and then over here to Aux # 4 from whence I am leaving. So he drops me here and takes off for Craig. And again I go through the old routine. Nobody knows nuttin’ no speake de English. So at this point I am getting annoyed, very annoyed. “What the hell kind of an outfit is this,” says I, pulling my rank. It got results- they sent me to Captain so-and-so. No, he didn’t know, - maybe Major… [...] no sonny, report to Colonel what’s-his-name. About the only person I didn’t see down here was Eleanor, (she was away). So finally, some Corporeal (no by gosh, he was a P. F. C.) comes running up to me with the glad news that I wasn’t supposed to get here until Friday. If I could have gotten hold of a gun then I would have shot him, the captain, the major, the goddanmed colonel, and then blown my own blasted head off! But everything is not lost. A plan begins to form in my feeble mind. Maybe I can get a ship and fly back to Craig, returning home tomorrow morning. So I go see Captain so-and-so. No, he can’t give me permission, better ask Major… [...] Forget it, forget I even mentioned it I said desperately trying to control myself. My next stop was the Officers Club where I proceeded to drown my sorrows {{in two or three}} dozen beers. Out of all of this I have but one question to ask: - why the hell didn’t I join the Navy?! I’m supposed to leave Saturday. There are two Instructors going with me and two other officers from Napier + Spence. Each advanced school has a man representing it. I’m representing Craig. It must be a big meet, they’re guys {{from all over the country}} going down. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> you tonight but the local phone wasn’t working. I hope they get it fixed by Saturday. What did you do after I left? I know you can’t answer it but I like to ask anyhow. What time did you get up? Do you miss me? My darling I didn’t think I could ever miss anyone as much as I do you. These last few days have been wonderful darling, although maybe a little tiring, boy I was beat last night. I’m going to hit the sack early tonight and sleep late tomorrow. Boy I’m going to feel lonely sackin’ solo again. Have you heard any news about a car yet? (what am I asking you for, you can’t answer me) Oh honey, you’d better wrote the photographer and order some pictures for me and mom. Have a set made for each of all of them, understand – all of them! It’s $ 1. 50 apiece for 8 x 10. But he’ll send us a bill. We’ll have some more made later. The Kodachromes can wait too. I’m so mad honey. We could have had the whole day together today. Oh well, we ought to have alot [sic] of time when I get back. I’ll have to sit around until the next P- 40 class starts. I miss you so much angel. You’re a wonderful wife darling. I’m the luckiest + happiest (also the loudiest [sic]) guy in the world. You’re the sweetest girl. I love you darling.
