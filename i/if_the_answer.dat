They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity.

25|$|During a quiz bowl game, {{two or more}} {{teams of}} usually up to four or five players are read {{questions}} by a moderator. In most forms of quiz bowl, {{there are two basic}} types of questions: toss-ups and bonuses. Toss-ups are questions that any individual player can attempt to answer, and players are generally not allowed to confer with each other. Each player usually has a signaling device, also called a buzzer, to signal in {{at any time during the}} question to give an answer. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> given is incorrect, then no other member of that team may give an answer. If a toss-up is successfully answered, the correctly answering team is given an opportunity to answer a bonus. Bonuses are usually worth a total of 30 points, and consist of three individual questions worth ten points each. Team members are generally permitted to confer with each other on these questions.|$|E

500|$|The Garbage Museum was an {{operating}} recycling facility and featured a viewing {{area for the}} operation which processes around 60,000 tons of recyclables from 20 local towns. Educational exhibits focused {{on the benefits of}} recycling drink cans and mining bauxite, the main source of aluminum, and reducing air pollution and water pollution. Another exhibit features a walk-through tunnel depicting a compost pile. Interactive exhibits included a general store and a [...] "Trash Bash" [...] activity in which [...] "imprison helmet-wearing contestants ... answer questions. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is wrong, others are given the green light to dump trash on them from an overhead opening."

500|$|On December 24, Khánh {{issued a}} {{declaration}} of independence from [...] "foreign manipulation", and condemned [...] "colonialism", explicitly accusing Taylor of abusing his power. At the time, Khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping {{to put together a}} peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Khánh was expressing opposition to the US merely because he knew he had lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Khánh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti-American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam. The US media were generally very critical of Khánh's actions and did not blame Taylor for the disharmony. Peter Grose of The New York Times said [...] "It almost seems as if Viet Cong insurgents and the Saigon government conspired to make the United States feel unwelcome." [...] The Chicago Tribune lampooned Khánh's junta, calling it a [...] "parody of a government" [...] and saying it would not survive for a week without US support and describing the generals as [...] "remittance men on the United States' payroll". However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm, who had resisted US advice so often. It said [...] "The issue is not General Khánh versus General Taylor. It is whether the Vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state." [...] The newspaper said <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> was yes, then both Washington and Saigon would have to look beyond personalities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} theories on lexical access for bilinguals, Language Selective Access and Language Non-Selective Access, {{attempt to explain}} the process and stages of lexical activation and selection. These hypotheses focus on determining whether lexical candidates from different languages that share similar lexical features are activated when a word is presented. For instance, when the Dutch word vork is activated, is the English word pork also activated? <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is [...] "no", it might suggest that language selection happens before the recognition of a word and only the lexical information of the target language is selectively activated, in which case lexical access is language selective. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is [...] "yes", it might suggest the other possibility that the recognition of a word is processed in parallel for both languages and the lexical information of both languages are activated, in which case lexical access is language non-selective.

2500|$|When people {{converse}} with one another, {{according to the}} American philosopher John Searle, they're making moves, not {{in the real world}} which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of illocutionary force requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level— that of social reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of [...] "brute facts"— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief— but of [...] "institutional facts", which [...] "exist" [...] only if you believe in them. Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of [...] "institutional facts". One can distinguish between [...] "brute" [...] facts and [...] "institutional" [...] ones by applying a simple test.
