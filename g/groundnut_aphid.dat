50|$|Groundnut rosette virus (GRV) is {{a peanut}} {{pathogenic}} virus found in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is transmitted between plants by insect vectors {{such as the}} <b>groundnut</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis craccivora).|$|E
5000|$|Aphis craccivora, {{variously}} {{known as}} the cowpea aphid, <b>groundnut</b> <b>aphid</b> or black legume aphid, is a true bug in the family Aphididae. [...] Originally of probable Palearctic origin, it is now an invasive species of cosmopolitan distribution.|$|E
50|$|The main vector for {{groundnut}} rosette {{virus is}} the <b>groundnut</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis craccivora). When it sucks the sap of an infected plant it receives groundnut rosette virus and satellite RNA, packaged together within a coating of groundnut rosette assistor virus. The disease is epidemic {{in nature and}} there is a seasonal cycle of infection, but the origins of this virus are unknown. In Africa, the <b>groundnut</b> <b>aphid</b> feeds on as many as 142 different species of plant, many of them in the Fabaceae family, and the groundnut rosette virus is presumed to have originated among these. Research has shown that although other host plants exist for GRV, GRAV and satellite RNA individually, the only known natural host plant for all parts of the complex is the groundnut.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{biological}} performance parameters of Aphis craccivora on groundnut variety ICG 12991 in laboratory and field trials demonstrated that ICG 12991 was {{resistant to the}} <b>aphid</b> vector of <b>groundnut</b> rosette diseases and that this resistance was stable over time and under high aphid pressure. Feeding experiments related slow population development and high aphid mortality on ICG 12991 to an inhibition of phloem feeding from the sieve elements. Consequently, virus transmission of all three agents of rosette disease was almost totally absent even under very high pressure of viruliferous aphids. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism of resistance in ICG 12991 showed that the resistance was induced by aphid probes rather than constitutive. The induced plant response {{was described as a}} hypersensitive response around the aphid feeding sites. Aphid-resistance and hypersensitivity were identified in at least 7 groundnut varieties and it is proposed that more varieties are likely to express these characteristics. The results led to the recommendation to evaluate <b>groundnut</b> varieties for <b>aphid</b> resistance by evaluating aphid population development. The identification of vector resistance and its efficacy in reducing virus spread of rosette disease in the field has opened the way for novel approaches for groundnut disease management...|$|R
