5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} {{rates and}} mechanisms {{are affected by}} a variety of factors including the strength of the surface-adparticle bond, orientation of the surface lattice, attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients. It is an important concept in surface phase formation, <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth,</b> heterogeneous catalysis, and other topics in surface science. As such, the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries. Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver halide salts used in photographic film.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E

LEEM {{is one of}} the most powerful tools to identify the thickness of graphene on SiC with a good spatial resolution.

It is shown that epitaxial graphene sheets continue even over steps of the substrate, and that a new graphene sheet often grows from step edges while the surface morphology changes drastically. Furthermore, the first-principles calculations also show the energetics of the <b>epitaxial</b> graphene <b>growth</b> on SiC.
