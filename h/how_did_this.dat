She commented, [...] "The minute you walked in , she was giving you the lyric sheet. That was the atmosphere—we're not here to just hang out. It's fun, but we're here to work and get this done". De Lory recalls the {{sessions}} for [...] "Survival" [...] took a [...] "couple of hours" [...] {{and there were no}} retakes. During recording sessions, Madonna was interested in working with Austin after he produced Joi's debut album The Pendulum Vibe (1994).

[...] A writer for BET Sound Off called the video a [...] "tantalizing visual" [...] and said he adored it, commenting, [...] "sans Kanye and Neyo’s unbearable showdown, I could watch this video {{over and over and}} over and over!" [...] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Though their scenes together are G-rated in comparison to Ciara's steamy romp with Justin Timberlake in their new clip for 'Love Sex Magic,' Hilson’s solo shots in bed are undeniably hot. Indeed, a tasteful flash of booty never hurt nobody." [...] In an interview on the Today Show, anchor Hoda Kotb made a remark to Ne-Yo, stating, [...] "You have this really hot new video that you do with Kanye West and another woman named Keri. You [...] are such big stars. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> happen?" [...] Blogs reported this as a possible [...] "diss" [...] toward Hilson, however, neither camps reported anything after the fact.|$|E

Decades ago it {{was among the first to}} furnish its workers with guaranteed annual wages and profit-sharing plans. Generations of family members worked at the plant, taking pride in their products and their relationship to the manufacturing process. The answer the movie presents is Reaganomics, the 'as long as I've got mine, the hell with everyone else' attitude prevalent in the 1980s".|$|E
2500|$|Part VI of the {{decision}} discussed whether the statute impermissibly targeted the Communist Party as the sole political party seeking the violent overthrow of the United States government. If the statute had penalized anyone who advocated violent overthrow of the government, Vinson held, there would be new constitutional doubts raised. But it was the Court's long-held tenet that statutes should be construed constitutionally wherever possible. Subsequently, Vinson interpreted Section 9(h) narrowly as barring from union office those who actually advocated overthrow {{of the government and}} not those who (for example) believed it would happen without their assistance. Vinson reiterated that the balancing of interests in Part V had found the infringement on free speech pemissible. But <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> reconcile with Reynolds v. United States? [...] Because, Vinson said, [...] "Insofar as a distinction between beliefs and political affiliations is based upon absence of any 'overt act' ... the act of joining the Party is crucial. ... courts and juries every day pass upon knowledge, belief and intent—the state of men's minds—having before them no more than evidence of their words and conduct, from which, in ordinary human experience, mental condition may be inferred." ...|$|E
