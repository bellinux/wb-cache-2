50|$|Investment {{banks that}} offer this product usually take a riskless {{position}} by hedging the client's {{position with the}} underlying asset. For example, the client may trade a swap - say Vodafone. The bank credits the client with 1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45. The bank pays the return on this investment to the client, but also buys the stock in the same quantity for its own trading book (1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45). Any equity-leg return paid to or due from the client is offset against realised profit or loss on its own investment in the underlying asset. The bank makes its money through commissions, interest spreads and dividend rake-off (paying the client less of the dividend than it receives itself). It may also use the hedge position stock (1,000 Vodafone in this example) {{as part of a}} <b>funding</b> <b>transaction</b> such as stock lending,repo or as collateral for a loan.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of the banking firm that is {{intended}} to reflect contemporary trends in the evolution of banks. In particular, we focus on the effects of both interbank and capital market competition on the role of banks in funding corporations. In our model, banks can choose to provide loans that are similar to capital market <b>funding</b> (<b>transaction</b> loans) or loans that involve unique bank-specific services (relationship loans). Borrowers can choose one of these two types of bank loans or directly access the capital market. Our key result is that, contrary to what many believe, a bank’s optimal response to increased competition is to expand relationship lending relative to its transaction lending. The behaviour of the absolute level of relationship lending with respect to increasing competition is non-monotone. Initially, an elevation in competition leads to an increase in the expected level of relationship lending, but then the expected level of relationship lending falls as competition rises further. Moreover, the viability of relationship banking depends significantly on the reputational quality of banks. Commercial Banking; Financial System Design; Investment...|$|E

40|$|Inter {{corporate}} asset sales {{provide a}} viable alternative to mergers and acquisitions to create shareholder value for both the buyer and seller companies. Intercorporate asset sales are defined as the sale of autonomous operational assets which does not entail a change in ownership control of the seller. Mergers and acquisitions research found greater value was created by cash <b>funded</b> <b>transactions</b> compared to equity <b>funded</b> <b>transactions.</b> Contrary to mergers and acquisitions, asset sale research found equity <b>funded</b> <b>transactions</b> created greater value compared to cash <b>funded</b> <b>transactions.</b> This research provides {{a deeper understanding of the}} effect the method of payment has on the value created when selling assets, enabling management of acquiring and divesting companies to realise their maximum value creation potential. The population consisted of intercorporate asset sale transactions announced and concluded for the 11 year period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2011. The exact population was not known, therefore judgmental sampling was used to identify companies. Only companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange All Share Index were considered for qualifying asset sale transactions. In total 112 companies were reviewed for asset sales yielding 214 qualifying transactions which were divided in sub samples of 43 equity buyers, 68 cash buyers, 30 equity sellers and 73 cash sellers. Based on the event study methodology the short term metric of abnormal share price returns and the medium term metric of abnormal operating financial performance were used to calculate and compare the value created by equity and cash <b>funded</b> <b>transactions.</b> Both metrics concluded that equity funded asset sales created greater value compared to cash funded asset sales. Inferences were made between asset sales and mergers and acquisitions and the researcher concluded by proposing a model to optimise shareholder value. Based on the accounting performance of the buyer and the intrinsic value of the asset or target, the model is used to select the optimum combination of corporate activity and the method of payment to unlock the optimum shareholder value.
