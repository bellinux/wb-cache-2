A second quarto, a reprint of Q1, was published in 1602 by Pavier; another reprint was issued as Q3 in 1619, with a false date of 1608—part of William Jaggard's False Folio. The superior text first was printed in the First Folio in 1623.|$|E

5000|$|To {{reproduce}} a copyrighted work in {{any material}} form {{without the consent}} of the copyright owner constitutes an infringement. Thus, an <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> must be in a [...] "material form".|$|E
5000|$|Infringing users did {{not have}} their {{accounts}} terminated, and the defendants [...] "made no significant effort to identify users who were using the Mega Sites or services to infringe copyrights, to prevent the uploading of <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> of copyrighted materials, or to identify <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> of copyrighted works" [...] (item 55-56) ...|$|R

50|$|Copyright {{has been}} defined to include the {{exclusive}} right, among others, to reproduce the work in any form and to publish the work. Furthermore, S. 51 of the Act deals with infringement. It says that copyright in a work will be infringed when an <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> of the work has been imported. <b>Infringing</b> <b>copy</b> of work {{has been defined}} as any work which has been imported in contravention to the provisions of the Act. The mainstay of S.51 is that a copyright is deemed to be infringed when any person does something which the Act confers as an exclusive right to the owner of the copyright.|$|E
50|$|The charges allow {{copyright}} holders, who succeed with {{claims of}} infringement, {{to receive an}} amount of compensation per work (as opposed to compensation for losses, an account of profits or damages per <b>infringing</b> <b>copy).</b> Statutory damages can in some cases be significantly more than the actual damages suffered by the rightsholder or the profits of the infringer.|$|E

50|$|Streaming copyrighted content {{can involve}} making <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> {{of the works}} in question. Streaming, or looking at content on the Internet, is legal in Europe, even if that {{material}} is copyrighted.|$|R
50|$|It also {{empowered}} any constable, on {{the written}} request (and risk) of the copyright owner or {{his or her}} designated agent, to seize without warrant any <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> being hawked for sale and bring them before a court; on the proof that they were copyright infringements, they could then be disposed of by the court as above.|$|E
50|$|LB (Plastics) Ltd. v. Swish Products Ltd., is a 1979 {{decision}} of the House of Lords as to whether a physical object is an <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> of a drawing depicting the object. The House of Lords held that it is, at least when an ordinary person could recognize that physical object was that which the drawing depicted.|$|E
5000|$|This {{decision}} also re-affirmed {{the ruling}} in LB (Plastics) Ltd. v.

50|$|Cavan Water Mill {{operates}} a MacAdam turbine {{as opposed to}} a conventional water wheel. The turbine was described as one of the few, if not the only surviving MacAdam turbines in Ulster in 1983. The turbine may be an example of 19th-century industrial espionage, as it is believed to be a patent <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> of a design by Benoît Fourneyron. A similar turbine was installed at Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills, Cork in 1853.|$|E
50|$|Section 63B of the Indian Copyright Act was {{inserted}} by the Copyright (Amendment) Act of 1994 and it classifies the knowing {{use of an}} <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> of a computer programme by any person as an offence which is punishable with both fine as well as imprisonment. Where the computer programme has not been used for gain or {{in the course of}} trade or business, the court may, after recording its reasons, not impose any sentence of imprisonment and can reduce the amount of the minimum fine prescribed.|$|E

50|$|Orders {{comparable}} to Anton Piller orders {{have long been}} available in the United States under section 503(a) of the Copyright Act (17 USC, § 503(a)), which provides for the impounding of allegedly <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> of works and equipment for making them.|$|R
5000|$|Infringement of {{copyright}} is actionable by the copyright owner as the infringement of a property right (s. 96) or, {{in the case}} of infringement of moral rights, as the tort of breach of statutory duty (s. 103). Damages will not be awarded against an [...] "innocent" [...] defendant, i.e. one who did not know and had no reason to know that the work was under copyright, but other remedies (e.g. injunction, account of profits: Scots law interdict, accounting and payment of profits) continue to be available (s. 97, see Microsoft v Plato Technology). Orders are available for the delivery up (Scots law: delivery) and disposal of <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> (ss. 99, 114): copyright owners may also seize such copies (s. 100). The making, dealing in or use of <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> is a criminal offence (s. 107). Copyright owners may ask the HM Revenue and Customs to treat <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> as [...] "prohibited goods", in which case they are prohibited from import (s. 111). Section 297 of the Act makes it an offense to fraudulently receive broadcasts for which a payment is required. Section 300 creates the offense of fraudulently using a trademark, inserted as ss. 58A - 58D of the Trade Marks Act 1938 c. 22.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court held}} that if RTC could prove that Netcom had {{knowledge}} of the infringing activities, Netcom could be liable for contributory infringement since its failure to simply cancel Erlich's infringing message and thereby stop an <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> from being distributed could constitute substantial participation. However, there {{was a question of}} fact as to whether Netcom knew or should have known that such activities were infringing after receipt of RTC's letter. This genuine issue of fact precluded summary judgment on contributory liability. (I.e., the court could not make a decision on contributory liability without trial because of factual disputes.) ...|$|E
50|$|He {{was charged}} with 3 counts of “attempting to {{distribute}} an <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> of a copyright work (otherwise than for the purpose of, in the course of, any trade or business) {{to such an extent}} as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright, without the licence of the copyright owner, contrary to sections 118(1)(f) and 119(1) of the Copyright Ordinance, Cap. 528 and section 159G of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 200” and 3 counts of an alternative charge of “Obtaining access to a computer with dishonest intent, contrary to section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 200”. Since the first 3 charges were proven, the last 3 charges were dropped.|$|E
5000|$|The High Court of Australia {{found that}} “Sony’s device of the Boot ROM chip and the access code… does not {{constitute}} a “technological protection measure” {{by virtue of the}} device’s deterrent effect on the copying of computer games. That is because the console’s inability to load the software from an <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> does not make it impossible or more physically difficult to make an infringing copy.” The High Court further found that protective devices like the PlayStation Boot ROM and access code are not “designed… to prevent… the infringement of copyright,” as they do not render the user unable to “reproduce the work in material form.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Court of Appeals {{affirmed the}} {{district}} court's decision in its entirety. The court first {{reasoned that the}} copies of the songs that the defendant had downloaded were <b>infringing</b> <b>copies,</b> rejecting the defendant's analogy to the [...] "time-shifting" [...] doctrine enunciated in the Supreme Court's landmark Sony [...] decision.|$|R
5000|$|Persons indicted have [...] "instructed {{individual}} users how to locate links to infringing content on the Mega Sites ... and ... have also shared {{with each other}} comments from Mega Site users demonstrating that they have used or are attempting to use the Mega Sites to get <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> of copyrighted content."

500|$|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare {{was widely}} {{distributed}} online {{in the form}} of <b>infringing</b> <b>copies.</b> Robert Bowling, Community Manager at Infinity Ward stated, [...] "We pulled some disturbing numbers this past week about the amount of PC players currently playing Multiplayer... What wasn't fantastic was the percentage of those numbers who were playing on stolen copies of the game on stolen/cracked CD keys of pirated copies." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{passing the}} {{threshold}} requirements, the Court turned to § 512(c)'s provision that prevents service provider liability where copyright infringement occurs {{as a result}} of the storage of the infringing material residing on the service providers system or network at the direction of a user. [...] IO argued that because Veoh was creating a Flash version of the content, along with screencaps, when it was uploaded, this <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> was not placed on Veoh's server [...] "at the direction of a user." [...] IO believed that the DMCA policies were not best served by protecting the creation of infringing copies for the purposes of distribution when the only protected activity should have been storage.|$|E
5000|$|I Modi {{were then}} {{published}} {{a second time}} in 1527, now with the poems that have given them the traditional English title Aretino's Postures, making {{this the first time}} erotic text and images were combined, though the papacy once more seized all the copies it could find. Raimondi escaped prison on this occasion, but the suppression on both occasions was comprehensive. No original copies of this edition have survived, {{with the exception of a}} few fragments in the British Museum, and two copies of posture 1. A, possibly <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> with crude illustrations in woodcut, printed in Venice in 1550, and bound in with some contemporary texts was discovered in the 1920s, containing fifteen of the sixteen postures.|$|E
5000|$|One form of {{computerized}} parody {{using the}} Internet juxtaposes layers over the original, on a webpage. In one example, the original layer is Mona Lisa. The second layer is transparent in the main, but is opaque and obscures the original layer {{in some places}} (for example, where Duchamp located the moustache). This technology is described at the George Washington University Law School website. An example of this technology is a copy of Mona Lisa {{with a series of}} different superpositions-first Duchamp's moustache, then an eye patch, then a hat, a hamburger, and so on. This is a link to the graphic. The point of this technology (which is explained on the foregoing website for a copyright law class) is that it permits making a parody that need not involve making an <b>infringing</b> <b>copy</b> of the original work if it simply uses an inline link to the original, which is presumably on an authorized webpage. According to the website at which the material is located:The layers paradigm is significant in a computer-related or Internet context because it readily describes a system in which the person ultimately responsible for creating the composite (here, corresponding to modern-day Duchamp) does not make a physical copy of the original work in the sense of storing it in permanent form (fixed as a copy) distributed to the end user. Rather, the person distributes only the material of the subsequent layers, that the aggrieved copyright owner (here, corresponding to Leonardo da Vinci) distributes the material of the underlying Mona Lisa layer, and the end user's system receives both. The end user's system then causes a temporary combination, in its computer RAM and the user's brain. The combination is a composite of the layers. Framing and superimposition of popup windows exemplify this paradigm.|$|E
5000|$|Righthaven sued a Boston-based cat blogger {{over her}} {{attribution}} to a Review-Journal story on her blog. Righthaven CEO Steve Gibson's vision is to [...] "monetize news content on the backend, by scouring {{the internet for}} <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> of his client's articles, then suing and relying on the harsh penalties in the Copyright Act — up to $150,000 for a single infringement — to compel quick settlements." ...|$|R
500|$|Only {{two days}} {{following}} the premiere, unlicensed copies appeared for sale in London. [...] "The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK," [...] said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft. <b>Infringing</b> <b>copies</b> of the DVD were selling for less than £1.57. Craig himself was offered such a DVD while walking anonymously {{through the streets of}} Beijing wearing a hat and glasses to avoid being identified.|$|R
50|$|Section 64 of the Indian Copyright Act affords {{power to}} a police officer, who is above or at the rank of a sub-inspector, to seize without warrant any <b>infringing</b> <b>copies</b> of copyrighted {{material}} {{if he or she}} believes that an offence under Section 63 is being, or is likely to be, committed. The constitutional validity of the power afforded to a police officer by this provision was upheld by the Rajasthan High Court in Girish Gandhi v. Union of India.|$|R
