40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{sequences}} {{of red and}} far red light on sterol biosynthesis in etiolated seedlings of Digitalis purpurea L. was examined. Red light caused a marked increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> free and glycosidic sterols and a small decrease in esterified sterols during the first 4 hours after illumination. Far red light elicited the same response but to a lesser degree. Exposure to red followed by far red light or the reverse caused little or no increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> free and glycosidic sterols.

5|$|The various {{subspecies}} of the rattlesnake genus Crotalus, produce venoms {{that carry}} out two conflicting functions. The venom immobilizes prey after a bite, and also helps digestion by breaking down tissues before the snake eats its prey. As {{with other members}} of the family Viperidae, the venoms of Crotalus disrupt the homeostatic processes of prey animals. However, there is a wide variety of venom compositions among the species of Crotalus. A 2010 study found a 100-fold difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> metalloproteinase activity among the various snakes, with Crotalus oreganus cerberus having the highest activity and Crotalus oreganus concolor having the lowest.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the effects of water stress on biochemical and physiological parameters of Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. (Sempre verde and Pitiuba), as well as reveal the cultivar that better adapts under water stress. The experimental design was randomized entirely in factorial, with 2 cultivars (Sempre verde and Pitiuba), combined with 2 water conditions (stress and control). Tenors of proline, free amino acids, total soluble carbohydrates and total soluble proteins were quantified and the nitrate reductase activity was measured. The plants submitted to stress suffered an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> proline, since this solute is an osmotic adjuster. There was an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> amino acids due to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protease enzyme activity and an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> total carbohydrate levels, caused by the increase of starch. A decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> total protein caused by <b>the</b> decrease <b>in</b> their synthesis and a fall in nitrate reduction activity caused by the low nitrate influx were reported. These responses were seen <b>in</b> both cultivars. <b>The</b> Pitiuba cultivar presented responses that show better osmotic adjustment in these conditions, revealing a greater adaptability of this cultivar in conditions of hydric stress...|$|R
