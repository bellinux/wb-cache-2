5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E

His father died at 44 of a heart attack and his mother <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> welfare to support her two sons. King was greatly {{affected}} by his father's death, and he lost interest in school. After graduating from high school, he worked to help support his mother and did not go to college. From an early age, however, he had wanted to go into radio.|$|E
25|$|The first Collector Card {{that was}} issued was {{to commemorate the}} {{creation}} of a new effigy for her majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 and a redemption was offered in Chatelaine magazine. In 2004, to commemorate the Acadie 25-cent coin. One card was included with every phone order after the launch of the commemorative coin. With the release of the Lucky Loonie, a third Collector Card was created. To procure a card, customers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the RCM website and place a request online. A total of 23 Collector Coin Cards have been released to date, mostly selling online for substantially more than they were when originally released.|$|E
25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was my}} task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E

25|$|On 6 November 1969, Vang Pao {{called a}} {{strategy}} session {{to revamp the}} Royalist irregulars' defenses. The success of his just concluded Kou Kiet had left him in possession of the strategic Plain of Jars, but with only 5,500 to 6,000 war-weary irregular troops to hold it. His Central Intelligence Agency advisers estimated he faced 16,000 North Vietnamese regulars, plus the Pathet Lao battalions. At such odds, they believed he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the defensive. They had planned four successive lines of hilltop strongholds, {{with the idea that}} tactical air could destroy communists attacking the Royalist trenchworks. Even within each defensive line, the hilltop forts were not mutually reinforcing one another but were easily bypassed. Vang Pao was more realistic than his advisers; he still realized that guerrillas needed the tactical flexibility to fight or flee as circumstances demanded.|$|E
25|$|On the {{run down}} to the first chicane Alesi slowed with an {{electrical}} problem and retired in the pits, but also blocked Katayama, allowing both Schumacher and Hill to attack. Schumacher went through but Hill hit Katayama, damaging his front wing. Coulthard <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> with a damaged car for an extra lap while the team put a new wing on Hill's car and sent him away. Brundle and Coulthard also rejoined after repairs as Berger was leading from Schumacher, Katayama, Olivier Panis, Bernard and Fittipaldi. Katayama retired on lap 7 with throttle troubles as Verstappen passed Fittipaldi. It {{was time for the}} stops and Verstappen retired with a spectacular fire as fuel spilled onto the bodywork of the car. He managed to escape relatively uninjured but the car was reduced to a smoldering wreck. The incident served to highlight the dangers of refuelling now it had been re-introduced to the sport, and paved the way for future safety measures. Schumacher retired on lap 20 with an engine failure.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{was on a}} mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a {{piano player}} and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of [...] "Love Takes Time" [...] for Columbia Records {{president}} Don Ienner. [...] "All the important guys were on the plane," [...] Margulies said. [...] "Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and Bobby Colomby." [...] Carey was told the song was a [...] "career-maker," [...] and that it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the first album. She protested - her album was already being mastered, and she intended this ballad for her next release.|$|E
500|$|Connal, {{watching}} the game {{from his home in}} Old Greenwich, Connecticut, also noticed the fourth quarter was running [...] "terribly slow". At 6:45, he called Cline again, and both men agreed the game would not end on time. Both supported running the end of the game, but given Goodman's instructions, his permission was required. Connal agreed to call NBC Sports president Lindemann, and that he and Lindemann would then speak to Goodman. After promising Cline a return call, Connal reached Lindemann by telephone. Lindemann agreed {{that the end of the}} game should be broadcast, and both men began trying to reach Goodman. Lindemann was successful in reaching Goodman, and asked the network president, [...] "What about the instruction to broadcast operations control that Heidi <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> at 7:00 ET, no matter what?" [...] Goodman replied, [...] "That's crazy. It's a terrible idea." [...] Lindemann then set up a three-way conversation with himself, Goodman and NBC Television president Don Durgin. After several minutes of discussion, Durgin agreed to delay the start of Heidi until after the game was completed. Sportswriter Kyle Garlett, in his history of sports gaffes, noted, [...] "And even though earlier executives had told [...] to make sure he started Heidi on time, those same executives changed their minds late in the game." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the extent}} that Ignition were {{willing to go to}} control access to the album {{generated}} more hype than could normally have been expected, and served to alienate members of both the print and broadcast media, as well as most Creation staff members. When [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] was planned as the first single, Ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure. However, three stations broke the embargo, and Ignition panicked. According to Greengrass: [...] "we'd been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months or something, and our plot was blown. 'Shit, it's a nightmare'." [...] BBC Radio 1 received a CD containing three songs ten days before the album's release, on condition that disc jockey Steve Lamacq talked over the tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners. The day after Lamacq previewed the album on his show, he {{received a phone call from}} Ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn't speak enough over the songs. Lamacq said, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the air the next night and say, 'Sorry, but we're not getting any more tracks.' It was just absurd." [...] According to Creation's head of marketing John Andrews, [...] " [...] made people despise Oasis within Creation. You had this Oasis camp that was like 'I'm sorry, you're not allowed come into the office between the following hours. You're not allowed mention the word Oasis.' It was like a fascist state." [...] One employee recalled an incident [...] "when somebody came round to check our phones because they thought The Sun had tapped them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robertson later said, [...] "Eventually, [...] built {{us up to}} {{the point}} where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, bless his heart, by {{sharpening}} us into such a crackerjack band that we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically." ...|$|E
2500|$|Location filming {{took place}} during January and February 1970 at Blue Circle Cement in Kent, Marlow Weir in Buckinghamshire, Southall Gas Works in Middlesex, and various sites in Aldershot, Hampshire. Studio {{recording}} then {{took place during}} February and March 1970. The alien underneath the spacesuit was achieved by layering the actor's face with blue make-up, tissue, latex rubber. Because it was uncomfortable for the actors, the make-up was applied shortly before they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> set. As the story {{was supposed to take}} place in the late 1970s, the spacesuit was designed as a futuristic version. Caroline John's husband, Geoffrey Beevers, briefly appears as a UNIT radio operator, credited as [...] "Private Johnson".|$|E
2500|$|Composer Zak Bellica {{originally}} {{wanted to}} hire an entire Eastern European orchestra with whom to record the score for the game. However, budget limitations made this impossible, as did the decision to make the music less [...] "soaring" [...] and more [...] "primitive". Ultimately, Bellica hired only one musician, cellist Lori Goldston; {{the rest of the}} score was created using instruments from sample libraries, which were then played back on a digital sampler. Due to the time constraints, Bellica had to compose the score without any access to footage from the game; all he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> was the script, and notes from Scott Campbell. Bellica would compose a piece of music for a specific part of the game and then send it to the developers, who would send it back to him with notes on what they wanted him to change.|$|E

2500|$|Hansen {{later said}} {{this was the moment}} where he [...] "had" [...] him. Since all Hansen <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> was the word of David Stanley and his mother, he could not have known for sure if there really had been money in the envelope. In fact, Hansen never {{actually}} mentioned money when he produced the envelopes, only asking {{whether or not there was}} any correspondence between the AD's office and the Stanley family. By refusing to acknowledge that he had, in fact, sent something to Stanley's family and then backtracking when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statement, Hansen knew Parker was hiding something. Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment. All (Parker) had to say was, 'I'm glad you asked, I sent him an insurance form,' and we would've had to start all over, because every dot that we connected started from the premise that we know he sent something." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{breakdown}} of peace negotiations with Hanoi, President Nixon launched Operation Linebacker II, an extensive aerial campaign by B-52 bombers and tactical aircraft that began on 16 December 1972. Nixon, {{in an effort to}} conceal the fact that the talks had broken down, ordered that the public explanation for the bombing be linked to [...] "a possible enemy offensive in the South." [...] With no information flowing from the White House, the Pentagon, or MACV, North Vietnam's propaganda was all that correspondents <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> and it was extensively reported by the media. The American people, however, were unconvinced. According to a Harris poll, fewer than 50 percent agreed that it was [...] "inhuman and immoral for the U.S. to have bombed Hanoi's civilian center" [...] and an impressive 71 percent believed [...] "what we did in bombing Hanoi was no worse than what the communists have done in the Vietnam War." [...] Following the campaign Hanoi returned to the negotiating table and (after some wrangling with the Saigon government) the Paris Peace Accords were signed on 27 January 1973. For the United States, the Vietnam War was over.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Communist East German government, {{the mass}} suicide became a taboo. The {{site of the}} mass graves was {{deliberately}} not cared for, became overgrown, and was at times tilled with sugar beets. The only visible hint of the mass grave was a solitary monument with the engraved date [...] "1945",, soon also overgrown. In contrast, a [...] obelisk was erected in Demmin's burned down center to commemorate Soviet soldiers {{who had died in}} the area. The local museum listed [...] "2,300 deaths due to warfare and famine" [...] for the years of 1945 and 1946. As late as 1989, the chronicle of the district's Communist party blamed the destruction of the town on Werwolf and Hitler Youth activities. The atrocities were blamed on Germans disguised as Soviets by a document found in the local Soviet military administration in Neubrandenburg. As Der Spiegel puts it:Arbitrary executions, the rapes, the torching of towns – the atrocities of the Red Army were a taboo in the GDR, the mass suicides as well. Those who had witnessed it all or even survived a failed suicide – children, elderly, raped women – were ashamed and kept quiet. Somehow, life <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> in the system of the liberators. Today, many do not want to remember, for too long they had struggled to find a balance between what they had suffered and what they had learned.|$|E
