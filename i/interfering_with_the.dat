Other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> function of DNA.|$|E

40|$|The place {{conditioning}} paradigm {{has been}} used to assess the antinausea potential of drugs in non-emetic animal species. The present experiments were designed to determine the potential of A 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to alleviate both conditioned and unconditioned sickness in rats (Rattus norvegiens). The results in the present study suggest that when the place aversion is strong (Experiment 1), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> establishment; however when the aversion is weak (Experiments 2 and 3), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> expression. Also, when administered during acquisition of a strong amphetamine-induced place preference, THC also seems to <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> establishment of the preference. Therefore it appears that when the place association is strong, THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> associative process itself, but when the place association is weak THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conditioned sickness or the retrieval of the association...|$|R
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E

5|$|Convicted {{computer}} {{criminals are}} people who are caught and convicted of computer crimes such as breaking into computers or computer networks. Computer crime can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (unauthorized access), illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system), data interference (unauthorized damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (<b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (or identity theft) and electronic fraud.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{running back}} Dwayne Thomas gained nine {{yards on the}} first Tech play, then the Hokies earned their initial first down on an option run that gained three yards. After the first down, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then Thomas ran for a six-yard gain. On third down, a long pass downfield was knocked down by a Texas defender, and the Hokies punted back to Texas. The kick was fair caught at the 13-yard line, but Tech was penalized 15 yards for <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> catch.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of John's see of Caithness in 11891190 was undoubtedly intended to extend Scots {{authority in the}} region. The new bishopric was not uncontroversial and John soon came into conflict with Harald Maddadson and the Bishop of Orkney, Bjarni Kolbeinsson. The conflict, presented as a dispute over the collection of monies for the papacy (a form of Peter's pence), was appealed to Pope Innocent III, who wrote to Bishop Bjarni and the Bishop of Rosemarkie (or Ross) to prevent John from <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> collection.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary cause}} of lead's {{toxicity}} is its interference {{with a variety of}} enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
5|$|Another command change {{occurred}} on June 22. In addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant {{had to be}} concerned with Confederate forces in his rear under the command of Joseph E. Johnston. He stationed one division {{in the vicinity of the}} Big Black River Bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg, both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at Canton, from <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at the XV Corps. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson. Sherman would eventually pursue Johnston and (re)capture Jackson on July 17.|$|E

5|$|By now the pre-war {{electrification}} scheme {{had been}} revived. In 1957 electrification between Rickmansworth and Amersham and Chesham began. Chalfont& Latimer's platforms were extended {{and a second}} platform was opened at Chesham on 3 July 1960 to prevent through operations to and from Baker Street from <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Chesham–Chalfont& Latimer shuttle. An electric service using London Underground T Stock began operations between Chesham and Chalfont& Latimer on 16 August 1960, with former MR electric locomotives hauling the through trains to and from London. A steam locomotive was kept on standby in the new second platform at Chesham, {{in case of a}} failure of the electric trains. From June 1962 both the T Stock and the locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by the newly introduced London Underground A Stock.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.|$|E
5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E

5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 1992, Reagan was {{assaulted}} by an anti-nuclear protester during a luncheon speech while accepting an {{award from the}} National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas. The protester, 41-year old Richard Paul Springer, smashed a 2-foot-high (60cm) 30-pound (13.5kg) crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president. Flying shards of glass hit Reagan, {{but he was not}} injured. Using media credentials, Springer intended to announce government plans for an underground nuclear weapons test in the Nevada desert the following day. Springer was the founder of an anti-nuclear group called the 100th Monkey. Following his arrest on assault charges, a Secret Service spokesman could not explain how Springer got past the federal agents who guarded Reagan's life at all times. Later, Springer pled guilty to reduced charges and said he hadn't meant to hurt Reagan through his actions. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor federal charge of <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Secret Service, but other felony charges of assault and resisting officers were dropped.|$|E
