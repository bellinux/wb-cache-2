40|$|In recent years, GaAsSb/InP double {{heterojunction}} {{bipolar transistors}} (DHBTs) {{have been demonstrated}} to be promising alternatives to InP/InGaAs HBTs, for next generation microwave/millimeter wave applications and optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs). However, GaAsSb-based DHBTs featuring the novel base material and type-II band alignment have not been well studied. This thesis investigated type-II GaAsSb DHBTs in the following aspects: periphery surface recombination current, <b>Kirk</b> <b>effect,</b> two dimensional (2 D) simulation and device optimization. The present work provided insights into device operation, and guidances for further device development. A series of physical models and parameters was implemented in 2 D device simulations using ISE TCAD. Band gap narrowing (BGN) in the bases was characterized by comparing experimental and simulated results. Excellent agreements between the measured and simulated DC and RF results were achieved. Emitter size effects associated with the surface recombination current were experimentally characterized for emitter sizes of 0. 5 by 6 to 80 by 80 square micrometer. The 2 D simulations by implementing surface state models revealed the mechanism for the surface recombination current. Two device structures were proposed to diminish surface recombination current. Numerical simulations for type-II GaAsSb-InP base-collector (BC) junctions showed that conventional base "push-out" does not occur at high injection levels, and instead the electric field at the BC junction is reversed and an electron barrier at the base side evolves. The electron barrier was found {{to play an important}} role in the <b>Kirk</b> <b>effect,</b> and the electron tunnelling through the barrier delays the onset of the <b>Kirk</b> <b>effect.</b> This novel mechanism was supported by the measurement for GaAsSb/InP DHBTs with two base doping levels. The study also showed that the magnitude of the electric field at the BC junction at zero collector current directly affects onset of the <b>Kirk</b> <b>effect.</b> Finally, optimizations for the emitter, base and collector were carried out through 2 D simulations.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} liturgical context of ecclesiastical {{discipline}} in early modern Scotland. The core question addresses the narrative being recounted within Protestant rituals of repentance, the liturgical expression of ecclesiastical discipline. Through {{an analysis of}} these rituals it is demonstrated that the primary narrative underpinning the performance of repentance is reconciliation with God and with neighbour. An examination of ceremonies officially authorised by the General Assembly, alongside descriptions of local practice, reveals how reconciliation was firmly embedded within the liturgical life of the Kirk. A secondary question addresses continuities and breaks with Scottish penitential practices prior to 1560. Although bringing a physical shift and ‘decluttering’ of performance space, many ritual continuities remained after 1560, especially in costumes, props, gestures and speech. This thesis is divided into four sections. Section One focuses upon ritual penitential practices employed by the pre-Reformation Kirk c. 1500 - 1560. The ‘cluttered’ stage, or stages, upon which rituals of repentance were performed is also analysed. These twin themes, focusing upon pre- Reformation practice and performance spaces, provide the base-line {{for the assessment of}} ritual continuity. Section Two moves the performance to the Protestant theatre of reconciliation, 1560 - 1610. After an initial exploration of the stages of discipline, rituals employed by the <b>Kirk</b> to <b>effect</b> neighbourly reconciliation are examined. They demonstrate how the expression of reconciliation and dispute settlement presents a potent visible representation of the harmonious community as the ‘true’ church. Moving from the harmonious community at the local level, Section Three investigates the liturgical performance of corporate repentance utilising the key text The Order of the General Fast. At both national and regional levels, corporate repentance became a visible expression of communal reconciliation to God and of the Protestant self-identification as the ‘new Israel’. The focus of the final section concerns excommunication, the ultimate tool of ecclesiastical discipline, and a further authorised liturgy, The Order of Excommunication and of Public Repentance, is examined. Far from permanent exclusion, the ritual of excommunication was intended to be radical soul-saving surgery, designed to reconcile an offender with both God and neighbour. In contrast with other recent studies which have analysed ecclesiastical discipline within a judicial context, the liturgical context of discipline as performed in rituals of repentance is placed centre-stage...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted towards the {{development}} and analysis of high-frequency, high-voltage silicon devices. A systematic study of physics, technology and device performance has been presented with extensive numerical results of both Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) and lateral MOSFETs. In the case of BJTs, the potential of bipolar devices for high-voltage high-frequency applications has been explored. The <b>Kirk</b> <b>effect</b> and the physical limit of BV_c_e_o*f_T are discussed in detail. For the first time, the equivalent critical electric field for open-base breakdown voltage has been obtained based on numerical simulations. This leads to the re-evaluation of the traditional Johnson limit. It is also demonstrated that the <b>Kirk</b> <b>effect</b> can be significantly suppressed by incorporating the Reduced Surface Field (Resurf) effect and a gradually doped collector region in the lateral bipolar transistors (LBTs) on thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI). A new technique is proposed to achieve the gradual doping profile. The proposed 40 -V Resurfed SOI LBT has a cut-off frequency of 8. 75 GHz, in comparison to 2. 6 GHz for the conventional non-Resurfed device. This corresponds to a record BV_C_E_O*f_T, compared to either experiment or simulation results in the literature. For the RF lateral power MOSFETs, an insight into the device performance is presented using the results by both traditional theory for the MOSFET and 2 -D numerical simulations. For the first time, it is identified that the intrinsic MOSFET is the dominant component in the RF LDMOSFET, which ensures the saturation property in forward I-V characteristics. Detailed results are presented on the transconductance performance of the device. It is clarified that the fall-off of transconductance of a RF LDMOSFET is caused jointly by the high resistance of this region and the reduction in channel resistance at a high gate voltage. Because of these two factors, most of the potential is dropped across the drift region at a high gate bias. As a result, the intrinsic MOSFET is forced into its linear region of operation, which results in a fall-off of the transconductance. To increase the range of gate voltages for a constant transconductance, higher drift doping concentration is preferred. This {{can be achieved by}} incorporating a grounded field plate without causing degradation of breakdown voltage. Extensive results are presented to analyse the influence of drift design, field plate, epi-layer doping and thickness, channel length, gate oxide and the main thermal process steps on the device performance. For the first time, a relationship is established between the device performance and the process and structural parameters. To achieve higher output power, structures and performance of a 48 -V RF LDMOSFET are presented. Effort is devoted to reducing the resistance of p"+ sinker and maintaining good process compatibility with 26 -V devices. Since the breakdown voltage can be increased by optimising the drift and epi-layer design, higher power can be delivered without increasing the input capacitance and feedback capacitance.

40|$|Operation of SiGe BiCMOS Technology Under Extreme Environments Tianbing Chen 96 pages Directed by Dr. John D. Cressler "Extreme {{environment}} electronics" {{represents an}} important niche market and spans {{the operation of}} electronic components in surroundings lying outside the domain of conventional commercial, or even military specifications. Such extreme environments would include, for instance, operation to very low temperatures (e. g., to 77 K or even 4. 2 K), operation to very high temperatures (e. g., to 200 C or even 300 C), and operation in a radiation-rich environment (e. g., space). The suitability of SiGe BiCMOS technology for extreme environment electronics applications is assessed in this work. The suitability of SiGe HBTs for use in high-temperature electronics applications is first investigated. SiGe HBTs are shown to exhibit sufficient current gain, frequency response, breakdown voltage, achieve acceptable device reliability, and improved low-frequency noise, at temperatures as high as 200 - 300 C. A comprehensive investigation of substrate bias effects on device performance, thermal properties, and reliability of vertical SiGe HBTs fabricated on CMOS-compatible, thin-film SOI, is presented. The impact of 63 MeV protons on these vertical SiGe HBTs fabricated on a CMOS-compatible SOI is then investigated. Proton irradiation creates G/R trap centers in SOI SiGe HBTs, creating positive charge at the buried oxide interface, effectively delaying {{the onset of the}} <b>Kirk</b> <b>effect</b> at high current density, which increases the frequency response of SOI SiGe HBTs following radiation. The thermodynamic stability of device-relevant epitaxial SiGe strained layers under proton irradiation is also investigated using x-ray diffraction techniques. Irradiation with 63 MeV protons is found to introduce no significant microdefects into the SiGe thin films, regardless of the starting stability condition of the SiGe film, and thus {{does not appear to be}} an issue for the use of SiGe HBT technology in emerging space systems. CMOS device reliability for emerging cryogenic space electronics applications is also assessed. CMOS device performance improves with cooling, however, CMOS device reliability becomes worse at decreased temperatures due to aggravated hot-carrier effects. The device lifetime is found to be a strong function of gate length, suggesting that design tradeoffs are inevitable. Ph. D.

40|$|By the {{advances}} in high frequency communication systems, and particularly Internet, wide bandwidth and high-speed transistors became key devices for the circuits. Especially, optical fibres can transport data at high rates. Therefore, high-speed electronics {{is necessary for}} all kind of data processing. One limitation is the ultra high frequency modulation of the light for data transport. This requires high frequency and high voltage of operation. Second, high linearity of amplification is necessary for analog-to-digital conversion (ADCs). Indium Phosphide based Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (InP HBTs) {{have the potential to}} provide high speed and high voltage for optoelectronic communication ICs. Moreover, since their energy band gap corresponds to the 1. 3 and 1. 55 µm wavelength, which are the wavelengths providing minimum optical loss in fibres, InP HBTs are the best choices for optical communication circuits. In this work, a process technology is developed for HBTs capable of 80 Gbit/s. The theory and also careful analysis have shown that the main limitations for the device speed are the base-collector capacitances and base resistances. Various designs are proposed to lower RC time constant. The influence of emitter size is observed on RF performance and for optical lithography it is found out that emitters with area of 1 x 15 µm 2 provides the best RF performance. Another important aspect is to lower any additional parasitic effects. Therefore directly contacted emitters are proposed to eliminate parasitic components caused by dummy pads and to dissipate the heat overall the emitter efficiently. Since the contact spacing between base and emitter plays an important role for base resistance, emitter contacts are patterned perpendicular to the major flat for low underetching. In addition to this, emitter mesa wet chemical etching process is optimised and 170 nm of underetching is achieved, which is sufficient to realize 1 µm width emitters. A mask set is designed offering directly contacted emitters and reliable processes. To reduce the base resistance, Pt/Ti/Pt/Au contact metal system providing 4 x 10 ? 7 Ohm. cm 2 contact resistance, is used on the base layer. Moreover, current density is also an important aspect for the RF performance. The well-known <b>Kirk</b> <b>Effect</b> is analysed and the collector layer is doped to improve the maximum current density. 1 x 1017 cm- 3 of collector doping density has doubled the maximum current density in comparison to the HBTs with non-intentionally doped collector layers. For HBTs with an emitter area of 1 x 15 µm 2 on the optimised layer structure, presented maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 330 GHz and cut-off frequency (fT) of 170 GHz at 1. 2 mA/µm 2. 1 µm is the minimum width achievable by wet chemical etching. But on the other hand, for ultra high speed HBTs, submicron emitters are dispensable. Therefore, an ICP-RIE process with Cl 2 /N 2 chemistry providing less emitter underetching is optimised. According to this, dry etching processes offering etch rate of 120 nm/min up to 1200 nm/min are optimised. For HBTs lower etch rate, vertical sidewall profile less damage to the surface are important aspects. An etch rate of 120 nm/min is sufficient for emitter mesa etching. Therefore, this process is investigated in details. It is found out that, RMS surface roughness less than 5 nm, ± 5 % uniformity over 2 ” wafer and ± 5 % run-to-run stability can be achieved at this low etch rates. Since the dry etching with this chemistry is not selective for InP and InGaAs, a hybrid etching process is sufficient to complete the emitter mesa etching. With this hybrid etching, the selectivity problem is solved with an emitter underetching of 85 nm. HBTs with an emitter area of 0. 5 x 7. 5 µm 2 processed with hybrid etching, has shown a maximum oscillation frequency of 370 GHz and a cut-off frequency of 165 GHz. Not only the RF performance but also the uniformity of the HBT properties is also an important aspect for circuit applications. Hbyrid etching process offers better homogeneity in terms of etching in comparison to the solely wet chemical etching. The samples etched with wet chemical etching have shown dc current gain 41 with 4 % standard deviation where the solely etched ones have presented dc current gain of 64 with 7 % standard deviation. The yield for both type of processing is more than 90 %. With the optimised layout, layer structure and processing, InP HBTs with high speed, high yield and high uniformity are now ready for 80 Gbit/s communication circuits...|$|E
