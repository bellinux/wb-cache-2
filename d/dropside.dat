50|$|The Überlandwagen {{shared a}} common chassis with the A7V tank, with {{suspension}} derived from the American Holt tractor and twin 100 hp Daimler engines centrally mounted. A driving position was sited above the engines on a platform, with dual sets of controls for driving in either direction to avoid the need to turn the vehicle. A canopy was fitted over the driving position, and wooden <b>dropsides</b> and ends were fitted at {{the front and rear}} of the vehicle. Some examples had rails added to support a tarpaulin over the load spaces. Towing hooks were fitted {{at both ends of the}} chassis.|$|R
5000|$|Isuzu {{ended up}} {{offering}} {{a very wide}} variety of bodyworks for the first Elf. There was the original integrated bed, {{as well as a}} separate truckbed with <b>dropsides.</b> There was a double-cab version available, as well as special bodywork for dedicated purposes such as a soda truck, a dumper, and a tanker. There was also a [...] "Route Van" [...] model with a glazed rear compartment and seating either three or six, as well as the [...] "Elf Bus" [...] which was available in two models from 1960. The Elf Light Bus has integrated bodywork and the long wheelbase and seats 21 passengers (chassis codes BL171/271 for the diesel/petrol) while the Elf Micro Bus fit into the very narrow slot between the Route Van and the Light Bus. The Micro Bus originally had the Route Van's bodywork but was more passenger oriented (seating 12 or 15). It carried the TL121/151/21/251B chassis codes, and from 1961 it received its own rear bodywork with bigger glazing. The Elf Bus later became its own line, called the Isuzu Journey.|$|R

50|$|Corgi {{produced}} several models {{based on}} Commer vehicles between 1956 and 1971, including liveried delivery vans, <b>dropside</b> lorries and a mobile camera van (with accessories) in approximately O scale (1:44).|$|E
50|$|Designed {{with the}} {{intention}} of being used in conjunction with the Commer Platform Lorry (454), Commer <b>Dropside</b> Lorry (452), ERF Platform Lorry (457) and ERF <b>Dropside</b> Lorry (456), Corgi introduced a series of painted die-cast metal 'loads' called Corgi Cargoes. They were packaged in a clear plastic blisters attached to a card featuring the Corgi dog logo, images of Corgi lorries and the range's signature blue and yellow colour scheme. The first to be introduced in February 1960 were Plank Load (1485) and Cement Load (1488), and they were incorporated into Gift Set 11 including the ERF <b>Dropside</b> Lorry and Trailer in March 1960. Brick Load (1486) and Milk Churns Load (1487) followed in July 1960 and Skip and Churns (1490) in September 1960. The last in this range to be released was to be used with the Massey Ferguson 65 Tractor (50) and was a red painted cast metal platform carrying three metal milk churns which clipped {{to the rear of the}} tractor. The packaging featured an image of a tractor. Corgi Cargoes were available until 1964.|$|E
5000|$|Mazda's {{original}} {{entry into}} the mid-sized truck class was the Mazda E2000 of January 1964. This, in turn had replaced the earlier D-series. The E2000 came with a standard bed ("EVA12"), with a three-way <b>dropside</b> bed ("EVA12S"), and as a long-wheelbase <b>dropside</b> ("EVA32S"). The truck had a , 1985 cc L (VA) which had also {{been used in the}} earlier D2000. At the time of introduction, the production target was 1,900 units per month. In 1970 a version called the E2500 was added to the lineup. It was fitted with the Perkins-developed [...] "XA", a 2522 cc L diesel engine which produces [...] It's chassis code is [...] "EXA".|$|E
50|$|TASC 45 No. 98504, {{built by}} Plasser & Theurer for British Rail. A four-wheel vehicle with side-tipping <b>dropside</b> rear body, crew cab with mess {{facilities}} and a HIAB crane on the rear. Used regularly on works trains and on galas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} {{mid-mounted}} {{just behind the}} front axle, and access is gained by simply lifting the front seats. Chassis code is S60, with the succeeding letter [...] "P" [...] signifying a simple pickup bed with one opening flap; [...] "T" [...] for the three-way <b>dropside</b> pickup; and [...] "V" [...] for the vans.|$|E
50|$|The only {{product of}} the Modec company was the Modec EV {{commercial}} vehicle. It was produced in three version; a chassis cab, box van and a <b>dropside.</b> All three shared a common wheelbase of 141.7 in and a steel ladder frame chassis. The Modec has a kerb weight of 3.3 tonnes and a max gross capacity of 6.05 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|At this stage, {{the robbers}} had {{foreseen}} {{that they would}} encounter a problem. They had to move the train from {{where it had been}} stopped to a suitable place to load their ex-army <b>dropside</b> truck with the stolen money. Bridge No.127 (Bridego Bridge, now known as Mentmore Bridge), approximately half a mile (800 m) further along the track was the chosen location.|$|E
50|$|Cars {{were not}} the only offerings - a variety of {{interesting}} lorries were brought out as well. An Austin Prime-Mover flatbed, AEC Major and Mammoth, an ERF <b>dropside</b> lorry, a Bedford articulated tanker, Commer delivery van and Tonibell ice-cream truck were just a few. Even the UK-made Massey-Ferguson type 65 tractor appeared, though for only one year making it worth several hundred dollars today in mint condition (Rixon 2005, p. 123).|$|E
50|$|British {{trucks were}} also {{produced}} {{in this line}} including Ford Transit vans and Ford Thames Trader truck, Commer <b>dropside,</b> Morris commercial van, Dennis F8 fire engine, Bedford S Type trucks, Land Rover LWB and Defender and Karrier boxback, among others. Later, the Volkswagen Transporter van was included in many different liveries - for example in bright yellow with the Bosch Auto Electrical logo. Vanguards were a departure from earlier Lledos, as they were produced in a consistent 1:43 scale.|$|E
50|$|In December 1972, a five-door van (L50VF, with sliding side doors) was added. Three months later, the <b>dropside</b> L51 went on sale. In November 1973 the Carry {{underwent}} a minor facelift, receiving a new grille and modified front bumper. The interior was also updated, {{with a new}} dashboard and finally hanging gas and clutch pedals. The fifth generation Carry led Suzuki to great market success, with Suzuki selling more kei trucks than all others during 1973 and 1974.|$|E
50|$|It was {{recognised}} {{that once}} {{children learn to}} stand {{they may be able}} to get out of a bed with low sides. According to an expert of the time, infant beds were used once the child was 12 months old. Often one side was hinged to open the enclosure, a function fulfilled in modern infant beds with a <b>dropside.</b> With the hinge side lowered, the bed could be moved on casters, and they could be moved right up to the carer's bed when needed.|$|E
50|$|Infant beds can be {{stationary}} or portable (portacots, portacribs or folding infant beds). In their portable {{form the}} beds generally don't feature a <b>dropside,</b> and portability factors are emphasised. Portacots are often made from plastics, are often smaller and fold into a compact package. Rather than bars, {{they will have}} breathable mesh sides with an aperture too small for any finger to fit into (less than 5mm by the standards). Standards for folding infant beds exist for Australia and New Zealand, Europe and international (adopted by various organisations including the American National Standards Institute).|$|E
50|$|The CFC {{operated}} the following freight stock.Four wheeled open wagons and closed vans, with {{a capacity of}} 10 tonnes, but restricted to 7 tonnes on the lines laid with the lighter rails. also ten bogie lowside wagons by Decauville. There were some unsprung, dumb buffered ballast wagons and some bogie flat wagons. There were two couverts surbaissés, which were low floor bogie wagons for conveying cattle or horses. For mineral traffic four wheeled steel sided <b>dropside</b> open wagons were used. Some had brake-huts. There were also ten bogie opens. Another fifty bogie wagons were ordered by the Mines de Barbery in 1914, {{but it is not}} known if these were delivered.|$|E
50|$|In June 1965 the {{rebodied}} L20 Suzulight Carry {{replaced the}} FB. The ladder-frame chassis was modified, now with independently sprung front wheels (by torsion bars). While output remained 21 hp, the engine benefitted from Suzuki's patented CCI (Cylinder Crank Injection) lubrication system. The Carry Van {{was replaced by}} the new L20V in January 1966, and there was also a <b>dropside</b> pickup (L21). Finally, there was the L20H, a pickup with a canvas canopy and a rear-facing seat placed in the bed, providing seating for four. Top speed for the second generation was down to 75 km/h. The Carry Van had a horizontally divided two-piece tailgate, and sliding rear windows.|$|E
5000|$|On May 4, 1958 the 'New Miler' (ARTH-1) was released. It too {{retained}} the GA30 engine {{and had the}} same maximum capacity, but with a much longer wheelbase and a longer and wider bed {{it was much more}} capable. This was also available with a <b>dropside</b> bed. This was replaced by the ARTH-2 in September 1959. The ARTH-2 received a [...] version of the 1.5 liter four, and by now there was also a [...] "Light Miler" [...] (1.25 ton) version available. The first few model years of the ARTH Miler were also available as the [...] "Prince Light Van", a four-door, six-seater van with panelled sides in the luggage compartment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} are of simple and durable construction, {{suited for the}} severe conditions found in the Indian countryside. Originally there were three models; the Town and Country, the Trax Challenger, and the Picki-up. In 1998, the four-wheel drive [...] "Tempo Trax Gurkha" [...] was introduced, originally aimed mostly at military users. Since then, a plethora of versions have appeared: open top SUVs, comparatively luxurious station wagons, <b>dropside</b> pickups (Kargo King), ambulances, vans, and many special bodies are offered on three different wheelbases of 2400 mm, 3030 mm (Kargo King), or 3050 mm. The Trax can hold up to 13 passengers in the LWB versions.|$|E
50|$|The Stout was Toyota's launch {{model in}} South Africa in 1961. It sold well until its {{discontinuation}} in 1979. The RK45 Stout {{was the first}} Toyota to begin complete knock-down assembly in South Africa, in 1962. South African production later switched to the two-litre RK101 series, available as a flush-side pickup, a <b>dropside,</b> or a chassis/cab. South African Stouts kept using a simplified version of the original bed, even after the longer cabin had been introduced, as they were not affected by Japanese regulations on overall length. Bed length was thus 2310 mm, marginally longer than elsewhere. Between 1961 and 1975, 17,500 Stouts were sold in South Africa - {{the majority of them}} assembled locally.|$|E
5000|$|Export {{versions}} claimed {{slightly higher}} power outputs of [...] and [...] respectively. In July 1962, a fire truck (F40) {{was added to}} the lineup. A naked version with just a bonnet and windshield was called the 40E, a cab with chassis was the 40A, and a <b>dropside</b> pickup version was called 40H. Early catalogs also listed a double cab and a station wagon version, but it is doubtful that these were ever produced. There was also an [...] "A-1 class" [...] fire engine called the FR40. This interesting hybrid combined the 680-series heavy truck chassis, with its [...] 4-litre, six-cylinder P engine, with the Junior's bodywork. This was slightly altered to accommodate the considerably taller engine, with higher fenders and an insert in the grille underneath the headlamps.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{months after}} the {{introduction}} of the pickups (in June 1977), a glassed van with sliding doors and also a [...] "panel van" [...] version were released. The panel van was simply a truck with a box mounted on the rear; this version was not exported. For export, a van version without windows or rear seats was preferred. A low floor <b>dropside</b> bed was added in December 1977, and a minor facelift took place in September 1978. The changes were limited to different colored bumpers and headlight surrounds, and a changed metal grille insert featuring a larger [...] "D" [...] logo. All versions were available in either Standard or Super DeLuxe trims, but in March 1979 a comparatively luxurious [...] "Custom EX" [...] version of the light van was added.|$|E
50|$|The {{first light}} {{commercial}} modelled by Corgi Toys was the Bedford CA van in Daily Express livery (403) and in 'KLG Plugs' livery (403M) which {{was part of}} the July 1956 range that launched the brand. The CA van was later released in the yellow and black livery of AA Services in May 1957 (408), in the black and silver livery of the Evening Standard (421) in June 1960 and in the yellow and blue livery of Corgi Toys (422) in October 1960. The first large commercial vehicles in the Corgi Toys range were the Commer <b>Dropside</b> lorry (452) and the Commer Refrigerated van finished the livery of Walls Ice Cream (453). The same large van body was used on the ERF 88G chassis to become the Moorhouses Van (459) in March 1958. Painted red and yellow it featured paper stickers on the sides advertising Moorhouses Lemon Cheese and Raspberry jam.|$|E
5000|$|By 1961 {{the pickup}} {{had become so}} popular that it was {{available}} as a standard model, being catalogued along with the chassis/cab, van and 12 seater, but Walkers of Watford produced their own particular style of pickup, which could be recognised by its substantial box section down the sides compared with the flush sides of the standard Ford pickup. A small tipper body with screw type gear was also listed, as was a standard <b>dropside</b> truck. Several styles of van body were offered, such as a box body of , a van body of , a pantechnicon with integral cab offering [...] capacity or with a factory cab [...] A milk float was also listed, as was a body style called a canopy pickup. This was a conversion of the standard panel van, but with the roof and sides down to the waist rail removed from a point about halfway along to the rear. The rear doors were also removed and a drop tailboard substituted, while a partition was put {{at the back of}} the cab area and a tip up seat built on to this bulkhead.The Eagle Engineering Company of Warwick produced small tower wagon equipment for the 400E, and Tuke and Bell supplied a special little slide cover refuse truck just the job for narrow alleys or pedestrian precincts.|$|E
