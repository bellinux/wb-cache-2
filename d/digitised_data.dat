These were to be based on <b>digitised</b> rainfall <b>data</b> whereas previous studies conducted on a national scale in South Africa were based on data that were manually extracted from autographic charts. With the longer rainfall records currently available compared to the studies conducted in the early 1980 s, it was expected that by utilising the longer, <b>digitised</b> rainfall <b>data</b> in conjunction with regional approaches, which have not previously been applied in South Africa, that more reliable short duration design rainfall values could Ix: estimated.

50|$|In the {{earliest}} analog camcorders the imaging device is vacuum-tube technology, {{in which the}} charge of a light-sensitive target was directly proportional {{to the amount of}} light striking it; the Vidicon is an example of such an imaging tube. Newer analog, and digital camcorders use a solid-state charge-coupled imaging device (CCD) or a CMOS imager. Both are analog detectors, using photodiodes to pass a current proportional to the light striking them. The current is then digitised before being electronically scanned and fed to the imager's output. The main difference between the two devices is how the scanning is done. In the CCD the diodes are sampled simultaneously, and the scan passes the <b>digitised</b> <b>data</b> from one register to the next. In CMOS devices, the diodes are sampled directly by the scanning logic.|$|E

The fast instruction rates of DSPs make it most efficient to <b>digitise</b> <b>data</b> as soon as possible. The analogue signal must be conditioned quickly and effectively to eliminate unwanted parts of the signal and convert the signal to a form {{that may be used}} by the ADC. All components must be able to handle the fast sampling rate and cold conditions. This means some trade off; for example the fast op-amp used has high input bias currents. Once digitised, the information must be compressed quickly and stored on local memory. Keywords: Signal Conditioning, Digital Signal Processing. 1...|$|R

The conventional method of designing and making thermoforming moulds is laborious and time consuming. A method based on a reverse engineering approach and thermoforming feature concept is proposed.
