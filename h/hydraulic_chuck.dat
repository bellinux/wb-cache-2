40|$|Rock {{fragmentation}} {{process by}} drilling rig {{is accomplished by}} the simultaneous effects of drill pipe rotation and axial downwards motions. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>chuck</b> transfers engine power to drill pipe during the drilling and sampling process suchthatitâ€™s {{one of the most}} important components of drilling rig. Chuck available on the market, design is not considered clamping force and drilling capacity matching, resulting in slipped drill, injury drill or chuck destruction. This study designs a maximum clamping diameter 73 mm <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chuck,</b> focuses on the interaction mechanism of the gripper slips and drill pipe. A model to simulate and optimize the clamp mechanism and slips has been developed by the finite element analysis method, conclude the structure of the optimal size of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chuck.</b> This research may be a better suggestion on resolving the problems of pipe damage and slipping down. The study method would also be a reference for the design of other kinds of chucks. A model to simulate and optimize rainwater-harvesting systems for irrigation has been developed...|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} micro-spindle units, {{a critical}} problem is miniaturization {{of the tool}} clamp. Approaches for scaling down conventional tool clamps, such as the collet-chuck, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>chuck,</b> and shrink-fit methods may be limited by their inherently complicated mechanisms. This study developed a novel tool clamp based on shape memory alloy (SMA), which allows further miniaturization. The tool clamp can be simplified by using an SMA ring, which {{is all that is}} needed for clamping. The SMA-based tool clamp does not require any collet, and its structural configuration is axisymmetric. Furthermore, the SMA makes it possible to switch between the clamped and unclamped states by using a simple device to regulate small changes in temperature. This paper first describes the operating principle of the SMA-based tool clamp. Second, it presents the finite element method (FEM) analyses that were conducted to investigate the characteristics of the clamping/unclamping operations and the effect of centrifugal force. Third, it describes a prototype of the SMA-based tool clamp, which was designed and built for applications in micro-spindle units. Fourth, it presents an evaluation of the time needed for the clamping/unclamping operations and the tool-clamping force, which were both evaluated experimentally. Finally, it describes a mill-machining test conducted with the prototype, which confirmed that the tool clamp is little affected by centrifugal force at high rotational speeds. The experimental results confirm that the proposed SMA-based tool clamp can be successfully applied to micro-machining. close...|$|E
40|$|The study {{deals with}} a {{development}} of an electric power chuck system for CNC lathe. Today, almost power chuck system for CNC lathes are used with hydraulic system included with hydraulic fluid which causes the environment pollution. Besides, not only the hydraulic pump always wastes energy, but also its heat transfer causes thermal deformation and deteriorates machining accuracy. In the study, in order to remove the hydraulic pump system from CNC lathe, the electric power chuck system which is able to adopt to the general CNC lathe and to have enough capability as general <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>chuck</b> system are developed. The electric power chuck system adopt to alternate general hydraulic pump system. From the experimental result, the developed electric power chuck system is found to have enough abilities. In addition, the electric power chuck system aims to improve machining accuracy by intercepting heat transfer and environmental pollution as well as removing the hydraulic system from machine tools...|$|R
