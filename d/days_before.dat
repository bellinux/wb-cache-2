Style receptivity lasts three days, from the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> to the <b>day</b> after anthesis. Ovule receptivity lasts two days: {{the day of}} anthesis and the <b>day</b> <b>before.</b> The rate of pollen tube growth varies {{in different parts of}} the pistil and in relation to pistil age.

In the receptacle region, where the transmitting tissue is reduced, the growth rate decreases independently of the time of pollination. The fruits are larger and heavier with more seeds when pollination occurs at anthesis.
