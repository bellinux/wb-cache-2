50|$|Orange oxide was {{received}} from the Refinery in five-ton mobile hoppers, which were mounted on seal hoppers to feed the reduction furnace {{at a rate of}} approximately 375 pounds per hour for producing metal grade UF4. The powder was agitated and carried through the reduction furnace by a ribbon flight screw. Dissociated ammonia was metered to the reduction reactors and passed counter-currently to the bed of uranium oxide within the chemical reactor. The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a hydrogen burner where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a feed screw to the first of the three <b>hydrofluorination</b> furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the <b>hydrofluorination</b> furnace by ribbon flight screws and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades. The off-gases containing water vapor formed in the reaction and excess hydrofluoric acid was removed from the first furnace and were sent to hydrofluoric acid recovery. The gases first passed to a partial condenser that removed all of the water in the form of 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the gases was then passed to a total condenser, which condenses the remainder of the acid as anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The gases at this point contain only the nitrogen from seals and purge gases and small amounts of hydrofluoric acid that did not condense in the total condenser. These were passed through potassium hydroxide scrubbers to remove the last traces of acid and then discharged to the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>hydrofluorination</b> {{of uranium}} dioxide {{is a key}} {{reaction}} in the conversion processes for uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel fabrication. Improvement in process performance {{can be achieved by}} a detailed characterization and modeling of the powder microstructure. High-quality and detailed microstructure data is necessary, and can be recently obtained by advanced techniques as focused ion beam (FIB) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with image processing. The FIB procedure uses Ga ions to mill thin sections from the exposed powder surface, which is alternatively imaged by SEM. Sequential milling and imaging yield a serial set of consecutive images of the powder agglomerates. The 3 D reconstruction obtained concerns about 300 µm 3. This 3 D reconstruction gives a valuable basis for the determination of essential microstructure and morphological parameters necessary for kinetic modeling: surface area, porosity, pore size distribution and tortuosity. UO 2 (s) + 4 HF (g) ⟺ UF 4 (s) + 2 H 2 O (g) The aim {{of this study is to}} focus on uranium based powders, in order to determine microstructural evolution during <b>hydrofluorination.</b> It is already known that the molar volume of UF 4 being 1, 88 times greater than UO 2, the dimensions of the pores inside the powder aggregates decrease when conversion increases. This is most likely the reason for the observed slowing down of the kinetic rate since the diffusion of reacting and produced gases through the smallest pores becomes more and more difficult. 3 samples have been studied: UO 2, UF 4 and a partially transformed powder (50 % conversion). FIB-SEM results show that, as expected, porosity decreases, and pore size distribution is shifted towards small pores, whereas tortuosity and the amount of closed pores are increasing throughout the reaction. All these results have been implemented in a numerical model which simulates the diffusion of gases into porous media.

The {{purpose of the study}} is to identify the model of transformation of this reaction in order to simulate the kinetics under isothermal and isobaric conditions. UO 2 (s) + 4 HF (g) ⟺ UF 4 (s) + 2 H 2 O (g) The solid-gas reactions always occur according to nucleation and growth process. If the reaction admits a rate-determining step, it can be shown that the rate equation may be expressed as the product of two functions:dα/dt=Φ(T,P) *S m (α,r 0) with dα/dt (s - 1); Φ(T,P) *S (mol. m - 2. s - 1) and S m (α,r 0) (m². mol - 1) Thermogravimetric analysis of the <b>hydrofluorination</b> enabled to study the influence of the temperature and hydrogen fluoride partial pressure on the reaction rate, and thus determine ϕ(T, P). It follows that the order of reaction is equal to 1 towards hydrogen fluoride between 42 and 720 mbar, and the reaction follows an Arrhenius law between 375 and 450 °C. Powder characterization showed that the space function Sm(α) follows a Carter-Valensi law, which corresponds to a shrinking core model with a rate limiting step of diffusion. The simulations show a phenomenon of kinetic slowdown from alpha = 0. 6. The molar volumes between UO 2 and UF 4 being quite different (1, 88 ratio), the dimensions of the pores inside the powder aggregates decreases when conversion increases. This is most likely the reason for the slowing down of the kinetic rate since the diffusion of reacting and produced gases through the smallest pores become more and more difficult. Thus isobaric conditions are no longer valid and the model deviates from the experience. The model can thus be improved by taking into account the transport phenomena in the powder agglomerates...|$|E
