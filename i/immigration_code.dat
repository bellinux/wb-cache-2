5000|$|Berkeley, California, {{became the}} first city {{government}} in the United States to pass a sanctuary resolution on November 8, 1971. Additional local governments in certain cities in the United States began designating themselves as sanctuary cities during the 1980s. [...] Some have questioned {{the accuracy of the}} term [...] "sanctuary city" [...] as used in the USA. The policy was first initiated in 1979 in Los Angeles, to prevent police from inquiring about the immigration status of arrestees. The internal policy, [...] "Special Order 40", states: [...] "Officers shall not initiate police action with the objective of discovering the alien status of a person. Officers shall not arrest nor book persons for violation of title 8, section 1325 of the United States <b>Immigration</b> <b>code</b> (Illegal Entry)." [...] These cities have adopted [...] "sanctuary" [...] ordinances banning city employees and police officers from asking people about their immigration status.|$|E
50|$|Almost immediately, the {{provisions}} of the law were challenged by Southwestern businesses. US entry into World War I, {{a few months after the}} law's passage, prompted a waiver of the Act's provisions on Mexican agricultural workers. It was soon extended to include Mexicans working in the mining and railroad industries and the exemptions continued through 1921. The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed in 1943. The Luce-Celler Act of 1946 ended discrimination against Asian Indians and Filipinos, who were accorded the right to naturalization, and allowed a quota of 100 immigrants per year. The Immigration Act of 1917 was later altered formally by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, known as the McCarran-Walter Act. It extended the privilege of naturalization to Japanese, Koreans, and other Asians. The McCarran-Walter Act revised all previous laws and regulations regarding immigration, naturalization, and nationality, and collected into one comprehensive statute. Legislation barring homosexuals as immigrants remained part of the <b>immigration</b> <b>code</b> until passage of the Immigration Act of 1990.|$|E

50|$|On the {{supportive}} {{side of the}} issue, it {{is argued}} that living illegally in the United States is civil infraction, and that this bill merely aims at re-cementing U.S. <b>immigration</b> <b>codes</b> that have long been neglected by changing the seriousness of the infraction from a civil to a criminal one. Supporters of the bill argue that it will increase border security by providing more US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to the border, thereby helping to curtail any possible entry to the country by terrorists, and that the passage of this bill may help curtail drug trafficking and human trafficking from Mexico to the US by depriving smugglers of sources and contacts on the US side of the border.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} issue of whether {{discrimination}} against two historically disadvantaged groups - racial minorities, on the one hand, and gays and lesbians, on the other - might increase or decrease should the federal immigration power devolve to the individual states. I conclude that while the lack of uniformity that accompanies immigration law devolution might lead to undesirable results in welfare reform and criminal law enforcement, and would likely not stem the tide of racism, it might lead to the opening of opportunities for gay Americans to petition their binational partners for immigration benefits. Such a development would turn the state of Vermont into a solitary haven for binational same-gender unions, thereby improving upon the federal <b>immigration</b> <b>code</b> 2 ̆ 7 s desire to keep families together by extending the breadth of its reach to include others usually excluded. Devolution in that case would lead to more protection for immigrants than what is currently available under the status qu...|$|E
40|$|For decades, {{immigration}} law and scholarship has been preoccupied with {{limits on the}} power of courts to police immigration policy. But the focus on this separation-of-powers question has obscured a second: how is immigration authority distributed between the political branches themselves? In this Article, we explore how the allocation of immigration power between the President and Congress has evolved as a matter of historical practice and constitutional law. A long-overlooked history hints that the President has at times asserted inherent executive authority to regulate immigration. At the same time, the explosive growth of the administrative state has assimilated most executive policymaking into a model of delegated authority. The intricate <b>immigration</b> <b>code</b> associated with this delegation framework may appear at first glance to limit the President’s policymaking discretion. In practice, however, the modern structure of {{immigration law}} actually has enabled the President to exert considerable control over immigration law’s core question: which types of noncitizens, and how many, should be permitted to enter and reside in the United States? Whether Congress intended for the President to have such freedom is less important than understanding the breadth of the Executive’s power and its asymmetric nature. The President has considerable authority to screen immigrants at the back end of the system, through enforcement decisions, but minimal control over screening at the front end, before immigrants enter the United States. We argue that this asymmetry may sometimes have pathological consequences [...] consequences Congress could mitigate by formally delegating power to the President to adjust the quotas and admissions criteria at the heart of immigration law...|$|E
40|$|The {{devolution}} {{of immigration}} policy to the 50 states {{has resulted in}} the enactment of more than 1, 500 state-level immigration since 2005. For the record 42 million immigrants living in the U. S., these laws have had tremendous consequences related to healthcare utilization and access, community relations with law enforcement, family dissolution, and the exacerbation of income inequalities. While the legislative arena has shifted to the states, our understanding of immigration policymaking remains unclear due to inconsistent and omitted predictors of <b>immigration</b> policy, subjective <b>coding</b> of <b>immigration</b> laws, and statistical modeling that {{does not take into account}} changes in key independent variables. Using data primarily from the Census Bureau’s American Factfinder, the Current Population Survey, and the National Council of State Legislatures, and other sources this research refines the quantitative determinants of immigration policy while using time-series analysis to highlight the factors linked to laws designed to integrate or exclude immigrations in the 50 states. Once empirical analysis is conducted, I delve into the details of state level immigration policymaking by interviewing state level bureaucrats within state health departments to determine the role that they, their data analysis, and the research play when it comes to influencing legislators and shaping immigration policy. This mixed methods approach combining statistical modeling and key informant interviews provides important findings that give a clear picture on why state institutional arrangements are crucial for understating immigration policy at the state level...|$|R
40|$|This article explores {{one set of}} {{criminal}} law actors who have been quietly accumulating immigration screening power {{over the last several}} years-our nation 2 ̆ 7 s inferior criminal courts and the prosecutors who rule them. By centering criminal courts, this article hopes to accomplish three things. First, it hopes to show that delegation is no monolith. Unlike other criminal law partners, who must do the Executive 2 ̆ 7 s bidding, a state prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s virtual autonomy over charging decisions enable her to effectively dictate whether a particular noncitizen defendant will meet or avoid the fate of permanent banishment, even if doing so contradicts the express wishes of immigration officials. Second, this article assesses criminal courts as institutions of mercy. Because opportunities for mercy have been nearly written out of the <b>immigration</b> <b>code,</b> criminal courts present a tantalizing prospect for noncitizen defendants. Such an inquiry is especially timely {{in light of the fact}} that state courts are now beginning to grapple with the aftermath of Padilla v. Kentucky. This article argues that while criminal courts are well-situated to make equitable interventions, the design and practice {{of criminal}} law practice constrain the ability of prosecutors and defense lawyers to identify worthy candidates of mercy. Finally, recognizing that many of the screening challenges facing criminal courts is on account of the de facto nature of their screening power, this article offers some thoughts on the way forward for courts should they begin the process of formally embracing their immigration powers...|$|E
40|$|The plenary power {{doctrine}} sharply {{limits the}} judiciary’s power to police immigration regulation—a fact that has preoccupied immigration law scholars for decades. But scholars’ persistent {{focus on the}} distribution of power between the courts and the political branches has obscured a second important separation-of-powers question: how is immigration authority distributed between the political branches themselves? The Court’s jurisprudence has shed little light on this question. In this Article, we explore how the allocation of regulatory power between the President and Congress has evolved as a matter of political and constitutional practice.

40|$|Congress 2 ̆ 7 s plenary {{power to}} {{regulate}} immigration sharply limits the judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in immigration regulation. Since the plenary power doctrine was first formulated, the Supreme Court has emphasized that immigration represents an issue best left to the political branches. The resulting extended focus by scholars on {{the implications of this}} distribution of power between courts and the political branches has obscured a second important separation-of-powers issue: the question of how immigration authority is distributed between the political branches themselves. The Court’s immigration jurisprudence has shed little light on this question, often treating the political branches as something of a singular entity. Surprisingly little scholarly commentary has addressed the inter-relationship between the two branches or attempted to discern whether consistent power-sharing patterns have emerged over time. In this Article, we explore how the allocation of power between the political branches to screen immigrants has been understood both as a matter of constitutional history {{and as a matter of}} actual practice, with a view to better understanding the structure of American immigration law. We present a long-overlooked constitutional history according to which the executive has claimed inherent authority to screen and admit immigrants, But we demonstrate how this use of authority has been slowly domesticated by the rise of the administrative state and its associated jurisprudence, with the consequence that most executive policymaking in the immigration arena proceeds today through delegated authority. But this delegation has not always operated in obvious ways. We show that the explosion of a detailed, rule-bound <b>immigration</b> <b>code</b> has had the counterintuitive consequence of delegating tremendous authority to the President to decide the most basic questions about which types of noncitizens, and how many, should reside in the United States. But this delegation has been asymmetric: the President has considerable authority to screen immigrants at the back end of the system through its enforcement decisions, but little control over screening at the front end, before immigrants enter the United States. We argue that this asymmetric delegation has pathological consequences in certain circumstances, and we suggest two possible solutions: either formally delegating to the President the power to adjust the quotas and admissions criteria at the heart of immigration law, or seriously restricting the prosecutorial discretion of the President in the immigration arena...|$|E
40|$|Congressional {{amendments}} to the <b>immigration</b> <b>code</b> in the 1990 s significantly broadened grounds for removal while nearly eradicating opportunities for discretionary relief. The {{result has been a}} radical transformation of immigration law. In particular, the constriction of equitable discretion as an adjudicative tool has vested a new and critical responsibility in enforcement officials to implement rigid immigration rules in a normatively defensible way, primarily through the use of prosecutorial discretion. This Article contextualizes recent executive enforcement actions within this scheme and argues that the Obama Administration’s targeted use of limited enforcement resources and implementation of initiatives such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals reflect defensible efforts to systematize equitable decision making principles within the new world of American immigration law. Having laid bare the practical realities of the modern immigration system, this Article then argues that reliance on executive discretion alone has thus far failed to ensure that individuals are deported only when justified. Of particular importance, the Department of Homeland Security under the current administration has all but abandoned any consideration of the normative merits of removal when it comes to noncitizens with any kind of criminal history. Indeed, the agency has used criminal history as an indiscriminate marker of undesirability, regardless of the seriousness of the underlying offense, the passage of time, the permanent resident status of the noncitizen, the severity of hardship that deportation would cause for the noncitizen’s family, and any other mitigating factors. A deportation system that allocates all responsibility for fairness and proportionality to enforcement actors raises other problems as well, including lack of finality and heightened risk of conflict with other branches and levels of government. These difficulties in turn can stymie the use of enforcement discretion as an effective equitable tool. The situation cries out for legal redress. The reinvigoration of adjudicative discretion and rollback of overly broad removal grounds through statutory reform are goals well worth pursuing, and this Article describes important measures that lawmakers might take toward those ends. In the absence of congressional intervention, there remain important steps the Executive could take to help ensure the proportionality and fairness of the deportation system, despite the drawbacks of enforcement based equity. This Article concludes by suggesting that if neither of the political branches takes adequate steps to address this new set of problems, it will be left to the federal judiciary to increase structural opportunities for equitable consideration through closer regulation of the modern deportation system...|$|E
