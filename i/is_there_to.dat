5|$|Old Kazran is soon {{visited by}} {{holographic}} {{images of the}} ship's crew in the present.

In the first ending, Jinkuro allows himself to be sent to Yomi while Momohime lives; she decides to forgo her marriage to Yukinojo and become a Buddhist nun in the hope of saving Jinkuro's soul through prayer.
