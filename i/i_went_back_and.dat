25|$|GONZALES: Senator, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} my {{calendar}} for that week. I traveled to Mexico for the inauguration of the new president. We had National Meth Awareness Day. We were working on a very complicated issue relating to CFIUS.|$|E
25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head. It gave me a lot of {{confidence}} to know that if <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Neither as a gentleman, nor {{as a human}} creature,' added Louis, in {{the same}} tone. 'Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> give your answer?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jean, shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{write the}} letter, or may I stay {{and tell you}} that the old man loves you better than a daughter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't you, now? Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{tell him}} that? But {{you must have}} {{something}} to eat. I don't know what's up, but Sir Magnus is in a taking." ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Drake stated that his debut album will be [...] "a solid hip hop album" [...] and musically distinct from his So Far Gone mixtape, which received negative comparisons to Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak (2008). He {{expressed a desire to}} work with André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Sade for the album. In {{an interview}} for MTV, Drake cited Nas and André 3000 as influences for parts of Thank Me Later, stating [...] "Nas was somebody that I used to listen to his raps and never understood how he did it. I always wanted to understand how he painted those pictures and his bar structure. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> really studied Nas and André 3000 and then came back with this album". In comparing the album to his previous work, he stated [...] "It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna sound happier. More victorious, 'cause that's where I'm at in my life". He told Entertainment Weekly that, [...] "I didn't make this album for commercial purposes. A lot of the verses are extremely long. I just made it to share with people. I hope they can enjoy".|$|E
500|$|On March 8, 2012, Winters {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Seattle Sounders Women, under head coach Michelle French, to play with national team members Alex Morgan, Hope Solo, Sydney Leroux, and Stephanie Cox. Of her signing, she said, [...] "Once WPS was suspended, I was obviously really disappointed. I thought about going overseas, but transfer windows were closed and things became really complicated and frustrating...Alex Morgan asked if I was interested in playing with her on the Sounders. [...] knew I have been living in Seattle. Right after that, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sent [...] an email to find out more information about the Sounders Women. So that's how it all started for me." [...] Winters played in eight matches for the Sounders Women, scored one goal and recorded one assist. The team finished second in the Western Conference with a [...] record. With the national teammates' presence on the team, the Sounders sold out nine of their ten home matches at the 4,500 capacity Starfire Stadium. Average attendance during the 2012 season for the Sounders Women was four times higher than the next closest team.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{spent the}} next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks {{full-time}} for Simon & Schuster in Cambridge. She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] because [...] "I felt that if <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together. Greenland did not read the novel until it was published.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{make love}} to those girls and let the world and you and {{everything}} go hang? Deep breasts and rounded limbs--and we poor emasculated devils go tramping by {{with the blood of}} youth in us!..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{say that}} <b>I</b> struck one wolf and it escaped?' thought Walter. 'Fie!' said his conscience, 'Do you not {{remember}} that a lie {{is one of the}} worst sins, both in the sight of God and man? If you tell a lie to-day and say you struck a wolf, to-morrow surely it will eat you up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no ray-admittance except ye pay again," [...] the Captain said. [...] "Hadn't <b>I</b> better <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{take the}} fellow your message?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Lead singer Bono {{explained}} {{that he had to}} ask himself a few hard questions before carrying on recording: [...] "I wanted to check where I was to where I am. So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> listened to all the music that made me {{want to be in a}} band, right from the Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo & The Bunnymen, all that stuff. And what was interesting is, that was what a lot of people in bands now are listening to anyway. So in a funny way, it made us completely contemporary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> plunged for it I {{might get}} that flour," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I {{should have to}} go down the rapid with it, and I mightn't want it then." ...|$|E
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> took Ajor in my {{arms and}} kissed the tears from her eyes and a smile to her lips while {{together}} we watched the last of the Americans disappear into the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} that I had not come to offer you my fortune." [...] And he almost scowled at her as he spoke. [...] "You know what my career has {{hitherto}} been, though you do not perhaps know what has driven me to it. Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> live after the same fashion, and let Tretton go to the dogs? It will be so unless you take me and Tretton into your hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will come}} to that second {{difficulty}} all in good time," [...] rejoined the Count. [...] "You may confuse yourself, Percival, {{as much as you}} please, but you shall not confuse me. Let the question of the money be settled first. Have I convinced your obstinacy? have I shown you that your temper will not let you help yourself?--Or must <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> (as you put it in your dear straightforward English) bully and bluster a little more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, sir, before I {{tell you}} that, <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> finish {{the story of}} Mr. Oxenham, if you will believe me enough to hear it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew the}} hands was aboard, and arter {{watching}} 'is cabin-skylight until {{the light was}} out, I went and undressed. Then I crept back on to the jetty, and arter listening by the Peewit {{to make sure that}} they was all asleep, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> climbed down the ladder.|$|E
6000|$|... "I left 'im {{there for}} a minute while I went and 'ad a look round. The deck of the Snipe was empty, but I could 'ear Uncle Dick down in the cabin singing; and, arter {{listening}} for a few seconds {{to make sure that it}} was singing, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> beckoned to 'Arry.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> hunted awhile for {{the nest}} among the bogs {{of a little}} bay; then left the search to {{investigate}} a strange call that sounded continuously farther up the shore. It came from some hidden spot in the tall grass, an eager little whistling cry, reminding me somehow of a nest of young fish-hawks.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} Gerald hesitated, and then got up. [...] "Very well! Perhaps it's the best chance I'll get, and I'll take it. But <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> pack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> open up {{the mines}} I have discovered," [...] said Anderson Rover. [...] "But not now. I {{want to see my}} own dear native land first." ...|$|R
3000|$|... (P 5) And {{honestly}} when I am not gambling, I {{can consider}} {{myself as a}} good father or a good husband. After work <b>I</b> would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don’t gamble at night.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> teased Dr. John about Madame's {{devotion to}} him. How he laughed! What fun shone {{in his eyes}} as he {{recalled}} some of her fine speeches, and repeated them, imitating her voluble delivery! He had an acute sense of humour, and was the finest company in the world--when he could forget Miss Fanshawe.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is cared for," [...] said Roland; [...] "I locked {{gate and}} wicket on them when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> no boat will stir {{from the island}} this night, if doors of good oak and bolts of iron can keep men within stone-walls.--And now I resign my office of porter of Lochleven, and give {{the keys to the}} Kelpie's keeping." ...|$|E
60|$|The crimson {{flush of}} anger {{began to fade}} out of her face, as <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> took my chair in silence. She waited a little, and steadied herself. When she went on, but one sign of feeling was {{discernible}} in her. She spoke without looking at me. Her hands were fast clasped in her lap, {{and her eyes were}} fixed on the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gilbert," [...] I said slowly, [...] "we are {{up against}} an impasse. <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> consult with Guest. He is the most {{resourceful}} man I know. He {{may be able to}} suggest something." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{footnote}} to this passage, written later, Gray adds: [...] "When I read this assessment now, I simply feel embarrassed at what a little snob I was when I wrote it... When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> listen, {{after a long}} gap, to Dylan's recording, every ardent, true feeling I ever had comes back to me. Decades of detritus drop away <b>and</b> I feel <b>back</b> in communion with my best self and my soul. Whatever the shortcomings of the lyric, the recording itself, capturing at its absolute peak Dylan's incomparable capacity for intensity of communication, is a masterpiece {{if ever there was}} one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{her know}} who I am? Mayhap I'll {{let her know}} that much, before long. When I'm going back to the wild country, I may say to her: 'Rough as I am to look at, I'm your mother's brother, and you're the only bit of my own flesh and blood I've got left to cotton to in all the world. Give us a shake of your hand, and a kiss for mother's sake; and I won't trouble you no more.' I may say that, afore <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> lose sight of her for good and all." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the story}} was told finally, however, and then I led the old man out of the cabin, he {{following}} me obediently, never asking where we were going, and when {{we had come to}} a ruined building mayhap fifty yards distant from old Mary's cabin, I halted, explained what we would do, saying that he should stay there while <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> released the prisoners.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. I was mad, I {{can tell}} you. I wasn't going to 'it 'er if I could 'elp it, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> licked into this chap, {{just to show}} 'er what I could do. 'E was a big chap, too. Well, I chucked him, and smashed things about, and gave 'er a scaring, and she ran up and locked 'erself into the spare room." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} she recovered herself, {{and with a}} murmur of apology was gone. Huddled up in my towel, I sat motionless, shrunken for a while almost to nothing in the dense sense of shame that had swept over me. Then suddenly I flung myself on my knees, and prayed--though what about and to whom I cannot say. After which <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> bathed myself again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} obliged to you," [...] he said, [...] "but {{there is only}} one course open to me. <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> make my plans. If I could have a {{carriage}} for the nine-forty!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To far-off lands whence I came, a sea-girt land {{which once}} was mine own. My fathers lived there. <b>I</b> would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> tell my {{people of all}} that I saw here on Calvary seven years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that would}} be the best plan," [...] Harry agreed. [...] "Now <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> take Bertie's place. It is my turn to be on watch, and he will be wanting to hear the news." ...|$|R
