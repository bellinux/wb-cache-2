5|$|The book is an {{extensive}} work of investigative journalism, {{written in the}} form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor working in Africa. He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS,</b> when international attention on the disease exploded.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (MW)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Not only in South-Africa, but worldwide, HIVIAIDS is a {{morbidity}} {{that increases}} {{on a daily}} basis. Currently, {{it can be seen}} as the hugest health dilemma in the world. The implications <b>of</b> the <b>Aids</b> pandemic on community structures are distressful. It is estimated that just as many people will <b>die</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> as from any other cause. A positive HIV test result has an enormous impact on the life of the person. A person's whole life changes the very moment he is informed that he is HIV positive. The person who is diagnosed with HIV as well as the people around him need to make life-changing decisions. These decisions should be made to deal with demands of HIV in an effective manner. According to people with HIVIAIDS from different communities, negative responses from fellow community members have a far more negative impact on them than having to deal with the positive HIV-status itself. It therefore is essential that a supporting environment be established in which in people living with HIVIAIDS can be accepted. To be able to understand and manage the situation better it is necessary to establish which processes made it possible for people to disclose their positive HIVIAIDS-status and what the experience of a person was after disclosure. The study established which processes were present to enable him to disclose and what support systems are necessary for people to disclose a positive HIVIAIDSstatus. A case study was used.

From the population of about 46 million in South Africa, 5. 7 million were HIV positive {{by the end of}} 2007 with about 1000 deaths every day. Sub-Saharan Africa appeared to be the most hit by this tragedy as indicated by statistics in this study. When parents <b>die</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aids,</b> the burden <b>of</b> orphaned children is left with relatives and extended families to look after those children. The number of orphans is escalating due to increasing death rate of parents. A detailed discussion on the extended families which includes their origin, roles they play as well as challenges they face in caring for orphaned children is included as well. Challenges include having to deal with grief and changing behaviour of the orphaned children. The goal {{of this study was to}} conduct an analysis of extended families affected by HIV/Aids taking care of orphans, living in the Kyasands informal settlement in order to improve service delivery. The main objectives of the study included exploring the needs of these extended families caring for orphaned children in terms of social, emotional and material aspects as well as challenges they face and how they manage to survive. A qualitative method was used in conducting this study with the use of semi-structured interviews to collect information. The main central question asked was, how do you manage to live with an additional member within your family. The main findings in this study were reported which included the strength and composition of assets and the extended families’ resources to make a living and adjust to shocks of life. Family was seen as the most trusted asset in this study by the respondents.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Community Psychiatric Nursing)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{previous}} {{study on the}} experiences of widowhood and beliefs about the mourning process of the Batswana people found that widows were stigmatised due to cultural beliefs that made coping a difficult process for the widow. The literature revealed that widowhood {{following the death of}} a partner from AIDS is a difficult process due to HIV and AIDS being highly stigmatized. Stigma is an attribute that is deeply discrediting and devaluating to an individual social identity. It also reduces the person from her usual status to one with a tainted image due to the belief that having contracted HIV and AIDS is a choice and that an individual is responsible for her immoral behaviour. This negative attitude that amounts to prejudice contributes to the women's feelings of unworthiness. It was also found that the stigma against people living with HIV and AIDS is not only directed at them, but also to those having close relationships with them namely, their spouses, children, relatives, as well as health workers, which is known as secondary or associated stigma. The stigma was found to be attributed to discrimination based on gender, age, sexual orientation and race, hence women living with HIV and AIDS were found to be more stigmatised than men. Women whose partners <b>died</b> <b>of</b> AIDS were thus perceived by the community as having infected their partners, therefore, they were blamed, isolated and excluded from community activities. Coping with the loss of a partner was found to be a difficult process for the widow, aggravated by the death from AIDS. Some women coped by denying their late partner's status, while others kept it secret to avoid stigmatization. Some women, however, coped by challenging perpetrators of stigma about their attitude. This study was motivated by the challenge perceived by the researcher concerning women who lost their partners to AIDS who had to be assisted with coping with stigma associated with them having had a partner who was infected and died from AIDS. The objectives of this study were to explore and describe the experiences of coping with stigma by women whose partners <b>died</b> <b>of</b> AIDS, as well as to develop, implement and evaluate a programme to assist women whose partners <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>aids</b> to cope with the stigma associated with their partner having had a relationship with an infected partner who <b>died</b> <b>of</b> AIDS. The literature was studied in order to contextualize both stigma and coping. A qualitative phenomenological design was followed in phase one of the study as well as a case study in phase two. A purposive sample was used in phase one as well as in phase two. Data were collected by means of single open ended questions. In-depth interviews were recorded on audio tape and transcribed verbatim. Personal, observational as well as methodological field notes were written after each interview. Data analysis was conducted according to the content analysis technique of Tesch. The co-coder and the researcher analysed the data independently, after which a consensus meeting was held to finalise data. Ethical principles were applied according to Burns and Grove, as well as the Democratic Nurses Organisation of South Africa and the Department of Health. Trustworthiness of the study was ensured through the model of Lincoln and Guba. The criteria of creditability, transferability, dependability, as well as confirmability were ensured. The findings of phase one of the study as well as the literature study of stigma intervention programmes assisted in the formulation of a programme. An eight sessions programme for coping with stigma for women whose partners <b>died</b> <b>of</b> AIDS was developed, implemented and evaluated. Phase two of the study consisted of a holistic multiple case design for presenting the developed programme. Data were collected by means of multiple sources of evidence. Data were analysed by means of a case record. Conclusions indicated that the programme for coping with stigma for women whose partners <b>died</b> <b>of</b> AIDS had a positive impact on the expansion of their coping skills. Doctora...|$|R
