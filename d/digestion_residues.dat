40|$|The {{increase}} of peat demand for horticultural crops, {{the reduction of}} peat availability, due {{to more and more}} restrictive regulations about the peatland exploitation and the increasing ecological awareness about the sustainable ecological development, has producted the necessity to find other materials that could replace, totally or partially this product as root substrates. It could be interesting to substitute peat with cheaper renovable products, using rejecting items considered as a cost for the company. Several scientists have already started to characterize, chemically-physically, the rice hulls and anaerobic <b>digestion</b> <b>residues</b> as peat substitute. Rice hulls is a by-product in rice processing composed by bracts that are removed from paddy during rice processing. The extensive world-wide use of rice presupposes that this rejected products are available on the market constantly and at a low cost. Petroleum exhaustibility and the costs of agricultural-industrial wastes obliged XXI century man to better use natural resources exploiting also what was, till than, considered a rejected product. Anaerobic digestion process has changed rejected products into source of energy, producing a byproduct: anaerobic <b>digestion</b> <b>residues</b> which could be used as agricultural amendant. The object of the thesis is the chemical-physical characterization of mixtures of different combinations of peat, rice hulls and anaerobic <b>digestion</b> <b>residues</b> derived from fruit pomace to consider the possibility to use them as substrates in horticultural cultivations.

40|$|ABSTRACT Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is one way}} {{of handling}} biowaste and generating energy in the form of methane, biogas. This study shows that spore forming bacterias survive the process of pasteurisation and anaerobic digestion in biogas plants. It has also been established that both the nonpasteurised-and digestion- waste contains pathogen spore forming bacterias. Two Swedish full-scale commercial biogas plants were sampled before pasteurisation, after pasteurisation and after digestion on 10 occasions with one week intervals. The samples were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively, with biochemical methods, for Clostridium spp and Bacillus spp. Polymerase Chain Reaction, a biomolecular method, was used for C. chauvei analysis, with C. chauvei specific primers. For this analyse the biogas plants were sampled at 11 occasions. Survival of pathogenic spore forming bacteria in <b>digestion</b> <b>residue</b> may be a health risk for both humans and animals.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the hydrolysis {{of the minor}} glycerophospholipids of human HDL(3), total HDL and LDL using human group IIA, V and X secretory phospholipases A(2) (sPLA(2) s). For this purpose we employed the enzyme and substrate concentrations and incubation times optimized for hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), the major glycerophospholipid of plasma lipoproteins. In contrast to PtdCho, which was readily hydrolyzed by group V and X sPLA(2) s, {{and to a lesser}} extent by group IIA sPLA(2), the minor ethanolamine, inositol and serine glycerophospholipids exhibited marked resistance to hydrolysis by all three sPLA(2) s. Thus, when PtdCho was hydrolyzed about 80 %, the ethanolamine and inositol glycerophospholipids reached a maximum of 40 % hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), which was examined to a more limited extent, showed similar resistance to group IIA, V and X sPLA(2) s, although the group V sPLA(2) attacked it more readily than group X sPLA(2) (52 % versus 39 % hydrolysis, respectively). Surprisingly, the group IIA sPLA(2) hydrolysis remained minimal at 10 - 15 % for all minor glycerophospholipids, and was of the order seen for the PtdCho hydrolysis by group IIA sPLA(2) at the 4 -h digestion time. All three enzymes attacked the oligo- and polyenoic species in proportion to their mole percentage in the lipoproteins, although there were exceptions. There was evidence of a more rapid destruction of the palmitoyl compared to the stearoyl arachidonoyl glycerophospholipids. Overall, the characteristics of hydrolysis of the molecular species of the lipoprotein-bound diradyl GroPEtn, GroPIns and GroPSer by group V and X sPLA(2) s differed significantly from those observed with lipoprotein-bound PtdCho. As a result, the acidic inositol and serine glycerophospholipids accumulated in the <b>digestion</b> <b>residues</b> of both LDL and HDL, and presumably increased the acidity of the residual particles. An accumulation of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids in the sPLA(2) <b>digestion</b> <b>residues</b> also had not been previously reported.

The results depict that the NP offers a selective interaction with fingermark residue, and thus offer clear and sharp images of fingermark ridges. In addition, the NP has been proven to outweigh BP due to two reasons: (1) the easy synthesis method using rice husk, an agricultural waste, and (2) its low toxicity content in the powder. On top of that, rice husk, which is a sustainable source, is available in abundance {{and the use of}} this rice husk in such a way decreases the accumulating wastes. This method also recycles the acid <b>digestion</b> <b>residue</b> that is usually discarded during the extraction of silica from rice husk. In addition, the method proposed does not require intense energy or costly components, thus suggesting the feature of being environmentally friendly, apart from being cost-effective. Further studies on larger scale with more surfaces and comparison with other available powders would be needed to establish the superiority and applicability of NP in routine forensic casework.|$|R

From this standpoint, US Patent No. 4649031 (1987) reported a non-destructive digestion process for the recovery of rare elements, including Lanthanides and Actinides and group V and VI elements that are adsorbed onto the surfaces of coal combustion residues. This techniques includes: (1) reducing the grain size of the combustion residues from 0.1 to 1  mm, (2) <b>digestion</b> of the <b>residues</b> with water, (3) <b>digestion</b> of the <b>residues</b> with a dilute aqueous alkali solution (1.5  %– 8  %), (4) <b>digestion</b> of the <b>residue</b> with a dilute aqueous acid solution (0.5  %– 5  %) at a temperature below the boiling point of water, (5) separating the solid and liquid phases after each digestion, (6) and isolating the s metals from the liquid phases.

They may be considered, in pectore, as advanced glycation end products/peptides. These compounds, important at a systemic level in diabetic and nephropathic subjects, are produced by enzymatic digestion of in vivo glycated proteins: They are related to the pathological state of patients and have been invoked as responsible for tissue modifications. The digested mixtures obtained by the two enzymes were analyzed by MALDI/MS and LC/ESI/MSn, and clear cut differences were found. First of all, the digestion products of glycated HSA are generally less abundant than those observed in the case of unglycated HSA, accounting for the lower proclivity of the former to enzymatic digestion.

Environmental and technical issues have been arising in the recent years, driving researchers to look for other substrates to both preserve peat bogs and improve physical aspects (e. g. aeration) of this substrate. Ground fresh rice hulls (GRH) have already been used and characterized by several authors and shown to be suitable for producing growing mixes while less is known about the possible use of anaerobic <b>digestion</b> <b>residues</b> (ADR).

The increase of GRH in the mix without residues negatively affected growth of both species, S. splendens in particular. Indeed, when the rate of GRH was higher than 33 %, seedlings did not reach marketable size.

Here, the O 2 planar optode technique was used to visualize soil O 2 dynamics following the surface application of digestates of the codigestion of pig slurry and agro-industrial waste. We also used N 2 O isotopomer analysis of soil-emitted N 2 O to determine the N 2 O production pathways, i. e., nitrification or denitrification. Two-dimensional images of soil O 2 indicated that anoxic and hypoxic conditions developed at 2. 0 - and 1. 5 -cm soil depth for soil amended with the digestate produced with 15 -d (PO 15) and 30 -d (PO 30) retention time, respectively. Total N 2 O emissions were significantly lower for PO 15 than PO 30 due to the greater expansion of the anoxic zone, which enhanced N 2 O reduction via complete denitrification. However, cumulative CO 2 emissions were not significantly different between PO 15 and PO 30 for the entire incubation period. During incubation, N 2 O emissions came from both nitrification and denitrification in amended soils.

RS 3 il led to the lowest fermentability. Furthermore, increased butyrate ratios were observed for all preparations. The varying RS preparations behaved similarly in the dynamic fermentation but showed high SDs. Moreover, the fermentability was slow during the first 24 h, indicating that the microbiota needed an adaptation period to ferment RS. Propionate ratios increased at the expense of butyrate with exception for RS 2 dy showing an increase in acetate only.

30|$|The BMPs suggest good {{digestibility}} and methane production {{per unit}} of chemical oxygen demand (COD) for waste. The approach of the BMP test is simple, an organic substrate is mixed with an anaerobic inoculum in defined operational conditions, and the gas evolved is quantified by a specific measurement method. Temperature affects the bio-methanation rate. Higher temperatures imply greater methane yields in a shorter digestion time. However, sharp increases of temperature may be avoided because they can cause a decrease in bio-methane production due {{to the death of}} specific bacterial strains, (Chae et al. 2008). BMP tests are carried out keeping the pH around neutrality (values ranging between 7.0 and 7.8). pH values below 6.0 – 6.5 inhibit the methane bacteria activity. To avoid drop in pH, chemicals are added to the organic substrate to supply buffer capacity. Sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium sulphide are the most used chemicals (Owen et al. 1979). Substrate particle size affects significantly the BMP tests (Esposito et al. 2011; Sanders 2001; Barlaz 1990; Vavilin and Angelidaki 2005) as it influences the ratio between surface and volume for each organic particle. This ratio is relevant since microorganisms can degrade only the substances present {{on the surface of the}} organic solids. BMP Test is also used to assess biodegradability of the test substrate. There are lots of studies investigating the BMP of cow manure in literature (Rao and Seenayya 1994; Ahring et al. 2001; Lehtomaki et al. 2007; Ashekuzzaman and Poulsen 2011).

In this study, digestion of sludge from Bjorkborn industrial area in Karlskoga (reactor D 6) and co-digestion of the same sludge mixed with oat (reactor D 5) and post-treatment in reed beds were investigated in parallel. Methane {{production as}} well as changes in cytotoxicity (Microtox(R); ISO 11348 – 3), genotoxicity (Umu-C assay; ISO/ 13829) and AhR-mediated toxicity (7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay using RTW cells) were measured. Results: The result showed good methane production of industrial sludge (D 6) although the digested residue was more toxic than the ingoing material measured using microtox 30 min and Umu-C. Co-digestion of toxic industrial sludge and oat(D 5) showed higher methane production and significantly less toxic sludge residue than reactor D 6. Furthermore, dewatering and treatment in reed beds showed low and non-detectable toxicity in reed bed material and outgoingwater as well as reduced nutrients. Conclusions: Co-digestion of sludge and oat followed by dewatering and treatment of sludge residue in reed beds canbe a sustainable waste management and energy production.

A computer-controlled, simulated digestion system was applied to accurately predict the digestibility of monogastric animals. Briefly, simulated gastric fluid was composed of approximately 1550 U/mL pepsin (Sigma 10070; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO). The small intestinal fluid was simulated with 4730  U/mL of amylase (Sigma A 3306; Sigma-Aldrich Co.), 550  U/mL of trypsin (Amresco 0785; Amresco Inc., Solon, OH), and 154  U/mL of chymotrypsin (Amresco 0164; Amresco Inc.). Before in vitro intestinal digestion, 2  mL of small intestinal fluid was added to a digestion chamber. The small intestinal fluid was diluted by 20  mL residual simulated gastric fluid, which reached a neutral pH after 3 washing procedures during in vitro gastric <b>digestion.</b> The <b>residues</b> were centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 15  min, and the sediments were dried at 105  °C for 5  h and tested in subsequent DM, CP, gross energy (GE) and AA contents.|$|R
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} plant {{nutrients}} are transported from rural to urban {{areas in the}} form of food. To reach circulation of these nutrients, a transport of plant nutrients back to the countryside is necessary. Food residues may be processed in biogas plants where anaerobic processes take place and biogas is produced. The effluents from biogas production can be used as fertilizers in agriculture. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of effluents from <b>digestion</b> of food <b>residues</b> as a fertiliser to cereals. The study has been based on results from a field trial with oats run by JTI at a farm just north of Uppsala. The field trial was arranged with randomised blocks with four replicates. Effluents from <b>digestion</b> of food <b>residues</b> from the biogas plant of SKAFAB/SRV in Sofielund, Stockholm, were applied at two different times. The first application of effluents was in spring just before sowing and the second application during growth, when the crop was 20 cm high. For comparison of nitrogen efficiency mineral fertilisers were also applied in separate treatments. The total amount of nitrogen in the crop was analysed at two occasions, starting when the oat plants had one node and at time for harvest. On these occasions soil samples were also analysed for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen. The weather had a large impact on the development and yield of crops during the growing season. The persistent rainfall resulted in a large mineralisation of organic nitrogen in the soil. A large uptake of nitrogen and a lush crop growth resulted in lodging for most of the treatments. The untreated plots yielded most grain and lodging was less severe than in treated plots. The differences in yield were small in plots fertilised with effluents from digestion at sowing time and those fertilised during growth. Treatments with effluents from digestion and mineral fertilisers produced equal yield when they were based on the same amount of ammonium nitrogen. No significant differences in the analysis of nitrogen content were found in the different treatments, but there were differences in protein content between them. Grains from the untreated control part had a lower protein content than grains in the fertilised parts. During the end of the growing season, there were large amounts of nitrogen left in the soil, mainly in the fertilised parts. Since weather conditions largely influence yields of crops, there is a need for a long period of field trials with effluents from <b>digestion</b> of food <b>residues</b> to eliminate the influence of weather conditions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2003. Environmental ScienceIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 111 - 120) Lichens {{are excellent}} biomonitors. This study was undertaken {{to develop and}} refine a partial digestion procedure for lichen, suitable for ICP-MS analysis of trace elements, {{for the purpose of}} environmental monitoring. The developed digestion method consisted of a series of alternating dry and wet ashings utilizing nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Acceptable ICP-MS data were obtained for the following suite of elements: Mg, P, Ca, Mn, Co, Zn, Sr, Ba, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Rb, Cd, Sb, Cs, and Ce. The application of the procedure to lichens from different sites indicated that sites could be distinguished by their trace element concentrations; the elements with differences included elements of environmental interest such as V, Zn, and Cu. The concentrations determined by this research for Newfoundland lichens were generally much lower than those reported by other researchers. The digestion procedure was also applied to different lichen species (Alectoria sarmentosa, Bryoria sp., and Cladonia alpestris) collected at the same site. It was found that different species yielded different trace element information, thus direct comparisons cannot necessarily be made. <b>Digestion</b> <b>residues</b> were examined by SEM-EDX to determine general compositions. The majority of these residual particles had a high silicon content, with varying amounts of other elements, particularly aluminum and potassium; these minerals were silicates, likely to be quartz, feldspars, olivines, garnets, micas, and/or clay minerals. Differences in concentration (as determined by ICP-MS) were observed in lichen samples collected from the same site in consecutive years. Some elements displayed differences between ICP-MS Runs, likely due to sample inhomogeneity. Other researchers have found that elemental concentrations can differ between species, that some elements (e. g. Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) have higher concentrations in more polluted areas, and that the levels of some anthropogenic pollutants decrease with distance from the source; each of these points support the findings of this study...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{methods are}} needed for {{determining}} total N when studying the fate of N fertilizer applied to soil. This study was concerned with the pretreatment of samples of a Vertisol (calcareous Typic Pellusterts) with water, 20 and 2 mL for macro- and semimicro-Kjeldahl methods, respectively, prior to digestion. The need for such a modification with certain clay soils was originally recommended in 1925, but its requirement in conjunction with modern Kjeldahl methods is rarely reported. The macro- and semimicro-Kjeldahl methods used involved digestion of soil with a H 2 SO 4 -K 2 SO 4 -CuSO 4 5 H 2 O-Se mixture. Both techniques yielded <b>digestion</b> <b>residues</b> with dark-colored granules and low recoveries of N with soil samples ground to pass through a sieve with 0. 8 -mm openings (20 mesh), unless the soil was initially treated with water. For instance, N recovery from a surface Vertisol was increased by 29 % {{as a result of}} a 30 -min water soaking prior to a macro-Kjeldahl digestion. Extension of the digestion period up to 5 h after initial clearing did not eliminate the need for the water pretreatment. The requirement for the water pretreatment for semimicro-Kjeldahl methods was greatly reduced when the soil was ground to pass through a sieve with 0. 16 -mm openings (100 mesh). Increase in soil N due to water pretreatment was reduced from 35 to 6 % by grinding the coarser soil to such fineness. A salicylic acid pretreatment, involving water addition after the nitration reaction, permitted satisfactory digestion. The water pretreatment effect appeared to be associated with incomplete digestion of organic N, not with the recovery of fixed NH 4 +, and was found with both surface and subsoils. Water pretreatment of samples from several horizons of an Alfisol (Udic Rhodustalfs) had little effect on recovery of soil N. A water pretreatment is probably not needed to obtain maximum recoveries of N if the nonmodified Kjeldahl method results in a postdigestion soil residue without dense, darkish granules. However, the water soaking was found to reduce bumping during digestion of many soils and is recommended for routine us...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The {{feasibility}} study shall answer the following questions: Are there economical and ecological advantages of on-farm dry digestion biogas plants? How {{the construction and}} operation parameters of a dry digestion biogas plant influence environment, profit, and sustainability of on-farm biogas production? The aim of the {{feasibility study}} is to provide facts and figures for decision makers in Finland to support {{the development of the}} economically and environmentally most promising biogas technology on-farm. The results may encourage on-farm biogas plant manufacturers to develop and market dry anaerobic digestion technology as a complementary technology. This technology may be a competitive alternative for farms using a dry manure chain or even for stockless farms. Results Up to now farm scale dry digestion technology does not offer competitive advantages in biogas production compared to slurry based technology as far as only energy production is concerned. However, the results give an over-view of existing technical solutions of farm-scale dry digestion plants. The results also show that the ideal technical solution is not invented yet. This may be a challenge for farmers and entrepreneurs interested in planning and developing future dry digestion biogas plants on-farm. Development of new dry digestion prototype plants requires appropriate compensation for environmental benefits like closed energy and nutrient circles to improve the economy of biogas production. The prototype in Järna meets the objectives of the project since beside energy a new compost product from the solid fraction was generated. On the other hand the two-phase process consumes much energy and the investment costs are high (> 2000 € m- 3 reactor volume). Dry digestion on-farm offers the following advantages: Good process stability and reliability, no problems like foam or sedimentation, cheap modules for batch reactors, less reactor capacity, reduced transport costs due to reduced mass transfer in respect of the produced biogas quantity per mass unit, compost of solid <b>digestion</b> <b>residues</b> suitable as fertiliser also outside the farm gate, use of on-farm available technology for filling and discharging the reactor, less process energy for heating because of reduced reactor size, no process energy for stirring, reduced odour emissions, reduced nutrient run off during storage and distribution of residues because there is no liquid mass transfer, suitable for farms using deep litter systems. These advantages are compensated by following constraints: Up to 50...|$|E

Contribution {{of protein}} and lipid {{components}} to the salt response of envelopes of an extremely halophilic bacterium. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 653 – 660. 1966. —Removal of protein from envelopes of Halobacterium cutirubrum by peptic <b>digestion</b> left <b>residues</b> that required {{little or no}} salt for stability. The salt requirement of envelopes was also lowered by incubation in 0. 1 m MgCl 2, and could be lowered even further by digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin in 0. 1 m MgCl 2. Dissolution of envelopes in low salt concentrations made their protein more susceptible to attack by these and other proteolytic enzymes. Removal of lipids raised the requirement for divalent cations, particularly for Mg++; it slightly increased the Na+ requirement and {{did not affect the}} requirement for K+. It was concluded that the requirement for high salt concentrations in extreme halophiles is due to mutual repulsion between negatively charged groups on proteins rather than to repulsion between negatively charged phosphate groups on the lipids. The latter act primarily as sites on which divalent cations, especially Mg++ which is required in high concentrations by growing cells, are bound. In this manner, the phosphate groups support envelope structure...|$|R
40|$|Tetranitromethane (TNM), a small aqueous reagent that {{specifically}} modifies solvent-accessible tyrosine residues to o-nitrotyrosine, {{was used to}} probe the topology of the GlyR. Homomers of human α 1 GlyR were recombinantly expressed via a baculovirus system, affinity-purified, and reconstituted in lipid vesicles of defined composition. The native-like reconstituted receptors were then reacted with TNM, and GlyR reaction products were isolated by SDS−PAGE. After proteolytic <b>digestion,</b> TNM-labeled <b>residues</b> were identified using mass spectrometry by observing the mass shift corresponding to the nitrate moiety. In this manner, we have identified TNM modifications of tyrosine residues at positions 24, 75, 78, 161, 223, and 228 in the receptor. Of significance, nitrations at Tyr 223 and Tyr 228 occur within the first putative transmembrane helix (M 1) of the receptor, and their labeling suggests a nonhelical secondary structure for M 1 for the glycine receptor. In a previously published report [Leite et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 13683], we also identified proteolytic cleavage sites within M 1. Taken together, these studies support a topological model where the “historical” M 1 segment cannot be entirely α-helical and may contain an extramembranous surface loop. Furthermore, we have also identified a tyrosine modification (Tyr 161) within a region of the N-terminal domain critical in agonist and antagonist binding...|$|R
40|$|In {{a family}} who {{expressed}} severe dominantly inherited osteoarthritis, the underlying mutation was traced by genomic sequencing to a single base change which predicts an amino acid substitution of cysteine for arginine at residue 519 of the triple-helical domain of the type II collagen molecule (Ala-Kokko, L., C. T. Baldwin, R. W. Moskowitz, and D. J. Prockop. 1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87 : 6565 - 6568). In the present study we examined whether this predicted protein phenotype was evident in articular cartilage obtained from an affected family member who underwent hip surgery. The cartilage collagen was solubilized by CNBr <b>digestion.</b> Cysteine <b>residues</b> were labeled by reduction and alkylation with 14 C-iodoacetate. Collagen CNBr-peptides were fractionated by ion exchange and reverse phase column chromatography. One peptide from the alpha 1 (II) chain, alpha 1 (II) CB 8, {{was found to be}} radiolabeled. Tryptic peptides were prepared from it and identified by microsequence analysis. The results show that approximately one-quarter of the alpha 1 (II) chains present in the polymeric extracellular collagen of the patient's cartilage contained the Arg 519 -to-Cys substitution. The protein exhibited other abnormal properties including disulfide-bonded alpha 1 (II) -dimers and signs of posttranslational overmodification. The premature cartilage failure and osteoarthritis are presumably a result of the abnormal type II collagen being expressed in the cartilage matrix...|$|R
