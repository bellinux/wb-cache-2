50|$|Direct {{conversion}} imagers utilize photoconductors, such as amorphous selenium (a-Se), {{to capture}} and convert incident x-ray photons directly into electric charge. X-ray photons incident upon a layer of a-Se generate electron-hole pairs via the <b>internal</b> <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> A bias voltage applied to {{the depth of the}} selenium layer draw the electrons and holes to corresponding electrodes; the generated current is thus proportional to the intensity of the irradiation. Signal is then read-out using underlying readout electronics, typically by a thin-film transistor (TFT) array.|$|E
40|$|A {{lightweight}} {{imaging method}} based on electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) structure {{was developed to}} analyze single cells. Cells were cultured on the EIS structure surface, and the impedance of this cell-based biosensor was measured by two-electrode electrochemical system. For the field-effect and <b>internal</b> <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> of semiconductor and the electric insulativity of living cell, difference impedance was detected when a scanning laser irradiated at the cell-free and cell-on area respectively. Thus, an image of cell distribution and adhesion could be obtained by calculating impedance for each scanning point. The results of the experiment showed that the spatial resolution of the proposed imaging method could reach to 5 μm, and the sensitivity was high, which indicate that it has great potential {{to be used in}} various cell-based assays, such as cytotoxicity detection, drug evaluation and cancer research...|$|E

SPADs implemented in planar technology compatible with CMOS circuits offer typical advantages of microelectronic devices (small size, ruggedness, low voltage, low power, etc.).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} for the synthesis of p-type semiconductive polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles, based on polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) -assisted micelle formation. This approach is simple, facile and environmentally friendly. The PPy nanoparticles of uniform size and shape were readily integrated with interdigitated microelectrode arrays for sensitive photo and chemical gas sensors. PPy nanoparticles-based sensing devices were fabricated via a simple drop casting of PPy nanoparticles on the interdigitated microelectrode arrays. Based on the <b>internal</b> <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> of the PPy nanoparticles, {{the performance of the}} PPy nanoparticles-based sensing device as an UV illuminance meter was investigated. It was found that the limit of detection was 2 Lux and the sensitivity was 3. 425 % per Lux of UV light illuminance. The PPy nanoparticles-based sensing device was also tested as an ammonia gas detector, based on the un-doping process of the PPy nanoparticles. The limit of detection was found to be 4 ppm and the sensitivity determined to be 0. 274 % per ppm ammonia in the concentration range from 0 ppm to 100 ppm, which covers the ammonia threshold limit values (25 ppm and 35 ppm), as defined by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Furthermore, the enfluence of the size of PPy nanoparticles and the thickness of the PPy nanoparticle layer on the sensitivity of the sensing device was investigated. It was found that smaller PPy nanoparticles lead to higher sensitivity, while the thickness of the PPy nanoparticle layer does not affect the sensor performance. The novel PPy nanoparticle synthesis approach developed in this study represents a progress towards simpl, cheap and environmentally friendly production of nanostructured conductive polymers. The obtained PPy nanoparticles demonstrate a high potential in finding application {{in a wide range of}} technologies such as photo detection and chemical gas sensing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A {{variety of}} {{assessment}} tools {{have become more}} prevalent in introductory physics courses {{as a way to}} enhance and assess conceptual learning. At the interface of modern physics and quantum mechanics, these tools are not presently as widely used. The Modern Physics course at American University presents an ideal opportunity for conceptual assessment given its somewhat atypical student composition. In this study both qualitative and quantitative measures of student understanding of a key concept in modern physics, the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> are utilized. As a quantitative overall baseline for gain, the Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey (QPCS) was implemented [1]. A set of questions on the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> that required both a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> were then given on both the midterm and final exams. The results of the QPCS, and a subset of QPCS questions solely on the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect,</b> are statistically compared to the more focused approach for assessing the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> Additionally, correlations between subsets of the student population and their gains on the various assessments were investigated. The results from these assessment methods will be discussed in the larger context of how assessment measures can be maximized to enhance student understanding in a modern physics course. In particular this study shows how there may be a correlation between a student’s background preparation, and their gain on different types of assessments...|$|R

40|$|According to {{an entropy}} {{approach}} and by reviewing {{the similarity between}} laws characterizing the flow of heat and electric charges, electric charges were defined as electromagnetic waves that possess an electrical potential or simply as ionized photons. Accordingly, the flow of electrons {{was defined as a}} simultaneous flow of particulate energy and wave energy. Such definitions led to clear the confusions of duality properties of electrons and light waves, conflicts in the SI system of units and to explain the difference between the calculated drift speed of electrons and the speed of electricity or charges in conductors. However, Einstein considered the electron to be a negative charge of unknown nature during his analysis of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> Einstein presented his hypothesis that light may behave as a particle to find a plausible explanation of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> He found the measured cutoff frequency of light below which light might not eject electrons from metal-surfaces in photocells regardless of how much light is shone on the surface as a proof of truth of his hypothesis. Such frequency may be explained also, according to the previously introduced definitions, as the minimum energy quanta that may gain a quantized potential in photocells. This explanation may find plausible explanations of the found measurements of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> for different metal surfaces, stopping voltages into photocells and the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> of X-rays. Einstein’s hypothesis of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> failed to find plausible explanations of such measurement results.
