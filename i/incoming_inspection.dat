40|$|Abstract Background Filamentous fungi are {{versatile}} cell {{factories and}} widely {{used for the}} production of antibiotics, organic acids, enzymes and other industrially relevant compounds at large scale. As a fact, industrial production processes employing filamentous fungi are commonly based on complex raw materials. However, considerable lot-to-lot variability of complex media ingredients not only demands for exhaustive <b>incoming</b> components <b>inspection</b> and quality control, but unavoidably affects process stability and performance. Thus, switching bioprocesses from complex to defined media is highly desirable. Results This study presents a strategy for strain characterization of filamentous fungi on partly complex media using redundant mass balancing techniques. Applying the suggested method, interdependencies between specific biomass and side-product formation rates, production of fructooligosaccharides, specific complex media component uptake rates and fungal strains were revealed. A 2 -fold increase of the overall penicillin space time yield and a 3 -fold increase in the maximum specific penicillin formation rate were reached in defined media compared to complex media. Conclusions The newly developed methodology enabled fast characterization of two different industrial Penicillium chrysogenum candidate strains on complex media based on specific complex media component uptake kinetics and identification of the most promising strain for switching the process from complex to defined conditions. Characterization at different complex/defined media ratios using {{only a limited number of}} analytical methods allowed maximizing the overall industrial objectives of increasing both, method throughput and the generation of scientific process understanding. </p...|$|R

40|$|It is {{imperative}} for all manufacturing setups {{to have a}} structured system and culture of quality control to maintain product performance and customer satisfaction. An integral part of this system is to check <b>incoming</b> parts through <b>inspection</b> {{and to ensure that}} suppliers uphold the same standards of quality. As a company scales up, quality failures become costlier and at the same time, use of data and statistics presents opportunities for immense savings. NVBOTS is a 3 D Printer manufacturing startup that is currently at the juncture of ramping up its production volume. The skeleton of its product is, in effect, a three axis frame with sourced machined components that build it up. In this thesis, one axis was taken up as a case study to develop a framework for analysing incoming parts. The proposed framework has a logical progression starting with analysis of part features and inspection procedure followed by a study of existing supplier capability and subsequent correlation of part geometry to final frame geometry. To perform this analysis, past Co-ordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) data from measurement of incoming parts was compiled and used. This document also makes some actionable recommendations based on the output of the framework. These include use of software packages that can help facilitate and speed up the use of this framework through efficient data logging and real time analysis. Subsequently, future use of statistical tolerancing is suggested to enhance manufacturability while reducing costs and finally, certain additions of platform features to the product were suggested to make full use network effects as the organization scales up. by Rahul Chawla.

40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{improvements in}} metal casting processes by reducing scrap {{and reducing the}} cost of production, due to scrap reduction from investment casting and yield improvement offered by lost foam casting as compared to no-bake or green sand molding. The objectives for the investment casting portion of the subtask are to improve knowledge of fracture toughness of mold shells and the sources of strength limiting flaws and to understand the effects of wax reclamation procedures on wax properties. Applying 'clean steel' approaches to pouring technology and cleanliness in investment casting of steel are anticipated to improve <b>incoming</b> materials <b>inspection</b> procedures as they affect the microstructure and toughness of the shell. This project focused on two areas of study {{in the production of}} steel castings to reduce scrap and save energy: (1) Reducing the amount of shell cracking in investment cast steel production; (2) Investigate the potential of lost foam steel casting The basic findings regarding investment casting shell cracking were: (1) In the case of post pouring cracking, this could be related to phase changes in silica upon cooling and could be delayed by pouring arrangement strategies that maintained the shell surface at temperature for longer time. Employing this delay resulted in less adherent oxidation of castings since the casting was cooler at the time o fair exposure. (2) A model for heat transfer through water saturated shell materials under steam pressure was developed. (3) Initial modeling result of autoclave de-waxing indicated the higher pressure and temperature in the autoclave would impose a steeper temperature gradient on the wax pattern, causing some melt flow prior to bulk expansion and decreasing the stress on the green shell. Basic findings regarding lost foam casting of steel at atmospheric pressure: (1) EPS foam generally decomposes by the collapse mode in steel casting. (2) There is an accumulation of carbon pick-up {{at the end of the}} casting opposite the gate. (3) It is recommended that lost foam castings in steel be gated for a quiescent fill in an empty cavity mold to prevent foam occlusion defects from the collapse mode. The energy benefit is primarily in yield savings and lower casting weight per function due to elimination of draft and parting lines for the larger lost foam castings. For the smaller investment casting, scrap losses due to shell cracking will be reduced. Both of these effects will reduce the metal melted per good ton of castings. There will also be less machine stock required per casting which is a yield savings and a small additional energy savings in machining. Downstream savings will come from heavy truck and railroad applications. Application of these processes to heavy truck castings will lighten the heavy truck fleet by about ten pounds per truck. Using ten years to achieve full penetration of the truck fleet at linear rate this will result in a fuel savings of 131 trillion BTU over ten years...|$|R
40|$|Summary The main {{objectives}} of the present work were focused on method development and application of vibrational spectroscopy (IRS, NIRS and Raman-S) for the quality evaluation of selected plant raw materials, in process control of the technological extraction and in processing of these raw materials. In this context, three taxonomically very different model organisms, fennel, sage and yew were investigated. Using the example of fennel showed that FTIR spectroscopic techniques discriminated the different chemotypes of fennel as well as sweet and bitter fennel according to Pharmacopoeia specifications. This discrimination succeeded for the first time, both on individual fruits using ATR-FTIR, {{as well as with}} larger sample weights by NIRS. Raman spectroscopy was successful for discrimination of extracts (CCl 4) of fennel fruits. Besides, a new, not previously described fennel chemotype was found. This contains a high level of -asarone and because of its toxicity this chemotype is not in use as a drug. Nevertheless, in literature -asarone is described to possess antifungal and allelopathic properties and extracts of this chemotype could therefore be applied as bio-pesticides, which however should be evaluated in further studies. Because of the relatively high content of essential oil components (EOCs) in drugs a rapid analysis of EOCs content and composition directly on the dried raw material using ATR-FTIR could be developed. In addition to the total content of EOCs, also predictive models for the major EOCs of good to very good quality could be established. Also, a rapid identification of dried sage leaves at different growth stages (young leaves of the sizes up to 15 / 30 mm calculated on dry weight) and harvest time (main differences are in the composition of vegetable matrix) could be done by principal component analysis. These non-destructive procedures take, according to the developed protocol, only a few minutes and do not require laborious sample preparation. These are good prerequisites to carry out this method also on intact fresh leaves, which will be an essential part of further investigations. In the third work package the possibilities and limitations of the use of IR and Raman spectroscopy for routine quality control in process-related analytics in the technological processing of plant raw materials and extracts have been extensively studied on the basis of yew needles. The very low concentration of the valuable target substance 10 -deacetylbaccatin III (DAB) in the plant raw material, the yew needles, is below the detection limit of the spectroscopic techniques used here and therefore did not allow a direct quantification of DAB. Using NIRS, diverse technological parameters with relevance for the extraction process, such as residual moisture and purity of the material and botanical contamination, were successfully determined and corresponding prediction models were developed. These are significant for preparing the drug for extraction and calculating of required amount of solvents, extraction time at various stages etc. Thus especially NIRS was found to be a powerful tool in the <b>incoming</b> goods <b>inspection</b> in the quality control of herbal raw material and an improvement the procedure, which is very often based only on visual inspections. In the next stages of the process, e. g., during different extraction stages (percolation, maceration), valid predictive models for the determination of water content (ATR-FTIR) and 10 -DAB concentration (RS) in extracts have been developed by means of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy and finally the enrichment of the target component tracked through the process...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre textile {{semi-finished}} products are playing {{an important role}} {{for the production of}} carbon fibre reinforced plastics via (liquid) resin infusion processes, e. g. in aircraft manufacturing and other industrial applications. The focus of the present work is on multiaxial warp knitted fabrics, also called non-crimp fabrics (NCF), a form of textile with the reinforcement fibres placed in multiple (mostly 2 - 4) layers upon each other, held together by a knitting yarn pattern. An assessment methodology is presented, comprising seven test methods, of which there are four on the processability of the NCF-textiles in part manufacturing and three to characterize the textile quality aspects related to laminate mechanical properties. For each of these test methods, approaches are explained to derive quantifiable values from the results to make the textile characteristics of different materials comparable. With regard to processability, the deformation or drape behaviour of the multiaxial fabrics and the alteration in textile quality by such processes are predominantly addressed. For this purpose, a test method for bulk and compaction characteristics is described as well as two test methods to characterize the in-plane (shear) deformation behaviour, one for biaxial and another for tri- and quadraxial warp-knitted fabrics. From the application of the test methods, results on the identification of the ply structure and textile production parameters governing this deformation behaviour are also presented. The area of processability is completed with a simple test on the infuseablity of the NCF with resin. For assessment of textile quality, methods to quantify the fibre angle deviations, both in and perpendicular to the textile plane are presented, as well as a method to assess the influences of the knitting yarn induced ply distortions. All tests can already be performed on the dry textile, before laminate specimen manufacturing and preparation. Concerning the laminate mechanical properties, examinations are made as to how the different structures of the dry textile are transferred into laminate structures. Furthermore, different approaches or theoretical models are applied to evaluate their influence on the compression strength of those laminates. The derived results are compared to real compression test data. The methods presented in this work enable to obtain a better comprehension of the correlations in NCF textiles and composites manufactured thereof. Thus, they allow a more structured and objective assessment of new NCF {{semi-finished products}} and the identification of weak points early in the selection process, to make a more precise and efficient material development possible. Furthermore, the methods can be used to ensure stable material properties in serial production, for instance during <b>incoming</b> / outgoing <b>inspections...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most high-efficiency {{solar cells}} are {{fabricated}} from monocrystalline Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) wafers because the material quality {{is higher than}} multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers. However, the material study {{presented in this paper}} reveals strong variations in the material quality of commercially available Cz-Si wafers, leading to a loss in solar cell efficiency of 4 % absolute. The reason for this is the presence of defects, which appear as dark rings in photoluminescence (PL) images of the finished solar cells. It is shown that these efficiency-limiting defects originate from oxygen precipitation during emitter diffusion. It is demonstrated that an <b>incoming</b> <b>inspection</b> in the as-cut state is difficult, as strong ring structures in as-cut wafers turn out to originate most often from thermal donors.

40|$|The quality {{assessment}} of multi-crystalline and high-performance multi-crystalline silicon wafers during <b>incoming</b> <b>inspection</b> of solar cell production requires a reproducible {{description of the}} relevant material defects and a classification scheme that is capable to rate as-cut wafers from unknown manufacturers. Both needs are addressed in this work. We introduce an image processing framework that allows {{the various types of}} crystallization-related defects visible in photoluminescence images to be detected quantitatively and thus enables a complete wafer description in terms of defects. The importance of different features within this defect characteristic is weighted by predicting the open-circuit voltage of solar cells with aluminum back-surface field as well as passivated emitter and rear cells with a stepwise extension of the model. The resulting robust classification scheme is successfully evaluated on a set of 7500 wafers, which represents the whole spectrum of material types and qualities that are currently available at the market. A comparison of defect signatures in high-performance multi-crystalline and standard multi-crystalline silicon materials underlines the relevance of additional features. As a result of this paper, we show that a regularized version of multi-linear regression models for quality prediction can optimize simpler linear models by adding selected features to the defect characteristic leading to mean absolute prediction errors of 2. 2 [*]mV for solar cells with aluminum back-surface field and 2. 9 [*]mV for passivated emitter and rear cells solar cells in a true blind test...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{availability}} and optimal utilization of medical equipment {{is important for}} {{improving the quality of}} health services. Significant investments are made for the purchase, maintenance and repair of medical equipment. Inadequate management of these equipment will result in financial losses and deprive the public of the intended benefits. This analysis is based on the conceptual framework drawn from the WHO recommended- lifecycle of medical equipment. AIMS: (1) To identify the problems in different stages of the life cycle. (2) To assess its financial implications and effect on service delivery. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Analysis of secondary data from the latest Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Reports for the states in India. The study variables were category of equipment, financial implications and problems in the stages of life cycle. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Calculation of proportions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A total of forty instances mentioning problems in {{the first phase of the}} life cycle of medical equipment were noted in 12 state reports. The equipment from the radiology department (15), equipment in the wards (5), laboratory (3) and operation theatres (4) were the ones most frequently implicated. In a majority of cases the financial implications amounted to twenty-five lakhs. The financial implications were in the form of extra expenditure, unfruitful expenditure or locking of funds. In 25 cases the equipment could not be put to use because of non-availability of trained staff and inadequate infrastructural support. Careful procurement, <b>incoming</b> <b>inspection,</b> successful installation and synchronization of qualified trained staff and infrastructural support will ensure timely onset of use of the equipment...|$|E
40|$|Controlling the {{assembly}} process starts when raw materials arrive in receiving. Proper handling of ESD devices {{is well documented}} with required grounding points and heal straps the norm in many facilities. Yet this {{is only one of}} the key issues we face in {{the assembly}} process. The one area most frequently ignored is the impact of humidity on both components and bare boards. Although many, if not most, of the manufacturing facilities are climate controlled, there are a number of instances where the floor-clock is accidently started when moisture barrier bags (MBB) are opened during <b>incoming</b> <b>inspection.</b> Even though the MBB may be resealed, the clock is not officially paused reducing the effective life of the moisture sensitive devices (MSD’s) prior to assembly. Bare boards are not subject to the same standards that MSD’s face. While the IPC D- 35 subcommittee has a working draft of IPC- 1601, Printed Board Handling and Storage Guidelines (1 st working draft – April 9, 2009), there currently is no standard for monitoring and controlling the exposure of boards to moisture prior to the assembly process. We are effectively left on our own to monitor and remediate any negative effects humidity may have on these raw materials. This paper deals with methods of handling and storing MSD’s and bare boards in a desiccant based, selfregenerating cabinet that can be used to pause and at times reset the floor-clock based on J-STD- 033 B 01 and prevent moisture related bare-board errors during the assembly process prior to and following the formalization of the standards...|$|E
