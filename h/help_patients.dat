5|$|The Grosvenor Sanatorium {{opened in}} 1915 to <b>help</b> <b>patients</b> {{suffering}} from tuberculosis, and could cater for 110 male patients, and 78 female. The philosopher Simone Weil lived in Ashford after escaping from France during World War II. She {{felt guilty about}} leaving French people behind in suffering and did not eat well. She subsequently contracted tuberculosis and {{was moved to the}} sanatorium where she died in 1943. A section of the old Ashford Bypass is now named Simone Weil Avenue, while the sanatorium subsequently became the Ashford Police Training Centre.|$|E

Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.|$|E

5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that {{plays a role in}} the inflammation seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not <b>help</b> <b>patients</b> survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E

50|$|Physiotherapy {{includes}} <b>helping</b> <b>patients</b> {{recover the}} ability of physical actions which includes: balance retraining, gait analysis and transfer training, neuromuscular retraining, orthotics consultations, and aqua therapy. Occupational therapy <b>helps</b> <b>patients</b> in activities of daily living. Some of these include: home management and safety training, cognitive retraining for memory, attention, processing, and executive functions. It may also include neuro-muscular strengthening and training, and visual perceptual skill development. Speech-Language Pathologists have begun to provide cognitive rehabilitation as well with goals that emphasize instruction in life-changes that facilitate increased independence. Speech and language therapy includes assisting patients with communication issues. Psychology includes <b>helping</b> <b>patients</b> deal with their changed, often dramatically so, circumstances especially coping to a changed identity of self {{as a result of}} adaptions and changes necessitated by brain injury.|$|R

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often need a long term, coordinated and a multidisciplinary team approach towards management of individual patients.

40|$|The {{official}} {{guidelines in}} health care state that a more severely ill patient should be prioritized over a less severely ill patient, {{but it is still}} debatable how much more care and resources should be allocated to this patient.

This is done through a web survey, where the social values people hold for <b>helping</b> <b>patients</b> with different levels of severity of illness are obtained. Severity of illness is measured both in terms of pain and immobility, and respondents’ values are investigated through two different types of perspectives; a patient’s perspective and a decision-maker’s perspective. The results show that individuals are equally risk averse as inequality averse against high levels of pain and immobility, and that <b>helping</b> <b>patients</b> with a severe condition is valued twice as much as <b>helping</b> <b>patients</b> with a less severe condition...|$|R
