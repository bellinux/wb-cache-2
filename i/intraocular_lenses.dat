40|$|Introduction: Spontaneous {{dislocation}} of <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> with bag is rare. Methods: We {{report a}} case of a 56 -year-old male who presented with spontaneous anterior dislocation of an in-the-bag <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> after manual small incision cataract surgery. He had undergone manual small incision cataract surgery with foldable acrylic <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> implantation, and 18 months after cataract surgery ND: YAG capsulotomy with uneventful post capsulotomy follow-up. 17 months after capsulotomy, the patient presented with sudden decrease of vision.

2500|$|Posterior capsular opacification, {{also known}} as after-cataract, is a {{condition}} in which months or years after successful cataract surgery, vision deteriorates or problems with glare and light scattering recur, usually due to thickening of the back or posterior capsule surrounding the implanted lens, so-called 'posterior lens capsule opacification'. [...] Growth of natural lens cells remaining after the natural lens was removed may be the cause, and the younger the patient, the greater the chance of this occurring. [...] Management involves cutting a small, circular area in the posterior capsule with targeted beams of energy from a laser, called [...] capsulotomy, after the type of laser used. [...] The laser can be aimed very accurately, and the small part of the capsule which is cut falls harmlessly {{to the bottom of the}} inside of the eye. [...] This procedure leaves sufficient capsule to hold the lens in place, but removes enough to allow light to pass directly through to the retina. [...] Serious side effects are rare. Posterior capsular opacification is common and occurs following up to one in four operations, but these rates are decreasing following the introduction of modern <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> together with a better understanding of the causes.|$|E

METHODS: This prospective randomized bilateral double-masked clinical study included 52 patients with visually significant bilateral cataracts divided in two groups; 25 patients (50 eyes) received aspherical <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> {{in one eye}} and spherical <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> in the fellow eye; and 27 patients (54 eyes) received ultraviolet and blue light filter (yellow tinted) IOL implantation in one eye and acrylic ultraviolet filter IOL in the fellow eye. The primary outcome measures were contrast sensitivity and blue-on-yellow perimetry values (mean deviation [MD] and pattern standard deviation [PSD]) investigated two years after surgery. The results were compared intra-individually. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant between-group (aspherical and spherical <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens)</b> difference in contrast sensitivity under photopic conditions at 12 cycles per degree and under mesopic conditions at all spatial frequencies.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{report a}} small series of {{pediatric}} patients with ectopia lentis that underwent limbal-approach lensectomy and vitrectomy and scleral-fixated <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> implantation and {{to review the}} literature on the topic of surgical management of ectopia lentis. MethodA retrospective review of 13 eyes of seven patients that underwent lensectomy, vitrectomy, and scleral-fixated <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> implantation and a review of the ophthalmic literature. ResultsIn our series, the average age at surgery was 70. 3 ± 13. 8 months and the average length of follow-up was 23. 8 ± 5. 9 months. The mean pre-operative visual acuity was 0. 86 ± 0. 17 which improved to 0. 23 ± 0. 09 post-operatively (p< 0. 001). No complications were encountered in our series. A review of the literature found that amblyopia was the biggest vision-limiting factor. In general, the literature suggested that a higher percentage of eyes that were left aphakic achieved better vision than those implanted with a scleral-fixated <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens.</b> However, there may be selection bias in that more eyes receiving an <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> may have pre-existing amblyopia. The complication rates for lensectomy or scleral-fixated <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> implantation were low in the literature. In the latter group, suture breakage and resultant <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> dislocation is a worrisome late complication. ConclusionSurgical intervention for ectopia lentis via vitrectomy techniques yields good result. In cases of unilateral aphakia or in settings where compliance with aphakic refractive correction is questionable and amblyopia is a constant threat, scleral-fixated <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> implantation is highly encouraged.
