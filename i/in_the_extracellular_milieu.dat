40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{are known}} to secrete exosomes that {{transfer}} membrane proteins, like major histocompatibility complex class II, to other DCs. Intercellular transfer of membrane proteins is also observed during cognate interactions between DCs and CD 4 (+) T cells. The acquired proteins are functional and {{play a role in}} regulation of immune responses. How membrane protein transfer is achieved and regulated is unclear. Here we show that T cells can recruit major histocompatibility complex class II-containing DC exosomes secreted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu</b> during cognate DC-T-cell interactions. Recruitment of these exosomes required T-cell activation and was dependent on leukocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) rather than on T-cell receptor specificity. Indeed, inducing a high-affinity state of LFA- 1 on resting T cells was sufficient to provoke exosome binding. These results imply that DC exosomes secreted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu</b> during cognate T-cell-DC interactions are targeted to T cells activated in that microenvironment...|$|E

Indeed, NE-mediated activity can repress flagellin transcription in P. aeruginosa, which facilitates biofilm formation [81]. Interestingly, NE-produced fragments of CXCR 1 were identified as potential contributors to epithelial activation and release of IL- 8 in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2)-dependent manner [82], thus creating a pathological feedback loop of neutrophil recruitment, NE release, CXCR 1 cleavage on epithelial cells, and further neutrophil recruitment. Additional contributions to this positive feedback loop come from the NE-mediated transcriptional upregulation of IL- 8 via MyD 88 /IRAK/TRAF- 6 [83] and direct NE-mediated processing of IL- 8 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu</b> [84]. Indeed, IL- 8 is produced as a 99 -amino acid precursor protein which is proteolytically cleaved at its N-terminus before release [85]. Once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu,</b> IL- 8 can be further processed by extracellular proteases, such as NE, leading to different bioactive forms that vary from 77 to 69 amino acids in length, with the 72 -amino acid form being the most potent [84]. In vitro studies also suggest that IL- 8 can be ultimately degraded in an NE-dependent manner over time [86] which could serve to balance out the induction of IL- 8 production and its post-transcriptional activation by NE.|$|E

PTPRG {{was identified as a}} candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by differential gene profiling of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic NPC chromosome 3 microcell hybrids (MCH). Down-regulation of this gene was found in tumor segregants when compared with their corresponding tumor-suppressive MCHs, as well as in NPC cell lines and tumor biopsies. Promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity were found to be important mechanisms contributing to PTPRG silencing. PTPRG overexpression in NPC cell lines induces growth suppression and reduced anchorage-independent growth in vitro. This is the first study to use a tetracycline-responsive vector expression system to study PTPRG stable transfectants.

40|$|Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{the primary}} agent of tuberculosis, must acquire iron from the host to cause infection.

Exochelins comprise a family of molecules whose most abundant species range in mass from 744 to 800 Da <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neutral Fe(3 +) -loaded state. The molecules form two 14 -Da-increment series, one saturated and the other unsaturated, with the increments reflecting different numbers of CH 2 groups on a side chain.

Based on a comparison of their tandem mass spectra, exochelins share a common core structure with mycobactins. However, exochelins are smaller than mycobactins due to a shorter alkyl side chain, and the side chain of exochelins terminates in a methyl ester.

Wdnm 1 -like is a novel 6. 8 -kDa protein, and Western blot analysis reveals secretion into culture media. Wdnm 1 -like transcript is selectively expressed in adipose tissue and liver and is enriched ∼ 500 -fold in white adipose depots vs. brown. Cellular fractionation of WAT demonstrates Wdnm 1 -like transcript expression is restricted to the adipocyte population. Studies in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes, an in vitro model of white adipogenesis, indicate Wdnm 1 -like transcript increases within 6 h of adipogenic induction with an ∼ 17, 000 -fold increase by day 7. Dramatic upregulation of Wdnm 1 -like also accompanies white adipogenesis of ScAP- 23 preadipocytes and primary preadipocytes. TNF-α treatment of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes increased Wdnm 1 -like transcript level 2. 4 -fold and was attenuated by pretreatment with the p 38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB 203580.

40|$|Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane {{proteins}} {{that provide a}} bi-directional link between the cell’s internal biological mechanisms and <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> environment. During inside-out signalling, intracellular messages converge on the integrin cytoplasmic domain to induce a conformational change. This is transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> domain where it results in an alteration in affinity for integrin ligands such as fibronectin and laminin. <b>In</b> this way <b>the</b> cell has developed the ability to modulate the critical functions of adhesion and cell movement. <b>In</b> outside-in signalling, <b>the</b> integrin performs a more complex function than simple adhesion; upon binding to ligand, <b>the</b> integrin <b>extracellular</b> domain undergoes a conformational change which is transmitted to the cytoplasmic domain. This alters the integrin’s cytoplasmic domain affinity for intracellular signalling proteins and results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> activation of intracellular second messenger pathways. <b>In</b> this way, <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu</b> is able to influence intracellular signalling including those involved in apoptosis. This thesis demonstrates data which provide original insights into bi-directional integrin signalling: Inside-out signalling: Constitutively active Notch 1 increases β 3 -integrin affinity and abrogates Hras-mediated integrin suppression without increasing expression of β 3 - integrin. Dominant-Negative Rras blocks Notch-mediated integrin activation and Notch 1 -mediated reversal of Hras and Raf-mediated integrin suppression and this is independent of erk phosphorylation. Notch 1 induces Rras activation. Functional adhesion assays confirm that Notch 1 IC increases K 562 adhesion in a β 1 -integrin dependent manner and this is abrogated by Dominant-Negative Rras. This data supports a mechanism in which Notch 1 increases integrin affinity via activation of Rras. Outside-in signalling: Evidence is presented demonstrating that extracellular matrix proteins, laminin and fibronectin, activate β 1 -integrins to protect SCLC cells against the apoptotic effects of etoposide and ionizing radiation via PI 3 Kinase activation. This occurs in two ways: 1) PI 3 Kinase-dependent β 1 -integrin signalling resulting in phosphorylation of Bad and reduced caspase- 9 cleavage and 2) a β 1 -integrinmediated over-riding of etoposide and radiotherapy-induced cell cycle S phase delay and G 2 /M arrest. β 1 -integrin-mediated outside-in survival signalling was investigated further <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vivo setting; MatrigelTM, a basement membrane product rich in extracellular matrix proteins, promoted SCLC xenograft survival and growth in a β 1 -integrin and tyrosine kinase-dependent manner.

At the cellular/molecular level, structural modifications of neural circuits are finely regulated by intrinsic neuronal properties and growth-regulatory cues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu.</b> Recently, it has become clear that stimuli coming from the external world, which comprise sensory inflow, motor activity, cognitive elaboration or social interaction, not only provide the involved neurons with instructive information needed to shape connection patterns to sustain adaptive function, but also exert a powerful influence on intrinsic and extrinsic growth-related mechanisms, so to create permissive conditions for neuritic remodelling. Here, we present an overview of recent findings concerning the effects of experience on molecular mechanisms underlying CNS structural plasticity, both in physiological conditions and after damage, with particular focus on activity-dependent modulation of growth-regulatory genes and epigenetic modifications...|$|E
40|$|During the {{aggregation}} {{phase of}} their life cycle, Dictyo-stelium discoideum amoebae {{communicate with each other}} by traveling waves of cyclic AMP. These waves are generated by an interplay between random diffusion of cyclic AMP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu</b> and the signal-reception/signal-relaying capabilities of individual amoebae. Kinetic properties of the enzymes, transport proteins and cell-surface receptor proteins involved in the cyclic AMP signaling system have been painstakingly worked out over the past fifteen years in many labora-tories. Recently Martiel & Goldbeter (1987) incorpor-ated this biochemical information into a unified math-ematical model of communication among Dictyostelium amoebae. Numerical simulations of the mathematical model, carried out by Tyson et al. (1989), agree in quantitative detail with experimental observations of cyclic AMP traveling waves in Dictyostelium cultures. Such mathematical modeling and numerical experimen-tation provide a necessary link between detailed studies of the molecular control mechanism and experimental observations of the intact developmental system...|$|E
40|$|The yeast vacuolar {{membrane}} H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is {{the first}} member of "vacuolar type" ATPase family that has been successively identified in various endocytic and exocytic membrane compartments of eukaryotic cells. The V-ATPase is a multisubunit complex composed of an integral membrane Vo sector and a peripherally associated V 1 sector, the two of which are joined together with the V 1 -Vo bridging component. Upon ATP hydorolysis, the enzyme induces an inward current of 100 pA and generates the proton motive force of 180 mV, interior acidic and inside positive, across the vacuolar membrane. The V-ATPase family performs diverse cellular functions and maintains pH and cation homeostasis in the lumens of organelles, in the cytosol and even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu.</b> The importance of being acid in these cellular compartments has been highlighted in various cellular events such as vegetative growth, cell transformation, differentiation, metamorphosis and apoptosis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{addition}} of a few amino acids to the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of the mature portion of the heat-labile enterotoxin chain B (LTB) of Escherichia coli on protein export, secretion and assembly were investigated. In E. coli, LTB (secretory protein) {{with or without the}} extension at the N- or C-terminus accumulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periplasmic fraction. For Vibrio cholerae, LTB with the extension at the C-terminus was exported to the periplasm followed by secretion to <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu.</b> However, LTB with the N-terminus extension was exported to the periplasm only. Our findings suggest that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of V. cholerae, the N-terminus of the mature LTB {{plays an important role in}} its secretion to <b>the</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>milieu...</b>|$|R
