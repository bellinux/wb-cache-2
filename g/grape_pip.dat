40|$|In ancient DNA (aDNA) research, {{evolutionary}} and archaeological {{questions are}} often investigated using the genomic sequences of organelles: mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA. Organellar genomes {{are found in}} multiple copies per living cell, increasing their chance of recovery from archaeological samples, and are inherited from one parent without genetic recombination, simplifying analyses. While mitochondrial genomes have {{played a key role}} in many mammalian aDNA projects, including research focused on prehistoric humans and extinct hominins, it is unclear how useful plant chloroplast genomes (plastomes) may be at elucidating questions related to plant evolution, crop domestication, and the prehistoric movement of botanical products through trade and migration. Such analyses are particularly challenging for plant species whose genomes have highly repetitive sequences and that undergo frequent genomic reorganization, notably species with high retrotransposon activity. To address this question, we explored the research potential of the grape (Vitis vinifera L.) plastome using targeted-enrichment methods and high-throughput DNA sequencing on a collection of archaeological <b>grape</b> <b>pip</b> and vine specimens from sites across Eurasia dating ca. 4000 BCE- 1500 CE. We demonstrate that due to unprecedented numbers of sequence insertions into the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, the grape plastome provides limited intraspecific phylogenetic resolution. Nonetheless, we were able to assign archaeological specimens in the Italian peninsula, Sardinia, UK, and Armenia from pre-Roman to medieval times as belonging to all three major chlorotypes A, C, and D found in modern varieties of Western Europe. Analysis of nuclear genomic DNA from these samples reveals a much greater potential for understanding ancient viticulture, including domestication events, genetic introgression from local wild populations, and the origins and histories of varietal lineage...|$|E

40|$|Grapevine (Vitis vinifera), one of {{the most}} {{important}} fruit species in the Classical Mediterranean world, is thought to have been domesticated first in South-Western Asia, during the Neolithic. However, the domestication process remains largely unknown. Crucial unanswered questions concern the duration of the process (rapid or slow?) and the related geographical area (single or multiple-origins?). Seeds from domesticated grapevine and from its wild ancestor are reported to differ according to shape. Our work aims, first, to confirm this difference and secondly to identify the extent of domestication in the grapes cultivated by Romans in Southern France during the period 50 BCE– 500 CE. We had the opportunity to analyze uncharred waterlogged <b>grape</b> <b>pips</b> from 17 archaeological sites. Based on an extended reference sample of modern wild grapevines and cultivars our work shows that both subspecies can be discriminated using simple measurements. The elongation gradient of the pip’s body and stalk may be regarded as an indicator of the strength of the selection pressures undergone by domesticated grapes. Grapevines cultivated during the Roman period included a mix of morphotypes comprising wild, intermediate and moderately selected domesticated forms. Our data point to a relative shift towards more selected types during the Roman period. Domestication of the grapevine appears to have been a slow process. This coul...|$|R

Phylogenies built using these genetic markers indicate that three pips from the Roman site of Gasquinoy are close to modern wild grapevines and/or the female group, while the only medieval pip from Colletière is hermaphrodite and close to the modern cultivated group.

Eventually the area became a Roman province first known as Provincia and later Gallia Narbonensis.The early Greek settlers brought a distinctly Mediterranean outlook to viticulture in Gaul. To their understanding, vines grew best in the same climate and area that would support olive and fig trees, therefore most of the early vineyard planting was in the warm, Mediterranean coastal areas. In 7 BC, the Greek geographer Strabo noted that the areas around Massilia and Narbo could produce the same fruits as Italy but the rest of Gaul further north could not support the olive, fig or vine. Under Roman rule, in the century and a half BC, the majority of the wine consumed in the area was required by law to be Italian in origin, as the distribution of fragments of wine amphorae found throughout Gaul after about 100 BC, especially along the coasts and rivers, suggests: some of the earliest amphorae, from the 2nd century BC, bear Iberian shipper's marks, indicating that distribution of wine predated conquest. It wasn't till the first century AD that there was record of Gaul's wine being of any note or renown. In his Natural History (book xiv), Pliny the Elder noted that in the region near Vienna (modern day Vienne in the Rhone wine region), the Allobroges produced a resinated wine that was held in esteem and commanded a high market price.|$|R

40|$|Phenolic {{residues}} which {{accumulate in}} the environment {{as a result of}} agro-industrial practices has resulted in the need to find and use Eco-Friendly techniques, rather than the traditional methods of burning or burying this kind of waste. Bioremediation and bioconversion are attractive alternatives using whole cell or enzyme-based systems. The aims of this project were to isolate and uses thermophilic Actinomycetes, which produce thermo-tolerant oxidoreductase enzymes, which can be used to bioconvert a model industrial phenolic waste commonly genersated in the wine-making industry of South Africa. Current research in bioconversion and bioremediation focuses on mesophilic microbes in that their enzymes can catalyse reactions at higher temperatures without affecting its activity and lower contamination levels. Three novel Actinomycete isolates were isolated (RU-A 0 l, RU-A 03 and RU-A 06) from a compost site and characterized using a combination of conventional identification techniques and 16 S rDNA methodology to identity the three isolates. All three isolates belong to the Streptomyces clade. In addition, five known Actinomycetes were selected from an internation culture collection and also screened for oxidoreductase activity in comparision to the three novel isolates. Although the five isolates were selected based on their ability to produce oxidoreductase enzymes, unexpectedly, no activity was detected. Screening assays for peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and laccase on RU-AO 1, RU-A 03 and RU-A 06, showed that all three isolated produced peroxidases and peroxidases but no laccase. Substrate specificity studies revealed that the most suitable substrates to determine peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activity on these isolates were catechol for polyphenol oxidase, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol for peroxidases and veratryl alcohol for lignin peroxidases. Previous studies have indicated that peroxidases and polyphenol oxidases are produced in Actinomycetes during the primary stage of growth. This was the case with RU-AOI, RU-A 03 and RU-A 06. Growth rates were higher that other Actinomycetes, with maxImum biomass being reached at 36 hours for the isolates RU-AOI and RU-A 06 and 48 hours for isolate RUA 03. pH studies showed that the three isolates were adaptable and could grow over a broad pH range. Catabolism studies of phenolic model compounds showed that the three isolates were capable of catabolizing the model phenolic compounds within a period of 24 hours. Further studies were carried out to determine the effect of these microbes and their enzymes in whole cell and enzyme-based systems on a model phenolic waste, graoe waste consisting of compressed <b>grape</b> skins, <b>pips</b> and stalks. Whole cell studies showed that the isolates were capable of bioconverting the waste at a maximum concentration of 30 % grape waste (vol:vol). Peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activity increased indicating induction of these enzymes in the presence of phenolic compounds, with a maximum increase of up to 15. 9 fold increase in extracellular lignin peroxidase activity in RU-AO 1. HPLC and phenolic determination assays indicated that bioconversion of the phenolic grape waste had occurred {{in the presence of the}} three isolates. Attempts were made to isolate and identify a peroxidase or phenol oxidase gene from one the isolates. As bacteria, Actinomycetes are amendable to gene manipulation making them suitable candidates for methods such as site directed evolution in comparison to fungi. Two clones were selected for sequencing based on positive activity results when assayed for peroxidase activity. However the resultant sequences did not identify a functional gene sequence. Southern Blotting was then carried out to determine the nature of the peroxidase gene. Previous studies have been focused on the catalase-peroxidase gene (CalC gene) found Actinomycetes and other bacteria. A probe was developed from the CalC gene. No hybridization occurred with any of the enzyme restricted DNA from the three isolates. The implications of these results are that the peroxidase genets in the three isolates are in fact lignin peroxidase in nature. This project has the potential in the bioconversion of phenolic wastes and is the first description of the use of thermophilic Actinomycetes in the bioconversion of an industrial phenolic waste...|$|R
