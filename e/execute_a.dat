5|$|Recognising {{that his}} force {{was at a}} disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland's group {{showed no signs of}} movement. Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for {{personal}} reasons.

5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down.

5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E

After a series of heavy battles, he launched a counterattack on 21 September that cut off the two Soviet armies in the salient. Fighting continued throughout October.
