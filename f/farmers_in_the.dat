5|$|The {{downward}} spiral {{of the economy}} has been attributed mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> controversial land confiscations of 2000.

5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affected area. A role of zduhaći, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} caused defections and {{divisions in}} the Republican party; many <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, as {{it would make it}} easier to repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.|$|E

Starting in 1935, 50,000 acre-feet (about 61.7 million m³) were made available this way.|$|E

5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats.

5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E
5|$|By late 1916, most {{settlers}} in the colony who were inclined to volunteer had already done so. To free up white manpower, some suggested the recruitment of older men for local service so more of the younger volunteers could go overseas. In 1917, the Chartered Company set up a committee to consider the question of national defence both {{during the war and}} thereafter; its report, released in February 1918, described reliance on volunteers as inefficient, and recommended the institution of compulsory service for whites, even after the war (no mention was made of using black troops in the future). The Company published proposals the following month to register all white males aged between 18 and 65 with a view to some form of conscription, but this provoked widespread and vocal dissent, particularly from <b>farmers.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> face of this opposition the administration vacillated until it quietly dropped the idea after the armistice.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century two breeds {{had been}} {{developed}} for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably {{closely related to the}} Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed. As fox hunting became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern Foxhound. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit-hunting packs.|$|E
5|$|Han <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yangzi River {{region of}} {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of}} the year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|Since cats were venerated {{in ancient}} Egypt, they were {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in the Middle East. A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today. A 2017 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of those first domesticated by <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Near East around 9,000 years ago.|$|E
