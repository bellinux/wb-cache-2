5|$|Brezhnev has {{fared well}} in opinion polls when {{compared}} to his successors and predecessors in Russia. In the West he is most commonly remembered <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> the economic stagnation that triggered {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union. In an opinion poll by VTsIOM in 2007 the majority of Russians chose to live during the Brezhnev era rather than any other period of 20th century Soviet history. In a Levada Center poll conducted in 2013, Brezhnev beat Vladimir Lenin as Russia's favourite leader in the 20th century with 56% approval. In another poll in 2013, Brezhnev was voted the best Russian leader of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Despite these incidents, {{legislative}} elections planned {{before the}} coup {{were held in}} April 1964. They were originally to be held on 23 February, though he dissolved the National Assembly and rescheduled them for 12 April. Upon insistence of the French, M'ba allowed opposition candidates to run, which it claimed was the main reason <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> the coup in the first place. However, their leaders were barred from participating because of their involvement in the coup, and known anti-Mba organizers were deported to remote parts of the country. In addition, M'ba was known to have bribed voters with banknotes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E

5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible <b>for</b> <b>starting,</b> stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E
5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a safety margin <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in {{unpowered}} gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E
5|$|In {{his rookie}} season, Young {{ranked in the}} top five among {{qualifying}} major league rookies in several statistical categories: strikeouts (second, 137), wins (tied for third, 12), ERA (fourth, 4.26), starts (fifth, 31) and innings pitched (fifth, 164⅔). He also tied Rangers rookie club records: wins (12, Edwin Correa in 1986 and Kevin Brown in 1989) and pre All-Star break wins (8, Jeff Zimmerman in 1999 and José Guzmán in 1986). Young ranked fifth among all American League pitchers with 7.5 strikeouts per 9 innings. Despite this success, however, he was a key part of an offseason trade that also sent Terrmel Sledge and Adrian Gonzalez to the San Diego Padres <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> pitcher Adam Eaton, middle reliever Akinori Otsuka and minor-league catcher Billy Killian.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{an airport}} with short {{take-off}} and landing flights was {{launched by the}} government in December 1983. The airport was proposed along with five other regionals airport: Fagernes Airport, Leirin; Førde Airport, Bringeland; Mosjøen Airport, Kjærstad; Røst Airport and Værøy Airport. The plans were passed by Parliament on 10 April 1984. Grants <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> construction were issued on the 1985 state budget and operating permission was issued by the government on 6 September 1985. The financing was split between the state (60 percent), Vikna Municipality (30 percent) and Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality (10 percent). The municipal funding was financed through a loan in Kommunalbanken. Most of the state funding was granted on the 1986 state budget, along with three other airports. The original target was for 12,000 passengers per year.|$|E

5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{made his}} major league debut with the Cubs on September 1, , against the Atlanta Braves, coming in relief <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> pitcher Dennis Lamp, {{who had given}} up four runs and eight hits in the four innings he pitched.

5|$|The Nazis took {{advantage}} of the fire to advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested. Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> the fire.|$|E

Villa's many responsibilities included installing and removing the engines, repairing and tuning them, and operating the compressed air and magneto <b>for</b> <b>starting</b> them.
