Perspectives explored are both that of the dream ego as well any [...] "others" [...] that appear in the dream. These [...] "others" [...] may be, for example, another person, an animal, or a physical object. Approaching dream figures in this way is consistent with archetypal psychologist James Hillman's prescription for therapeutic work in regard to the phenomena of psychic multiplicity. Drawing upon Carl Jung's realization that [...] "the <b>ego</b> <b>complex</b> is not the only complex in the psyche," [...] Hillman described the psyche to be not a singular unified whole defined by the ego point of view, but rather a self-organizing multiplicity of autonomous selves. In the technique of embodied imagination, for each of these [...] "selves" [...] or [...] "states" [...] representing various perspectives, the dreamer then feels, identifies, and locates the feelings and sensations in his or her body. At the conclusion of the dreamwork session, the dreamer simultaneously holds in conscious awareness these differentiated and complex states of embodied feeling and sensation. The act of holding these multiple disparate states at the same time creates a psychical tension from which a completely new image or feeling state spontaneously emerges from the dreamer's psyche. This new image or state presents a completely new and previously unknown awareness to the dreamer, one through which the dreamer often feels changed, transformed, or greatly expanded in the ability to embody and feel intensely.|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen is an {{essential}} component of living organism. Protein synthesis and biosynthesis of nitrogen containing molecules essential for growth, such as amino acids and NAD, strictly depend on the availability of the nitrogen source. Limiting amount of nitrogen limit cell growth. Exogenous amino acids and other nitrogenous compounds such as ammonium constitute the nitrogen source. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae can sense and utilize a total of 21 different nitrogenous compounds to sustain growth. The uptake and utilization of different nitrogen sources is hierarchical and subject to strict and complex regulation at the transcriptional, translation and post-translational level. In general, preferred nitrogen sources inhibit the uptake and catabolism of non-preferred nitrogen sources. The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase among eukaryotes controlling growth in response to nutrients and growth factors. TOR is found in two essential conserved multiprotein complexes named TOR complex 1 (TORC 1) and TORC 2. In yeast, TORC 1 signaling is sensitive to nutrients, particularly to availability of the nitrogen source. Thus, TORC 1 by promoting anabolic processes, such as protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, couples growth to the availability of the nitrogen source. The sensing mechanism activating TORC 1 in response to nitrogen source sufficiency is only poorly understood. Recent studies identified the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> as intermediary component of the amino acid sensing pathway. In the presence of amino acids, particularly leucine, the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> is activated and promotes TORC 1 activity. The small GTP binding proteins Gtr 1 and Gtr 2 are part of the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex.</b> Gtr 1 and Gtr 2 form a heterodimeric complex. In response to amino acids Gtr 1 is loaded with GTP and Gtr 2 with GDP, leading to activation of the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex.</b> Several factors determine <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> activation by dictating the Gtr 1 / 2 guanosine loading. Vam 6 was proposed to act as guanosine exchange factor (GEF) towards Gtr 1. The Npr 2 /Npr 3 /Iml 1 complex was reported to act as GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Gtr 1. Therefore, amino acid stimulation of TORC 1 is decreased in the absence of Vam 6 and increased in the absence of Iml 1. Several observations point out that <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> signaling, alone, is not sufficient to explain TORC 1 activation by the nitrogen source. For instance, 1) components of the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> signaling are not essential; 2) ammonium starvation down-regulates growth even in cells where <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> signaling is hyperactivated. Therefore, nitrogen source and amino acids sufficiency might signal to TORC 1 via distinct mechanisms. In this study we analyze the effect of different nitrogen sources on TORC 1 activity. We use the phosphorylation state of the direct TORC 1 target Sch 9 as readout for TORC 1 activity. We describe that preferred nitrogen sources activate TORC 1 signaling stronger and better than non-preferred nitrogen source. TORC 1 activation by preferred nitrogen sources is paralleled by an increase in glutamine synthesis and accumulation. Growth is increased in the presence of preferred nitrogen sources in a glutamine synthesis dependent way. Therefore, glutamine constitutes a metabolic input linking TORC 1 activation in response {{to the quality of the}} nitrogen source to growth capacity. We find that <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> signaling is dispensable when a preferred nitrogen source is provided. TORC 1 activation and growth increase are still induced in cells compromised for <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> signaling. Taken together, we demonstrate that nitrogen source and amino acid sufficiency act via discrete mechanisms to activate TORC 1. ...|$|E

Here, we report that the yeast Rag GTPase homolog Gtr 1, a component of the vacuolar-membrane-associated <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> (EGOC), interacts with and activates TORC 1 in an amino-acid-sensitive manner. Expression of a constitutively active (GTP-bound) Gtr 1 (GTP), which interacted strongly with TORC 1, rendered TORC 1 partially resistant to leucine deprivation, whereas expression of a growth inhibitory, GDP-bound Gtr 1 (GDP), caused constitutively low TORC 1 activity. We also show that the nucleotide-binding status of Gtr 1 is regulated by the conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vam 6. Thus, in addition to its regulatory role in homotypic vacuolar fusion and vacuole protein sorting within the HOPS complex, Vam 6 also controls TORC 1 function by activating the Gtr 1 subunit of the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{target of}} rapamycin complex 1 (TORC 1) {{is a key}} conserved {{regulator}} of eukaryotic cell growth. The xenobiotic rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of the yeast complex. Surprisingly, the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex,</b> a nonessential in vivo activator of TORC 1, is somehow required for yeast cells to recover efficiently from a period of treatment with rapamycin. Why? Here, we found that rapamycin is only a partial inhibitor of TORC 1. We confirmed that saturating amounts of rapamycin do not fully inhibit proliferation of wild-type cells, {{and we found that}} the residual proliferation {{in the presence of the}} drug is dependent on the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> and on the activity of TORC 1. We found that this residual TORC 1 -dependent proliferation is key to recovery from rapamycin treatment. First, the residual proliferation rate correlates with the ability of cells to recover from treatment. Second, the residual proliferation rate persists long after washout of the drug and until cells recover. Third, the total observable pool of cell-associated rapamycin is extremely stable and decreases only with increasing cell number after washout of the drug. Finally, consideration of the residual proliferation rate alone accurately and quantitatively accounts for the kinetics of recovery of wild-type cells and for the nature and severity of the ego− mutant defect. Overall, our results revealed that rapamycin is a partial inhibitor of yeast TORC 1, that persistence of the drug limits recovery, and that rapamycin is not detoxified by yeast but is passively diluted among progeny cells because of residual proliferation...|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} rapamycin complex 1 (TORC 1) is an {{essential}} regulator of eukaryotic cell growth that responds to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids.

We find that the leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) Cdc 60 interacts with the Rag GTPase Gtr 1 of the EGOC in a leucine-dependent manner. This interaction is necessary and sufficient to mediate leucine signaling to TORC 1 and is disrupted by the engagement of Cdc 60 in editing mischarged tRNA Leu.

40|$|In {{order to}} enhance an {{understanding}} of different cultures and groups, post-Jungians are currently applying C. G.

In the post-Jungian view, much of what tears groups apart {{can be understood as}} the manifestation of autonomous processes in the collective and individual psyche that organise themselves around the cultural identity and cultural complexes of groups. A post-Jungian model of the development of the Self, based on Jung’s early identification of the archetypal patterns of Masculine and Feminine, was used to explore and discuss the development and formation of the Afrikaner cultural identity and its concomitant complexes within South Africa as they were shaped by important historical events. The interplay between the Masculine and Feminine principles led to the argument that, within the premises of the model, Afrikaner identity was forged by traumatic events in the static Feminine, which lead to a gross overemphasis of the Masculine in its dynamic and, more especially, in its static forms, reverberating in the notorious nationalist strategy of Apartheid. It was further argued that that the change and transformation of the Afrikaner cultural identity {{under the auspices of the}} dynamic Feminine was inevitable, leaving the Afrikaner in a situation in which the reconstruction of their cultural identity or identities is still emerging. It was concluded that, since all human cultures are seen as having their roots in and being centred around a religious viewpoint, as was evident in the Great Father-God, Calvinistic, patriarchal ethic of the Afrikanerdom, the individuation of the Afrikaner and the evolution of the Afrikaner cultural identity will most probably include a renewal of some of its religious viewpoints...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} use of {{constrained}} surrogate models to solve the multi-design optimization problem of a flexible hydrofoil. The surrogate-based optimization (<b>EGO)</b> substitutes the <b>complex</b> objective function of the problem by an easily evaluable model, constructed from {{a limited number of}} computations at carefully selected design points. Associated with ad-hoc statistical strategies to propose optimum candidates within the estimated feasible domain, EGO enables the resolution of complex optimization problems. In this work, we rely on Gaussian processes (GP) to model the objective function and adopt a probabilistic classification method to treat non-explicit inequality constraints and non-explicit representation of the feasible domain. This procedure is applied to the design of the shape and the elastic characteristics of a hydrofoil equipped with deformable elements providing flexibility to the trailing edge. The optimization concerns the minimization of the hydrofoil drag while ensuring a non-cavitating flow, at selected sailing conditions (boat speed and lifting force). The drag value and cavitation criterion are determined by solving a two-dimensional nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problem, based on a static vortex lattice method with viscous boundary layer equations, for the flow, and a nonlinear elasticity solver for the deformations of the elastic components of the foil. We compare the optimized flexible hydrofoil with a rigid foil geometrically optimized for the same sailing conditions. This comparison highlights the hydrodynamical advantages brought by the flexibility: a reduction of the drag over a large range of boat speeds, less susceptibility to cavitation and a smaller angle of attack tuning range...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} mostly {{devoted to a}} text {{analysis}} of Freud’s Work on Moses (1939), {{the case of the}} Wolf Man (1914 - 1918) and the text on the splitting of the Ego (Jan 1938 - 1940). In the course of this text analysis the fertility and the relation of these selected texts will be shown for an interpretation of the last steps of Freud’s self-analysis. The first part is totally devoted to the Work on Moses. By means of the three forewords in this work we can develop hypotheses concerning the consecutive phases in the realization of the Work on Moses and the construction that was eventually published and which was drafted by Freud from the material of these consecutive phases. Thus chapters I and II are parts from a first Work on Moses that was written in 1934. The elaborate third chapter on the other hand is for the bigger part a second Moses’ version that was (re) written in 1938 in which Freud inserted the remainder,the ‘most objectionable and dangerous’ part of his first Moses’ version at the last instant. This remainder of the first Moses’ version can be found in chapter III, second part, from p. 211 to p. 239 (in the German edition, G. W. XVI. English edition, S. E. Vol. 23, p. 105 - 130). When comparing both the remainder of the first Moses’ version and the second Moses’ version, they appear to differ on main points of importance. The importance of this exceptional construction for the eventual interpretation of the Work on Moses is then extensively investigated. Thus Freud’s interpretation of the Jewish-Christian religion in the first Moses’ version appears to emanate from an omnipotence-construction, whereby he as a writer takes the place of the primal father, in this case Moses. At the same time this omnipotence-construction is disavowed which explains the impasse in which Freud landed with this version and which impeded his publication of the Work on Moses for years. Only after writing the text of the splitting of the Ego (Jan 1938. Die Ichspaltung im Abwehrvorgang G. W. XVII, pp. 59 - 61. English edition: Splitting of the Ego in the process of defence S. E. Vol. 23, p. 271 - 278) which actually analyses the disavowal mechanism also active in the first Moses’ version, gradually a development within Freud takes place which leads to the writing of a new version. This new version, the second, crosses out the account of the first version, so that on the one hand this first version is destroyed in its original design {{and on the other hand}} this first version as inserted remainder in the second version becomes the confession of the murder that Freud committed on the father function in his first Moses’ version. After establishing Freud’s quotation - albeit concealed - and resumption of the analysis of the case of the Wolf Man as the only clinical illustration in his second Moses’ version (S. E. Vol 23, p. 78 - 79) and after ascertaining that the text of the splitting of the Ego is mainly based on material from this same case, the second part of this study takes up the case of the Wolf Man extensively (1914 - 1918. G. W. XII, p. 29 - 157. English edition: S. E. Vol. 17, p. 7 - 122). This part not only analyses large parts of the text on this case, but also other subsequent texts in which the Wolfman appears concealed or unconcealed and which indicate that Freud kept on struggling with problems that he had with this ‘analytical example’ which wouldn’t heal, problems that he found hard to admit. Our analysis sets to the short correspondence between Freud and the Wolf Man (1926), which is also seen against the background of the latter’s later analysis with R. M. Brunswick. Our analysis shows that as well for Freud as for the Wolfman the analysis got stuck in both their disavowal mechanisms rendering the exchange on both sides fraudulent. After the long detour via the case of the Wolf Man the third part of this study is a text analysis, line by line, of the short but compact text of the splitting of the Ego. The preceding investigation of the Work on Moses and the case of the Wolf Man allows us to make the link with and show the relevance of the text of the splitting of the Ego for the interpretation of the case of the Wolf Man and the hinging function that the text of the splitting of the Ego had and has for the breach of the disavowal in the first Moses’ version, so that the Work on Moses could be completed. The disavowal which plays a central role in the Work on Moses and the case of the Wolf Man, is now also investigated from the perspective of the text of the splitting of the <b>Ego.</b> The <b>complex</b> characteristics of the disavowal as we find them in Freud’s text(s), allow a clear distinction from negation and repression (‘Verneinung’ and ‘Verdrängung’). It is this text of the splitting of the Ego which eventually allows Freud to make the step from a (disavowed) ‘splitting of the Ego of the man Moses/ Freud’ to the establishment of a ‘rift in his ego’ (‘Einriss im Ich’). Part four tries to trace to what extent Freud realizes with his Work on Moses his intention to supply a psychoanalytical contribution to the understanding of the Jewish-Christian religion mainly. This part recapitulates the preceding work and stipulates that the Work on Moses in the previously discovered latent structure (see first part of the study) exposes the religion-interpretation of the first Moses’ version as a disavowed omnipotence-link between religion and psychoanalysis, which is in fact destructive for both psychoanalysis and religion. Only in the second Moses’ version and after the confession of the murder committed on the father and mother function which is raised by the insertion of the first Moses’ version, Freud is able to establish a communication between religion and psychoanalysis which contains creative possibilities for both without confusion of both domains or bringing them up against each other. This part then establishes from his text of the splitting of the Ego and his Work on Moses that Freud not only knew better how to work through lifelong problems and so profited in that sense and received something from his psychoanalytical self-investigation, but that he also profited and received something from the Jewish-Christian religion. Although several critical observations can be justly made about Freud’s opinions on Biblical Jewry and Christianity which only become understandable from his self-analytical process, this part tries to show that the more essential representations of the Jewish-Christian religion that Freud then interprets, are a good representation of the ‘religion of his forefathers’ which he grew up with from his childhood onwards. Furthermore we also try to show in this last part that the influence of these representations can be found, albeit latently, in Freud’s interpre- tation of this religion. The interaction between Freud’s interpretation of the Jewish-Christian religion on the one hand and the latent influence of Jewish-Christian thinking on his own selfanalysis on the other hand, is shown by means of the writings of the prophet Hosea and an important text of Paul (Rom 7, 7 - 25). In this study we call this a reciprocal interpretation or an ‘interpenetration’ between Freud and Hosea and between Freud and Paul. Vertaling: Mevr Irèn...|$|R
40|$|The Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC 1) {{is a key}} and conserved {{regulator}} of cell {{growth and}} proliferation. The xenobiotic compound rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of TORC 1 in yeast. The <b>EGO</b> <b>complex,</b> a non-essential activator of TORC 1 is required for recovery of cells following rapamycin treatment. Why? Here, we find that rapamycin is in fact only a partial inhibitor of yeast TORC 1; wild-type cells are able to maintain slow proliferation {{in the presence of}} high concentrations of the drug (i. e. concentrations multiple times the minimum inhibitory concentration). We find that this residual, rapamycin-insensitive, proliferation is dependent on the <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> and on TORC 1 activity. We show that the ability of cells to maintain slow proliferation in the presence of rapamycin dictates their ability to recover. We find that rapamycin is not actively detoxified in yeast; instead, rapamycin is cleared by dilution-by-proliferation. The cell-associated intracellular pool of rapamycin is stable, decreasing only very slowly following washout of the drug and only diminishing at the rate of cell proliferation. The rapamycin-insensitive growth rate also persists long after rapamycin washout, indeed, until cells recover from the drug. The rapamycin-insensitive growth rate is not only able to quantitatively account for the observed kinetics of recovery from the drug in wild-type cultures, but also explains the severity of the ego- recovery defect. We contributed to a large-scale genetic screen seeking mutants that, like ego- mutants, fail to recover from rapamycin treatment. We find that loss of any one of 10 proteins identified results in a rapamycin recovery defect and a slow rapamycin-insensitive growth rate. Our data propose important or novel roles of the core HOPS/CORVET complex, threonine biosynthesis, Vps 15 p, Vsp 34 p, Ccr 4 p and Dhh 1 p activities in modulating the activity or efficiency of TORC 1. Overall our results reveal that rapamycin is only a partial inhibitor of yeast TORC 1, that persistence of the drug within the cell limits recovery and that rapamycin is not actively detoxified in yeast. Instead, recovery occurs due to dilution-by-proliferation and distribution of the drug among an increasing number of progeny cells.

40|$|The {{target of}} rapamycin complex 1 (TORC 1) {{integrates}} various hormonal and nutrient signals to regulate cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Amino acid-dependent activation of TORC 1 is mediated via the yeast <b>EGO</b> <b>complex</b> (EGOC) consisting of Gtr 1, Gtr 2, Ego 1, and Ego 3. Here, we identify the previously uncharacterized Ycr 075 w-a/Ego 2 protein {{as an additional}} EGOC component that {{is required for the}} integrity and localization of the heterodimeric Gtr 1 -Gtr 2 GTPases, equivalent to mammalian Rag GTPases. We also report the crystal structure of the Ego 1 -Ego 2 -Ego 3 ternary complex (EGO-TC) at 2. 4 Å resolution, in which Ego 2 and Ego 3 form a heterodimer flanked along one side by Ego 1. Structural data also reveal the structural conservation of protein components between the yeast EGO-TC and the human Ragulator, which acts as a GEF for Rag GTPases. Interestingly, however, artificial tethering of Gtr 1 -Gtr 2 to the vacuolar membrane is sufficient to activate TORC 1 in response to amino acids {{even in the absence of}} the EGO-TC.

40|$|The TorC 1 {{protein kinase}} complex {{is a central}} {{component}} in a eukaryotic cell's response to varying nitrogen availability, with kinase activity being stimulated in nitrogen excess by increased intracellular leucine. This leucine-dependent TorC 1 activation requires functional Gtr 1 / 2 and Ego 1 / 3 complexes. Rapamycin inhibition of TorC 1 elicits nuclear localization of Gln 3, a GATA-family transcription activator responsible {{for the expression of}} genes encoding proteins required to transport and degrade poor nitrogen sources, e. g. proline. In nitrogen-replete conditions, Gln 3 is cytoplasmic and Gln 3 -mediated transcription minimal, whereas in nitrogen limiting or starvation conditions, or after rapamycin treatment, Gln 3 is nuclear and transcription greatly increased. Increasing evidence supports the idea that TorC 1 activation may not be as central to nitrogen-responsive intracellular Gln 3 localization as envisioned previously. To test this idea directly, we determined whether Gtr 1 / 2 - and Ego 1 / 3 -dependent TorC 1 activation also was required for cytoplasmic Gln 3 sequestration and repressed GATA factor-mediated transcription by abolishing the Gtr-Ego complex proteins. We show that Gln 3 is sequestered in the cytoplasm of gtr 1 Δ, gtr 2 Δ, ego 1 Δ, and ego 3 Δ strains either long term in logarithmically glutamine-grown cells or short term after refeeding glutamine to nitrogen-limited or -starved cells; GATA factor 2 dependent transcription also was minimal. However, in all but a gtr 1 Δ, nuclear Gln 3 localization in response to nitrogen limitation or starvation was adversely affected. Our data demonstrate: (i) Gtr-Ego-dependent TorC 1 activation is not required for cytoplasmic Gln 3 sequestration in nitrogen-rich conditions; (ii) a novel Gtr-Ego-TorC 1 activation-independent mechanism sequesters Gln 3 in the cytoplasm; (iii) Gtr and <b>Ego</b> <b>complex</b> proteins participate in nuclear Gln 3 - Myc 13 localization, heretofore unrecognized functions for these proteins; and (iv) the importance of searching for new mechanisms associated with TorC 1 activation and/or the regulation of Gln 3 localization/function in response to changes in the cells' nitrogen environment.
