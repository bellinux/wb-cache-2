5|$|This lists {{buildings}} that once held {{the title of}} tallest building in New York City. Both Trinity Church and the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> have held the title twice, the latter following {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks. The <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> was surpassed by One World Trade Center in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In the 1933 film, {{directors}} Cooper and Schoedsack {{appear in}} cameos as {{the pilot and}} rear-gunner who shoot Kong during the film's climax atop the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building.</b> In the 2005 film, Jackson plays one of the gunners.|$|E
5|$|These {{top stories}} are very narrow with low, sloped ceilings, and are useful only for holding {{radio-broadcasting}} and other mechanical and electrical equipment. Television station WCBS-TV (Channel 2) originally transmitted {{from the top}} of the Chrysler starting in 1938. The installation continued through the early 1950s, when it moved to the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> due to competition from RCA's transmitter at the latter tower. For many years, WPAT-FM and WTFM (now WKTU) also used the Chrysler Building as a transmission site, but they also moved to the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> by the 1970s. Since then, there have not been any commercial broadcast stations located at the Chrysler Building.|$|E
5|$|Chrysler {{realized}} that his tower's height would exceed the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire. However, the <b>Empire</b> <b>State's</b> developer John J. Raskob reviewed the plans and {{realized that}} he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building, and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension. Two days later, the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.|$|R
5000|$|Sekowsky, one of {{the nascent}} Marvel Comics' mainstays, chose to remain and [...] "make George's life hell". Nonetheless, Barclay {{recalled}} the staff often having cocktails together at Longchamps, the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> ground-floor restaurant, and found Timely [...] "a pleasant place to work".|$|R
5000|$|In the Looney Tunes cartoon [...] "Much Ado About Nutting", a {{squirrel}} {{has so much}} difficulty opening a coconut he carries it to the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> observation deck and tosses it over the edge. While the street is damaged by the impact, the coconut remains intact.|$|R
5|$|In a technologically-advanced 1939, the {{zeppelin}} Hindenburg III moors itself {{atop the}} <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building.</b> Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, {{a scientist who}} arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished.|$|E
5|$|When {{early in}} the film {{newspaper}} clippings {{from around the globe}} are shown, in the Japanese newspaper the iconic silhouette of Godzilla is clearly visible. Similarly, during the New York sequence when Sky Captain deploys a bomb to stop a giant robot, the shape of King Kong can be seen on the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> in the background.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{panelling}} from {{a room in}} the Crown & Treaty {{public house}} was sold in 1924 to an American businessman, who installed it in his office in the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> in New York. It was returned in 1953 as a gift to the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II and returned to the house, although the monarch retained ownership.|$|E
50|$|The new 81-story building, when completed, {{will have}} a total height of 1340 ft. In comparison, the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> roof at the 102nd floor is 1250 ft tall, 1454 ft with its antenna, and the {{original}} 2 World Trade Center (referred to as the South Tower) was 1362 ft.|$|R

50|$|By late 2015, reports {{emerged that}} Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) had {{announced}} {{its plans to}} invest $35 billion in the U.S. over five years. The QIA investments focus on diversifying the fund’s assets and concentrate on direct investments in real estate. Since the announcement, QIA has {{made a series of}} high-level investments in the U.S. including the purchase of a minority stake in the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building’s</b> owner.|$|R
5|$|Benchley's return yielded {{two more}} short films, and his {{high-profile}} prompted negotiations for sponsorship of a Benchley radio program and numerous appearances on television shows, {{including the first}} television entertainment program ever broadcast, an untitled test program using an experimental antenna on the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building.</b> The radio program, Melody and Madness, was more a showcase for Benchley's acting, as he {{did not participate in}} writing it. It was not well received, and was removed from the schedule.|$|E
5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries {{and a more}} traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|Promotions for the DVD release {{occurred}} {{across the}} United States. The <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> was illuminated yellow, {{the first time}} the building had ever been used as part of a film promotion. In the United Kingdom, Fox launched a £5 million advertising campaign. They also signed a £1.6 million deal with the yogurt company Yoplait, to produce a The Simpsons Movie design for their brand Frubes. In its first week it topped the U.S. DVD chart, and generated $11.8 million in rental revenue.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> opening {{coincided with}} the Great Depression in the United States, {{and as a result}} much of its office space was vacant. In the first year, 23% of the {{available}} space was rented; by contrast, during the 1920s, the average building would be 52% rented upon opening and 90% rented within five years. The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the [...] "Empty State Building".|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the effects}} of the Great Depression, some of the world's tallest skyscrapers were built during the 1930s, {{including}} Art-Deco masterpieces that are still part of the city's skyline today, such as the iconic Chrysler, General Electric and <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>buildings.</b> Both before and especially after World War II, vast areas of the city were also reshaped by the construction of bridges, parks and parkways coordinated by Robert Moses, the greatest proponent of automobile-centered modernist urbanism in America.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{high-profile}} {{project for}} a large-scale building Juengling {{was involved in}} was being on the design team {{for the release of}} the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> new lighting as of 2012. The lighting is 50% more efficient than before, can be started at the stroke of a button and contains over 16 million colors. [...] The ESB partnered with the Macy's Fireworks Spectacular for their 37th Fourth of July fireworks show, unveiling the ESB lighting project for the first time.|$|R

He abducts Marge then {{attempts}} {{to climb the}} <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building,</b> but is unable {{to get past the}} second story of the building. King Homer collapses in exhaustion. In the end, King Homer and Marge get married. The story ends with the wedding.|$|E
5|$|The Chrysler Building is an Art Deco-style {{skyscraper}} {{located on}} the East Side of Midtown Manhattan in New York City, {{at the intersection of}} 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan. At , the structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before it was surpassed by the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> in 1931. It is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel structure. , the Chrysler is the fifth-tallest building in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of {{a lightning bolt}} can be five times hotter than {{the surface of the}} sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot, some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E
50|$|On the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> viewing platform, Kate, {{thinking}} that Princeton has stood her up, throws his lucky penny away. A hundred stories below, Lucy, walking by on Fifth Avenue, is knocked unconscious by the penny. Kate and Princeton unsuccessfully {{try to work}} out their problems over Lucy's comatose body. Rod is too proud to accept Nicky's repeated apologies, despite clearly missing him, and tearfully consults Christmas Eve. Princeton, Kate and Nicky dream of returning to happier times ("I Wish I Could Go Back to College").|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} (approximately from the 1940s through the 1970s), there were booths called Voice-O-Graphs, that let the user record their own voice onto a record when money was inserted. These were often found at arcades and tourist attractions {{alongside}} other vending and game machines. The <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> 86th floor observatory in New York City, Coney Island, NY and Conneaut Lake Park, PA {{are some of}} the locations which had such machines. Gem Razors also created thousands of free Voice-O-Graph records during wartime for the troops to send home to their families.|$|R
5000|$|One part per {{quadrillion}} (ppq) denotes {{one part}} per [...] parts, one part in 1015, and {{a value of}} 1 × 10−15. This is equivalent to 1 drop of water diluted into a cube of water measuring approximately 368 meters on a side (fifty million cubic meters, which is a cube about as tall as the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> 102 stories), or {{two and a half}} minutes out of the age of the Earth (4.5 billion years). Although relatively uncommon in analytical chemistry, measurements at the ppq level are sometimes performed.|$|R
5|$|A three-disc Deluxe Extended Edition was {{released}} on November 14, 2006 in the U.S., and on November 3 in Australia. Twelve minutes were reinserted into the film, and a further forty minutes presented alongside {{the rest of the}} special features. The film was spread onto the first two discs with commentary by Peter Jackson and Philippa Boyens, and some featurettes on discs one and two, whilst the main special features are on disc three. Another set {{was released}}, including a WETA figurine of a bullet-ridden Kong scaling the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building,</b> roaring at the army with Ann in hand. The extended film amounts to 200 total minutes.|$|E
5|$|New York {{has played}} a {{prominent}} {{role in the development of}} the skyscraper; since 1890, eleven structures in the city having held the title of world's tallest building. New York City went through a very early high-rise construction boom that lasted from the early 1910s through the early 1930s, during which 16of the city's 82tallest buildings were built—including the Woolworth Building, the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, the Chrysler Building and the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building,</b> each of which was the tallest in the world at the time of its completion, the latter remaining so for forty years.|$|E
5|$|On {{a typical}} weekday, a {{combined}} total of 50,000 people {{worked in the}} North and South Towers, with another 200,000 passing through as visitors. The complex was so large that it had its own zip code: 10048. The Windows on the World restaurant, located {{on top of the}} North Tower, reported revenues of $37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States. The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in movies, television shows, postcards, and other merchandise. The towers came {{to be seen as a}} New York City icon, much like the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building,</b> the Chrysler Building, and the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5000|$|A {{proposal}} or rider in Section 3003 of the Act, titled [...] "Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act", {{would allow}} RCM {{to develop and}} operate an underground copper mine 7,000-feet deep (approximately five <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>buildings)</b> in the publicly owned Tonto National Forest near Superior, Arizona. The mine would destroy an area set aside in 1955 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower that is sacred to the San Carlos Apache. The land contains more than 2,400 acres of the Oak Flat Campground, an area dotted with petroglyphs and historic and prehistoric sites. [...] Said former San Carlos Apache tribal chairman Wendsler Nosie Sr. of the Act's attached rider: “This is Congressional politics at its worse, a hidden agenda that destroys human rights and religious rights." ...|$|R
50|$|After scavs {{destroy a}} generator, Jack discovers the scavs {{have been using}} the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Buildings</b> antenna to {{transmit}} coordinates to outer space. While taking a break at his secret lake house retreat, he watches a crash-landing module of a pre-war spacecraft called the Odyssey. Thinking the ship contains aliens, he investigates, only to find humans in stasis chambers. One of the humans is the woman from his dreams. Jack protects her chamber from a drone that destroys the others, and later revives the woman, Julia Rusakova, who makes Vika instinctively jealous. Jack and Julia return to recover her flight recorder but are captured by the scavs. They are taken to their headquarters at the Raven Rock Mountain Complex, and the scavs are revealed to be human survivors.|$|R
500|$|The {{house sparrow}} is closely {{associated}} with human habitation and cultivation. It is not an obligate commensal of humans as some have suggested: Central Asian house sparrows usually breed away from humans in open country, and birds elsewhere are occasionally found away from humans. The only terrestrial habitats that the house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra. Well adapted to living around humans, it frequently lives and even breeds indoors, especially in factories, warehouses, and zoos. It has been recorded breeding in an English coal mine [...] below ground, and feeding on the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> observation deck at night. It reaches its greatest densities in urban centres, but its reproductive success is greater in suburbs, where insects are more abundant. On a larger scale, it is most abundant in wheat-growing {{areas such as the}} Midwestern United States.|$|R
5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the structure was built by Walter Chrysler, {{the head of the}} Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, as Walter P. Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E
5|$|The hotel faced stiff {{competition}} from the early 20th century, {{with a range of}} new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), The St. Regis (1904), The Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.|$|E
50|$|The first {{architectural}} {{application of}} aluminium was the mounting {{of a small}} grounding cap on the Washington Monument in 1884. Sheet-iron or steel clapboard siding units had been patented in 1903, and Sears, Roebuck & Company had been offering embossed steel siding in stone and brick patterns in their catalogues for several years by the 1930s. ALCOA began promoting the use of aluminium in architecture by the 1920s when it produced ornamental spandrel panels for the Cathedral of Learning and the Chrysler and <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Buildings</b> in New York. The exterior of the A.O. Smith Corporation Building in Milwaukee was clad entirely in aluminium by 1930, and 3'-square siding panels of Duralumin sheet from ALCOA sheathed an experimental exhibit house for the Architectural League of New York in 1931. Most architectural applications of aluminium in the 1930s were on a monumental scale, {{and it would be}} another six years before it was put to use on residential construction.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> {{art deco}} design {{is typical of}} pre–World War II {{architecture}} in New York. The modernistic stainless steel canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th Streets lead to two-story-high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second-floor level. The riveted steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building's gravity stresses and wind loads. The exterior of the building is clad in Indiana limestone panels, which came from the Empire Mill in Sanders, Indiana, and give the building its signature blonde color. The limestone facade, which is lined with vertically aligned steel mullions parallel to each window, also makes the steel frame even stiffer against the winds. The large amount of material used in the building's construction made it very stiff compared to other skyscrapers, with a structural stiffness of [...] versus the Willis Tower's [...] and the John Hancock Center's [...] A December 1930 feature in Popular Mechanics estimated that a <b>building</b> with the <b>Empire</b> <b>State's</b> dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of [...]|$|R
25|$|The building's {{structural}} steel was pre-ordered and pre-fabricated {{in anticipation of}} a revision to the city's building code that would have allowed the <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> {{structural steel}} to carry , up from , thus reducing the amount of steel needed for the building. Although the 18,000-psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities, Mayor Jimmy Walker did not sign the new codes into law until March 26, 1930, just before the steel was about to be laid. The first steel framework was put into place on April 1, 1930. From there, construction proceeded at a fast pace. During one stretch of 10 working days, the builders erected fourteen floors. This was made possible due to the extremely precise coordination of the building's planning, as well as the mass production of common materials such as windows and spandrels. For instance, after a supplier of dark Hauteville marble could not deliver enough material on time, Starrett switched to using Rose Famosa marble from a German quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble.|$|R
