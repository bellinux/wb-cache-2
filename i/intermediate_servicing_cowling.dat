40|$|Discussed {{here are}} {{problems}} {{with the use of}} cowlings with radial air cooled engines. An XF 7 C- 1 airplane, equipped with <b>service</b> <b>cowling</b> and with narrow ring, wide ring, and exhaust collector ring cowlings over the <b>service</b> <b>cowling,</b> was used. For these four cowling conditions, the rate of climb and high speed performance were determined, the cylinder conditions were measured, and pictures to show visibility were taken. The level flight performance obtained with an engine speed of 1900 r. p. m. for the service type, the narrow ring, the wide ring, and the exhaust collector ring was 144. 4, 146. 6, 152. 8, and 155 mph, respectively. The rate of climb was practically the same for each type tested. The visibility was not materially impaired by the use of the wide or the narrow cowlings. With the narrow ring and exhaust collector ring cowlings there was an increase in cylinder temperature. However, this increase was not enough to affect the performance of the engine. The use of an exhaust collector ring incorporated into the cowling is practical where the problem of visibility does not enter...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the issue whether developing countries forego chances in world manufactured markets by protecting <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> against market entry of new suppliers. By scanning the empirical literature on effective rates of protection (ERP), {{the evidence is}} supportive. Yet, it seems more the indirect effect via expanding the service sector in total through liberalization and deregulation than the direct effect of lowering ERP in <b>intermediate</b> <b>service</b> industries for downstream manufacturing industries which is relevant. Developed countries {{on the other hand}} enjoy a much lower level of protection in important <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> like banking and telecom and thus these industries can be instrumental to help downstream manufacturing industries in adjustment and restructuring. It is argued that especially in the EU competition in <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> will further rise due to various EU-policy rooted factors. As a result, protection rates of services in individual EU countries will converge. This paper presents a theoretical model of the labor market in which these effects can be analyzed. We then calibrate the model with respect to the German labor market to shed light on the relative strengths of these effects and thereby assess the degree to which low-wage subsidies encourage or discourage employmentTrade Liberalization, Services, Effective Rates of Protection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which agglomeration of the hospital service industry enhances the productivity of producing health care. Specifically, we use a large set of private insurance claims from the FAIR Health database to show that an increasing spatial concentration of hospital services results in a decreased cost of obtaining <b>intermediate</b> medical <b>services.</b> We explicitly test whether the reduced cost at concentrated locations arises from the ability to share <b>intermediate</b> <b>service</b> providers. The identification relies on state variation in medical lab technician licensure requirements, which influence the cost of <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> only through the cost of running a lab. Our findings suggest that agglomeration of the hospital service industry attracts specialized medical labs, which in turn help to reduce the cost of producing laboratory tests...|$|R

Using regression to control for observable differences between firms that import service inputs and those that do not, we show that firms that start importing <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> experience faster employment growth than equivalent firms that do not.

3000|$|... fJust {{as there}} have been {{numerous}} attempts to define ‘services,’ there are equally numerous attempts to classify them, reflecting the great heterogeneity hiding behind this general label. It is particularly useful to make a distinction between consumer (or final) services and producer (or <b>intermediate)</b> <b>services.</b> Producer <b>services</b> are <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> provided to goods or other service producers. Their definition and demarcation is based on a function-based classification of services that was initially proposed by Greenfield (1966) and further developed by Browning and Singelmann (1975). However, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between producer services and consumer services; activities such as banking or transport services not only fulfill intermediate demand but also meet the needs of final consumers, even though they may emphasize the provision of services to one group or another (see for example Marshall et al. (1988)).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two related}} questions {{that help to}} explain geographic variation in access to medical services. The first question examines the existence of agglomeration economies in the hospital service industry. The second considers whether the sharing of intermediate inputs contributes to spillovers from spatial concentration of hospital services. These questions are addressed by estimating a bivariate probit model that explicitly controls for potential correlations between whether a service is provided and how the service is provided. Three key findings are obtained. First, hospitals in more concentrated areas {{are more likely to}} outsource <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> to specialized <b>intermediate</b> <b>service</b> suppliers. This suggests that agglomeration economies exist in the hospital service industry and are generated in part through the sharing of intermediate inputs. Second, the presence of nearby small hospitals increases the tendency to outsource, which is consistent with a “Chinitz” effect identified elsewhere in the literature. Third, the agglomeration effect attenuates geographically...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} research on efficiency gains for Russia from WTO membership concludes that service trade liberalization especially through allowing foreign suppliers {{to invest in}} Russian service industries promises the largest gains. This points to sizable efficiency deficits in the Russian service sector. This paper departs from the question whether both the Russian sectoral protection structure and the effective rates of protection (ERPs) differ from structures and rates in benchmark countries if tax equivalents for <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> are taken into account. The result is that almost all Russian service industries get effectively taxed and not protected once not only tax equivalents of intermediate goods but also those of <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> are included in ERP calculation. Variance among industries and peak taxes in service industries are significantly higher than in a median emerging country taken as benchmark. These findings support the key role of <b>intermediate</b> <b>services</b> liberalization {{for the expansion of}} a viable Russian service sector. Results from comparing Russian effective rates of protection with those of the EU accession countries Bulgaria and Romania are not inclusive. Tax levels of the two accession countries are also high and variant and thus cannot serve as a proxy for the “economic distance of Russia to Brussels”. Lessons for European Neighborhood Policy point to the requirement for the EU to liberalize bilateral service trade (through mode 3 supply: commercial presence) on a quid pro quo base: without opening EU markets for Russian companies in specific services (i. e., energy distribution), Russia will probably not open its service sector for EU suppliers more than is required in order to comply with minimum WTO accession prerequisites.
