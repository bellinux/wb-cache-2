40|$|A {{world wide}} {{foodborne}} illness due to viruses remains a major concern, despite improving hygienic conditions. Magnetic nanoparticles have attracted recent researchers for their intensive applications as biomaterials and magnetic storage materials. The {{goal of this}} study is to synthesize Mg- NP's by using ultrasonic-assisted chemical coprecipitation method under different conditions. The Synthesized Mg- NP's was coated with chitosan for capturing the bacterial concentration from contaminated food sample. Chitosan from amine group specifically binds with bacteria on their surface of most food pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). The binding characteristic of chitosan coated Mg- NP's with bacterial cell wall was obtained by using UV-Visible spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy. UV-Visible Spectroscopy gives the reading of absorbance when the binding of receptor proteins occured with the sample. By using TEM, the Mg NP's shape and size was investigated. The product consisted of <b>ferrous,</b> <b>ferrite</b> (Fe 3 O 4) nanosized cubic particles with a high level of crystallinity. This kind of Chitosan-magnetite nanocomposite has the potential to be used in biosensors to identify and to detect foodborne pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} and thermopower measurements {{have been}} made on zinc and manganese <b>ferrous</b> <b>ferrite,</b> Zn(x) Fe-xO 4 and Mn(x) Fe 3 -xO 4 with 0 less-than-or-equal-to X < 1, in the temperature range 100 - 300 K. The results of X < 0. 5 are tentatively interpreted {{in terms of the}} formation of a Coulomb gap at low temperatures in an energy band of localized states. For X greater-than-or-equal-to 0. 5 the electrical conductivity is sysmptomatic of nearest-neighbour hopping, and thermopower vareis aas In c where c = (1 - X) / 2. The energy bandwidth of conduction states has been extracted from the thermopower and electrical conductivity data and is shown to be roughly proportional to the standard deviation of the Zn and Mn distributions [X(1 - X) ] 1 / 2. A polaron contribution to the conductivity activation energy of approximately 0. 03 eV at room temperature has been deduced for Mn 0. 8 Fe 2. 2 O 4 and Mn 0. 9 Fe 2. 1 O 4...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{creation of}} cobalt <b>ferrous</b> spinel <b>ferrite</b> nanoparticles and investigation of their phase composition, surface structure and magnetic properties. Cobalt <b>ferrous</b> spinel <b>ferrite</b> nanoparticles were synthesized in an aerated system of steel electrode contacting with aqueous cobalt chloride at different pH values of solution. According to X-Ray diffraction data, it was shown, that some impurity phases also formed during the synthesis process, notably, lepidocrocite and goethite on the steel surface and Green Rust I, cobalt hydroxide, heterohenite in the solution. The quantity of such phases depends on pH value of initial solution. The size of synthesized cobalt <b>ferrous</b> spinel <b>ferrite</b> nanoparticles was approximately 10 â€“ 12 nm. Saturation magnetization of synthesized cobalt <b>ferrous</b> spinel <b>ferrite</b> nanoparticles is rather high. Synthesized magnetic cobalt <b>ferrous</b> spinel <b>ferrite</b> nanoparticles are promising for different medicalbiological applications.

40|$|Nanosized {{zinc ferrite}} spinel powders of various {{compositions}} were produced in a radiofrequency (RF) thermal plasma from oxide mixtures and from co-precipitated hydroxides. Bulk and surface chemical compositions {{of the products}} were measured by ICP-AES and XPS. Phase conditions were determined by XRD. Morphology was investigated by SEM and TEM. In spite of the short residence time of reagents in the plasma reactor, {{a high degree of}} spinel formation was achieved. The Zn enrichment on the surface determined by quantitative XPS is attributed to a thin ZnO layer {{on the surface of the}} zinc ferrite particles.
