The visitor not accustomed to medicine meets a horrific sight made of pathological deformities.

Straws from each batch of semen were incubated for 2 hours in a water bath at 37 degrees C. Following this, the percentage of progressive motility, the rate of motility, {{and the percentage of}} intact acrosomes were determined for each unfixed sample. Each batch of semen was fixed in 2 different solutions of 0. 2 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (glutaraldehyde 1 and glutaraldehyde 2) and in 10 % neutral buffered <b>formol</b> saline (<b>formol</b> saline).

At Day 7, the samples in <b>formol</b> saline had a significantly higher percentage of intact acrosomes than those in glutaraldehyde 2. When the percentage of intact acrosomes for the unfixed samples at Day 0 was compared with the percentages of intact acrosomes for glutaraldehyde 1, glutaraldehyde 2, and <b>formol</b> saline at Day 7, only the percentage of intact acrosomes for <b>formol</b> saline was significantly higher than for the unfixed samples.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the nature and situation of antibody-producing cells following the subcutaneous injection of diphtheria toxoid and ovalbumln adsorbed to alumluum phosphate. In 1926 Glenny, Pope, Waddington, and Wallace (I) showed that when a solution of potassium aluminum sulfate, colloidal iron, or tungsfic acid was added to crude <b>formol</b> toxoid a precipitate formed and that when guinea pigs were inoculated with such preparations appreciably greater antitoxin responses followed, compared with those following the injection of the untreated <b>formol</b> toxoids. In 1931 Glenny, Butte, and Stevens (2) published investigations designed to account for this increased antigenic potency of alum-precipitated toxoid over its parent <b>formol</b> toxoid. They stated that this enhancement was due to the delayed absorption from the site of inoculation. Moreover, they considered that the release of toxoid from the injected alum precipitate was prolonged so that antigen liberated subsequently could act as a secondary type stimulus.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the ƒÂ 13 C and ƒÂ 15 N isotopic {{composition}} in frozen samples (control), samples in alcohol and in formaldehyde of Plagioscion squamosissimus and Hypophthalmus edentatus. From each individual we extracted {{a strip of}} muscle from the region above the lateral line, in the dorsal fin base, that was divided into three equal parts, each one was submitted to one type of treatment: freeze. control group (- 15 oC), conservation in alcohol 70 %and fixation in formaldehyde 4 %. Samples were kept under those treatments for 30 days, washed and submerged in distilled water for 4 hours. Afterwards, they were dried up in air oven at 60 oC for 48 hours and macerated until the obtaining of a fine powder. A {{significant difference was found}} in isotopic values of carbon and nitrogen, between the control and the samples in alcohol and formaldehyde, except for ƒÂ 13 C from the H. edentatus samples in formaldehyde. The carbon isotopic values of samples in alcohol were mostly enriched compared to control, whereas the samples in formaldehyde presented depleted values in relation to the control. The nitrogen isotopic values for both samples preserved in alcohol and formaldehyde were enriched when compared to the values of frozen samples, independently of used preservatives. Therefore, the isotopic correction should be accomplished according to the isotope and preservative employed for species of freshwater fish.

Therefore, the present study was set up to evaluate the biomass and diversity of earthworms in natural and reforested Araucaria plots, impacted or not by fire, and to identify the most efficient earthworm collection method. Four study areas included: native forest with Araucaria (NF); Araucaria reforestation (R); Araucaria reforestation submitted to an accidental fire (RF); and native grass pasture with native Araucaria and submitted to an intense accidental fire (NPF). Five soil samples containing the earthworm community were taken in a 0. 3 ha area in each of the forest sites, close to five Araucaria trees selected at random. Three collection methods were tested: application of dilute <b>Formol</b> (0. 5 %) to the soil surface, handsorting of small (25 ´ 25 cm) or large (40 ´ 40 cm) monoliths.

40|$|In {{observing the}} {{liquefaction}} of gelatin by micro 6 rganisms bacteriologists have been hampered by Jack of adequate quanti-tative means for measuring this property. The methods com-monly employed are unreliable and inconvenient {{even from a}} qualitative standpoint. In a recent paper Levine and Carpenter employed the change in viscosity and <b>formol</b> titration for detecting the gelatinolytic properties of bacteria. They observed that the viscosity (at 25 °C.) of autoclaved gelatin when stored at 22 °C. changed very little {{for a few days}} and then increased markedly. Gelatin inoculated with non-liquefying organisms acted in a similar manner. Pro-teolytic bacteria, on the other hand, rapidly decreased the vis-cosity of the medium. The proteolytic types fall into two groups with reference to their <b>formol</b> titration figures; in one group the <b>formol</b> titration increased slowly and did not reach a very high figure, in the other, the rise was very rapid and considerable. The effect of the increase in viscosity of uninoculated gelatin on storage (or gelatin inoculated with non-proteolytic organisms) is to exaggerate the difference between the proteolytic and non-proteolytic organisms, so that as a qualitative test the change in viscosity at 25 °C. may prove to be very convenient and delicate. For comparative purposes, however, it would be far more desirable if the gelatin medium could be manipulated so that its viscosity would remain constant when not proteolized. It was the purpose of the following experiments to ascertain whether autoclaved gelatin, after storage at various temperatures for prolonged periods, could be treated so as to yield products of constant viscosity...|$|E
