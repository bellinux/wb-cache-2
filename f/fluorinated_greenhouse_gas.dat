40|$|Range {{reduction}} {{caused by}} climate {{control is a}} barrier to widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EV). Higher efficiency and lower energy consumption by the air conditioning system will mitigate this disadvantage, as power consumption inside electric vehicles is a very relevant issue. Moreover, several European Union directives prohibit the use of HFC 134 a or any other <b>fluorinated</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) higher than 150 in new mobile air conditioning systems by January 2017. The Adoption of environmentally friendly refrigerants and minimizing the charge of refrigerant gas would be a viable option to endorse the EU directives. In this lecture, alternative climate control systems which profit from the advantages of thermochemical energy storage will be presented. In order to investigate the suitability of these systems for the high temperature fuel cell range extender vehicle (HTFCREX) developed by the DLR Institute of Vehicle Concepts, suitable climate control systems based {{on the use of}} hydrogen are developed, modeled and designed using the simulation environment Modelica/Dymola and the Air Conditioning Library.

The environmental office’s methods, existing routines, present regulations and guidelines have been studied.

The Environmental Office of Dalsland was established 1 January, 2007, when the municipalities of Bengtsfors, Dals Ed, Färgelanda and Mellerud merged their environmental offices together under a joint Environmental committee.

40|$|Some {{fluorinated}} gases (F-gases) {{which are}} used, or {{considered to be}} used, in crystalline silicon photovoltaic solar cell and film silicon module manufacturing {{have a very high}} global warming effect. CF 4, C 2 F 6, SF 6 and NF 3 have global warming potentials 7390, 12200, 22800 and 17200 times higher than CO 2. These gases can be used in texturing, phosphorus silicate glass removal (PSG), edge isolation and reactor cleaning operations from which unreacted species and reaction byproducts will be emitted. An inventory of the current use of <b>fluorinated</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> by the European and U. S.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of current air conditioning systems, for railway HVAC applications, utilize high global warming potential (GWP) hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants in a vapor compression cycle. In Europe, the dominating refrigerants are R 134 a and R 407 C, constituting 75 and 25 % of the total stock, respectively. <b>Fluorinated</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> (GHG), such as HFCs, accounts for 2. 5 % of the overall GHG emissions, expressed in GWP (EU 2013), and are as a consequence being regulated at an increasing rate, through the revised F-Gas regulation of 2014, (EU) No 517 / 2014, that aims to reduce EU fluorinated GHG emissions by {{two thirds of the}} 2010 levels by 2030. Because of the legislations and incentives put into place, both at the national and international level, the demand for environmentally benign HVAC&R technology, with viability in terms of achieved system efficiency and cost, is high, and can be expected to increase in a range of sectors the forthcoming years. A review of current railway HVAC technology, gives strong indication that R 744 (CO 2) vapor compression units {{are one of the most}} viable candidates for the future, able to meet virtually all requirements with regard to environmental impact, safety, reliability and energy efficiency. A newly developed, energy efficient and environmentally friendly prototype R 744 HVAC unit, will be tested onboard a commuter trainset, operated in the Oslo area, during a test campaign to be initiated late 2017. The goal of the test campaign is to evaluate the viability of the prototype in terms of being a replacement for the current standard R 134 a HVAC units, outfitted on the Norwegian railway operator NSB s railway fleet. The prototype have the ability to operate in reversed mode, thus enabling delivery of heat to the passenger compartment through the ventilation air, down to an ambient temperature of - 20 ℃. Moreover, the prototype utilize suction line heat exchangers, and offers ejector-supported fluid expansion during AC-mode operation, in order to minimize losses related to fluid expansion. Results from laboratory bench tests of the prototype, presented in this thesis, indicate that performance requirements can be met, provided an attentive approach, with regard to system design and control strategy, is applied.

This study presents estimates of current and future global emissions of F-gases, their technical mitigation potential and associated costs for the period 2005 to 2050. The analysis uses the GAINS model framework to estimate emissions, mitigation potentials and costs for all major sources of anthropogenic F-gases for 162 countries/regions, which are aggregated to produce global estimates. For each region, 18 emission source sectors with mitigation potentials and costs were identified. Global F-gas emissions are estimated at 0. 7 Gt CO 2 eq in 2005 with an expected increase to about 3. 6 Gt CO 2 eq in 2050. There are extensive opportunities to reduce emissions by over 95 percent primarily through replacement with existing low GWP substances.
