5|$|Albeit disorganized, <b>Emily</b> <b>and</b> its {{remnants}} dropped extensive precipitation {{across the}} Dominican Republic, with maximum totals {{of up to}} 21inches (528mm) recorded in Neiba. Among other consequences, severe flooding and isolated mudslides left 56 communities isolated from surrounding areas. The storm displaced up to 7,534 people throughout the country, of which 1,549 sought refuge in storm shelters. Consecutive hours of rainfall resulted in the overflow of some rivers, although no significant damage was reported to adjacent areas. Offshore, squalls generated rough waves that briefly affected boating operations and oceanside homes. To the east of Santo Domingo, two men drowned after getting caught in a swollen river. A third drowning fatality occurred elsewhere in the capital due to flooding.|$|E

5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception.

Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably.

5|$|Sherwood's four-month sea {{voyage to}} India was difficult; she was again {{pregnant}} and the regiment's ship {{was attacked by}} French warships.

5|$|WINDALCO {{reported}} {{a loss of}} 10,000tons of aluminum due to flooding. Manufacturing companies reported J$18.3million (US$296,000) in losses, primarily from suspended operations. In November, the Jamaica Labour Party sought J$3.2billion (US$51.8million) in additional funding to repair roads damaged by Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, <b>Emily,</b> <b>and</b> Wilma. The following month, the Jamaica Agricultural Society received J$5.5million (US$88,266) from the Japanese embassy to assist 500farmers in Portland Parish. The long-term effects of Dennis were limited, with nearly every economic sector returning to normal within a few months. The only exceptions were exports of banana and coffee crops, {{both of which were}} still recovering from Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Overall implications to the nation's gross domestic product were negligible, merely flat-lining growth rather than causing decline. However, in combination with the effects of a drought early in 2005, inflation values required adjustment upwards from 9% to 14.3%.|$|E
5|$|In Part 2, Phoebe {{tries to}} contact someone by phone to warn them about Rachel, {{eventually}} getting through to Joey {{at the hotel}} and stirring up homesickness in him.

5|$|Kresge {{comes to}} see Scully, {{telling her that}} the Sims {{received}} several large payments from a pharmaceutical company, Prangen Industries. The two visit Dr. Calderon, who tells them that Emily was part of clinical trials and that Roberta was paid the money {{to keep her from}} pulling Emily from the program. Marshall Sim is arrested for the murder of his wife. Scully visits <b>Emily</b> <b>and</b> gives her the cross necklace. Marshall confesses soon after, but is found dead in his cell shortly after being visited by the two dark-suited men. Bill shows Scully a photo of Melissa, who is clearly not pregnant, shortly before Emily was born, which he thinks proves that she isn't Emily's mother. Scully meets with someone from an adoptive agency, wanting to adopt Emily. The woman is very hesitant considering Scully's job and the fact that Emily is a special needs child. Scully flashes back to talking with Melissa around Christmas time shortly before she joined the FBI. On Christmas morning Scully receives the results of a DNA test from the FBI proving that Melissa is not Emily's mother—she is.|$|E

Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, <b>Emily,</b> <b>and</b> her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
