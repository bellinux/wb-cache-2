This was followed by the Vako Orchestron in 1975, which used a more professional-sounding version of the same technology. It was popularised by Patrick Moraz.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{tradition}} declined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-twentieth century, {{in part due}} to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century. The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, {{in the work of the}} painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins.|$|E

5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-2000s, the city was a setting in the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed {{in the city and}} suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E

5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees.

5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{arose in}} Cappadocia {{relatively}} late with {{no evidence of}} a Christian community before the late second century AD. Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid third century, a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities. The community remained very small throughout the third century: when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c. 250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea.|$|E

5|$|Georgetown's fight song is rare among U.S. {{university}} fight {{songs for}} mentioning other colleges by name.

5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore {{is characterized by a}} noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, Hensley {{married for}} the third time, but his wife, Inez Hutcheson, left him after {{less than a year}} of marriage. After their separation, Hensley began to preach in Chattanooga. During services, he began asserting that he had been {{miraculously}} healed after being paralyzed for a year following a coal-mining accident. Kimbrough disputes his claim, noting that there is no one-year gap in the records of Hensley moving or actively ministering. Hensley continued to live in Chattanooga until the early 1950s; he moved to Athens, Georgia, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-1950s.|$|E

In the 1993 film Gettysburg, set during the American Civil War (1861–65), he portrayed the real-life Union Army flag bearer Sergeant Andrew Jackson Tozier. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-2000s, he survived three cancers and then moved back to Blue Hill with his family, where he semi-retired while occasionally appearing in local stage productions.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid 2000's the Crusaders and Brumbies had a rivalry like no other.

However, in 2004, the Brumbies would defeat the Crusaders in the final meeting 47-38 in a high scoring match. Likewise with the Blues, the rivalry has dwindled in recent times, with the Brumbies only sporadically title threats.|$|E
