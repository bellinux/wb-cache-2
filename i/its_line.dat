5|$|The GWR {{objected to}} the {{reduction}} of the Bakerloo Tube's Paddington connection to a shuttle and the MR {{objected to the}} connection of the two lines, which would be in competition with <b>its</b> <b>line</b> through Kilburn. Parliament rejected the proposed connection and the changes to the NWLR's route and the company's permissions eventually expired without any construction work being carried out. The Bakerloo Tube bill was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The Great Wall of China visible today largely {{dates from}} the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often {{extending}} <b>its</b> <b>line</b> through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|The Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company {{was founded}} in 1886 in order to span the Missouri River. In the late 1880s the city had five {{franchise}} companies providing transit services within city limits. They included the Omaha and Southwestern Street Railway Company, which provided services to Kountze Place, Dundee, Bemis Park and the Gold Coast neighborhoods. Short lines ran with limited purposes: one went only to a baseball field {{at the end of}} <b>its</b> <b>line,</b> while another ran to and from a park.|$|E

5|$|The most {{enduring}} Roman legacy {{may be that}} created by Hadrian's Wall. <b>Its</b> <b>line</b> approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created {{a distinction between the}} northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political debate. This is probably coincidental however, as there is little to suggest its influence {{played an important role in}} the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened on 30 May 1870 by the DR (now the District line) when the railway {{extended}} <b>its</b> <b>line</b> from Westminster to Blackfriars. The {{construction of the}} new section of the DR was planned {{in conjunction with the}} building of the Victoria Embankment and was achieved by the cut and cover method of roofing over a trench. Due to its proximity to the South Eastern Railway's Charing Cross station, the station was originally called Charing Cross.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1857, the European and North American Railway opened <b>its</b> <b>line</b> from Moncton {{to nearby}} Shediac; this was {{followed}} by a line from Moncton to Saint John opening in 1859. At about the time of the arrival of the railway, the popularity of steam-powered ships forced an end to the era of wooden shipbuilding. The Salter shipyard closed in 1858. The resulting industrial collapse caused Moncton to surrender its civic charter in 1862.|$|E

The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|E
