5|$|Prior to {{the current}} bridge, four other bridges have spanned the Indian River Inlet, opened in 1934, 1940, 1952, and 1965, the latter widened by an {{additional}} span added in 1976. All were known informally as the Indian River Inlet Bridge, and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The 1965 bridge, a steel girder bridge, was subject to scouring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inlet,</b> leading {{to the need to}} replace it. Initial plans for a tied-arch bridge over the inlet in 2004 were over budget, and 2006 plans for a 1,400-foot (427-meter) cable-stayed bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems. Construction of the current, 2,600-foot (792-meter) bridge began in 2008 as part of a design-build project, with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge. The current Indian River Inlet Bridge opened partially in January 2012 and completely in May 2012 at a cost of $150 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} air intakes replaced conventional intake rampswhose {{function is}} to divert turbulent boundary layer airflow away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inlet</b> and prevent it entering the enginewith a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design. The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet cowls and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake. In 1999, developmental work on the DSI {{with the aim of}} improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001. Multiple models underwent wind tunnel tests; {{it was found that the}} DSI reduced weight, cost, and complexity while improving performance.|$|E

40|$|The {{adjusted}} factor Ga is {{a generic}} friction loss correction factor for pipelines with multiple outlets. The adjusted factor Ga {{can be applied}} to pipelines with or without outflow at the downstream end. Furthermore, this factor {{can be applied to}} a pipeline where the first outlet is at a full outlet spacing or a fractional outlet spacing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pipeline <b>inlet.</b> When <b>the</b> outflow at the downstream end is reduced to zero, the adjusted factor Ga reduces to the adjusted factor Fa. If the first outlet is positioned one outlet spacing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pipeline <b>inlet,</b> <b>the</b> factor Ga reduces to G. Finally, if both the outflow is zero and the first outlet is one outlet spacing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pipeline <b>inlet,</b> <b>the</b> adjusted factor Ga reduces to a close approximation of the well known factor F. The adjusted factor Ga {{is a function of the}} number of outlets along the pipeline, the location of <b>the</b> first outlet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pipeline <b>inlet,</b> <b>the</b> outflow ratio, and the velocity exponent of the head loss formula...|$|R

25|$|A {{check valve}} lets gas flow in one {{direction}} only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. Gas flow one way pushes {{the ball out of}} the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking it. Not to be confused with a flashback arrestor, a check valve is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is so far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inlet</b> that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its off position.|$|E

500|$|The VRDK was a motorjet, a {{rudimentary}} type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine's compressor. It forced {{air into the}} stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle. In the I-250 a [...] Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine {{was used as the}} primary powerplant. After takeoff a clutch {{at the end of the}} crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13:21 to an extension shaft that powered the compressor of the VRDK. The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inlet</b> underneath the propeller spinner, thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107's supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine's output to [...] at [...] The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine's excess heat into the exhaust stream. However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes' operating time per sortie, which meant that it was useless weight during the rest of the flight.|$|E

2500|$|For flow in a pipe of {{diameter}} , experimental observations {{show that}} for [...] "fully developed" [...] flow, laminar flow occurs when [...] < 2300 and turbulent flow occurs when [...] > 2600. At {{the lower end}} of this range, a continuous turbulent-flow will form, but only at a very long distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inlet</b> of the pipe. The flow in between will begin to transition from laminar to turbulent and then back to laminar at irregular intervals, called intermittent flow. This is due to the different speeds and conditions of the fluid in different areas of the pipe's cross-section, depending on other factors such as pipe roughness and flow uniformity. Laminar flow tends to dominate in the fast-moving center of the pipe while slower-moving turbulent flow dominates near the wall. As the Reynolds number increases, the continuous turbulent-flow moves closer to the inlet and the intermittency in between increases, until the flow becomes fully turbulent at [...] > 2600. This result is generalized to non-circular channels using the hydraulic diameter, allowing a transition Reynolds number to be calculated for other shapes of channel.|$|E
