40|$|BACKGROUND: To enable {{adequate}} {{interpretation of}} growth measurements {{in the management}} of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), we assessed growth and its associated determinants in children with PAH. METHODS: We did a retrospective longitudinal study of height and body-mass index in reference to WHO growth standards by pooling data from four contemporary prospective registries of paediatric PAH representing 53 centres in 19 countries. The main outcome measures were median height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> and body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> percentiles and longitudinal deviation of height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> and body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z scores from WHO standards. FINDINGS: 601 children were followed up for a median of 2 · 9 years (IQR 1 · 5 - 4 · 4). Baseline median height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> percentile was 26 (IQR 4 - 54) and baseline median body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> percentile was 41 (IQR 12 - 79). Mean height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score was significantly lower than the reference (- 0 · 81, 95 % CI - 0 · 93 to - 0 · 69; p< 0 · 0001), as was body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score (- 0 · 12, - 0 · 25 to - 0 · 01; p= 0 · 047). Height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score was particularly decreased in young patients (aged ≤ 5 years) with idiopathic or hereditary PAH and in all patients with PAH associated with congenital heart disease. Although Z scores increased in some patients and decreased in others, we detected no significant trend in height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score (p= 0 · 57) or body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score (p= 0 · 48) before taking account of covariates. Multivariable linear mixed effects modelling showed that age, cause of PAH, ex-prematurity, WHO functional class, trisomy 21, and time since diagnosis were associated with height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score, whereas age, ethnicity, and trisomy 21 were associated with body-mass index <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score. A favourable WHO functional class course was independently associated with increases in height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> Z score. INTERPRETATION: PAH is associated with impaired growth, especially in younger children and those with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. The degree of impairment is independently associated with cause of PAH and comorbidities, but also with disease severity and duration. Because a favourable clinical course was associated with catch-up growth, height <b>for</b> <b>age</b> could serve as an additional and globally available clinical parameter to monitor patients' clinical condition.

5|$|The {{environment}} of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management. These works were a success, with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, Ages Ago, opening in 1869. Ages Ago was also {{the beginning of a}} collaboration with the composer Frederic Clay that would last seven years and produce four works. It was at a rehearsal <b>for</b> <b>Ages</b> Ago that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan. The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} is episodic and usually focuses on one character at a time. Each {{of the first}} four episodes focuses {{on one of the}} four main characters, depicting social interaction and growth. The anime's use of time travel allows focus on the older versions or children of previously-featured characters, and contrasts their experiences with the protagonists' agelessness. Reviewers have experienced difficulty categorizing the Popotan anime, though it does feature an overall comedic tone. The characters are very lighthearted and eager to help new acquaintances. Nudity appears in many episodes, though no sexually explicit scenes occur. Geneon rated the series <b>for</b> <b>ages</b> 16+; Section23 Films gave its re-release a TV-MA rating.|$|E

40|$|International audience: Non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (NHL) disproportionately affects older patients, who do {{not often}} undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We analyzed Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research data on 1248 patients age ≥ 40 years receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) or nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning HCT for aggressive (n = 668) or indolent (n = 580) NHL.

Fewer patients aged ≥ 65 had previous autografting (26 % versus 24 % versus 9 %; P =. 002). Rates of relapse, acute and chronic GVHD, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 1 year post-HCT were similar in the 3 age cohorts (22 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), 19 % to 26 %] <b>for</b> <b>age</b> 40 to 54, 27 % [95 % CI, 23 % to 31 %] <b>for</b> <b>age</b> 55 to 64, and 34 % [95 % CI, 24 % to 44 %] <b>for</b> <b>age</b> ≥ 65. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 years was slightly lower in the older cohorts (OS: 54 % [95 % CI, 50 % to 58 %] <b>for</b> <b>age</b> 40 to 54; 40 % [95 % CI, 36 % to 44 %] <b>for</b> <b>age</b> 55 to 64, and 39 % [95 % CI, 28 % to 50 %] <b>for</b> <b>age</b> ≥ 65; P <. 0001). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant effect of age on the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD or relapse.
