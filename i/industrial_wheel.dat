50|$|The {{hamlet of}} Little Matlock was {{severely}} {{damaged by the}} Great Sheffield Flood of March 1864, it was accentuated {{by the fact that}} the River Loxley is quite narrow at that point as it squeezes between steep valley sides. There was no damage to dwellings as they were situated on higher ground away from the flood but the <b>industrial</b> <b>wheels</b> and tilts by the river were either completely destroyed or severely damaged. Two young men were killed at Mr. Thomas Harrison’s Tilt and Forge. Mr Cadman the owner of Little Matlock Forge claimed over £5,000 in compensation after the flood for damage to tilts, forges, dam banking, weir and cottages.|$|R

40|$|The task {{given to}} us was to develop an <b>industrial</b> <b>wheel</b> with new {{thinking}} in terms of fresh design and construction, with the ability to brake. While the produced wheels of today only own the property of total braking, a wish was made to integrate the ability of directional locking. The time spent working with the project has been filled with multiple sketches of ideas and function analysis. Choices of material and ways of construction have been verified by calculations, tests and prototype building. The goal of this thesis has been to develop a unique caster with well thought-out design that would be adaptable to different areas of applications. The result was a hubless wheel with the ability of directional locking before total braking. A prototype of the wheel has been made to show the design and functions...|$|E
40|$|Software {{product line}} {{engineering}} is a proposed methodology that enables software products and software-intensive systems {{to be developed}} at lower cost, higher quality and less time to market. The structured and managed artifacts reuse among different products in development is the main target of software product line engineering. As a key-method of the product line engineering approach, the commonality and variability analysis is a technique that identifies the potential artifacts for reuse. But the reuse poses challenges for delivering safety-critical products from the product line and achieving product line functional safety. In order to analyze the product line and provide more valuable information for its safety analysis, we make use of established product line modeling techniques, which model the product line commonality and variability from different perspectives. In this report, we investigate the product line modeling techniques. The product modeling analysis process covers two aspects: 1. Study different product line modeling techniques and find the ones suitable for product line modeling. We choose the modeling techniques that can be implemented to discuss in detail. 2. We implement the <b>industrial</b> <b>wheel</b> loader product line with two modeling techniques. Comprehensive models and detailed modeling process explanation are presented. The product line functional safety analysis covers three aspects: 1. Investigate the different safety analysis techniques and choose the fault tree analysis as the main technique. 2. Extend the single system fault tree to the product line fault tree. 3. Investigate {{the contributions of the}} product line modeling techniques to the product line functional safety analysis. Specifically, we map the product line models to the product line fault tree. Furthermore, we evaluate the product line modeling techniques from their performance in domain analysis and safety analysis...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{procedure}} {{to solve a}} job shop scheduling problem at a Belgian manufacturer producing <b>industrial</b> <b>wheels</b> and castors in rubber is presented. The procedure {{is an extension of}} a hybrid shifting bottleneck procedure with a tabu search algorithm while incorporating various company specific constraints. The various extensions to cope with the company specific constraints have a strong similarity with the complex job shop problem formulation of Mason et al. (2002). The new procedure is used as a simulation engine to test the relevance of various scenarios in order to improve the current planning approach of the company. A detailed computational experiment highlights the main contribution of the novel procedure for the company. ...|$|R
50|$|Annick GendronFrom 1968 to 1973 the French artist Annick Gendron used <b>industrial</b> <b>wheels</b> to spin {{paint on}} Plexiglas. At {{the end of}} the 1960s {{she was one of the}} first artist to use {{centrifugal}} force to produce large-sized artworks. Inspired by childrens games : spin art, spin painting, her goal was to transcend this modest use to get the most spectacular effects from it. Damien Hirst got the same idea in the 1990s, as her he transcends the original practice, by the use of more spectacular materials, sizes, shapes, and skill improvement. Her work has been shown at the Raymond Duncan Gallery, at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery, at the Salon des Indépendants and Surindependant at the Musée dArt Moderne de la Ville de Paris, at the Salon des Artistes Français at the Grand Palais and the Salon dAutomne in Paris.|$|R

Dynamic and kinematic structures of quadruped robots are very complex compared to <b>industrial</b> and <b>wheeled</b> robots. In this study inverse kinematics solutions for a quadruped robot with 3 degrees of freedom on each leg are presented. Denavit-Hartenberg D-H method are used for the forward kinematic. The inverse kinematic equations obtained by the geometrical and mathematical methods are coded in MATLAB. And thus a program is obtained that calculate the legs joint angles corresponding to desired various orientations of robot and endpoints of legs. Also the program provides the body orientations of robot in graphical form. The angular positions of joints obtained corresponding to desired different orientations of robot and endpoints of legs are given in this study...|$|R

40|$|Desiccant {{wheels are}} used as an air {{dehumidifier}} in air-conditioning and <b>industrial</b> applications. Desiccant <b>wheel</b> performance determines the size and cost of the whole system. A good desiccant wheel is one that saves energy usage. This article presents an experimental investigation {{on the effects of}} varying the regeneration air temperature, viz., 50, 60 and 70 °C, on desiccant wheel performance. Three performance criteria were considered, namely condition of process outlet air, dehumidifier efficiencies and dehumidification rate. Two kinds of efficiency of the desiccant wheel dehumidifier were examined, namely thermal and dehumidification efficiency. Results of the experiments show that increasing the regeneration air temperature increases the dry bulb temperature of the process outlet air. However the moisture content of the process outlet air is reduced. The dehumidification efficiency of the desiccant wheel decreases with increasing regeneration air temperature, i. e., 46. 7, 45. 8 and 45. 3 % for 50, 60 and 70 °C, respectively. In contrast, the dehumidification rate increases with an increase in the regeneration air temperature, namely 32. 6, 37. 1 and 40. 2 g/h for 50, 60 and 70 °C, respectively...|$|R

The original site of the college, first proposed in 2000 and on approximately 300 acres northeast of Lake Mead Drive and Boulder Highway near downtown Henderson raised environmental concerns as it was approximately one mile from a toxic waste storage facility, which prompted the Nevada Board of Regents in 2001 to select the college's present day site located west of U.S. Highway 95 in {{what was once the}} Wagon <b>Wheel</b> <b>Industrial</b> Park. In June 2000, the Regents requested $5.2 million for start-up costs for the campus and $7 million for instruction costs for its first cohort of students in 2002-03 as well as $43.5 million for capital construction which was to include a library. Nevada Gov. Guinn’s 2001-2003 executive budget, which was developed later in 2000, reduced the Regents' request by recommending [...] "$22.8 million in state funding, 6.8 million to open it to 1,000 full-time students in the fall of 2002, and $16 million to help construct the first campus building.” ...|$|R
40|$|Cemented carbides, often simply termed as hardmetals (WC-Co), are {{heterogeneous}} {{composite materials}} {{consisting of a}} ceramic phase embedded in a metallic binder, with the former providing hardness, wear resistance and the latter presenting toughness. Such an excellent combination of properties and enables them to be perfectly well adapted for tool applications. After sintering, different manufacturing steps need {{to be applied to}} the hardmetal in order to achieve a finished tool which fulfills requirements of real <b>industrial</b> applications. Diamond <b>wheel</b> grinding is one of the machining processes frequently implemented by hardmetal producers for machining the as-sintered hardmetal to tools with a certain subscribed geometry. As a result of this abrasive process, surface integrity changes will be induced, such as: surface texture, micro-cracks, residual stresses and maybe phase transformation. Consequently, such surface integrity alterations will {{play an important role in}} dictating the mechanical and tribological behaviour of the manufactured tool. Under operation, cutting tools often suffer wear phenomena, and small quantities of material are progressively removed from the surface. In assessing the lidding contact behaviour of hard materials, scratch test is one of the most common methods among the options described in the literature. Within the above framework, the main objective of this project is to evaluate the grinding-induced anisotropy effects in terms of damage on scratch resistance and associated failure mechanisms for a WC- 13...|$|R
40|$|Loadstar(pvt) Ltd {{is one of}} {{the leading}} <b>industrial</b> tire, <b>wheel</b> and track {{manufacturers}} in Sri Lanka which started as a small company and became the number one solid tire exporter in the world today. This study was carried out to identify the growth of the company as a result of efficient acquisition and assimilation of technology in line with business strategies. Measuring instruments were designed to assess acquisition of technology knowledge in products and processes as well as the growth stage of acquired technologies and its transfer status to Loadstar. In addition, study focused on assessing acquisition of capabilities such as Design Engineering, R&D, Production and Selling and Servicing. Furthermore, balanced scorecard management tool was used to study the behavior of key business parameters such as Turnover growth, Internal growth in product and technologies, Level of customer satisfaction and growth in employment and training. Literature survey shows the analysis of technology based development of a manufacturing company mainly requires proper understanding of technology components. It also indicates that successful acquisition of identified technologies heavily relies on the level of acquiring core capabilities as well as supporting capabilities. Concepts such as "Technology ball" and "Technology based development of a firm" indicate the acquisition of knowledge and level of technology transfer with time respectively. Study revealed that Loadstar has successfully acquired process technology capabilities from its inception and moved on to acquiring R&D capabilities, especially in material development and bias ply pneumatic tire design after 1998. It was also found that Loadstar's capability in Solid tire product development is quite low,' even though it carries the considerable market share compared to pneumatic tires. Further, study revealed that Loadstar lacks Selling and servicing capability which {{is one of the}} core capabilities to add value to the product. Based on analysis and conclusions, it is recommended that Loadstar need to strengthen its R&D in Solid tire products, as well as company should boost its involvement of innovation and development of radical technologies in its all product groups. Further, process technology should be strengthened by improving work facilitation and modification capabilities. In addition, company should focus on acquiring Selling and Servicing capabilities to work closely with customers to add more value to the product...|$|R
