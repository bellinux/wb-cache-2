5|$|A {{rerouting}} of trunklines in 1941 lead to {{the creation}} of a Business US12 (BUS US12). M-96 ran concurrently with BUS US12 and M-37 was truncated to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> M-96.

M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and BUS US12/M-96 was extended by the end of the decade when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed in the area. BUS US12 was redesignated as Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> BL I-94/M-78 running on Capital Avenue.

5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{used the}} M-13 {{designation}} for a highway {{at the end}} of 1932 that connected M-78 and M-21 through Lennon. By the middle of 1936, the highway had been extended northward to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> a junction with M-46 in Saginaw. The entire trunkline was paved in the middle of 1939. Later the next year, the section in Saginaw was extended a bit farther along Washington Avenue to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> a junction with US10 and US23. A section of the then-M-78 freeway (now I-69) opened between 1958 and 1960; when this freeway opened, M-13 was truncated northwards slightly in the Lennon area to <b>end</b> <b>at</b> the new highway. The first section of the US23 freeway around Bay City opened in late 1960 or early 1961. When it opened, MSHD extended M-13 along the former route of US23 from the northside of Saginaw into Bay City {{to the end of the}} freeway at Kawkawlin. The I-75/US23 freeway north of the Kawkawlin area to Standish opened in 1967, and M-13 is shown on maps following US23's former route through Linwood and Pinconning after the change.
