5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction of violence, and felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting <b>good</b> <b>people.</b> He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E

25|$|Zimbardo's book, The Lucifer Effect, {{gets its}} title from the {{metamorphosis}} of Lucifer into Satan.

Thus, Zimbardo derives this title to explain how <b>good</b> <b>people</b> turn evil. Zimbardo's main assumption on why <b>good</b> <b>people</b> do terrible things is due to situational influences and power given from authority.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} evil is often phrased in the form: Why {{do bad things}} happen to <b>good</b> <b>people?.</b> Christianity teach that all people are {{inherently}} sinful due to the fall of man and original sin; for example, Calvinist theology follows a doctrine called federal headship, which argues that the first man, Adam, was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted this, when he created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.|$|E

25|$|After the 1890 general {{election}} {{for the lower}} house of the Diet of Japan, the elected members proved much less amenable to government persuasion than had been anticipated by Itō Hirobumi {{and other members of}} the Meiji oligarchy. Rather than docilely rubber stamp legislation issued from the House of Peers and the genrō, the leaders of the lower house used the only leverage granted to them under the Meiji Constitution: withholding budgetary approval to show resistance. This stalemate led to earlier than anticipated dissolution of the government and new elections. Emperor Meiji expressed concern that if the same people were elected again, the same problem would recur, and suggested that regional offices encourage <b>good</b> <b>people</b> to run for office.|$|E
