50|$|Forest {{gardening}} {{is a term}} permaculturalists use {{to describe}} systems designed to mimic natural forests. Forest gardens, like other permaculture designs, incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems. The terms <b>forest</b> <b>garden</b> and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature. Numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens, such as Graham Bell, Patrick Whitefield, Dave Jacke, Eric Toensmeier and Geoff Lawton. Bell started building his <b>forest</b> <b>garden</b> in 1991 and wrote the book The Permaculture Garden in 1995, Whitefield wrote the book How to Make a <b>Forest</b> <b>Garden</b> in 2002, Jacke and Toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set Edible Forest Gardening in 2005, and Lawton presented the film Establishing a Food Forest in 2008.|$|E
