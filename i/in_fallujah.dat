5000|$|Al-Amiriyah (العامرية al-ʻāmiriyyah) or Amiriyah Fallujah, also Ameriyah, Amiriyyah, Ameriya, Amiriyat, Ameriyat and the like, {{is a city}} <b>in</b> the <b>Fallujah</b> District of Al Anbar province, about 30 km {{south of}} the city of <b>Fallujah,</b> <b>in</b> Iraq. Ameriyah {{residents}} belong mostly to the Albu Issa subtribe, part of the Dulaim tribe.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{disbanding}} of the Iraqi Army, insurgent activity increased, especially <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah.</b> Initially, armed resistance {{groups could}} {{be characterized as}} either Sunni nationalists who wanted {{to bring back the}} Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E
5|$|Just {{one week}} after the MEF had taken over Anbar, insurgents <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah</b> ambushed a convoy {{carrying}} four American mercenaries from Blackwater USA on 31 March, killing all of them. An angry mob then set the mercenaries' bodies ablaze and dragged their corpses through the streets before hanging them over a bridge crossing the Euphrates. The American media compared the attack on the mercenaries to the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, where images of American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Somalia prompted the United States to withdraw its troops.|$|E
5|$|Al Anbar, {{the only}} Sunni-dominated {{province}} in Iraq, saw little {{fighting in the}} initial invasion. Following the fall of Baghdad it was occupied by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Violence began on 28 April 2003 when 17 Iraqis were killed <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah</b> by U.S. soldiers during an anti-American demonstration. In early 2004 the U.S. Army relinquished command of the province to the Marines. By April 2004 the province was in full-scale revolt. Savage fighting occurred in both Fallujah and Ramadi {{by the end of}} 2004, including the Second Battle of Fallujah. Violence escalated throughout 2005 and 2006 as the two sides struggled to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley. During this time, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. The Marine Corps issued an intelligence report in late 2006 declaring that the province would be lost without a significant additional commitment of troops.|$|E

25|$|From June 29 to 30, the US-led Coalition and the Iraqi Air Force bombed large convoys of ISIL {{vehicles}} {{fleeing the}} Ramadi, Khalidiya Island, and Fallujah areas, after ISIL's recent defeat <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah.</b> The airstrikes destroyed over 150 vehicles and {{killed at least}} 360 ISIL militants.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Fallujah (2016), also {{referred}} to as Third Battle of Fallujah, or Fallujah offensive (2016), code-named Operation Breaking Terrorism (عملية كسر الإرهاب) by the Iraqi government, was a military operation against ISIL launched to capture the city of Fallujah and its suburbs, located about 69 kilometers (40 miles) west of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. The operation began on 22 May 2016, three months after the Iraqi forces had started the total siege of Fallujah. On 26 June, Iraqi forces recaptured the city of Fallujah, before recapturing the remaining pocket of ISIL resistance <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah's</b> western outskirts two days later.|$|R

25|$|The November 2004 anti-insurgent Marine {{operation}} {{in the city of}} Fallujah that took place during the Iraq War, has been compared to the Battle of Hue. Both battles were fought in close quarters in an urban setting where the enemy ensconced itself in the midst of civilians. <b>In</b> <b>Fallujah,</b> Sunni insurgents turned mosques into fortresses, in a similar way to how NVA forces utilized Buddhist temples in Hue. Both battles also had insurgents and other forces utilizing snipers, significantly increasing the combat potential of the combatants, while the Marines also constituted the advanced fighting elements of the US forces deployed in both Hue and Fallujah. Lastly, both battles constituted some of the heaviest fighting that took place in their respective wars. The operation <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah</b> killed 95 U.S. servicemen, while operations in Hue resulted in more than 200 U.S. servicemen being killed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{offensive}} {{was launched}} by insurgents {{during the month}} of November in Mosul. U.S. forces backed by peshmerga fighters launched a counteroffensive which resulted in the Battle of Mosul (2004). The fighting in Mosul occurred concurrently with the fighting <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah</b> and attributed to the high number of American casualties taken that month.|$|E

25|$|The Marines succeeded, recapturing {{the whole}} region and even {{fighting}} insurgents {{all the way to}} the Syrian border, where they were forced to stop (Syrian residents living near the border heard the American bombs very clearly during the operation). The vast majority of these armed and trained insurgents quickly dispersed before the U.S. could bring the full force of its firepower on them, as it did <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah.</b>|$|E
25|$|U.S. marines encircled Fallujah with an earth wall, {{trying to}} control access to the city, {{allowing}} only women and children to leave the city. On 19 June 2004, twenty two Iraqis, among them women and children, {{were killed in a}} U.S. air strike on a residential neighborhood. Allawi condemned the rebellion and called upon the city to surrender Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of the Tawhid-e-Jihad group who is alleged to be hiding <b>in</b> <b>Fallujah,</b> or face aerial bombing by the United States.|$|E
25|$|In April 2004, several Iraqi battalions {{refused to}} fight {{as part of}} the force engaged in the First Battle of Fallujah.

Gen. David Petraeus) with the new focus on providing security for the Iraqi people from the emerging threat posed by the Iraqi insurgency.|$|E
