25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that I had <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.|$|E
25|$|The {{one that}} <b>{{finished}}</b> <b>my</b> career was when I got hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear up, and I {{got back to}} hook and it went between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. After that, I didn't want to be there. I thought of other things I wanted to do in life. Even though I continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't want to be there.|$|E

500|$|In late 1871, Rimsky-Korsakov {{moved into}} Voin's former apartment, and invited Mussorgsky {{to be his}} roommate. The working {{arrangement}} they agreed upon was that Mussorgsky used the piano in the mornings while Rimsky-Korsakov worked on copying or orchestration. When Mussorgsky left for his civil service job at noon, Rimsky-Korsakov then used the piano. Time in the evenings was allotted by mutual agreement. [...] "That autumn and winter {{the two of us}} accomplished a good deal", Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, [...] "with constant exchange of ideas and plans. Mussorgsky composed and orchestrated the Polish act of Boris Godunov and the folk scene 'Near Kromy.' I orchestrated and <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> Maid of Pskov." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1896, Bryan's old teacher, {{former senator}} Trumbull died; {{on the day}} of his funeral, Bryan's mother also died, {{suddenly}} in Salem. [...] Bryan spoke at her funeral, quoting lines from Second Timothy: [...] "I have fought a good fight, I have <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> course, I have kept the faith." [...] He also attended, as a correspondent for the World-Herald, the Republican convention that month in St. Louis. [...] The Republicans, at the request of their nominee for president, former Ohio governor William McKinley, included a plank in their party platform supporting the gold standard. [...] Bryan was deeply moved when, after the adoption of the platform, Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller led a walkout of silver-supporting Republicans. [...] Bryan's biographer, Paolo Coletta, suggests that Bryan may have played a part in inciting the silver men's departure; he was in close contact with Silver Republicans such as Teller and South Dakota Senator Richard Pettigrew. [...] Historian James Barnes wrote of Bryan's preparations: ...|$|E
500|$|Meeker {{was again}} advocating better roads, and gained {{the support of}} Henry Ford, who built him a Model A car with a covered wagon-style top, dubbed the Oxmobile, {{to be used in}} another {{expedition}} over the Trail to publicize Meeker's highway proposals. [...] In October 1928, Meeker was hospitalized with pneumonia in Detroit. [...] He returned to Seattle, where he fell ill again. [...] Meeker was taken to a room in the Frye Hotel, where he told his daughter Ella Meeker Templeton, [...] "I can't go. [...] I have not yet <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> work." [...] Ezra Meeker died there on December 3, 1928, just under a month short of his 98th birthday. [...] His body was taken in procession back to Puyallup, where he was interred beside his wife Eliza Jane in Woodbine Cemetery. [...] Under a plaque based on the Oregon Trail Memorial coin Ezra Meeker had inspired, their gravestone, erected by the OTMA in 1939, reads, [...] "They came this way to win and hold the West".|$|E

500|$|Although Sibelius {{informed}} {{his secretary}} in late August 1945 that the symphony had been burned, the matter remained a secret {{confined to the}} composer's private circle. During the remaining years of his life, Sibelius {{from time to time}} hinted that the Eighth Symphony project was still alive. In August 1945 he wrote to Basil Cameron: [...] "I have <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> eighth symphony several times, but I am still not satisfied with it. I will be delighted to hand it over to you when the time comes." [...] In fact, after the burning he had altogether abandoned creative composing; in 1951, when the Royal Philharmonic Society requested a work to mark the 1951 Festival of Britain, Sibelius declined. As late as 1953 he told his secretary Levas that he was working on the symphony [...] "in his mind"; only in 1954 did he admit, {{in a letter to the}} widow of his friend Adolf Paul, that it would never be completed. Sibelius died on 20 September 1957; the next day his daughter Eva Paloheimo announced publicly that the Eighth Symphony did not exist. The burning of the manuscript became generally known later, when Aino revealed the fact to the composer's biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna.|$|E
500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater." [...] When asked what his [...] "favorite George moment" [...] was, Knight said his relationships with Stevens and Bailey.|$|E
500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E

[...] The eunuchs, however, yelled {{that there was an}} {{emergency}} and the emperor must return to the palace at once. [...] They grabbed Emperor Wenzong's litter, put him on it, and ran north through the roped screen behind Hanyuan Hall (breaking the screen in the process) toward the palace. Li Xun ran after the litter and grabbed it, yelling, [...] "I have not <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> report, and Your Imperial Majesty should not return to the palace!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Rivers became [...] "another and far happier man – diffidence gave {{place to}} confidence, reticence to outspokenness, a {{somewhat}} laboured literary style to one remarkable for ease and charm". He {{is quoted as}} saying [...] "I have <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> serious work and I shall just let myself go." [...] In those post war years, his personality seemed to change dramatically. The man who had been most at home in his study, the laboratory, or the field now dined out a good deal, had joined clubs, went yachting and appeared to welcome rather than shun opportunities for public speaking. Always having been a voracious reader, he now began reading in philosophy, as he had not done for some years, and also in imaginative literature. Not all of his friends from former years welcomed these changes; some felt that, along with his shyness, his scientific caution and good sense may have deserted him to a degree but most people who saw how happy Rivers had become agreed that the slight alterations to his character were for the better.|$|E

2500|$|In 1946, {{he testified}} at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo, {{detailing}} his resentment at {{how he had}} been treated by the Japanese. At the Tokyo trial, Puyi became involved in a lengthy exchange with defense counsel Major Ben Bruce Blakeney about whether he was kidnapped in 1931 or not, which forced Puyi to perjure himself {{by saying that the}} statements in Johnston’s 1934 book Twilight in the Forbidden City about how he had willingly become Emperor of Manchukuo were all lies. When Blakeney mentioned that the introduction to Twilight in the Forbidden City described how Puyi had told Johnston that he had willingly gone to Manchuria in 1931, Puyi perjured himself by saying he was not in contact with Johnston in 1931, and that Johnston made things up for [...] "commercial advantage". The Australian judge, Sir William Webb, the President of the Tribunal, was often frustrated with Puyi's testimony, and chided him numerous times. At one point, when Puyi said [...] "I have not <b>finished</b> <b>my</b> answer yet", causing Webb to say [...] "Well, don't finish it". Behr described Puyi on the stand as a [...] "consistent, self-assured liar, prepared to go to any lengths to save his skin", and as a combative witness more than able to hold his own against the defense lawyers. Puyi was greatly helped as with the exception of Major Blakeney, no one at the trial had actually read Twilight in the Forbidden City or the interviews Woodhead had conducted with him in 1932, which gave Puyi much room to distort what had been written about him or said by him. Puyi greatly respected Johnston, who was a surrogate father to him, and he felt guilty about the way he had repeatedly on the stand in Tokyo called Johnston a dishonest man whose book Twilight in the Forbidden City was full of lies, causing him to pray for the Buddha to ask for atonement for sullying Johnston's name.|$|E
