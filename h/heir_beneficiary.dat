Although the Texas Probate Code provides for a temporary administration {{in the case of}} an immediate need to preserve an estate, the application and court process are not correspondingly responsive.

This Right entitles artists to {{a portion of the}} sale price when their work is resold through an auction house, art gallery or art dealer, however there are certain conditions which govern an artist’s entitlement to benefit from this Right. DACS collects resale royalties on behalf of its artist members and those that do not join another collecting society.

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{internal}} revenue taxes, transfer taxes {{are the most}} uncertain in terms of revenue generation because transfer taxes are levies directly affecting the passing on of wealth and property of a taxpayer to his <b>heirs</b> and <b>beneficiaries.</b> These are comprised of the estate and donor’s taxes. The estate tax (Section 85, NIRC of 1997, as amended) is imposed on {{the transfer of the}} decedent’s estate to his lawful <b>heirs</b> and <b>beneficiaries</b> based on the fair market value or the zonal value of real property whichever is higher at the time of death. It is a tax on the privilege to transmit property upon death. The donor’s tax (Section 98, NIRC of 1997, as amended) on the other hand, is levied on the transfer by any person, resident or non-resident, of the property by way of gift. The transfer tax system was designed with the end in view of redistributing wealth i. e., to encourage the break-up of big estates and bring about their immediate transfer to others so that greater productivity may be achieved. The imposition of the estate tax is justified based on the estate-partnership theory which provides that the estate tax represents the share of the State as a passive and silent partner in the accumulation of property by the decedent. The State is regarded as an extraordinary compulsory heir of the decedent, practically taking precedence over the legitimate heirs in the distribution of the decedent’s assets. 1 The negligible ratio of transfer taxes to the revenue collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue {{in the last two decades}} in spite of the institution of major reforms brings to the fore the apparent need t...|$|R

50|$|According to the Bulgarian {{legislation}} regulating local taxes, {{succession tax}} is levied on estate succeeded by law or by will within Bulgaria or abroad by Bulgarian citizens {{as well as}} on the estate located within Bulgaria succeeded by foreign nationals. The succeeded estate includes the movable and immovable property owned by the decedent and the rights over such property, as well as their other property rights, receivables and liabilities at the time of opening of the succession, unless otherwise provided by legislative statute. The inherited estate is subject to deductions as to the obligations and tax reliefs laid down in Bulgarian law, or in those cases where it is inherited by the state.Art. 38 lists the types of property that are tax free:• property passed to the State or municipalities;• ordinary household furnishings;• pensions not received by the decedent;• estate of Bulgarian citizens located abroad to which the succession tax of the respective state has applied.Taxable persons are:• heirs by law, such that as of 2004, succession tax in Bulgaria does not apply to the surviving spouse and the lineal heirs;• testamentary <b>heirs,</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and legatees;• stateless persons are subject to the succession tax for inherited estate on the territory of Bulgaria, if the person in question has been permanently resident within the territory of Bulgaria (Art. 29 LTFA).The heirs may waive the succession through a unilateral act and as a result, they are subject to the succession tax. The waiver needs to be express, written and recorded in a specific book at the District Court. In case there is more than one heir, the tax is due in accordance with their share, and the taxable amount depends on the degree of kinship and the size of the inherited share. The tax is determined and communicated to each co-heir - Art. 106 and Art. 107 TIPC.|$|R

Documents released in the late 20th century indicate that the British Government knew that Brooke was not involved, but chose not to reveal {{the truth of the matter}} so not to provoke Indonesia. It had recently won its war of independence from the Netherlands, and the UK was already dealing with the Malayan Emergency to the north-west.

50|$|In 1910, the Shrady Family {{successfully}} claimed {{two thirds}} of the Appley estate (worth nearly $1 million {{at the time of the}} settlement) finally resolving a legal battle that was initiated in the 1860s. The founder of the estate was Jacob Appley, the son of a German immigrant who started out as a butcher. In the early 1800s he made a big score by cornering the mutton market and he began investing in properties around the lower east side on Eldridge, Delancey, Forsyth, Bayard, and First Streets. When he died in 1840 he left the estate, which included about 40 houses, in trust for his only son, Jacob Alexander Appley (Jacob A.). The trust document, one of the earliest of its kind, provided Jacob A. with the income from the estate for life and saved the properties to be distributed to Jacob A's issue (children) after his death. In case no issue existed the trust named old Jacob's sister Barbara (Shrady) and her <b>heirs</b> as the <b>beneficiaries.</b> As Barbara's grandson, Dr. George Frederick Shrady was one potential beneficiary.|$|R
40|$|The Article {{addresses}} the frequently litigated {{issue of the}} ownership of joint bank accounts that elderly people may have opened to protect against incapacity or to avoid FDIC insurance limits on single accounts. Despite the strong possibility of these non-donative motives, most states—by statute or court decision—award the accounts to the surviving co-tenants instead of the depositors’ <b>heirs</b> or will <b>beneficiaries.</b> This occurs even when the account contract did not contain language of survivorship and even {{when there is no}} evidence that the depositor was offered a contract that would have allowed him or her to choose an agency arrangement. The author argues that these presumptions in favor of survivorship rights exist because of a faulty analogy to other will substitutes such as life insurance, where donative intent is clear. The author also examines the few statutory account forms that purport to allow depositors to express various intents. These forms are hopelessly complex for a depositor without legal training and propose a simpler deposit account agreement that would allow a depositor to clearly indicate whether donative intent exists...|$|R

At {{that point the}} closest female descendant inherited as Duchess, with her husband serving as Duke by [...] "right of representation". The position of John of Montfort was legally founded {{on the belief that}} a brother (even a half-brother) was a closer <b>heir</b> than a <b>beneficiary</b> niece, and that the Salic form of inheritance adopted by the Kingdom of France should be followed. This argument was {{based on the fact that}} since 1297 Brittany had been a Duché-pairie ("member and part of the crown"), and that the legislation of the suzerain kingdom should therefore be applied. [...] Challenges to the Salic law of the Franks had historically been rejected for the Kingdom of France, allowing Philip V to gain the throne in 1316, and Philip VI most recently. This made Edward III's support of John of Montfort quite ironic, in that the argument for Edward III to inherit the Kingdom of France was based on the opposing philosophy that the crown should be able to descend through a female line.|$|R

5000|$|Vollard's former {{secretary}} and protegé, Erich Šlomović, a young Serb with Jewish origins (b. 1915), had connections with Vollard, Fabiani {{as well as}} Lucien Vollard since about 1938. He had often stated his wish to create a museum of French art collected by him in Yugoslavia. Šlomović had amassed a collection of about 600 works, most of them prints or drawings, with a few important oil paintings, {{by a combination of}} exchange, gift, purchase and donation. Vollard had put him in direct contact with the most prominent artists of the day and often asked him to act as agent for art selling or purchasing purposes. Beginning of 1940, Šlomović put about 200 works in storage in a Societe Generale bank branch vault in Paris. Returning home with about 450 of these works, he exhibited them in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1940. With the advance of German armies in Serbia, he went into hiding, along with his brother Egon, and his father and mother Roza. They placed the paintings in crates behind the wall of a farmhouse in the Southern Serbian village of Bacina. Šlomović, his brother and father were soon arrested, and, like many other Jews in occupied Serbia, killed by the Nazi Germans in 1942 in Belgrade. After the war these were appropriated by the Yugoslav authorities. They were shown officially only once in 1989 in Belgrade and Zagreb under the name [...] "Slomovic Collection". A legal battle is currently (2014) underway to determine the ownership of the Belgrade collection, including the Šlomović <b>heirs,</b> the Vollard <b>beneficiaries</b> and the Serbian government.|$|R
40|$|This volume {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the testamentary practices of women in medieval and early modern France, examining {{the experience of a}} cross-section of the population, from artisans to the elite, in Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, Marseille, Montpellier, La Rochelle, Brittany, and Burgundy. The making of a will was perhaps the single most prominent moment in women’s lives for the assertion of agency. Though constrained to some degree by customary practice and the increasing influence of Roman law, women demonstrated remarkable initiative in the formulation of their last wishes. Wills permitted women to reward friendship and loyalty, to designate universal <b>heirs</b> as major <b>beneficiaries,</b> to stipulate conditions of inheritance so that last wishes were carried out, and, perhaps most importantly, to make pious donations to the Church for the salvation of the testators’ souls. They chose their burial sites and arranged for funeral processions, and they endowed anniversary masses for their souls in perpetuity. Individual testamentary decisions differed, as did spousal strategies, but the reinforcement of family ties, even the assertion of relationship, was possible in wills.
