To attain this objective, two surveys {{were conducted with}} public contracting authorities and <b>economic</b> <b>operators,</b> in 2010 and 2012 respectively. The main contribution of this exploratory {{research study}} was to demonstrate the distinct over time perspective of public contracting authorities and <b>economic</b> <b>operators</b> and evidence that <b>economic</b> <b>operators</b> are the most vulnerable to electronic market dynamics. The research study conducted shows that {{the vulnerability of the}} <b>economic</b> <b>operators</b> results from their susceptibility to excessive price-based competition and from the additional e-procurement costs introduced by e- procurement service providers. However, in general, it is relevant to highlight that public e-procurement have a global positive impact on public contracting authorities and <b>economic</b> <b>operators</b> and in both cases it resulted in a perception of increased transparency in the purchasing procedures of public entities...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} <b>means</b> of positive <b>operators</b> on a Hilbert space. We extend the theory of matrix power <b>means</b> to arbitrary <b>operator</b> <b>means</b> {{in the sense of}} Kubo-Ando. The basis of the extension is relying on ideas coming from differential geometry. We consider generalized Karcher equations for positive operators and show that such equations admit unique positive solutions that can be obtained as a limit of one-parameter families of <b>operator</b> <b>means</b> called induced <b>operator</b> <b>means.</b> These means are themselves unique fixed points of one parameter families of strict contractions induced, through Kubo-Ando theory of <b>operator</b> <b>means,</b> by semigroups of holomorphic functions mapping the upper half-plane into itself. These semigroups of holomorphic functions are considered with Koenigs function corresponding to Schroeder's functional equation. Koenigs function in this setting provides us with a logarithm map corresponding to every 2 -variable <b>operator</b> <b>mean.</b> The semigroups of 2 -variable means behave as geodesics and we exactly classify the cases when they are indeed geodesics of affinely connected manifolds, thereby providing the cases when these generalized Karcher equations are exactly Karcher equations in the geometric sense. This is achieved by studying the arising holonomy groups. The unique solutions of these generalized Karcher equations are called lambda extensions and have numerous desirable properties which are inherited from the induced <b>operator</b> <b>means</b> themselves.
