The <b>fire</b> extinguisher <b>handles</b> also have the effect of cutting off power to the fuel switches, meaning that the fuel may continue to flow – a potentially dangerous situation. The report restated a previous Boeing Service Bulletin giving procedural advice that fuel switches should be operated before <b>fire</b> <b>handles.</b> It went on: [...] "This was not causal to the accident but could have had serious consequences {{in the event of a}} fire during the evacuation." ...|$|R

50|$|Once the {{inflatable}} {{survival suit}} {{has been put}} on and zipped shut, the wearer activates <b>firing</b> <b>handles</b> on compressed carbon dioxide cartridges, which punctures the cartridges and rapidly inflates the suit. This results in a highly buoyant, rigid shape that also offers very high thermal retention properties.|$|R
25|$|Operating {{the face}} blind <b>firing</b> <b>handle</b> {{initiated}} <b>firing</b> {{of the main}} gun located {{at the rear of}} the seat, the main gun being a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fired in sequence. As the seat moved up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply was activated.|$|R
25|$|The Mk.9 seat is {{considered}} by the manufacturer as the culmination of their earlier designs. It features only one <b>firing</b> <b>handle</b> (the face blind handle being deleted) and a new explosive gas system to operate canopy jettison, harness retraction and main gun firing, dispensing with previous mechanical systems of rods or cables.|$|R
50|$|The A-10, F-15, F-117, B-1, and B-2 use {{connected}} <b>firing</b> <b>handles</b> that activate {{both the}} canopy jettison systems, and the seat ejection. Both handles accomplish the same task, so pulling either one suffices. The F-22, WB-57, and F-16 {{have only one}} handle located between the pilot's legs, due to cockpit space limitations.|$|R
5000|$|The design, as patented, {{consists}} of nine fixed barrels {{attached to a}} limbers and caissons. The weapon was loaded with a cylinder containing nine rounds of ammunition, arranged so that the rounds lined up with the barrels of the weapon. A <b>firing</b> <b>handle</b> was then attached, which locked the cylinder into place.|$|R
25|$|Operating {{the face}} blind <b>firing</b> <b>handle</b> initiates <b>firing</b> {{of the main}} gun located {{at the rear of}} the seat, the main gun is a {{telescopic}} tube with two explosive charges that fire in sequence. As the seat moves up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply is activated and personal equipment tubing and communication leads are automatically disconnected.|$|R
25|$|James Martin {{was very}} {{concerned}} by this development and worked hard to reduce the peak acceleration loads felt by the occupant, the solution was to use a second charge firing in sequence and alterations to the seat to provide a posture that would protect the spine. Foot rests and a face blind <b>firing</b> <b>handle</b> were added.|$|R

The report restated a previous Boeing Service Bulletin giving procedural advice that fuel switches should be operated before <b>fire</b> <b>handles.</b> It went on: [...] "This was not causal to the accident but could have had serious consequences {{in the event of a}} fire during the evacuation."Indeed, the need to issue Safety Recommendation 2008-009, affecting all 777 airframes which had yet to incorporate the Boeing Service Bulletin (SB 777-28-0025) - as was the case with G-YMMM - was given as the main reason for issuing the first special bulletin, well before the accident investigation itself was complete.|$|R

Modifications were also made to the checklist, including adding to the checklist confirmation that the <b>fire</b> <b>handles</b> had been pulled.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is {{provided}} by Airport Operations Crews. The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), {{two of which are}} in service full-time. The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies. All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments. For example, the Purchase <b>Fire</b> Department <b>handles</b> all structure calls on {{the southern part of the}} airfield, the Armonk <b>Fire</b> Department <b>handles</b> calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester <b>Fire</b> Department <b>handle</b> all calls on the east end, including the main terminal. EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.|$|R

50|$|The ACES II {{ejection}} seat {{is used in}} most American-built fighters. The A-10 uses connected <b>firing</b> <b>handles</b> that activate both the canopy jettison systems, followed by the seat ejection. The F-15 has the same connected system as the A-10 seat. Both handles accomplish the same task, so pulling either one suffices. The F-16 has only one handle located between the pilot's knees, since the cockpit is too narrow for side-mounted handles.|$|R

(For example: When a person goes to the aid of a victim of a gunshot wound, some GSR particles can transfer from the victim.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Mk.10 seat is a {{development}} of the Mk.9. Like the Mk.9 it features only one <b>firing</b> <b>handle</b> (the face blind handle being deleted), use of the explosive gas system was extended to operate the drogue gun and harness release system. Arm restraint lines and command ejection capability were new additions. For ease of maintenance the Mk.10 was designed with modular assemblies, avoiding the need to remove the whole seat from the aircraft for minor servicing tasks.|$|R

25|$|On January 21, 1998 a Continental Express ATR-42, N15827, had an {{emergency}} during roll on landing. During the landing roll, a fire {{erupted in the}} right engine. The airplane was stopped on the runway, the engines were shut down and the occupants evacuated. The <b>fire</b> <b>handles</b> for both engines were pulled and both fire bottles on the right engine discharged. However, {{the fire in the}} right engine continued to burn. The airport fire services attended shortly afterward and extinguished the fire.|$|R

50|$|The new firing {{mechanism}} {{involved a}} new , which was {{inserted into the}} axial breech vent. The crosspiece of the T was positioned pointing upwards. A long layer's guard {{was added to the}} left side of the cradle projecting behind the breech. A spring-loaded <b>firing</b> <b>handle</b> was built into the layer's guard. When cocked by pulling back and then releasing, it sprang forward and struck a firing lever on the breech, which translated the forward motion to a downward motion and propelled a firing plunger into the T of the friction tube which in turn ignited the cordite propellant charge.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991 {{a further}} {{variant of the}} MP5K was developed, {{designated}} the MP5K-PDW (PDW—Personal Defense Weapon) that retained the compact dimensions of the MP5K but restored the <b>fire</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics of the full-size MP5A2. The MP5K-PDW uses a side-folding synthetic shoulder stock (made by the U.S. company Choate Machine and Tool), a [...] "Navy" [...] trigger group, a front sight post with a built-in tritium insert and a slightly lengthened threaded, three-lug barrel (analogous to the MP5-N). The stock can be removed and replaced with a receiver endplate; a rotary drum with apertures from the MP5A2 can also be used.|$|R
5000|$|The M37 {{was also}} {{adopted by the}} Portuguese armed forces, who placed it into service as the Metralhadora pesada 7,92 mm m/938 Breda heavy machine gun. The Breda saw {{extensive}} service in Portugal's African colonies {{during the early stages}} of the Portuguese Colonial Wars. [...] The Breda Modello 38 was intended for vehicle use, and was fed from a top-mounted box magazine. The Modello 38 used a pistol style grip, rather than the twin <b>firing</b> <b>handles</b> of the Modello 37. This was the main vehicle-mounted machine gun used in fighting vehicles by the Royal Italian Army.|$|R

As the seat moved up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply was activated.As the seat moved further up and out of the aircraft a lanyard attached to the cockpit floor fired a steel rod, known as the drogue gun, this extracted two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. The occupant then released themselves from the seat harness and operated the main parachute manually by pulling a ripcord.|$|R
