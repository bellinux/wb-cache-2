25|$|In 1982, the International Skating Union {{enacted a}} rule stating that a skater may perform {{each type of}} triple only once, or twice {{if one of them}} is {{incorporated}} into a combination or sequence. For a set of jumps to be considered a combination, each jump must take off from the landing edge of the previous jump, with no steps, turns, or change of edge in between jumps. Toe loops and loops are commonly performed as the second or third jump in a combination because they take off from the back outside edge of the landing foot, or skating leg. To perform a salchow or flip on the back end of a combination, a <b>half</b> <b>loop</b> (which is actually a full rotation, but lands on a back inside edge of the landing leg) may be used as a connecting jump. In contrast, jump sequences are sets of jumps which may be linked by non-listed jumps or hops. Sequences are worth 80% of what the same jumps executed in combination would be worth.|$|E
25|$|The Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), or toss bombing, tactic {{was first}} made public {{in front of}} a crowd of 3,000 {{including}} 11 state governors on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B–47 Stratojet entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a <b>half</b> <b>loop,</b> releasing its bomb under computer control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target. The development of this system at Eglin dated to at least mid-1955 under Project Back Breaker. The unintended consequence of this tactic would be a series of crashes by B-47s in early 1958 caused by stress-induced cracks which caused the bombers to shed their wings. A fleet-wide inspection and repair program known as Milk Bottle was begun in May 1958 which led to no fewer than nine Technical Orders, with most aircraft cycled through the program by October 1958.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} a new <b>half</b> hitch <b>loop</b> suture configuration on flexor tendon repair mechanics. Cadaver canine flexor digitorum profundus tendons were repaired with 4 - or 8 -strands, 4 - 0 or 3 - 0 suture, with and without <b>half</b> hitch <b>loops.</b> An additional group underwent repair with <b>half</b> hitch <b>loops</b> but without the terminal knot. <b>Half</b> hitch <b>loops</b> improved the strength of 8 -strand repairs by 21 % when 4 - 0, and 33 % when 3 - 0 suture was used, and caused a shift in failure mode from suture pullout to suture breakage. 8 -strand repairs with <b>half</b> hitch <b>loops</b> but without a terminal knot produced equivalent mechanical properties to those without <b>half</b> hitch <b>loops</b> but with a terminal knot. 4 -strand repairs were limited by the strength of the suture in all groups and, as a result, the presence of <b>half</b> hitch <b>loops</b> did not alter the mechanical properties. Overall, <b>half</b> hitch <b>loops</b> improved repair mechanics, allowing failure strength to reach the full capability of suture strength. Improving the mechanical properties of flexor tendon repair with <b>half</b> hitch <b>loops</b> has the potential to reduce the postoperative risk of gap formation and catastrophic rupture in the early postoperative period...|$|R

500|$|After {{leaving the}} station, the train turns 180 {{degrees to the}} right, then begins to climb the chain lift hill at 40 degrees. Once the train reaches {{the top of the}} [...] lift, it enters the first element called the [...] "Wing Over Drop". The train rotates 180 degrees before {{descending}} [...] in a <b>half</b> <b>loop.</b> During this drop, the train reaches its maximum speedand riders experience about 4 Gs. After leaving the first drop, the train immediately enters an Immelmann loop almost directly under the lift hill. After the loop, the train turns right into the only camelback hill, which is [...] high. Riders experience about two seconds of weightlessness on the hill. Next, the train goes through a giant flat spin, followed by a zero-g roll which features two keyhole points as it passes through two -tall towers. The train then returns to the ground and goes through an inclined dive loop, which is the turn-around point of the roller coaster. Next, the train rotates 360 degrees in an inline twist, which passes the two towers. The train then turns slightly left before entering the mid-course brake run. The train drops to the ground before ascending again and enters a 360-degree downward helix. The train then traverses a small hill before turning left into the final brake run which leads back to the station.|$|E

Recent atomic simulation of <b>half</b> <b>loops</b> emission from surface steps and experimental evidences of anisotropic relaxation of GaInAs films deposited on vicinal (111) GaAs substrates strongly support surface steps as preferential sites for nucleation. In low temperature buffer layer structures (SiGe/Si) an original dislocation structure is observed which corresponds to the dislocation emission in different glide systems by a unique nucleation centre. ...|$|R
