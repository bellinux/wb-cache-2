Internal waves in a continuously stratified medium may propagate vertically {{as well as}} horizontally. The dispersion relation <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>waves</b> is curious: For a freely-propagating internal wave packet, the direction of propagation of energy (group velocity) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave crests and troughs (phase velocity). An internal wave may also become confined to a finite region of altitude or depth, {{as a result of}} varying stratification or wind. Here, the wave is said to be ducted or trapped, and a vertically standing wave may form, where the vertical component of group velocity approaches zero. A ducted internal wave mode may propagate horizontally, with parallel group and phase velocity vectors, analogous to propagation within a waveguide.|$|E
50|$|The authors {{believed}} that the Turkish experience {{in the process of}} adoption and harmonization to the Copenhagen political criteria of the European Union is a case that successfully portrays this method. The paper also argued that democracy is in fact about striking of a modus vivendi between the processes of institutionalization and participation. Participation prior to institutionalization does not necessarily lead to democracy. Institutionalization and participation should co-exist. The establishment of constitutional liberties is {{the sine qua non of}} liberal democracy. In cases where political participation via elections takes place prior to the establishment of such liberties, illiberal democracy would be the outcome. Such a view may be disillusioning for impatient demands from below for democratization. Nevertheless, it contains viable “transitional” suggestions for the region in achieving sustainable democracy. Yet, rather than emphasizing a dilemma and a necessity of establishing sequences between institutionalization and participation, one should focus on the coexistence of these two dimensions of the democratization processes. The parameters of this coexistence would differ from one society to another. Universal democratic minimums involve the achievement and securing of constitutional liberties via institutionalization, the functioning of free and competitive elections as well as the establishment of functioning channels between civil societal organizations and political parties. In order <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>waves</b> prompted by civil societal organizations to lead to a democratic disclosure, there has to be a functioning political realm. A functioning political realm refers to a strong parliament with effective political parties. What is significant in the Middle East is not necessarily the establishment of more civil society organizations but rather the strengthening of the channels of communication between civil society and the parliament. Consequently, democratization initiatives in the region should strengthen the parliament while lending credence to civil society.|$|E

We identify the loops with the ephemeral regions (small-scale bipoles) observed by ground-based instruments and by SOHO. To characterize the loops we employ the concept of a minimum energy state for topologically complex fields. Emerging loops release energy relaxing to the minimum state. Relaxation along the minimum state–due to a competition between footpoint twisting by photospheric motions and reconnections inside the loops – releases blinks of energy into the solar atmosphere.

Further compression destroys the wave; electrons are then untrapped at suprathermal energies and form a residual beam. As compression continues, the bump-on-tail instability is triggered each time one of the discrete modes comes in resonance with this beam. Hence, periodic bursts of the electrostatic energy are produced until a wide quasilinear plateau is formed...|$|E

40|$|Waves with constant, nonzero linearized {{frequency}} form {{an interesting}} class of nondispersive waves whose properties {{differ from those}} of nondispersive hy-perbolic waves. We propose an inviscid Burgers-Hilbert equation as a model equation <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>waves,</b> and give a dimensional argument to show that it mod-els Hamiltonian surface waves with constant frequency. Using the method of multiple scales, we derive a cubically nonlinear, quasilinear, nonlocal asymp-totic equation for weakly nonlinear solutions. We show that exactly the same asymptotic equation describes surface waves on a planar discontinuity in vortic-ity in two-dimensional inviscid, incompressible fluid flows. Thus, the Burgers-Hilbert equation provides an effective equation for these waves. We describe the Hamiltonian structure of the Burgers-Hilbert and asymptotic equations, and show that the asymptotic equation may be also be derived by means of a near-identity transformation. We derive a semi-classical approximation of the asymptotic equation, and show that spatially periodic, harmonic travel-ing waves are linearly and modulationaly stable. Numerical solutions of the Burgers-Hilbert and asymptotic equations are in excellent agreement in the appropriate regime. In particular, the lifespan of small-amplitude smooth so-lutions of the Burgers-Hilbert equation is given by the cubically nonlinear timescale predicted by the asymptotic equation...|$|E
30|$|For {{the model}} {{with the water}} layer, we should {{consider}} an interface wave (frequently called Scholte waves; Scholte, 1958) instead of a surface Rayleigh wave. Van Vossen et al. (2002) compared FD simulations with analytical solutions <b>for</b> <b>such</b> <b>waves</b> for two simple cases: (1) with flat water-solid interface and (2) with an inclined interface. These authors recommended using at least 15 grid points per wavelength for {{the case of an}} inclined interface to reduce possible errors that increase with increasing dipping angle. Our grid scheme follows this recommendation at periods of maximum amplitudes that are around 3 s. Moreover, due to the smoothness of the model, the maximum dipping angle of the bottom interface is small enough (5 °; see, for example, Fig. 3 (a) or Fig. 4). A more detailed study was performed by Okamoto and Takenaka (2005) who compared FDM and the discrete wavenumber method (DWM) simulation results. Their recommendations are stricter: 60 grid points per wavelength, and second order staggered grid scheme should be applied {{in the vicinity of the}} watersolid interface. We should mention that in most simulation cases, higher amplitudes are obtained for FDM simulations than for DWM simulations. In our case, correction of the calculation method according to the recommendations of Okamoto and Takenaka (2005) could result in slightly smaller amplitudes on Fig. 5 (a), right panel.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe plasma {{dispersion}} {{function and}} the reduced velocity distribution function are calculated numerically for any arbitrary velocity distribution function with cylindrical symmetry along the magnetic field. The electron velocity distribution is separated into two distributions representing {{the distribution of}} the ambient electrons and the suprathermal electrons. The velocity distribution function of the ambient electrons is modelled by a near-Maxwellian distribution function in presence of a temperature gradient and a potential electric field. The velocity distribution function of the suprathermal electrons is derived from a numerical model of the angular energy flux spectrum obtained by solving the transport equation of electrons. The numerical method used to calculate the plasma dispersion function and the reduced velocity distribution is described. The numerical code is used with simulated data to evaluate the Doppler frequency asymmetry between the up- and downshifted plasma lines of the incoherent-scatter plasma lines at different wave vectors. It is shown that the observed Doppler asymmetry is more dependent on deviation from the Maxwellian through the thermal part for high-frequency radars, while for low-frequency radars the Doppler asymmetry depends more on the presence of a suprathermal population. It is also seen that the full evaluation of the plasma dispersion function gives larger Doppler asymmetry than the heat flow approximation for Langmuir waves with phase velocity about three to six times the mean thermal velocity. <b>For</b> <b>such</b> <b>waves</b> the moment expansion of the dispersion function is not fully valid and the full calculation of the dispersion function is needed...|$|E
