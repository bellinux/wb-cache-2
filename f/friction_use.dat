40|$|Urban {{mobility}} {{systems are}} composed multiple elements with strong interactions, i. e. their future is co-determined {{by the state}} of other elements. Thus, studying components in isolation, i. e. using a reductionist approach, is inappropriate. I propose five recommendations to improve urban mobility based on insights from the scientific study of complex systems: use adaptation over prediction, regulate interactions to avoid <b>friction,</b> <b>use</b> sensors to recover real time information, develop adaptive algorithms to exploit that information, and deploy agents to act on the urban environment.

40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} {{experimental}} data that were collected through a crash avoidance experiment (which was lead by Professor Lennart Strandberg) in February and March 1990. Fifty-two ordinary drivers {{were instructed to}} perform two different kinds of manoeuvres on ice to determine the effectiveness of antilock brakes and of four tyre configurations. Results were reported at the 1991 ESV Conference. The first aim of this master thesis is to check and revise the measured data (used by Prof. Strandberg in courses at Linköping University). Checking out many hours of video recordings from onboard cameras reveals various protocol inconsistencies and errors, which {{in some cases it}} is not possible to correct. This work might increase the reliability of any further analysis of these data. The second aim is to elaborate on the revised data and to test the hypothesis that quick steering is a key factor to not lose control of the car during a crash avoidance manoeuvre. Different variables are introduced and used to estimate the steering wheel velocity and lateral <b>friction</b> <b>use.</b> The results show linear (positive) correlations between lateral <b>friction</b> <b>use</b> and steering wheel velocity. The greatest steering wheel velocities appear in the tests with loss-of-control and reach values up to 1180 degrees per second. However, the 1990 experimental layout was not intended for this type of research questions and it seems difficult to determine the causal relationship between quick steering and control of the car. Some cases of excessive steering input might have occurred. The results indicate that quick steering by itself is not enough to guarantee the total control of the car. An early reaction to the skid might be necessary too. Evidently, further research is needed...|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the diverse metals and the manners of their working by the <b>friction</b> <b>use.</b> The {{purposes}} are {{to study the}} frictional process at the high speeds and at the high temperatures, to choose the optimum modes for the diverse types of frictional working of metals. The interdependences between the main variables of high-speed friction (among them are the speed of sliding, the pressure, the temperature, the coefficient of friction, the wear) have been ascertained. The brought-out new dependences of high-speed friction allow to optimize the variables of mode of diverse types of frictional working of metals. The cutting of metals by the frictional saws, the welding of metals by friction, the control of frictional forces during the working are introduced. The application fields are the metallurgical industry (the frictional saws), the machine-building, the tool industry (the frictional welding) Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of an ongoing}} investigation into modeling friction in fluidized dense-phase pneumatic transport of bulk solids. Many popular modeling methods of the solids <b>friction</b> <b>use</b> the dimensionless solids loading ratio and Froude number. When evaluated under proper scale-up conditions of pipe diameter and length, many of these models have resulted in significant inaccuracy. A technique for modeling solids friction has been developed using a new combination of dimensionless numbers, volumetric loading ratio and the ratio of particle free settling velocity to superficial conveying air velocity, to replace the solids loading ratio and Froude number. The models developed using the new formalism were evaluated for accuracy and stability under significant scale-up conditions for four different products conveyed through four different test rigs (subject to diameter and length scale-up conditions). The new model considerably improves predictions compared with those obtained using the existing model, especially in the dense-phase region. Whereas the latter yields absolute average relative errors varying between 10 % and 86 %, the former yielded results with errors from 4 % to 20 % {{for a wide range}} of scale-up conditions. This represents a more reliable and narrower range of prediction that is suitable for industrial scale-up requirements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The paper {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of rectilinear {{motion of the}} snake robot. Considering that snake robot locomotion is based on friction forces between robot and its environment, the basic friction models are introduced. For study the experimental snake robot LocoSnake is used. At first, by mechanic laws the propulsive forces affecting segment of snake robot are determined. By means of mathematical analysis the average velocity of snake robot is derived. Since the number of snake robot segments has influence on robot average velocity, the optimal number of segments for maximum velocity is derived. In the next section the influence of dry and viscous friction on moving segment are described. At last the experimental analysis of three kinds of surfaces are done, namely dry <b>friction,</b> viscous <b>friction</b> <b>using</b> oil and viscous <b>friction</b> <b>using</b> lubricant. The measurements by means of measuring I/O card MF 624 was done. In the conclusion the differences between these surfaces are described and discussed. The contribution of the paper is determination of influence of surface change on the snake robot rectilinear locomotion...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether greater microeconomic flexibility facilitates {{the process of}} creative destruction {{in the context of}} new trade models with heterogeneous firms (Bernard et al., 2003 and Melitz, 2003). In these models, freer trade increases aggregate productivity because high-efficiency firms expand through exporting and low-efficiency firms exit the market. However, factor reallocation could be negatively affected by the presence of microeconomic <b>frictions.</b> We <b>use</b> these insights of the theory to analyze whether a reduction in trade costs increases the probability of becoming an exporter relatively more in industries with greater microeconomic flexibility and whether plant exit driven by trade costs declines is more likely in industries with lower <b>frictions.</b> <b>Using</b> plant level data from Venezuela, we report results supporting these predictions.
