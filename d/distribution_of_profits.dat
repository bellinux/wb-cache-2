We find that marginal returns to budgets and opening screens vary over the domain of these variables.

25|$|A {{dividend}} is {{a payment}} {{made by a}} corporation to its shareholders, usually as a <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits.</b> When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, the corporation is able to re-invest the profit in the business (called retained earnings) and pay a proportion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually a deposit into a bank account) or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or share repurchase.|$|E

2500|$|The Marxian {{controversy}} about the so-called transformation problem began with Friedrich Engels's preface and supplement to his edition of Marx's third volume of Capital in 1894. Engels realized very well, {{that there were}} unsolved issues in Marx's theory of value and capital, and he had previously invited other economists to help solve them. Already before the third volume was first published, Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, German socialists like Conrad Schmidt and various Italian authors were critically assessing the implications of Marx's theory. But Engels himself died in 1895. Subsequently, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and his critic Ladislaus Bortkiewicz (himself influenced by Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev) claimed that Marx's argument about the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> from newly produced surplus value is mathematically faulty. This {{gave rise to a}} lengthy academic controversy. Critics claimed, that Marx failed reconcile the law of value with the reality of the distribution of capital and profits, a problem that had already preoccupied David Ricardo – who failed to solve it. Although Marx himself had noted this problem in Capital, Volume I and said that [...] "many intermediate terms are still needed" [...] to solve it, and although Engels suggested that Marx had indeed solved it, critics alleged Marx never delivered a credible solution in the posthumous third volume. Specifically, critics claimed that Marx failed to prove that labor-time is the regulator of product-prices within capitalist production, since he failed to demonstrate what exactly the quantitative connection was between the two. As a corollary, Marx's theory of the TRPF was undermined as well, since it was based on a necessary long-term evolution of value-proportions between the composition of production capital and the yield of production capital.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{systematic}} attempt to investigate two conjectures about the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> company rates of profit: {{that it should}} be log-normal (Gibrat 1931), and {{that it should be}} gamma distributed (Farjoun and Machover 1983). A large set of company accounts data is analysed, and partial support found for Gibrat and for a generalised version of Farjoun and Machover. The analysis includes a demonstration <b>of</b> different empirical <b>distributions</b> for different profit rate measures, a demonstration of power law tails in all measures <b>of</b> the <b>profit</b> rate, and a demonstration of size effects (differences in tail weights) in financial ratios. Annual variation in the overall skewness and kurtosis <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> rate <b>distributions</b> is shown to be dominated by variation in the power law tails. L -moments, a recent innovation in robust methods to deal with extreme values, are used in conjunction with a size-weighted sampling scheme to identify possible models for <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>profit</b> rate at the capital level. Farjoun and Machover derive their hypothesis from a particular conception of the process of capitalist competition. A rival conception, that of Glick (1985), is tested using company accounts data and shown to be vulnerable to criticism concerning the scope of its data set, the test statistic employed, and its choice <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> rate measure. More fundamentally, it is also dependent on doubtful premises about the within-industry <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> rates, as L-moment analysis demonstrates.
