Use of anti-scattered grid and of magnification will increase presumably {{but it is too}} early to assess the place of the other methods in the future. The cost of these sets of equipment will also influence their use. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Several non {{invasive}} irnaging {{procedures are}} discussed. Clinical strategies are introduced as a concep ~ {{for their future}} utilization. Notions of sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and accuracy are defined and nained as the basic tools for the imple mentation of such strategies. Doctors are concerned about diagnosing space occupying disease at an easiy stage. It is hoped that the early recognition of pathology will allow for appropriate staging of the disease. Planning of the most adequate form of treatment will even tually lead to an improvement in the patientâ€™s management and follow-up. In order to achieve this aim, clinicians have helped thernselves {{with a variety of}} investigations, of which imaging techniques liave always played an important role. By tradition, con ventional radiology and the utilization of X-rays have been dominant. In recent years, however, a number of different imaging rnethods have established themselves iii clinical medicine and have rnatured into individual arcas of application. These include imaging techniques based on the radioactive tracer rnethod, imaging techniques based on ultra sound waves and imaging techniques based on the use of gamma rays and X-rays and the simultaneous utilization of a computer for image reconstruction of a cross section of an organ (ernission and transrnission computerized tomography, respectively). Ia this article, we review some of the concepts, arcas of application and difficulties which arise with the utilization of these techniques in medicine and an attempt is made to place them within the general diagnostic problem of space occupying disease detection. Ther mography, xeroradiography, maminography, <b>ionography,</b> Freznel zone plate irnaging and electron magnetic resonance imaging represent techniques which are only mentioned in order to exclude them from the scope of this paper. The Concept of Non-invasive Imaging One of the most attractive characteristics which these techniques have in cornmon is the degree of safety with which they {{can be applied to the}} investigations of patients. From this point of view, they have indeed revolutionized clinical investigation of larg...|$|E
