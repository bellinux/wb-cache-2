5|$|On 24 January 1674, Bishop Fuller {{issued a}} decree {{dealing with the}} {{recommendations}} of the commissioners—a majority of all the Fellows should always be present at an election, so the Provost could not push an election <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> meeting, and Fellows should be admitted immediately after their election. On 28 January Provost Say obtained from the King a recommendation for Twitty's election, but it was withdrawn on 13 February, following the Vice-Chancellor's refusal to swear Twitty into the University and the Bishop's protests at Court.|$|E

5|$|Above the chromosphere, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K {{in the upper}} chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E

50|$|These {{modifications}} at {{the crown}} level influence photosynthate production positively {{as long as}} water supply is not limiting. Even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration are more important after thinning, total evapo-transpiration at stand level tends to decrease. Furthermore, with the reduced importance of leaf area index (LAI), thinning reduces canopy water interception and increases throughfall. This explains why the soil moisture content increases <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thinned</b> stand. Thus, during the vegetation period, tree-water status is usually better <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thinned</b> stand than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high-density stand.|$|R
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, {{which was the}} point of sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E
5|$|The main {{evidence}} of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of clay present in the K–Pg boundary across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium. Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared to 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole; in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion of this element. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|Spin-wave {{resonance}} (SWR) is a newly emerged {{method for}} studying surface magnetic anisotropy and surface spin-wave modes (SSWMs) <b>in</b> (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> films. The existence of SSWMs <b>in</b> (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> films {{has recently been}} reported in the literature; SSWMs have been observed in the in-plane configuration (with variable azimuth angle ϕ_M between the in-plane magnetization of the film and the surface [100] crystal axis), in the azimuth angle range between two in-plane critical angles ϕ_c 1 and ϕ_c 2. We show here that cubic surface anisotropy is an essential factor determining the existence conditions of the above-mentioned SSWMs: conditions favorable for the occurrence of surface spin-wave modes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> film <b>in</b> the in-plane configuration are fulfilled for those azimuth orientations of the magnetization of the sample that lie around the hard axes of cubic magnetic anisotropy.

5|$|Volvariella bombycina, {{commonly}} known as the silky sheath, silky rosegill, silver-silk straw mushroom, or tree mushroom, is a species of edible mushroom in the family Pluteaceae. It is an uncommon but widespread species, having been reported from Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. The fruit body (mushroom) begins developing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin,</b> egg-like sac. This ruptures and the stem expands quickly, leaving the sac {{at the base of the}} stem as a volva. The cap, which can attain a diameter of up to , is white to slightly yellowish and covered with silky hairs. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced gills, free from attachment to the stem, and initially white before turning pink as the spores mature. The mushroom grows singly or in clusters, often appearing in old knotholes and wounds in elms and maples. V.bombycina contains compounds with antibacterial properties.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Heterodontosaurus tucki (SAM-PK-K337) was discovered during the British-South African expedition to South Africa and Basutoland (former name of Lesotho) in 1961-1962. Today, it {{is housed in}} the Iziko South African Museum. It was excavated on a mountain {{at an altitude of}} about , at a locality called Tyinindini, in the district of Transkei (sometimes referred to as Herschel) in the Cape Province of South Africa. The specimen consists of a crushed but nearly complete skull; associated postcranial remains mentioned in the original description could not be located in 2011. The animal was scientifically described and named in 1962 by palaeontologists Alfred Walter Crompton from South Africa and Alan J. Charig from the United Kingdom. The genus name refers to the different-shaped teeth, and the specific name honors George C. Tuck, a director of Austin Motor Company, who supported the expedition. The specimen was not fully prepared by the time of publication, so only the front parts of the skull and lower jaw were described, and the authors conceded that their description was preliminary, serving mainly to name the animal. It was considered an important discovery, as few early ornithischians were known at the time. The preparation of the specimen, i.e. the freeing of the bones from the rock matrix, was very time consuming, since they were covered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin,</b> very hard, ferruginous layer containing haematite. This could only be removed by a diamond saw, which damaged the specimen.|$|E

5|$|Uttar Pradesh, with a {{total area}} of , is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area. It is {{situated}} on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover {{most of the state}} are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.|$|E
