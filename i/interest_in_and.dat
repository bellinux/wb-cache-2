5|$|Dave Guard and Bob Shane {{had been}} friends since junior high school at the Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii where both had learned to play ukulele in {{required}} music classes. They had developed an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> admiration for native Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. While in Punahou's secondary school, Shane taught first himself and then Guard the rudiments of the six-string guitar, and the two began performing at parties and in school shows doing {{an eclectic mix of}} Tahitian, Hawaiian, and calypso songs.|$|E
5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{elements}} of the character are drawn from the real Colbert's personal life. Both the real Colbert and the character were raised in Charleston, South Carolina; both are the youngest of 11 children; both played Dungeons & Dragons as teenagers; and both are practicing Roman Catholics. Colbert's own <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of religion, science fiction, and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings story will often show through in the Report. His character has a chocolate portrait of Viggo Mortensen (who portrayed Aragorn in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films) {{in a place of}} honor on his shelf; Mortensen briefly reprised the role of Aragorn in the Reports September 13, 2007 episode. He also owns a Sting sword presented to him by Peter Jackson.|$|E

5|$|Educated at {{home until}} she was seven, Bishop then went to a private {{elementary}} school {{until the age of}} nine. In 1909, then ten years old, she entered the progressive Fielden School in her hometown of Manchester, where she studied for three years. She completed her high school education at the Manchester High School for Girls. Though Bishop intended to study chemistry, her lack of education in physics meant that she could not pursue her preferred course in the Honours School of Chemistry. Instead, she matriculated at Manchester University in October 1918 to study botany, chemistry, and zoology. That first-year course in zoology sparked her lifelong <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> commitment to the field. She graduated with honours from the School of Zoology, receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1921; she received her master's degree in 1922. During her undergraduate years, under the tutelage of the helminthologist R.A. Wardle and the protozoologist Geoffrey Lapage, Bishop studied ciliates acquired from local ponds.|$|E
5|$|In Ocarina of Time, {{the player}} {{controls}} the playable character Link {{in the land}} of Hyrule. Link sets out on a quest to stop Ganondorf, king of the Gerudo tribe, from obtaining the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants the wishes of its holder. He travels through time and navigates various dungeons to awaken the sages, who have the power to seal Ganondorf away forever. Music plays an important role: To progress, the player must learn to play several songs on an ocarina. The game was responsible for increased <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> sales of the instrument.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an <b>interest</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of}} the Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

Stemming from her <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> endowments to the arts, {{she was a}} trustee emerita {{and a member of}} the Acquisitions Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, member of the Board of Trustees of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, one of the managing directors of The Metropolitan Opera, honorary trustee and former board president of the Palm Springs Art Museum, {{and a member of the}} American Philosophical Society. Mrs. Annenberg was chairwoman emerita of the Foundation of Art and Preservation in Embassies, and a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.|$|E
5|$|Much of Colbert's {{personal}} life {{was reflected in}} his character on The Colbert Report. With the extended exposure of the character on the show, he often referenced his <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of Catholicism, science fiction, and The Lord of the Rings, as well as using real facts to create his character's history. His alternate persona was also raised in South Carolina, is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married. The actual Colbert's career history in acting and comedy, however, was often downplayed or even denied outright, and he frequently referred to having attended Dartmouth College (which was {{at the forefront of}} the conservative campus movement in the 1980s) rather than his actual alma mater, Northwestern. In July 2012, Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central, extending the run of The Colbert Report until the end of 2014.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson also {{advocated}} {{careful study}} of the state's finances to deal with increasing expenditures. He insisted that the state stop covering its short-term indebtedness using bonds. However, Stevenson was willing to tax to benefit segregation in schools, and helped create the state bureau of education in 1870. Because most blacks possessed little property of significant value, the new tax yielded little revenue to support their educational institutions. State legislators rejected his 1870 proposal to create a state bureau of immigration and statistics to spur <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> migration to the state. He did persuade the legislators to make some improvements in the state's penal and eleemosynary institutions, including establishing a House of Reform for juvenile offenders.|$|E

5|$|This opulence {{could not}} be {{sustained}} indefinitely, and the Wall Street Crash badly damaged the family finances, decreasing their <b>interest</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> visits to, Rùm. Sir George died in France, in July 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War Two, and was interred in the family mausoleum on Rùm. His widow continued to visit Rùm as late as 1954. In 1957 Lady Bullough sold the whole island, including the Castle and its contents, to the Nature Conservancy Council, on the understanding {{that it would be}} used as a national nature reserve; the mausoleum was the only part of Rùm not included in the sale. Lady Bullough died in London, in 1967, at the age of 98; she was buried next to her husband in the Rùm mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Viking metal {{emerged from}} black metal {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an {{opposition}} to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes {{in favor of the}} Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader modern Pagan and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed <b>interest</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.|$|E
