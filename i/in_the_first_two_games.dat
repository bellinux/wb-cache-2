5|$|Jimmy Rollins hit in 36 {{straight}} games {{up to and}} including the final game of 2005. Hitting streak in one season and hitting streak over two seasons are considered two separate records by Major League Baseball.

5|$|In {{the first}} round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, Parker was chosen to defend New Jersey Net and former Toronto {{favorite}} Vince Carter. Parker was effective in shutting down Carter, restricting him to 13-for-43 shooting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games.</b> However, the Raptors were eliminated by the Nets after Game 6. On April 4, 2007, the NBA also announced that Parker had been selected by a five-member panel of former players as the divisional winner of the 2006–07 NBA Sportsmanship Award. The annual award reflects the ideals of sportsmanship in amateur and professional basketball.|$|E

5|$|On April 2, 2011, Kinsler {{became the}} first player in major league history to hit a lead-off home run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of a season (giving him a total of 15 lead-off homers in his career). In his next game against the Red Sox, he hit another {{home run in the}} third inning.

The two also joined Dean Palmer (1992) as the only Texas ballplayers to ever homer in the first three games of the season.|$|E

He later donated the bloody sock he wore during the game to the Baseball Hall of Fame museum. Much {{of the blame for}} the Cardinals' losses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> was directed at the fact that Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best batters, had combined for one hit in 22at-bats.|$|E

5|$|Broken Sword spawned four sequels. The first, , was {{released}} in 1997. It uses the same engine as the first Broken Sword game. Six years later, Revolution released Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, which features 3D graphics and a direct-control mechanism. It uses the RenderWare engine. In 2006 the company released Broken Sword: The Angel of Death (Secrets of the Ark: A Broken Sword Game in North America), which returns to the point-and-click system used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games.</b> It is {{the only game in}} the series not released for a console, and it uses Sumo Digital's engine. The fifth installment, , was announced through a Kickstarter project in August 2012. The game features 2D graphics, and it {{was released}} in September 2013.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the season, Tech {{followed}} through on that promise, winning 3316 and 6321 against Bowling Green and Pittsburgh, respectively. A loss to No.3 Miami followed, but {{a victory over}} Maryland in the game that followed gave Tech a 31 record, already better than its 1992 win total. After a close loss at No.14 West Virginia that was determined by a missed last-second field goal by Tech placekicker Ryan Williams, the Hokies won five of their last six regular-season games. These wins included victories over Big East opponent Syracuse and No.23 , Tech's traditional rival. With an 83 regular-season record and ranked No.22 in the country by the Associated Press, Tech was extended {{an invitation to the}} Independence Bowl, its first bowl bid since the 1986 Peach Bowl.|$|E

After being held pointless <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the 2011–12 season, Tavares had back-to-back four-point games against the Tampa Bay Lightning and New York Rangers. From December 29, 2011, to January 21, 2012, Tavares had 21 points in a 12-game point streak, seven of which were multi-point games. He was selected {{to play in the}} 2012 NHL All-Star Game. In his first career All-Star Game, he recorded one goal and one assist. Additionally, during the 2011–12 season, Tavares was named as an alternate captain for New York.|$|E
5|$|The Spurs {{qualified}} for the 1998 NBA Playoffs as the fifth seed, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns coach Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds and replicating the performance in Game 2, contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns. However, the Spurs lost {{in the second round}} to the eventual Western Conference Champions Utah Jazz. In this series, Duncan was pitted against Hall-of-Fame power forward Karl Malone. Duncan outscored Malone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> which the Spurs lost, but as the series progressed, the more experienced Malone shut Duncan down on defense and dominated on offense, outscoring the young power forward in Games 3 to 5 18–10, 34–22 and 24–14 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Rockets was a tight one, with three of the six games going to overtime. The Blazers fared well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> despite not having home-court advantage, beating Houston 122-120 and 112-105 in Games 1 and 2 respectively, fueled by Aldridge's 46 points and 18 rebounds in Game 1, and 43 points and 3 blocks in Game 2. In the sixth game of the series with the Rockets {{threatening}} to force a Game 7 back in Houston, down by two points with 0.9 {{seconds left in the}} game, Damian Lillard hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to close out the series, and the Blazers advanced to the semifinals {{for the first time since}} 2000, where they lost to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in five games.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} part of the media {{franchise}} Megami Tensei, but as Last Bible was developed for a wider audience, including children, the series is toned down compared to Shin Megami Tensei. For instance, players meet monsters rather than demons, and most of the Last Bible titles take place in a medieval fantasy world. The music for the first two games was composed by Hiroyuki Yanada and Iwao Mitsunaga, while Yanada composed the music for Last Bible III on his own, and Manami Matsumae composed the music for Another Bible. Critics have been mostly positive to the series, but the games' graphics have received mixed responses. The music, particularly the one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games,</b> has been positively received. Several music albums with the games' soundtracks have been released by Sweep Records.|$|E
5|$|Although Blažević {{continued}} his tenure {{in spite of}} failure to qualify for Euro 2000, he resigned in October 2000 following draws against Belgium and Scotland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. His successor {{at the helm of}} the national team was Mirko Jozić, who previously led the Yugoslavia under-20 team to a World Cup triumph in 1987. Despite the retirement of many Golden Generation players, Croatia went unbeaten during the rest of the qualifiers. They opened their 2002 World Cup campaign with a narrow loss to Mexico before producing a surprise 2–1 victory over Euro 2000 finalists Italy in the next fixture, giving life to hopes of passing through to the knockout stage. However, they lost their final group fixture to Ecuador and were eliminated. Jozić then resigned, and was replaced in July 2002 by Croatian-Austrian Otto Barić, the team's first manager born outside the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Coach Leeman Bennett {{treated the}} season as a {{building}} season, but was disappointed with the team's mental errors and lack of progress. Later in the season, he would begin to privately admit that the Buccaneers' talent was much worse than he had realized. Steve DeBerg won the starting quarterback job after outplaying Steve Young in the preseason, but was benched in favor of Young after struggling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games.</b> Kevin House and Jimmie Giles were released after an October loss to the New Orleans Saints, along with ex-Dallas Cowboys fullback Ron Springs. Bennett {{showed up at a}} press conference held after the season by owner Hugh Culverhouse, unaware {{that the purpose of the}} press conference was to announce Bennett's firing. Giles, then with the Detroit Lions, criticized the move, saying that no coach could compensate for the Buccaneers' lack of talent. He also claimed that administrator Phil Krueger destroyed team chemistry by demeaning players during contract negotiations, pointing to guard Sean Farrell's disgruntlement as an example.|$|E

5|$|Maverick Hunter is the codename for a {{cancelled}} first-person shooter {{video game}} in the Mega Man franchise {{that would have been}} developed by Armature Studio and published by Capcom. It was intended to be a darker entry in the Mega Man X series. Mega Man artist and producer Keiji Inafune was responsible for establishing the western-designed game and Adi Granov was responsible for X's new design. It was intended to be the first of a trilogy of games, where players controlled its protagonist X <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> and then as Zero for the third. The game would have had similar platform elements found in earlier Mega Man X titles. It had a lifespan of about six months in 2010 before it was ultimately cancelled due to the aforementioned internal disagreements around the same time as Inafune departed from Capcom and other Mega Man titles were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The Bears' first away game of {{the season}} {{occurred}} in Seattle, who led the all-time series 10–6, including the last three regular season games. However, the Bears had won the last game in Seattle in 2009 25–19. The Bears offense, not featuring Jay Cutler nor Alshon Jeffery, faced a defense led by Kam Chancellor, who returned to the Seahawks after a holdout. Without Chancellor for the first two games of the season, the defense had allowed quarterbacks to complete 72 percent of their passes with a passer rating of 116.4. Jeff Joniak believed that to counter the Legion of Boom, the Bears had to balance the rushing and passing attacks, while watching for a blitz that pressured Aaron Rodgers 19 times in week two. On defense, the Bears had to watch for quarterback Russell Wilson, though he had struggled with pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games,</b> being sacked a total of eight times. Additionally, the run defense had to be aware of a running game led by Marshawn Lynch; the corps had averaged 121.5 yards per game. On special teams, the Bears had to stop speedy rookie receiver Tyler Lockett, who had scored on a punt return earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob Moore said, “We’re at rock bottom now...but if we start pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable. The loss {{marked the first time}} since 1961 that a professional football team was shut out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the season, when the Oakland Raiders were shut out by the same two teams in the same order.|$|E
