5|$|TuneUp Utilities 2004: Introduces TuneUp 1-Click Maintenance and TuneUp WinStyler (the {{predecessor}} TuneUp Styler.). Also includes registry <b>defragmentation</b> {{support for}} Windows 2000 and XP.|$|E
5|$|TuneUp Utilities 2008: Incorporates {{two more}} {{components:}} TuneUp Drive Defrag (the <b>defragmentation</b> tool) and TuneUp Repair Wizard (the troubleshooting tool). TuneUp Utilities 2008 {{no longer has}} a separate disk cleanup component; the disk cleanup function {{has become part of}} the Start Center, under a new Gain disk space section.|$|E
5|$|The Optimize system section {{includes}} TuneUp Program Deactivator, which unloads {{programs from}} memory and prevents their further automatic execution, {{an alternative to}} uninstalling them. While disabled programs continue to consume disk space, they no longer affect the startup time, the shutdown time and the system performance. Other components include a <b>defragmentation</b> tool, a registry cleaner, and a startup manager to replace MSConfig.|$|E
25|$|<b>Defragmentation</b> is a {{procedure}} used to minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items to physically proximate {{areas on the}} disk. Some computer operating systems perform <b>defragmentation</b> automatically. Although automatic <b>defragmentation</b> is intended to reduce access delays, performance will be temporarily reduced while the procedure is in progress.|$|E

25|$|Since DOS 3.3 the {{operating}} system provides means to improve the performance of file operations with FASTOPEN by {{keeping track of the}} position of recently opened files or directories in various forms of lists (MS-DOS/PCDOS) or hash tables (DR-DOS), which can reduce file seek and open times significantly. Before DOS 5.0 special care must be taken when using such mechanisms in conjunction with disk <b>defragmentation</b> software bypassing the file system or disk drivers.|$|E
25|$|Other {{high-level}} mechanisms may read in {{and process}} larger parts or the complete FAT on startup or on demand when needed and dynamically build up in-memory tree {{representations of the}} volume's file structures different from the on-disk structures. This may, on volumes with many free clusters, occupy even less memory than {{an image of the}} FAT itself. In particular on highly fragmented or filled volumes, seeks become much faster than with linear scans over the actual FAT, even if an image of the FAT would be stored in memory. Also, operating on the logically high level of files and cluster-chains instead of on sector or track level, it becomes possible to avoid some degree of file fragmentation in the first place or to carry out local file <b>defragmentation</b> and reordering of directory entries based on their names or access patterns in the background.|$|E
25|$|Thus, a zpool (ZFS storage pool) is vaguely {{similar to}} a computer's RAM. The total RAM pool {{capacity}} depends {{on the number of}} RAM memory sticks and the size of each stick. Likewise, a zpool consists of one or more vdevs. Each vdev {{can be viewed as a}} group of hard disks (or partitions, or files, etc.). Each vdev should have redundancy, otherwise if a vdev is lost, then the whole zpool is lost. Thus, each vdev should be configured as RAID-Z1, RAID-Z2, mirror, etc. It is not possible to change the number of drives in an existing vdev (Block Pointer Rewrite will allow this, and also allow <b>defragmentation),</b> but it is always possible to increase storage capacity by adding a new vdev to a zpool. It is possible to swap a drive to a larger drive and resilver (repair) the zpool. If this procedure is repeated for every disk in a vdev, then the zpool will grow in capacity when the last drive is resilvered. A vdev will have the same base capacity as the smallest drive in the group. For instance, a vdev consisting of three 500 GB and one 700GB drive, will have a capacity of 4Ã—500GB.|$|E

2500|$|On such SD cards, {{standard}} utility {{programs such}} as Mac OS X's [...] "" [...] or Windows' SCANDISK {{can be used to}} repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. <b>Defragmentation</b> tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file, but not an improvement comparable to <b>defragmentation</b> of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, <b>defragmentation</b> performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on flash memory; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.|$|E
2500|$|April EDW (built on April 19, 2006 with a {{build number}} of 5365), which was {{released}} on April 21, 2006, introduced more changes to visual user interface elements, and to the behavior of User Account Control. A number of new backgrounds were also introduced, and two new screensavers were added as well. The Sidebar was enabled by default, as was automatic <b>defragmentation</b> of the hard drive. Hold'em, a game that shipped with some previous CTPs, was dropped due to apparent [...] "political sensitivity" [...] issues; Microsoft now offers it as a separate web download for Windows Vista Ultimate users.|$|E
5000|$|NTFS was {{introduced}} with Windows NT 3.1, but the NTFS filesystem driver {{did not include}} any <b>defragmentation</b> capabilities. In Windows NT 4.0, defragmenting APIs were introduced that third-party tools could use to perform <b>defragmentation</b> tasks; however, no <b>defragmentation</b> software was included. In Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, Microsoft included a <b>defragmentation</b> tool based on Diskeeper that made use of the <b>defragmentation</b> APIs and was a snap-in for Computer Management. In Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8, the tool has been greatly improved and was given a new interface with no visual diskmap {{and is no longer}} part of Computer Management. [...] There are also a number of free and commercial third-party <b>defragmentation</b> products available for Microsoft Windows.|$|E

5000|$|Linux ext2, ext3, and ext4: Much like UFS, these filesystems employ {{allocation}} techniques {{designed to}} keep fragmentation under control at all times. As a result, <b>defragmentation</b> is not needed {{in the vast majority}} of cases. ext2 uses an offline defragmenter called e2defrag, which does not work with its successor ext3. However, other programs, or filesystem-independent ones such as defragfs, may be used to defragment an ext3 filesystem. ext4 is somewhat backward compatible with ext3, and thus has generally the same amount of support from <b>defragmentation</b> programs. Currently e4defrag can be used to defragment an ext4 filesystem, including online <b>defragmentation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|To {{defragment}} a disk, <b>defragmentation</b> software (also {{known as}} a [...] "defragmenter") can only move files around within the free space available. This is an intensive operation and cannot be performed on a filesystem {{with little or no}} free space. During <b>defragmentation,</b> system performance will be degraded, and it is best to leave the computer alone during the process so that the defragmenter does not get confused by unexpected changes to the filesystem. Depending on the algorithm used {{it may or may not}} be advantageous to perform multiple passes. The reorganization involved in <b>defragmentation</b> does not change logical location of the files (defined as their location within the directory structure).|$|E
