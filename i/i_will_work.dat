2500|$|In 1976 Stevens nearly drowned off {{the coast}} of Malibu, California, United States, and said he shouted: [...] "Oh, God! If you save me <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> for you." [...] He related that right {{afterward}} a wave appeared and carried him back to shore. This brush with death intensified his long-held quest for spiritual truth. He had looked into [...] "Buddhism, Zen, I Ching, numerology, tarot cards, and astrology". Stevens' brother David Gordon, a convert to Judaism, brought him a copy of the Qur'an as a birthday gift from a trip to Jerusalem. Stevens was quickly taken with its content, and he began his transition to Islam.|$|E

Golden Boy Promotions announced on July 18, the bout would take place at AT Stadium in Arlington, Texas, [...] the other venue looking to host the fight was the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Canelo, who had fought his last 5 fights at his preferred 155 lbs catchweight, said, [...] "I am very pleased to announce my next fight against Liam Smith, a tremendous fighter with real knockout power, and the WBO junior middleweight world title owner, I {{have no doubt that}} this fight will be give and take, which will fill the expectations of the fans, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> with all the enthusiasm as I always do to get the upper hand on Sept. 17." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 presidential {{election}} campaign, Senator Barack Obama advocated a full {{repeal of the}} laws barring gays and lesbians from serving in the military. Nineteen days after his election, Obama's advisers announced that plans to repeal the policy might be delayed until 2010, because Obama [...] "first wants to confer with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his new political appointees at the Pentagon to reach a consensus, and then present legislation to Congress". As president he advocated a policy change to allow gay personnel to serve openly in the armed forces, stating that the U.S. government has {{spent millions of dollars}} replacing troops expelled from the military, including language experts fluent in Arabic, because of DADT. On the eve of the National Equality March in Washington, D.C., October 10, 2009, Obama stated in a speech before the Human Rights Campaign that he would end the ban, but he offered no timetable. Obama said in his 2010 State of the Union Address: [...] "This year, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are." [...] This statement was quickly followed up by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Michael Mullen voicing their support for a repeal of DADT.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper.
