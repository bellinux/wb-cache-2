After they received multiple recording contract offers in 2001, the band decided to sign with Sparrow Records. Matt Hammitt said, [...] "At that point, we really had to do some soul searching and figure out where it was {{we were supposed to}} be ...

[...] It was the third time since the war that Oxford had lost the event {{as a result of a}} crew member collapsing mid-race. [...] Oxford's bow Richard Bate confessed that he [...] "didn't even know anything had been wrong until after the race. [...] I only knew we were not at our best." ...|$|E
500|$|The series' writing team {{expressed}} concern that the episode would be compared to two episodes from [...] ("" [...] and [...] "The Alternative Factor"). Piller added: [...] "e <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not do the evil-versus-good story that the original Star Trek had done." [...] Biller was assigned to write the script as his second writing assignment for the series; his first had been for [...] "Elogium". Biller attributed his interest in the episode's concept to his personal experiences with his younger, adopted brother's struggle to understand his biracial identity. Even though Biller was initially critical of the pitch's melodrama, he felt that his version had the melodrama expected of a Star Trek episode. The final draft of the script was submitted on February 24, 1995.|$|E

[...] Cambridge's Malcolm Baker said: [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do it after about 25 strokes." [...] Behrens explained [...] "Our strength {{was that we}} were more uniform than Oxford. [...] We have proved that {{you do not have to}} be an Olympic champion to win the Boat Race." [...] The Oxford Boat Club president Pinsent conceded: [...] "They put right a lot of mistakes they have made in the past, and they rowed outstandingly well." [...] Spracklen agreed: [...] "Cambridge got too far away. [...] They were a better boat in that race. [...] All credit to them."

500|$|There was {{no doubt}} that the Japanese had {{suffered}} a major defeat. Imamura's chief of staff flew to Imperial General Headquarters to report on the disaster. It was decided {{that there would be no}} more attempts to land troops at Lae. The losses incurred in the Bismarck Sea caused grave concern for the security of Lae and Rabaul. This resulted in a change of strategy. On 25 March a joint Army-Navy Central Agreement on South West Area Operations gave operations in New Guinea priority over those in the Solomon Islands campaign. The XVIII Army was allocated additional shipping, ordnance and anti-aircraft units, which were sent to Wewak or Hansa Bay. Of the defeat, Rabaul staff officer Masatake Okumiya said, [...] "Our losses for this single battle were fantastic. [...] Not during the entire savage fighting at Guadalcanal did we suffer a single comparable blow. [...] We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> no longer run cargo ships or even fast destroyer transports to any front on the north coast of New Guinea, east of Wewak." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating [...] "Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the ’50s but she {{had nothing to do with}} a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show."

In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain Killer Moth, attracting Batman's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career. Although Batman insists she give up crime-fighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} {{ends with}} continuous clicking of the camera. Gaga {{comes to the}} top of the pillar and sings a combination of [...] "Starstruck" [...] and [...] "LoveGame" [...] as she is joined by her dancers in tracks and jackets and hands Gaga her trademark disco stick. After [...] "LoveGame", she talks a monologue about the year [...] "3009". And says that [...] "The kids came out of New York and shot the paparazzi."

This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called [...] "The Brain" [...] starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair. After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white leotard with high-pointed [...] "puff" [...] shoulders and lightning shaped symbols, while riding on a similarly colored vespa. She then starts singing [...] "The Fame". This is followed by a speech. Gaga said she's been [...] "travelling the whole world, but when I get back, I can still smell the stench of greed." [...] And then she performs [...] "Money Honey" [...] with the dancers who are wearing backpacks.

2500|$|Bungie {{conceived}} of Soulblighter {{prior to the}} release of [...] in 1997, with the only thing that would prevent them from making it being if The Fallen Lords was a commercial failure. However, when the original game proved a success, becoming Bungie's biggest selling game thus far, the sequel immediately went into development. One of their main goals with the sequel was to include numerous gameplay aspects and game mechanics which they had wanted to feature in The Fallen Lords, but had been unable to implement due to time constraints. Alex Seropian, co-founder of Bungie, explains [...] "there were still some things at the end of Myth that we wanted to do, but we just ran out of time.

The initiative {{called for a}} joint enterprise of businesses and organizations, owned or run by black people, to produce and distribute a line of cosmetics and toiletries sold under the Clean & Fresh (now defunct) label. Major haircare companies, including Johnson Products Company, {{backed out of the}} initiative fearing it could lead to accusations of anti-Semitism. Johnson Products owner George E. Johnson, Sr. maintained that his company's distributors told him that any dealings with Farrakhan's P.O.W.E.R. project would lead to having his own products boycotted. [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not offend our distribution channels," [...] a Johnson spokesman Dorothy McConner said.

New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Hadid studied {{mathematics}} at the American University of Beirut before moving, in 1972, to London {{to study}} at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. There she studied with Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi. [...] Her former professor, Koolhaas, described her at graduation as [...] "a planet in her own orbit." [...] Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught. ‘We called her {{the inventor of the}} 89 degrees. Nothing was ever at 90 degrees. She had spectacular vision. All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces." [...] He recalled that she was less interested in details, such as staircases. [...] "The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling, and the space was reducing and reducing, and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling. She couldn’t care about tiny details. Her mind was on the broader pictures—when it came to the joinery she <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> fix that later.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E
