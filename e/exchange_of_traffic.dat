5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

50|$|Boscarne Junction {{was created}} in September 1887 when the GWR opened a line {{connecting}} from their station in Bodmin to the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway (now owned by the L&SWR).

Junction. The purpose of the GWR line was to take china clay from Wenford clay dries to the docks at Fowey, the traffic having previously been taken by the LSWR to Wadebridge. Originally there was a single siding between the two diverging lines, which was connected to them at both ends and used for the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> between the GWR and L&SWR. The line to Wenfordbridge diverged from the line to Bodmin North a short distance to the east at Dunmere Junction, where there was just a ground-frame. In 1914 a second loop siding was added at Boscarne Junction {{on the north side of}} the L&SWR line, extending from the signal-box almost to Dunmere Junction, and this was used then mainly for the transfer of the Wendfordbridge traffic. The line to Wadebridge closed on 17 December 1978 and was truncated at the road just beyond the signal box in 1981. The line here closed completely on 3 October 1983, but trains returned to Boscarne Junction in 1997 when the Bodmin and Wenford Steam Railway built a platform and began operating trains from Bodmin General.

In order to overcome this limitation, we designed ATB to be adaptive in two dimensions: First, the beacon interval is adapted dynamically and, secondly, the protocol can dynamically make use of available infrastructure elements. We concentrate on a Traffic Information System (TIS) with a focus on congestionaware communication. Simulation experiments clearly demonstrate that ATB performs well in a broad range of settings.
