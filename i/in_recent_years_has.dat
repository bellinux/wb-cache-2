5|$|On this site, 171 {{plant species}} are surveyed. Given {{its size and}} poor soil, this {{diversity}} is notable. Management undertaken <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> been essential to maintaining open areas, the most threatened by primary succession. Thus, the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, bushy areas, open areas) provide a mosaic of habitats, and thus remarkable species.|$|E

The town is host to a number of artists, many of whom open their studios to the public during the Festival. An Artisan Market is held on Catherine Hill monthly between April and October.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{modernisation}} <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> centred {{around the}} Underground's rolling stock, with large scale renewals and refurbishments of existing fleets, in particular on Lines A and H. Along with this came {{the construction of}} new underground workshops and storage areas on lines A, H and E, as well as the expansion of the existing facilities on Lines B and D.|$|E
5|$|New {{construction}} has dovetailed with efforts to cultivate business growth. One of the area's more successful business ventures <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> been the Youngstown Business Incubator.

5|$|Tellurium {{is used in}} cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of tellurium demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E
5|$|The National Archives Heraldry Board, {{established}} under Swedish statute 2007:1179, is {{the highest}} heraldic body in Sweden. The board is chaired by the National Archivist and includes three other officials, three deputies, the State Herald (who acts as secretary), the National Archives jurist and the National Archives heraldic artist. This board convenes as needed, which <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> been {{once or twice a}} year.|$|E
5|$|The Sword {{has been}} {{categorized}} as a stoner rock and doom metal band, and {{is influenced by}} groups such as Black Sabbath and Sleep.

5|$|The breed first {{developed}} in the late 18th century when Narragansett Pacers and Canadian Pacers from the eastern United States crossed with gaited Spanish Mustangs from Texas. Other breeds were later added, and in 1886 a foal named Black Allan, now considered the foundation sire of the breed, was born. In 1935 the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' Association was formed, and the studbook closed in 1947. In 1939, the first Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration was held, an annual event that <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> attracted considerable attention and controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Auxois are still bred for meat production, and in 2001, 50% {{of the horses}} bred were intended for slaughter. However, the power and gaits of the breed make them valued for competitive and leisure driving, as well as equestrian tourism. The smaller horses of the breed are used for milk production. The Auxois is used for celebrations, such as weddings, and historical reenactments. It is also used for logging, and <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years,</b> <b>has</b> been increasingly used in agriculture, being found in vineyards, gardens and farms. The use of them {{for the maintenance of}} rural roads is also in planning.|$|E
5|$|As of 1993, {{there were}} 40 timber-processing plants {{and a number}} of sawmills. Tawau Port is a major export and import gateway for timber {{especially}} from North Kalimantan. A barter trade has been formalised between East Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan) and Sabah with the creation of Tawau Barter Trade Association (BATS) in 1993. The association handles the cash-based trade of raw materials from Indonesia, but <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> focussed on timber industry. Other than timber, since British rule ended exports have traditionally been spices, cocoa and tobacco. Birds' nests are harvested at Baturong, Sengarung, Tepadung and Madai Caves by the Ida'an community. Tawau {{is one of the top}} cocoa producers in Malaysia, and the world together with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia. The town is the cocoa capital for both in Sabah and Malaysia. Cocoa production is mostly concentrated in the interior, north of the town, while palm oil production is concentrated along the roads to Merotai, Brantian, Semporna and Kunak. Both cocoa and palm oil are part of the large agriculture sector that has become the main income producer for the town.|$|E

5|$|Private flying is most {{associated}} with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and touring aircraft. Examples of these are the Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper PA28 Cherokee, all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of Cirrus. The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £133, compared to an estimated £77 per hour for gliders, and a reported £35 per hour for microlights. Recent trends have seen {{an increase in the}} use of microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the Robinson R22 and R44. Another growth area in private flying <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>has</b> been in the use of amateur built aircraft, such as the Van's Aircraft RV-4 and the Europa.|$|E
5|$|The Jim Henson Company and the Jim Henson Foundation {{continued}} {{after his}} death, producing new series and specials. Jim Henson's Creature Shop, founded by Henson, also continues to build creatures {{for a large}} number of other films and series (e.g. the science-fiction production Farscape, the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the movie MirrorMask) and {{is considered one of the}} most advanced and well respected creators of film creatures. As of 2017, his eldest son Brian and eldest daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company; his daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, assumed the roles of Kermit the Frog and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson. Whitmire also assumed the roles of Link Hogthrob, starting with the video game Muppet RaceMania, as well as The Muppet Newsman, starting in 2008, with Muppet.com viral online videos. However in 2017 Whitmire was fired from the Muppets Studio and as a result, Matt Vogel has taken over the role of Kermit. Muppeteer veteran Bill Barretta has taken over for Henson's fairly deeper voiced roles, such as the Swedish Chef, Mahna Mahna, Rowlf the Dog, and Dr. Teeth. Guy Smiley, <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years,</b> <b>has</b> been taken over by Eric Jacobson, and the role of Waldorf, in 1992, was assumed by Muppet performer veteran Dave Goelz. As of 2017, Ernie is now performed by puppeteer Peter Linz.|$|E
