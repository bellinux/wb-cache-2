40|$|The paper {{considers}} a situation when a terrorist with N attack facilities allocates <b>its</b> <b>resource</b> between attacking an object {{and protecting the}} facilities {{that will be used}} in the attack. A government allocates <b>its</b> <b>resource</b> between protecting the object passively and striking actively and preventively against all or a subset of the attack facilities. The government strikes preventively if the object destruction probability is lower than when choosing passive defense. The paper formulates a zero-sum situation in which the terrorist chooses how to distribute <b>its</b> <b>resource</b> between the attack and protection efforts where the government chooses how to distribute <b>its</b> <b>resource</b> between the (PS) preventive strike and protection efforts and decides how many facilities to strike. It is shown that independently of the number of facilities the government strikes, the sum of the fraction of the terrorist's resource allocated to attack and the fraction of the government's resource allocated to the PS always equals one. The condition of the PS effectiveness is formulated. Examples are provided to illustrate the methodology of the model analysis.

However, Pyrrhon betrays the deities due to wanting to claim the Aurum's power and prove himself as the strongest god in existence, which leads to him being mentally controlled by the Aurum Brain. After Pit defeats the fusion of Pyrrhon and the Aurum Brain, Pyrrhon briefly comes to his senses and sacrifices himself to banish the Aurum {{to the far side}} of the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1976, a {{stalemate}} existed between the Falintil and the Indonesian army. Unable to overcome heavy resistance and drained of <b>its</b> <b>resources,</b> the TNI began rearming. Indonesian navy ordered missile-firing patrol-boats from the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as submarines from West Germany. In February 1977, Indonesia also received thirteen OV-10 Bronco aircraft from the Rockwell International Corporation {{with the aid of}} an official US government foreign military aid sales credit. The Bronco was ideal for the East Timor invasion, as it was specifically designed for counter-insurgency operations in difficult terrain. By the beginning of February 1977, at least six of the 13 Broncos were operating in East Timor, and helped the Indonesian military pinpoint Fretilin positions. The OV-10 Broncos dealt a heavy blow to the Falintil when the aircraft attacked their forces with conventional weapons and Soviet-supplied Napalm known as 'Opalm.' Along with the new weaponry, an additional 10,000 troops were sent in to begin new campaigns that would become known as the 'final solution'.|$|E

5|$|Coutances {{was elected}} to the see of Lincoln on 8 May 1183, {{selected}} by King Henry over three other candidates. He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183 and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183 at Angers by Richard of Dover, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was enthroned at Lincoln Cathedral on 11 December 1183. While at Lincoln, Coutances took part in the election of Baldwin of Forde as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184. Writing about Coutances' time at Lincoln, Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese of Lincoln and of squandering <b>its</b> <b>resources.</b> Coutances helped the schools in the city of Lincoln, acting as the patron for scholars such as John of Tynemouth and Simon of Southwell.|$|E
5|$|Despite this failure, Arab {{pressure}} gradually {{began to}} mount, {{especially after the}} sack of Laodicea Combusta in 770. The Byzantines were still capable of major counterstrokes and scored a few victories in the field, but in 782 the Caliphate mobilized <b>its</b> <b>resources</b> and launched a massive invasion under the Abbasid heir-apparent, Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), which forced the Empire into conceding a three-year truce and the payment of a heavy tribute. When warfare resumed in 785, and until {{the outbreak of the}} Abbasid civil war following Harun's death in 809, the Abbasids established and maintained a clear military supremacy, although vigorous Byzantine resistance prohibited any plans for outright conquest. Kamacha itself was surrendered to the Arabs by its Armenian garrison in 793, only to be recovered by the Byzantines in the years following Harun's death. It fell again in Muslim hands in 822, and was not finally taken by the Byzantines until 851.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 850s and early 860s Ímar was {{involved}} in a protracted conflict with Máel Sechnaill, overking of the Southern Uí Néill and the most powerful ruler in Ireland. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, but it may have been sparked by competition for control of Munster and <b>its</b> <b>resources.</b> Ímar allied successively with Cerball, King of Osraige and Áed Findliath, overking of the Northern Uí Néill against Máel Sechnaill. Máel Sechnaill died in 862 and his lands were split, effectively ending the conflict. Following this Ímar and his kin warred with several Irish leaders in an attempt to expand their kingdom's influence. Ímar disappears from the historical record in Ireland between the years 864 and 870; this is consistent with Ímar being identical to Ivar the Boneless - Ivar was active in England between these two dates and he is not mentioned by English sources after 870. In 870 the annals record that Dumbarton Rock, the chief fortress of the kingdom of Strathclyde, was successfully captured by Ímar and Amlaíb following a four-month-long siege.|$|E

5|$|Malini is an indigent {{woman whose}} father is in poor health. She is persuaded by her friend Sundari, an actress, {{to join her}} theatre company, Kala Mandhiram. Malini soon becomes very {{successful}} and popular. She is later befriended by Sampath, a charlatan, who is regularly involved in dodging creditors. Deaf to all advice, Malini allows herself to be led astray in professional, financial and moral terms. She is put out of Kala Mandhiram and sets up a theatre company of her own where Sampath appoints himself as general manager. She also severs ties with those who previously helped her, including Sundari. At first, the new company prospers, but <b>its</b> <b>resources</b> are soon squandered by Sampath and it falls under a weight of debt and disgrace. Sampath abandons Malini, who falls back to her previous poor condition. However, with Sundari's help, she returns to Kala Mandhiram and begins her life anew.|$|E
5|$|On {{receiving}} this reply, Bonaparte immediately {{ordered his}} fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers directed an amphibious operation in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic {{sites around the}} island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of Mdina fell to General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. Although Valletta {{was strong enough to}} hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of <b>its</b> <b>resources</b> over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights. Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he {{and the rest of the}} expeditionary force sailed eastwards for Alexandria on 19 June.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Railway was {{primarily}} a passenger-carrying railway which used most of <b>its</b> <b>resources</b> to extend its electrified lines. There was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however, although the Traffic Department preferred mixed traffic designs which could also haul passenger trains on the remaining non-electrified lines at peak periods. By the late 1930s the Southern Railway was adequately served with powerful mixed traffic locomotives of the S15 and N and N1 classes, {{but there was a}} need for a smaller freight locomotive with high route availability that could also undertake light passenger duties. This role had been performed by the ex-LSWR 'Jubilee' A12 0-4-2, which were approaching the end of their useful lives.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{results were}} favorable, and a {{full-scale}} mockup was formally reviewed in March 1949.

By the following year, the Il-30 program had lost momentum as the Ilyushin OKB was ordered to concentrate <b>its</b> <b>resources</b> on facilitating the service introduction of the Il-28.

5|$|The pharaoh was the {{absolute}} monarch {{of the country}} and, at least in theory, wielded complete control {{of the land and}} <b>its</b> <b>resources.</b> The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the vizier, who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the archives. At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch, who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The temples formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they houses of worship, but were also responsible for collecting and storing the nation's wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers, who redistributed grain and goods.|$|E
