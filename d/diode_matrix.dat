The building's project, work of Kievan-native architects Oleksandr Malynovsky and Oleksandr Komarovsky, was a very fine crafted design. This was because it had to match the imposing Kiev Post Office building opposite not only in proportions, but in such a style that would blend in with the milieu, yet be visibly a modern structure. One feature that punctuated the latter, was a 24-metre tower with four 7.2 x 4.3 metre screens displaying the current time, temperature, date and other information. This became the official clock tower of Ukraine, and chimed the famous melody Yak tebe ne lyubyty, Kyyeve miy.

The ALART space instrument exhibits a multi-beam design, providing height retrieval over a wide area and terrain slope measurements.

40|$|Abstract As use {{of printed}} {{electronics}} is going towards expansion in near future, researchers are studying methods {{for development of}} printed components, and also procedures for driving them. Few low speed but low cost, and flexible stand alone systems e. g., some sensor systems and displays; have already {{made their way to}} market after competing conventional, high speed, high cost, and rigid silicon electronics. At present, there are different type of printed sensors and display matrices, which have been developed but not being used in stand alone systems. Thus, there was a need for demonstrating ‘developed printed electronic components’ in such a way, that they are integrated with other core electronic circuits like embedded systems, to assure their ability to replace individual conventional component. In the thesis, some experiments were conducted to drive printed electronic components while overlooking their manufacturing details; i. e., the circuit used to drive the printed components was not a part of printed technology (e. g., printed processing, memory units), rather a conventional system (e. g., microcontroller and microprocessor boards available in market) is used. Particularly for this project the printed components are meant to be capacitive sensor matrix, resistive touch screen, organic light emitting <b>diodes</b> (OLED) <b>matrix,</b> electrophoretic display matrix, and electrochromic display matrix. These components were interfaced using embedded system {{in such a way that}} they can be driven meaningfully e. g., resistive touch screen can control display option for OLED matrix. Embedded Linux has significant advantages over previously used OS and non-OS based solutions as it is robust, scalable, and manage resources efficiently. Such a system with backbone of Linux processing was a part of design, which handled a separately designed interface board capable of interfacing 13 capacitive sensor (maximum 8 pF) inputs, a four wire resistive touch screen (with few hundred ohm resistance between terminals), a current driver with 50 mA segment current for 10 x 10 display matrix and voltage range from 0 to 5 V, voltage driver for two led segments capable of dissipate 40 mA at 5 V, finally a voltage driver for separate 10 led segments capable of dissipating 40 mA from 0 to 15 V or a 10 x 10 display matrix with power rating of maximum 16. 9 mA at 0 to 15 V. So, in this way different displays or individual led segments can be interfaced with a system which can download their display configuration from HTTP client based user interface, and upload the capacitive sensor and resistive touch screen readings back to user. The device was capable of changing demonstration parameters e. g., blinking, animation for displays via user interface, and program structure was kept convertible so that minor changes can create completely new demonstration: interfacing different components. Design included a power board capable of providing stable 1 A supply current at 5 V. A Current-Voltage (I-V) characterizing board was part of design which can measure I-V curve of printed solar cells. Printed electronic components were interfaced with embedded systems without much problem, making one comfortable in conclusion that these individual components are ready to replace conventional components in non-standalone systems at-least...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{microscopy}} is {{an essential}} tool in biological science {{and one of the}} gold standards for medical examinations. Miniaturization of microscopes can be a crucial stepping stone towards realizing compact, cost-effective and portable platforms for biomedical research and healthcare. This thesis reports on implementations of bright-field and fluorescence chip-scale microscopes for a variety of biological imaging applications. The term “chip-scale microscopy” refers to lensless imaging techniques realized in the form of mass-producible semiconductor devices, which transforms the fundamental design of optical microscopes. Our strategy for chip-scale microscopy involves utilization of low-cost Complementary metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, computational image processing and micro-fabricated structural components. First, the sub-pixel resolving optofluidic microscope (SROFM), will be presented, which combines microfluidics and pixel super-resolution image reconstruction to perform high-throughput imaging of fluidic samples, such as blood cells. We discuss design parameters and construction of the device, as well as the resulting images and the resolution of the device, which was 0. 66 µm at the highest acuity. The potential applications of SROFM for clinical diagnosis of malaria in the resource-limited settings is discussed. Next, the implementations of ePetri, a self-imaging Petri dish platform with microscopy resolution, are presented. Here, we simply place the sample of interest {{on the surface of the}} image sensor and capture the direct shadow images under the illumination. By taking advantage of the inherent motion of the microorganisms, we achieve high resolution (1 µm) imaging and long term culture of motile microorganisms over ultra large field-of-view (5. 7 mm × 4. 4 mm) in a specialized ePetri platform. We apply the pixel super-resolution reconstruction to a set of low-resolution shadow images of the microorganisms as they move across the sensing area of an image sensor chip and render an improved resolution image. We perform longitudinal study of Euglena gracilis cultured in an ePetri platform and image based analysis on the motion and morphology of the cells. The ePetri device for imaging non-motile cells are also demonstrated, by using the sweeping illumination of a light emitting <b>diode</b> (LED) <b>matrix</b> for pixel super-resolution reconstruction of sub-pixel shifted shadow images. Using this prototype device, we demonstrate the detection of waterborne parasites for the effective diagnosis of enteric parasite infection in resource-limited settings. Then, we demonstrate the adaptation of a smartphone’s camera to function as a compact lensless microscope, which uses ambient illumination as its light source and does not require the incorporation of a dedicated light source. The method is also based on the image reconstruction with sweeping illumination technique, where the sequence of images are captured while the user is manually tilting the device around any ambient light source, such as the sun or a lamp. Image acquisition and reconstruction is performed on the device using a custom-built android application, constructing a stand-alone imaging device for field applications. We discuss the construction of the device using a commercial smartphone and demonstrate the imaging capabilities of our system. Finally, we report on the implementation of fluorescence chip-scale microscope, based on a silo-filter structure fabricated on the pixel array of a CMOS image sensor. The extruded pixel design with metal walls between neighboring pixels successfully guides fluorescence emission through the thick absorptive filter to the photodiode layer of a pixel. Our silo-filter CMOS image sensor prototype achieves 13 -µm resolution for fluorescence imaging over a wide field-of-view (4. 8 mm × 4. 4 mm). Here, we demonstrate bright-field and fluorescence longitudinal imaging of living cells in a compact, low-cost configuration. ...|$|R

30|$|A {{considerable}} part of {{the behavior}} in smart environments relies on event-driven and rule specification. Rules are the mechanism most often used to enable user customization of the environment [7]. Some research workers propose socially acceptable physiological signal monitoring system consisting of a natural sensing interface and an intuitive information display [8]. Other studies in economic psychology have repeatedly revealed that energy consumption behavior in the household could be optimized through the provision of frequent and immediate feedback [9]–[11]. Another system is designed to make integration and interconnections of new metering devices and visualizations simple and constitutes a good basis for further research on awareness of energy usage in our (future) living environments [9]. Next was presented a fully distributed system and architecture based on a network of smart cameras to perform georeferenced tracking and activity recognition. Additionally an intuitive visualization was presented, where all information were integrated in one world model that is available ubiquitously [12]. A different paper proposes {{a new way of}} providing virtual smart home services using tangible mixed reality (MR), which provides more cost-effective and reliable visualization and simulation of the existing pervasive environment [13]. Other way of visualization is new HMI (Human-Machine Interface) system, which is based on statically positioned indicators for data output and a touch screen above them for data input. Indication elements consist of discrete light emitting <b>diodes</b> (LED), LED <b>matrices,</b> segment-type displays and small sized graphical visualization panels [14]. Some studies focuses on the application-layer simulation to propose a Visualization System of Context-aware Application Scenario Planning (VS-CaSP) for assisting non-technical developers and end-users in rapidly and easily designing the application scenario of smart buildings and in performing the acceptable and predictable simulation and evaluation [15]. The promising trend of visualization technology for textiles facilitates home consumers to approach and access both market information and application guidelines with easy means such as a remote controller, therefore, may help to promote the home textile consumptions significantly [16]. One of key components in the development of smart home technology is the detection and recognition of activities of daily life. Based on a self-adaptive neural network called Growing Self-Organizing Maps (GSOM), was presented a new computational approach to cluster analysis of human activities of daily living within smart home environment [17].|$|R
