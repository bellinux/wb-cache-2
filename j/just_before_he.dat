5|$|After a {{month of}} preparation, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was to assault the Confederate works at Yorktown, McClellan learned that Johnston had {{withdrawn}} up the Peninsula towards Williamsburg.

Samantha later tweeted that Akhil appeared for shooting his portions in the film. When his health conditions worsened, Nageswara Rao asked Nagarjuna to bring the dubbing equipment to dub for his role fifteen days before his surgery as he did not want any other artist to do it if his voice worsened. He completed those activities <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died on 22 January 2014. Only an appearance in a song remained incomplete.|$|E

5|$|Crane {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E

5|$|The {{concession}} conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
