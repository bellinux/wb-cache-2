2500|$|One {{possible}} {{cause of a}} delay in the onset of puberty past the age 14 in girls and 15 in boys is Kallmann syndrome, a form of <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (HH). Kallmann syndrome is also associated {{with a lack of}} sense of smell (anosmia). [...] Kallmann syndrome and other forms of HH affect both men and women. It is caused by a failure in HPG axis at puberty which results in low or zero gonadotropin (LH and FSH) levels with the subsequent result of a failure to commence or complete puberty, secondary hypogonadism and infertility.|$|E

5000|$|Based on its cause, {{the type}} of <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (HH) may be {{classified}} as either primary or secondary.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, he {{described}} a congenital endocrine condition (<b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> with anosmia) {{that has come}} to be known as Kallmann's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Clinically, {{mutation}} {{results in}} the X-linked form of Kallmann syndrome. Individuals with Kallmann syndrome experience anosmia (lack of smell) and do not go through puberty (hypothalamic <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Secondary - defect lies {{outside of}} the gonad: e.g. Polycystic ovary syndrome, and Kallmann syndrome, also called <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> Hemochromatosis and {{diabetes}} mellitus can be causes of this as well.|$|E
50|$|Obesity {{increases}} the risk of <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> Animal models indicate that obesity causes leptin insensitivity in the hypothalamus, leading to decreased Kiss1 expression, which, in turn, alters the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).|$|E
50|$|Administration of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) (or human {{chorionic}} gonadotropin) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is {{very effective in}} the treatment of male infertility due to <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> Although controversial, off-label clomiphene citrate, an antiestrogen, may also be effective by elevating gonadotropin levels.|$|E
50|$|Congenital <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> {{presents}} as hypogonadism, e.g., {{reduced or}} absent puberty , low libido, infertility, etc. {{due to an}} impaired release of the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), and a resultant lack of sex steroid and peptides production by the gonads.|$|E
50|$|Other {{causes of}} {{dwarfism}} are spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, diastrophic dysplasia, pseudoachondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, Noonan syndrome, primordial dwarfism, Turner syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), and hypothyroidism. Severe shortness with skeletal distortion also occurs {{in several of}} the Mucopolysaccharidoses and other storage disorders. <b>Hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> may cause proportionate, yet temporary, dwarfism.|$|E
50|$|Kallmann {{syndrome}} (KS) {{and other}} forms of <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (HH) are classed as pituitary or endocrine disorders. While the end result is a failure of puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics, the underlying cause of the disorder is located between the two endocrine glands located within the brain.|$|E
5000|$|Primary HH, {{also called}} {{isolated}} <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism,</b> {{is responsible for}} only a small subset of cases of HH, and is characterized by an otherwise normal function and anatomy of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. It is caused by congenital disorders such as Kallmann syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone insensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Kallmann {{syndrome}} {{is a form}} of <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (HH). Approximately 50% of HH cases occur with no sense of smell and are classified as Kallmann syndrome. Apart from the sense of smell there is no difference in the diagnosis or treatment between a case of HH or a case of Kallmann syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (HH), {{also known}} as {{secondary}} or central hypogonadism, as well as gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency or gonadotropin deficiency (GD), is a medical condition characterized by hypogonadism due to an impaired secretion of gonadotropins, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), by the pituitary gland in the brain, and in turn decreased gonadotropin levels and a resultant lack of sex steroid production.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a protein}} that lacks the normal DNA-binding domain {{contained}} in other nuclear receptors. The encoded protein {{acts as a}} dominant-negative regulator of transcription of other nuclear receptors including steroidogenic factor 1. This protein also functions as an anti-testis gene by acting antagonistically to SRY. Mutations in this gene result in both X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia and <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (HH), {{also known}} as {{secondary}} or central hypogonadism, as well as gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency or gonadotropin deficiency (GD), is a condition which is characterized by hypogonadism due to an impaired secretion of gonadotropins, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), by the pituitary gland in the brain, and in turn decreased gonadotropin levels and a resultant lack of sex steroid production.|$|E
50|$|Affected males {{may also}} lack male sex hormones, {{which leads to}} {{underdeveloped}} reproductive tissues, undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), delayed puberty, and an inability to father children (infertility). These characteristics are known as <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> Females are rarely affected by this disorder, but a few cases have been reported of adrenal insufficiency {{or a lack of}} female sex hormones, resulting in underdeveloped reproductive tissues, delayed puberty, and an absence of menstruation.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of congenital <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (CHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS) {{has been estimated}} {{to be in the}} region of 1 in 10,000 male births. This figure comes from a 1973 study of French Foreign Legion conscripts A more recent paper published in 2011 gave the incidence in the Finnish population at 1 in 48,000, with a sex distinction of 1 in 30,000 for males and 1 in 125,000 for females.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 a {{team led}} by Prof. Nelly Pitteloud and Andrew Dwyer of the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) in Switzerland {{proposed}} the formation of a European wide research consortium funded by the European Cooperation on Science and Technology organisation (COST) that would provide a framework for clinicians and researchers to collaborate their research into GnRH deficiency conditions, including Kallmann syndrome and other forms of <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> The first meeting of COST Action BM1105 http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/bmbs/Actions/BM1105 was held in Brussels in February 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{features}} of Kallmann syndrome (KS) and congenital <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (CHH) can be {{split into two}} different categories; [...] "reproductive" [...] and [...] "non reproductive". Not all symptoms will appear in every case of KS/CHH, not even amongst family members. Some of these features {{are linked to the}} gene defects known to cause KS/CHH, but in some cases it is still not clear why some of these features exist. It has been estimated that 60% of KS/CHH cases will show a non-reproductive symptom.|$|E
50|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{insensitivity}} {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} genetic and endocrine syndrome which is characterized by inactivating mutations of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) and thus an insensitivity of the receptor to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), resulting in a partial or complete loss of {{the ability of the}} gonads to synthesize the sex hormones. The condition manifests itself as isolated <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (IHH), presenting with symptoms such as delayed, reduced, or absent puberty, low or complete lack of libido, and infertility, and is the predominant cause of IHH when it does not present alongside anosmia.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} {{cause of a}} delay in the onset of puberty past the age 14 in girls and 15 in boys is Kallmann syndrome, a form of <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (HH). Kallmann syndrome is also associated {{with a lack of}} sense of smell (anosmia). Kallmann syndrome and other forms of HH affect both men and women. It is caused by a failure in HPG axis at puberty which results in low or zero gonadotropin (LH and FSH) levels with the subsequent result of a failure to commence or complete puberty, secondary hypogonadism and infertility.|$|E
50|$|X-linked adrenal {{hypoplasia}} congenita {{is caused}} by mutations in the NR0B1 gene. More than 90 NR0B1 mutations that cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita have been identified. Many of these mutations delete {{all or part of}} the NR0B1 gene, preventing the production of DAX1 protein. Some mutations cause the production of an abnormally short protein. Other mutations cause a change in one of the building blocks (amino acids) of DAX1. These mutations are thought to result in a misshapen, nonfunctional protein. Loss of DAX1 function leads to adrenal insufficiency and <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism,</b> which are the main characteristics of this disorder.|$|E
50|$|Anosmin-1 is a secreted, EM {{associated}} glycoprotein {{found in}} humans and other organisms responsible for normal development, which {{is expressed in}} the brain, spinal cord and kidney. Absence or damage to the protein results in Kallmann syndrome in humans, which is characterized by loss of olfactory bulbs and GnRH secretion leading to anosmia and hypothalamic <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> Anosmin-1 is coded by the KAL-1 gene, which is found on the X chromosome. Anosmin-1 is 100 kilodaltons and is expressed {{on the outside of}} cells. Because of this and because of its contribution to normal migration of nerve cells, a role in the extracellular matrix has been postulated.|$|E
50|$|GnRH neurons, or Gonadotropin-releasing hormone expressing neurons, are {{the cells}} in the brain that control the release of {{reproductive}} hormones from the pituitary. These brain cells control reproduction by secreting GnRH into the hypophyseal portal capillary bloodstream, so are {{sometimes referred to as}} “sex neurons”. This small capillary network carries GnRH to the anterior pituitary, causing release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) into the wider bloodstream. When GnRH neurons change their pattern of release from the juvenile to the adult pattern of GnRH secretion, puberty is initiated. Failure of GnRH neurons to form the proper connections, or failure to successfully stimulate the pituitary with GnRH, means that puberty is not initiated. These disruptions to the GnRH system cause reproductive disorders like <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> or Kallmann Syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the NR0B1 gene {{located on}} the X {{chromosome}} (Xp21.3-p21.2) cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. The NR0B1 gene provides instructions to make a transcription factor protein called DAX1 that helps control the activity of certain genes. When the NR0B1 gene is deleted or mutated, the activity of certain genes is not properly controlled. This leads to problems {{with the development of}} the adrenal glands, two structures in the brain (the hypothalamus and pituitary gland), and reproductive tissues (the ovaries or testes). These tissues are important for the production of many hormones that control various functions in the body. When these hormones are not present in the correct amounts, the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> can result. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.|$|E
50|$|The {{apparent}} pituitary adenoma had {{at least}} three additional secondary effects on his medical condition besides causing acromegaly. First, his eyes show progressive misalignment, indicating the tumor grew laterally into the cavernous sinus and compromised the cranial nerves controlling eye muscle power. Second, he has a hairless face. Although potentially just a personal choice, {{in the presence of}} a large pituitary tumor, this is more likely due to testosterone deficiency. This condition results from the enlarging tumor interfering with the normal function of gonadotropin pituitary cells resulting in secondary <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> and infertility. Third, in 1858 his lateral eyebrows were absent, indicating secondary hypothyroidism, also caused by the tumor compromising the function of the normal pituitary thyrotrope cells. The 1852 daguerreotype of Pio Pico may be the earliest objective image of acromegaly ever recorded since the disease was not recognized and named until Pierre Marie coined the term in 1886 while he was working at the clinic of Jean-Martin Charcot in Paris, France.|$|E
5000|$|Fezolinetant shows high {{affinity}} for and potent inhibition of the NK3 receptor in vitro (Ki = 25 nM, IC50 = 20 nM).Loss-of-function mutations in TACR and TACR3, the genes respectively encoding neurokinin B and its receptor, the NK3 receptor, {{have been found}} in patients with idiopathic <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> In accordance, NK3 receptor antagonists like fezolinetant have been found to dose-dependently suppress luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, though not that of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and consequently to dose-dependently decrease estradiol and progesterone levels in women and testosterone levels in men. As such, they are similar to GnRH modulators, and present as a potential clinical alternative to them for use in the same kinds of indications. However, the inhibition of sex hormone production by NK3 receptor inactivation tends to be less complete and [...] "non-castrating" [...] relative to that of GnRH modulators, and so they may have a reduced incidence of menopausal-like side effects such as loss of bone mineral density.|$|E
5000|$|The fertile eunuch {{syndrome}} {{is a cause}} of <b>hypogonadotropic</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> caused by a lutheinizing hormone deficiency. It is characterized by hypogonadism with spermatogenesis. Pasqualini and Bur published the first case of eunuchoidism with preserved spermatogenesis in 1950 in la Revista de la Asociación Médica Argentina.The hypoandrogenism with spermatogenesis syndrome included: (a) eunuchoidism, (b) testis with normal spermatogenesis and full volume, with mature spermatozoids in {{a high proportion of}} seminiferous tubes and undifferentiated and immature Leydig cells (c) full functional compensation through the administration of chorionic gonadotropin hormone, while hCG is administered (d) total urinary gonadotrophins within normal limits (e) this definition implies the normal activity of the pituitary and the absence of congenital malformations in general. In describing five other similar cases in 1953, Mc Cullagh & al [...] coined the term fertile eunuch introducing it in the English literature. Unfortunately, this term is incorrect and should not be employed. Indeed, these patients are not really eunuchs. Moreover, as it will be explained later, they are not usually fertile if not treated.|$|E
