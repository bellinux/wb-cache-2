40|$|We use a regression-discontinuity {{design to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> sixth-grade {{students}} in reading and mathematics on their achievement across three years of middle school. To identify the effect of the intervention, we use sharp cutoffs in the test scores used to assign students to <b>double</b> <b>blocking.</b> We find large, positive, and persistent effects of <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> in reading, but, unlike previous research, we find no statistically significant effects of <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> in mathematics either in the short run or medium run...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA proper <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set in PG(2,p) {{is a set}} B {{of points}} such that 2 ⩽|B∩l|⩽(p+ 1) - 2 for each line l. The {{smallest}} known example of a proper <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set in PG(2,p) for large primes p is the disjoint union of two projective triangles of side (p+ 3) / 2; {{the size of this}} set is 3 p+ 3. For each prime p⩾ 11 such that p≡ 3 (mod 4) we construct a proper <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set with 3 p+ 1 points, and for each prime p⩾ 7 we construct a proper <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set with 3 p+ 2 points...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>doubled</b> <b>block</b> also blocks {{trailing}} {{pieces of}} the player who created the block, or blocks them unless they roll the exact number {{to land on the}} block; additionally, the <b>doubled</b> <b>block</b> cannot move forwards until the block that landed upon it moves off again. This reduces the tactical advantage of a block and makes the game more interesting.|$|R

40|$|The {{representation}} of H 4 histone mRNA sequences in RNAs isolated from G 1 and S phase HeLa cells {{was assessed by}} use of a homologous H 4 histone cDNA. S phase cells were obtained by <b>double</b> thymidine <b>block,</b> and G 1 cells were obtained by <b>double</b> thymidine <b>block</b> or mitotic selective detachment. Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs from S phase cells hybridized with H 4 histone cDNA as did nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs from G 1 cells synchronized by <b>double</b> thymidine <b>block.</b> In contrast, significant levels of hybridization were not observed between H 4 histone cDNA and nuclear, polysomal, or postpolysomal cytoplasmic RNAs of G 1 cells synchronized by mitotic selective detachment. <b>Double</b> thymidine <b>block</b> yields a G 1 cell population containing 20 - 25 % S phase cells whereas the G 1 population obtained by mitotic detachment contains less than 0. 1 % S phase cells. The ability of H 4 histone cDNA to hybridize with the RNAs from G 1 cells obtained after release from <b>double</b> thymidine <b>block</b> can therefore {{be explained by the}} presence of S phase cells in such a G 1 population [...] an artifact of the synchronization procedure. We interpret these results to be consistent with the presence of H 4 histone mRNA sequences during the S but not G 1 phase of the cell cycle in continuously dividing HeLa S 3 cells...|$|R
60|$|Great was {{the anxiety}} of course to secure the prize, and {{energetic}} the action displayed. Zulu, being the most active and cat-like, was ordered to pass a rope round the net to which a powerful <b>double</b> <b>block</b> was applied.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was {{constructing}} the shears. Lashing the two topmasts together, and making allowance for their unequal length, at the point of intersection I attached the <b>double</b> <b>block</b> of the main throat-halyards. This, with the single block and the throat-halyards themselves, gave me a hoisting tackle. To prevent the butts of the masts from slipping on the deck, I nailed down thick cleats. Everything in readiness, I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and carried it directly to the windlass. I was growing to have faith in that windlass, for it gave me power beyond all expectation. As usual, Maud held the turn while I heaved. The shears rose in the air.|$|E

40|$|A twofold <b>blocking</b> set (<b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set) in {{a finite}} {{projective}} plane Π {{is a set}} of points, intersecting every line in at least two points. The minimum number of points in a <b>double</b> <b>blocking</b> set of Π is denoted by τ 2 (Π). Let PG(2,q) be the Desarguesian projective plane over GF(q), the finite field of q elements. We show that if q is odd, not a prime, and r is the order of the largest proper subfield of GF(q), then τ 2 PG(2,q)) ≤ 2 (q+(q- 1) /(r- 1)). For a finite projective plane Π, let χ-(Π) denote the maximum number of classes in a partition of the point-set, such that each line has at least two points in some partition class. It can easily be seen that χ-(Π) ≥v-τ 2 (Π) + 1 ({star operator}) for every plane Π on v points. Let q=ph, p prime. We prove that for Π= PG (2,q), equality holds in ({star operator}) if q and p are large enough. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

6000|$|But {{he remembered}} a {{block and tackle}} in the tool-house, and ran and brought it.

50|$|On 8 May 1988, {{the former}} signal box and {{interlocked}} frame were abolished. Also abolished were crossovers, formerly {{located at the}} Up and Down ends of the station, and the <b>double</b> line <b>block</b> system between Reservoir and Keon Park, which was replaced with automatic three position signalling. Pedestrian boom barriers were also provided at the pedestrian crossing, located at the Down end of the station, and at the High Street level crossing. Two months earlier, the <b>double</b> line <b>block</b> system between Bell and Reservoir was abolished.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984 {{the site}} was redeveloped. The {{original}} hall was converted into seven superior residential apartments, whilst retaining its external appearance. In addition seven new modern style <b>double</b> <b>blocks</b> each of six apartments {{were built in the}} grounds overlooking the lake, giving 49 apartments, most occupied by retirees. Further development of eight large detached houses known as Lakeside occurred alongside the apartments. In the 2000s around 100 apartments known as Lady Aston Park exclusively for the over 55s were built. A BUPA residential care home and private BUPA hospital followed.|$|R
