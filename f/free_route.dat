25|$|Today, {{hundreds}} of climbers scale the sheer rock walls of Devils Tower each summer. The most common route is the Durrance Route, {{which was the}} second <b>free</b> <b>route</b> established in 1938. There are many established and documented climbing routes covering every side of the tower, ascending the various vertical cracks and columns of the rock. The difficulty of these routes range from relatively easy {{to some of the}} most challenging in the world. All climbers are required to register with a park ranger before and after attempting a climb. No overnight camping at the summit is allowed; climbers return to base on the same day they ascend.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} {{congestion pricing}} zone {{was defined as}} the island of Manhattan, bordered by the East and Hudson Rivers south of 60th Street. The northern border of the congestion zone was originally slated to be 86th Street, but this changed after the commission's recommendation released on January 10, 2008. Exempted roadways within the zone include the FDR Drive, New York Route 9A (West Side Highway and Henry Hudson Parkway included), the Battery Park Underpass, and the East River bridges (Queensboro Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge) and their approaches. A <b>free</b> <b>route</b> from the East River bridges to the FDR Drive and from the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels to Route 9A would be designated. Drivers who use toll crossings to or from the zone (e.g. Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and Queens-Midtown Tunnel) would be charged the difference between the toll and the congestion charge.|$|E
25|$|Three {{distinct}} loyalty {{products are}} offered, tailored towards business and frequent flyers. These are Flexi Fare, easyJet Plus {{and a new}} frequent traveller loyalty programme called Flight Club. Flexi Fare {{is a type of}} ticket that is usually more expensive than the regular fare and comparable to a business ticket with other airlines. This ticket offers additional flexibility, including unlimited free date changes within a set period, <b>free</b> <b>route</b> changes, complimentary checked baggage (1x20kg), an increased carry-on baggage allowance, and a £5 on board refreshment voucher. easyJet Plus is an annual subscription product targeted at frequent flyers, both business and leisure. This service offers free allocated seating (including extra legroom), priority check-in, fast track security, speedy boarding and extra cabin baggage. The airline's loyalty programme is called Flight Club. To qualify for this a person must have flown at least twenty times or spent over £1500 on ten flights within 12 months. Benefits include fee-free flight changes, free name changes, and a dedicated contact centre team.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Link {{reversal}} routing (LRR) is a local, distributed, and low-overhead {{technique used}} to maintain loop <b>free</b> <b>routes</b> in mobile wireless ad hoc networks. We explore {{the problem of}} load balancing the packet traffic in the network when using the LRR created routes. We study a fundamental LRR algorithm and identify usual situations which cause the load to be unbalanced. We propose two modifications to the LRR algorithm such that the load is distributed in a more uniform manner. The modifications preserve all the desirable qualities of LRR algorithms such as loop <b>free</b> <b>routes,</b> local response to topology change and are completely distributed in nature. In order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed mechanisms we augment the TORA, a LRR based routing protocol, module of NS- 2. We perform extensive simulations and compare the performance of modified TORA with basic TORA. It is observed that although the proposed mechanisms lead to better load balance, the routing overhead is considerably increased. We investigate the reason of this increase and propose ways of overcoming this problem. I...|$|R
