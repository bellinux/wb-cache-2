500|$|After {{his victory}} Maguire {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} Terry Griffiths {{who had been working}} with him on the mental side of the game: [...] "He's been on the phone <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> me to keep calm and that I can do it if I believe in myself". Maguire said he always knew he was good enough to win a tournament and that he would aim for a top-16 finish for the season. White said, [...] "Stephen outplayed me in safety, potting and position so he deserved to win" [...] and, [...] "He gave me a good bashing. I'm pleased for him because he's a nice lad but I'm disappointed because I didn't compete".|$|E
500|$|On July 28, 2005, Feldman and two {{teammates}} threw {{a perfect}} {{game against the}} Corpus Christi Hooks. It was the first combined nine-inning perfect game in Texas League history, and the third overall. Feldman was tasked with getting the last three outs, and with two outs in the ninth he let the count get to 3–1. [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> myself, 'Don't walk him,'" [...] Feldman said. [...] "Once it got to 3–1, I threw it right down the middle. [...] If they got a hit, they got a hit. [...] But they're not going {{to break up a}} perfect game on a walk." [...] The batter grounded out. [...] On July 31, the three pitchers shared the Texas League Pitcher of the Week Award.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{said of the}} song, [...] "It took me {{months to}} come up with 'Just the Way You Are'... I wasn't {{thinking}} of anything deep or poetic. I was telling a story. Get ready to fall in love!" [...] He added, [...] "I'm a big fan of songs like Joe Cocker's 'You Are So Beautiful' and Eric Clapton's 'Wonderful Tonight' - songs that go straight to the point. You know, there's no mind-boggling lyrics or twists in the story - they just come directly from the heart. And to me 'Just The Way You Are' is one of those songs. There's nothing mind-blowing about it. I'm <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> a woman she looks beautiful the way she IS - and, let's be honest, what woman doesn't wanna hear those lyrics?!" ...|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Abagnale himself {{addressed}} the issue of his story's truthfulness with a statement posted on his company's website which said in part: [...] "I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> a story and not writing my biography." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kaidan (怪談), which {{literally}} means “supernatural tale” or [...] "weird tale", {{is a form}} of Japanese ghost story. Kaidan {{entered the}} vernacular when a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular in the Edo period. The popularity of the game, as well as the acquisition of a printing press, {{led to the creation of}} a literary genre called Kaidanshu. Kaidan are not always horror stories, they can [...] "be funny, or strange, or <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> about an odd thing that happened one time".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E
