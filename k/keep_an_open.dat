Renzetti credited them with breathing [...] "new life" [...] into {{the crew of}} the Enterprise while simultaneously trying to kill them. The Borg Queen received special attention for her combination of horror and seduction; Ebert wrote that while the Queen [...] "looks like no notion of sexy I have ever heard of", he was inspired [...] "to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> mind". Carr said, [...] "She proves that women with filmy blue skin, lots of external tubing and bad teeth can be sleekly seductive." ...|$|E
500|$|Journalists have {{reported}} that fans preferring one era of the band strongly dislike others. Rock author Colin McGuire has described the arguments from fans of the Gabriel era as [...] "they sold out and became too corporate when Collins stepped into the spotlight", while fans of the Collins era argue [...] "the Gabriel years were boring and hard to stomach". He concluded both eras of the band should be judged on their own merits. The band themselves {{have been aware of}} these divides; press interviews for Abacab explicitly stated that fans of Foxtrot might not like the album, but should <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> mind.|$|E
500|$|No {{account or}} allusion to Philip's presumed {{conversion}} to Christianity survives. The Byzantinist and Arabist Irfan Shahîd, who argues {{in favor of}} Philip's Christianity in Rome and the Arabs, assumes {{that he had been}} a Christian before becoming emperor. He argues, therefore, that {{there is no need to}} explain the absence of evidence for Philip's conversion in contemporary Christian literature. Trachonitis, equidistant from Antioch in the north and Bosra in the south, and sited on a road connecting the two, could have been Christianized from either direction. Even if he was not himself Christian, Philip would probably have been familiar with Christians in his hometown as well as Bosra and other nearby settlements. Hans Pohlsander, a classicist and historian arguing against accounts of Philip's Christianity, allows that Philip [...] "may have been curious about a religion which had its origins in an area so close to his place of birth. As an eastern provincial rather than an Italian, he may not have been so intense in his commitment to the traditional Roman religion that he could not <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> mind on other religions." [...] He also accepts that Philippopolis probably contained a Christian congregation during Philip's childhood. For the scholar of religion Frank Trombley, however, the absence of evidence for the early Christianization of Philippopolis makes Shahîd's assumption that Philip was Christian from early childhood unmerited.|$|E

2500|$|Bishop Untener's {{career was}} marked by a {{consistent}} focus on egalitarianism in the church, ministry {{to the poor and}} participative liturgy. [...] His liberal views often put him at odds with orthodox Catholics and with the Vatican. He was regarded as being sensitive to the viewpoints of liberal Catholics. His overall view was that one should <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> mind, consider the logic of one's actions and how they affect the church, and reflect openly over controversial issues.

2500|$|But even if {{we accept}} the {{premises}} of eschatology, careful study is still necessary, for as John Walvoord says, [...] "One {{of the problems in}} the interpretation of prophecy is that every prophecy is related to other prophecies like pieces of a tapestry to the whole." [...] In the light of this, and of the fact that eschatology deals with events which are as yet unseen, it behooves us to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> mind.

It is relatively cheap, does not emit any radiation, is accessible, {{is capable of}} visualizing tissue function in real time and allows to the performing of provocative maneuvers in order to replicate the patient’s pain.

During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house".

2500|$|Spanish Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta did {{not seek}} war with the United States. He did not expect victory, but he knew Spanish {{citizens}} would likely revolt if he conceded to American demands in Cuba. Meanwhile, Spanish naval leaders tried to employ a strategy where they would not win the war outright, but rather resist the US Navy as much as possible.

2500|$|On October 12, 2007, The Hellacopters {{announced}} {{they would be}} breaking up after releasing their seventh full-length album Head Off, a collection of cover songs. According to the band, {{the reason for the}} breakup was to quit while they were still on top and not because of tension within the band. The album was originally presented as a regular Hellacopters studio album so that the fans would <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> mind about the music. Håkansson also felt that it was fitting for the fans to get to know eleven new great bands to check out after the band's break up. The album debuted at number four in the Swedish charts and in the top 20 in Finland and Norway. The last Hellacopters shows were played at Debaser Medis in Stockholm October 25 and 26; the concerts were filmed and streamed live on the band's MySpace page. Several friends and collaborators of the band were in the audience, including members of Sahara Hotnights, Entombed, Burst, Stefan Sundström, Texas Terri, Pernilla Andersson and [...] "Demons" [...] (who was the opening band for most of the dates on the tour).

2500|$|Early on, Hayashi {{said they}} {{attempted}} to move on from relying just on sex and violence: [...] "We’re {{trying to focus on}} the real women that surround us; the voice of a female, the mannerisms. We are being realistic about it. We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [...] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up," [...] as opposed to the previous concept of just [...] "make her breasts big and just make them jiggle." [...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing.
