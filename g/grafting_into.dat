40|$|In vivo {{inoculation}} {{of cells}} such as tumor cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) /embryonic stem (ES) cells into immunocompromised mice {{has been considered}} as a powerful technique to evaluate their potential to proliferate or differentiate into various cell types originating from three germ cell layers. Subcutaneous grafting and grafting under the kidney capsule {{have been widely used}} for this purpose, but there are some demerits such as the requirement {{of a large number of}} tumor cells for inoculation and frequent failure of tumorigenesis. Therefore, <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> other sites has been explored, including intratesticular or intramuscular grafting as well as <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> the cochleae, liver, or salivary glands. In this study, we found that intrapancreatic parenchymal injection of cells is useful for allowing a small number of cells (~ 15 × 103 cells or ~ 30 cell clumps μL− 1 ·site− 1) to proliferate and sometimes differentiate into various types of cells. It requires only surgical exposure of the pancreas over the dorsal skin and subsequent injection of cells towards the pancreatic parenchyma under dissecting microscope-based observation using a mouthpiece-controlled glass micropipette. We now name this technology “intrapancreatic parenchymal cell transplantation (IPPCT) ”, which will be useful, especially when only a small number of cells or colonies are available...|$|E
40|$|Beneficial {{effects of}} carbon <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> the iron active {{material}} for rechargeable alkaline-iron-electrodes {{with and without}} Bi 2 S 3 additive is probed by in situ X-ray diffraction in conjunction with Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and electrochemistry. EXAFS data unravel that the composition of pristine active material (PAM) for iron electrodes comprises 87 % of magnetite and 13 % of alpha-iron while carbon-grafted active material comprises 60 % of magnetite and 40 % of alpha-iron. In situ XRD patterns are recorded using a specially designed electrochemical cell. XRD data reflect that magnetite present in PAM iron electrode, without bismuth sulfide additive, is not reduced during charging while PAM iron electrode with bismuth sulfide additive is partially reduced to alpha-Fe/Fe(OH) (2). Interestingly, carbon-grafted-iron electrodes with bismuth sulfide exhibit complete conversion of active material to alpha-Fe/Fe(OH) 2. The ameliorating effect of carbon grafting is substantiated by kinetic parameters obtained from steady-state potentiostatic polarization and Tafel plots. The mechanism for iron-electrode charge - discharge reactions {{are discussed in the}} light of the potential - pH diagrams for Fe - H 2 O, S - H 2 O and FeSads - H 2 O systems and it is surmised that carbon <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> iron active material promotes its electrochemical utilization.

40|$|Seventy-five {{percent of}} breast cancers are {{estrogen}} receptor α positive (ER(+)). Research on these tumors is hampered {{by lack of}} adequate in vivo models; cell line xenografts require non-physiological hormone supplements, and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are hard to establish. We show that the traditional grafting of ER(+) tumor cells into mammary fat pads induces TGFβ/SLUG signaling and basal differentiation when they require low SLUG levels to grow in vivo. <b>Grafting</b> <b>into</b> the milk ducts suppresses SLUG; ER(+) tumor cells develop, like their clinical counterparts, {{in the presence of}} physiological hormone levels.

40|$|AbstractNT 2 {{cells are}} a transfectable human {{embryonal}} carcinoma cell line, {{that can be}} differentiated into postmitotic neuron-like cells (NT 2 N cells), and transplanted into rodent brains.

Here, we show that this step can be omitted, and that undifferentiated NT 2 cells migrate over long distances and differentiate into both neuron- and oligodendrocyte-like cell types upon <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> brains of immunocompetent newborn mice. Grafted cells can be traced by fluorogold, with no evidence for tumor formation.

40|$|The {{activity}} of RNA polymerase {{has been determined}} in the nuclear fraction of normal mouse ovaries, 60 -day-old preneoplastic intrasplenic ovarian grafts, and ovarian tumours developed after 7 months of ovary <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> the spleen.

Oestradiol injected for 10 days, acting as depressant of the host pituitary gonadotrophic potency, decreased the enzyme level in the grafts, whereas no change was observed in similarly treated tumours. These facts indicate that hormonal mechanisms regulating the genetic nuclear expression are operating only in the 2 -month-old preneoplastic ovarian cell, while autonomy from these regulating mechanisms is achieved by 7 -month-old tumour cells...|$|E

Many E 13. 5 ventral telencephalic progenitors were observed to integrate and adopt local phenotypes following heterotopic transplantation into telencephalic or mid-hindbrain targets, whereas mid-hindbrain cells of the same stage were unable to integrate and change fate in the telencephalon. In contrast, many mid-hindbrain cells from an earlier developmental stage (E 10. 5) were capable of integrating and adopting a forebrain phenotype after <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> the telencephalon, suggesting that mouse mid-hindbrain progenitors become restricted in their developmental potential between E 10. 5 and E 13. 5...|$|E

When BFP is used for gap arthroplasty of the temporomandibular joint, minimal gap (6 – 7  mm) is advised [53]. The shrinkage rate is reported to be 28 % [53]. If the prepared gap is large, a greater amount of fat is required, and vertical height of the mandibular ramus cannot be maintained [54].

30|$|The {{operative}} treatment of intraarticular calcaneal fractures {{with or without}} bone grafting is still a topic of debate. The practice of using a bone graft to fill the “empty core” of the calcaneus during surgery has become increasingly popular. Many authors have incorporated bone <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> the fixation procedure, and have achieved satisfactory results [19, 20]. Some surgeons always use bone grafts [7, 16], whereas other surgeons do not use them at all [21, 22]. A nationwide survey of the Netherlands reported that, among the surgeons who operated on the ORIF group, 20  % definitely used bone grafts, 42  % used grafting when deemed necessary, and 38  % did not use bone grafts at all [23]. The objective {{of the present study}} was to compare the outcomes and complication rates of both groups (A and B) and to determine the differences between the groups in terms of final outcomes and complications.|$|E
40|$|The {{agent that}} causes prion {{diseases}} {{is thought to}} be identical to PrPSc, a conformer of the normal prion protein PrPC. Recently a novel protein, termed Doppel (Dpl), was identified that shares significant biochemical and structural homology with PrPC. To investigate the function of Dpl in neurogenesis and in prion pathology, we generated embryonic stem (ES) cells harbouring a homozygous disruption of the Prnd gene that encodes Dpl. After in vitro differentiation and <b>grafting</b> <b>into</b> adult brains of PrPC-deficient Prnp 0 / 0 mice, Dpl-deficient ES cell-derived grafts contained all neural lineages analyzed, including neurons and astrocytes. When Prnd-deficient neural tissue was inoculated with scrapie prions, typical features of prion pathology including spongiosis, gliosis and PrPSc accumulation, were observed. Therefore, Dpl is unlikely to exert a cell-autonomous function during neural differentiation and, in contrast to its homologue PrPC, is dispensable for prion disease progression and for generation of PrPSc...|$|E

40|$|Human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSC) are a {{heterogeneous}} cell population that contains adult multipotent stem cells. Although {{it is well}} established that hADSC have skeletal potential in vivo in adult organisms, in vitro assays suggest further differentiation capacity, such as into glia. Thus, we propose that <b>grafting</b> hADSC <b>into</b> the embryo can {{provide them with a}} much more instructive microenvironment, allowing the human cells to adopt diverse fates or niches. Here, hADSC spheroids were <b>grafted</b> <b>into</b> either the presumptive presomitic mesoderm or the first branchial arch (BA 1) regions of chick embryos. Cells were identified without previous manipulations via human-specific Alu probes, which allows efficient long-term tracing of heterogeneous primary cultures. When <b>grafted</b> <b>into</b> the trunk, in contrast to previous studies, hADSC were not found in chondrogenic or osteogenic territories up to E 8. Surprisingly, 82. 5 % of the hADSC were associated with HNK 1 + tissues, such as peripheral nerves. Human skin fibroblasts showed a smaller tropism for nerves. In line with other studies, hADSC also adopted perivascular locations. When <b>grafted</b> <b>into</b> the presumptive BA 1, 74. 6 % of the cells were in the outflow tract, the final goal of cardiac neural crest cells, and were also associated with peripheral nerves. This is the first study showing that hADSC could adopt a perineural niche in vivo and were able to recognize cues for neural crest cell migration of the host. Therefore, we propose that xenografts of human cells into chick embryos can reveal novel behaviors of heterogeneous cell populations, such as response to migration cues...|$|R
