In October 1995, Adobe acquired the <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> software company Frame Technology for US$566million, and re-branded its FrameMaker software to Adobe FrameMaker. Adobe acquired GoLive Systems in January 1999 and obtained its CyberStudio HTML editor software, releasing it as Adobe GoLive. In May 2003, Adobe acquired Syntrillium Software and its digital audio editor software Cool Edit Pro, and merged it into its product line, re-releasing it as Adobe Audition.|$|E

5|$|Research {{work on the}} Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties thanks {{to the need to}} copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.|$|E

5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, the {{combination}} of the Mac, Apple's LaserWriter printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's MacPublisher and Aldus PageMaker enabled users to design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics—an activity to become known as <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing.</b> Initially, <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> was unique to the Macintosh, but eventually became available for other platforms. Later, applications such as Macromedia FreeHand, QuarkXPress, and Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator strengthened the Mac's position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> market.|$|E
25|$|The Macintosh {{initially}} sold well, but follow-up {{sales were}} not strong {{due to its}} high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed {{with the introduction of}} the LaserWriter, the first PostScript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price, and PageMaker, an early <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> market. The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the <b>desktop</b> <b>publishing</b> market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.|$|E

40|$|Providing {{electronic}} document delivery (EDD) services to off-campus {{students can be}} a challenge. Methods of delivery that work well for one group of users might not work at all for another group. Knowing and using the different EDD service options to accomplish the goal of providing quality service to students results in a win-win situation. Student expectations of timely delivery of material are met and the department develops a reputation of dependable quality service. Library users have raised expectations from the 24 / 7 services available through the world wide web. EDD of information to the researcher???s desktop helps the library meet these needs and expectations. However, the options for desktop delivery can also be overwhelming, so knowing how and why different software and delivery methods work enables the practitioner to control {{the outcome of the}} transaction.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of smokers who manage to quit do so without {{the assistance of a}} facilitated cessation program. Since the majority of focused anti-smoking efforts are directed at facilitated programs, there is an apparent gap in service of the population at risk. Also, the sharp decline in smoking prevalence indicates a changing demographic dynamic. It is probable that those persons still smoking comprise a different population type than did smokers of a decade ago. A reexamination of major strategies for self-quitting is strongly indicated. The purpose of this thesis was to apply what was known about addictive behavior to a self-guided quitting process. Major variables guiding this effort were learning theory, theory of self-change, empirically demonstrated methods of cessation, and psychosocial effects on lifestyle change. The knowledge gained during the process was incorporated into a menu approach that emphasized personal responsibility for the quitting process and allows for choices that serve to tailor the program to the individual's needs. The end result was a quitters' guide, <b>desktop</b> <b>published</b> and prepared in a small quantity for pilot purposes. This guide was evaluated by persons with particular expertise in addictive behavior, especially smoking cessation. An ammended product was then presented to smokers and/or former smokers for further feedback. A journal of the process that detailed both difficulties and successes was also included.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} inadequate urban planning on municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in the Niger Delta Region (NDR) of Nigeria. The continuous migration and high concentration of people, administration and industrial activities in the region {{with little or no}} implementation of urban planning procedures during the development of the settlements in the region has contributed to increase the problem of MSWM in the NDR. It is not uncommon to see streets, roads, undeveloped plots of land and drains littered with solid waste in most Niger Delta cities, towns and communities. The data for this research were gathered from field surveys, observations, questionnaires as well as <b>desktop</b> information from <b>published</b> materials. Chi-Square statistical method was used in the analysis of the correlation data. The results show that there is a strong relationship between inadequate waste collection and the existence of unplanned settlements in the region. The study also revealed that indiscriminate waste disposal is strongly linked with the existence of unplanned settlements in the NDR of Nigeria. Therefore, the implementation of urban planning procedures and inclusion of waste management during the building and development of cities, towns and villages in the Niger Delta should be taking as a matter of high priority if cities in the region are to be clean and free from wastes and environmental pollution...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesAs US cost-containment {{pressures}} intensify, {{the hurdles}} to justify new drugs continues to grow. Safety and efficacy data from clinical trials alone {{are no longer}} adequate {{to meet the needs}} of all health care decision makers driving a need for robust, complementary data. The perceived need to collect real-world clinical, patient-centered, and/or economic outcomes through observational studies varies across stakeholders, organizations and geographical regions. To better understand how decision makers use observational studies to inform reimbursement decisions and/or market access for new health care products. MethodsWe conducted <b>desktop</b> research of <b>published</b> literature, HTA reports and third party websites, to identify types of observational studies most valuable to health insurance and managed care organizations in reimbursement decision making. We conducted initial one-on-one interviews with payer decision makers from the RTI-HS US Commercial Payer Advisory Panel. Further interviews with current medical directors and pharmacy directors are planned to review the need for real world evidence and provide insights into decision making process. Participants will be recruited to ensure representation from organizations of different sizes, types and geographical presence to identify the specific evidence requirements and design attributes most accepted by payers, and to understand how real world evidence contributes to the value of a new drug from the payers’ perspective. ResultsData from observational studies are used to describe patient segments, understand treatment patterns, resource utilization and provide effectiveness data supplementing clinical trialsdata. Preliminary results indicate these data help inform payer decision making but the validity and robustness of the results is often scrutinized. ConclusionsPublication of observational data in Tier 1, peer-reviewed journals lends critical credibility to real world studies. As reimbursement decision makers continue to rigorously review new therapies, accurate and generalizable real world data will become particularly important for outcomes or performance-based access schemes and budget management...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{personal}} desktops have faced {{the problem of}} information overload due to increasing computational power, {{easy access to the}} Web and cheap data storage. Moreover, an increasing number of diverse end-user desktop applications have led to the problem of information fragmentation. Each desktop application has its own data, unaware of related and relevant data in other applications. In other words, personal desktops face a lack of interoperability of data managed by different applications. Recent years have also seen the rapid growth of shared data in online social network communities. Desktop users have been publishing extensively data from their personal desktops to different social-networking sites. In the current data- <b>publishing</b> scenario, <b>desktop</b> data that is published to a social network becomes completely disconnected from desktops they originate. Moreover, there is no interoperability between the same <b>desktop</b> data <b>published</b> to different social networks. A core idea of a Social Semantic Desktop vision is to enable semantic integration and data interoperability on the personal desktop by applying Semantic Web technologies, and to connect data from personal desktops into a unified information space of social network communities. This thesis introduces a new form of documents, called Semantic Documents, which attempts to bring desktop documents closer to this vision and provides a software architecture, namely Semantic Document Architecture (SDArch) that supports semantic documents. Semantic documents enable unique identification, semantic annotation, and semantic linking of fine-grained units of documents’ data. Semantic links can be established between the semantically related document data units, whether they are stored on the same personal desktop or shared within social networks. Therefore, semantic documents integrate data of desktop documents into a unified desktop information space as well as fill the gap between the desktop information space and the information space of the social network communities. New processes such as the semantic document search and navigation, which are enabled by such integrated desktop information space, improve the effectiveness and efficiency of desktop users in carrying out their daily tasks. The thesis’s main contributions are the development of the Semantic Document Model (SDM) that describes semantic documents and the design of SDArch that provides solutions for the semantic document repository, services that support semantic documents related processes, and tools that enable desktop users to interact with semantic documents. Additionally, in order to validate the thesis I implemented the SDArch prototype, which is a fully-functional software providing the implementation of all the intended SDArch functionalities. The thesis is validated by two evaluation studies: i) the experimental evaluation of the information retrieval in integrated collections of semantic documents, and ii) the usability evaluation of the user effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in using the SDArch services and tools. The results of these two evaluation studies proved that semantic documents have potential to semantically integrate and improve interoperability of desktop data, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of desktop users while carrying out their daily tasks...|$|R
