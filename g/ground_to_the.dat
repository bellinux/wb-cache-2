5|$|After {{agreement}} {{from the}} Cardiff Athletic Club, the freehold {{of the south}} ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July 1968. Work could then begin on the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club would move to Sophia Gardens and the cricket <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who would {{move out of the}} south ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|Around daybreak, Pike's A Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, {{reached the}} village of Katika, {{which turned out to}} be a {{clearing}} with some dilapidated huts. His company came under fire from Katika Spur, the high <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, which was strongly held by the 9th Company, 80th Infantry Regiment and a company of the 238th Infantry Regiment. The Japanese attempted to outflank A Company on its left, but ran into Capitan L. Snell's D Company, 2/15th Infantry Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Both stadia had {{approximately}} east-west alignment: the rugby <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north (Castle Street) end; the National Stadium to {{the south}} (Wood Street) end. The original capacity was 65,000 but {{this had to be}} reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons. 11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500. This capacity would have been much less than Twickenham and the other major rugby venues and also less than the demand for tickets to major events.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} take Caen through {{successive}} flanking manoeuvres, Montgomery decided the next attack would be a frontal assault. Although Caen's strategic importance had vastly diminished since D-Day, he sought control of Bourguébus and the commanding high <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. On 5 July the orders for Operation Charnwood were issued; {{it was to be}} launched at 04:20, {{an hour and a half}} before dawn on 8 July.|$|E
5|$|However, under Barroso, the Commission {{began to}} lose <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> larger member states as {{countries}} such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role. This has increased {{with the creation of}} the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon. There has also been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission.|$|E

5|$|In 1186, {{a letter}} from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its {{surrounding}} lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158–1191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177–1201, by King Valdemar I. On Absalon's death, the property was {{to come into the}} ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde. Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August, {{a general}} advance began and the {{following}} morning No. 6 Commando took part in an attack to seize an area of high <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the Dives, north of Dozule. The attack took place {{under the cover of}} darkness and the lead elements were able to infiltrate deep into the German positions before they were detected. By daybreak the position had been captured and {{over the course of the}} day four determined counter-attacks were repelled. In one attack, a troop from No. 6 Commando rushed their attackers, killing the senior German officer and capturing 25 prisoners as the attack was broken up.|$|E
5|$|On 7June the 9th Parachute Battalion, {{relieved}} by the Special Service Brigade commandos, moved southwards to the Bois de Mont near Bréville, shortening the front {{held by the}} 3rd Parachute Brigade. The 6th Airborne Division's deployments now had the 6th Airlanding Brigade in the south, holding a line between Longueval and Herourvillette, the 5th Parachute Brigade to the rear just {{to the east of}} the River Orne bridge, the attached 1st Special Service Brigade to the north with troops in Sallenelles and Franceville-Plage, and finally the 3rd Parachute Brigade holding the ridge of high <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|E

5|$|Radyr Cricket Club {{was founded}} in 1890 by the Earl of Plymouth, who granted a hundred-year lease for the current {{riverside}} <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local residents for a nominal sum. The pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1973 while the team were away on tour. Under {{the leadership of the}} new Chairman Keith Terry, a huge fund-raising effort was made and a new pavilion opened on the footprint of the old one in 1975. Radyr currently plays in the first division of the South Wales Premier Cricket League.|$|E
5|$|The British advance resumed at 05:30, and {{at about}} 08:30 {{the vanguard of}} the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered the west end of Villers-Bocage. A {{squadron}} of the 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters), moved through the town and occupied Point 213, an area of high <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east on the Caen road. The regimental headquarters and a company of infantry occupied the eastern end of the town along the main road.|$|E
5|$|The black {{community}} of Africville, {{on the southern}} shores of Bedford Basin adjacent to the Halifax Peninsula, was spared the direct force of the blast by the shadow effect of the raised <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. However, Africville's small and frail homes were heavily damaged by the explosion. Families recorded the deaths of five residents. Africville received little of the donated relief funds {{and none of the}} progressive reconstruction invested {{in other parts of the}} city after the explosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the rugby ground begins with the first stands {{appearing}} for spectators in the ground in 1881–1882. Originally the Arms Park had a cricket <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and a rugby union stadium to the south. By 1969, the cricket ground had been demolished {{to make way for}} the present day rugby <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and a second rugby stadium to the south, called the National Stadium. The National Stadium, which was used by Wales national rugby union team, was officially opened on 7 April 1984, however in 1997 it was demolished {{to make way for the}} Millennium Stadium in 1999, which hosted the 1999 Rugby World Cup and became the national stadium of Wales. The rugby ground has remained the home of the semi-professional Cardiff RFC yet the professional Cardiff Blues regional rugby union team moved to the Cardiff City Stadium in 2009, but returned three years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{main attack}} across the Sangro by V Corps (Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey), {{comprising}} the British 78th Infantry Division (Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh) and 8th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Dudley Russell) with supporting and diversionary attacks further inland by the 2nd New Zealand Division (Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg) and XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey) was delayed by bad weather until late November. After {{several days of}} hard fighting, the Germans withdrew to the defences they had prepared on the high <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the Moro river.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} Operation Windsor, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division {{took part in}} Operation Charnwood. On 9 July, the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade {{captured}} Carpiquet airfield and by nightfall, the northern half of Caen had been captured. On 18 July British and Canadian forces launched Operation Atlantic and Operation Goodwood in which the Canadians captured the Caen districts on the south bank and the British captured <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east {{and south of the}} city. Canadian forces then attacked German positions on Verrières Ridge in Operation Spring.|$|E

The churchyard was used as a burial ground and as a public open space. As with other City churchyards, as the amount of available burial space in London failed {{to keep pace with the}} growing population it came to be used exclusively as a burial ground.|$|E
5|$|ASquadron 4RTR and the 1st Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) {{continued}} the advance toward Fort Capuzzo. Concealed in hull down positions behind a ridge near the fort were 20–30 German tanks, supported by anti tank guns. These engaged ASquadron, disabling five tanks, but {{were forced to}} withdraw as the squadron pressed its attack. On the final approach to Fort Capuzzo, contact was lost between 4RTR's tanks and 1DLI's leading CCompany, and {{the attack on the}} fort began without armoured support. The fort was vigorously defended, and it was not until just before midday that CCompany, reunited with ASquadron 4RTR and reinforced by A and BCompanies 1DLI, eventually took the position. DCompany 1DLI—which had been in reserve during the attack—then made a wide left hook to capture a small landing <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the fort.|$|E
5|$|At Nazareth, {{the initial}} {{attack by the}} Gloucester Hussars was {{strongly}} opposed during street fighting. The Congestion created by prisoners was increased by numerous German lorries parked along the narrow streets. As they were continuing their attack, the Gloucester Hussars were fired on by machine guns from the buildings on the high <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-west and from balconies and windows. At 08:00 the Gloucester Hussars were reinforced by two squadrons and three troops of the 18th Lancers followed by a squadron of the 9th Hodson's Horse. They were subsequently counter-attack by German office workers who, despite being almost annihilated by the 13th Cavalry Brigade's machine guns, held off the British cavalry attack.|$|E
