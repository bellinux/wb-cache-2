50|$|Primary neurulation {{occurs in}} {{response}} to soluble growth factors secreted by the notochord. Ectodermal cells are induced to form neuroectoderm {{from a variety of}} signals. Ectoderm sends and receives signals of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and cells which receive BMP4 signal develop into epidermis. The <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> chordin, noggin and follistatin are needed to form neural plate. These <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> are created and emitted by the Spemann's organiser. Cells which do not receive BMP4 signaling due to the effects of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> will develop into the anterior neuroectoderm cells of the neural plate. Cells which receive fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in addition to the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> form posterior neural plate cells.|$|R

During target cell recognition, these cells receive both activating and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals.</b> The cell must evaluate these opposing signals {{and determine the}} appropriate response: activation or inhibition. Classically, <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> are mediated by receptors that recognize MHC class I molecules (1).

25|$|Nitric oxide is also {{generated}} by phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) {{as part of}} the human immune response. Phagocytes are armed with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is activated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a single signal or by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) along with a second signal. On the other hand, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) provides a strong <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal</b> to iNOS, whereas interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 provide weak inhibitory signals. In this way, the immune system may regulate the armamentarium of phagocytes that play a role in inflammation and immune responses. Nitric oxide is secreted as free radicals in an immune response and is toxic to bacteria and intracellular parasites, including Leishmania and malaria; the mechanism for this includes DNA damage and degradation of iron sulfur centers into iron ions and iron-nitrosyl compounds.|$|E

50|$|Simultaneously, in the {{indirect}} pathway, the motor cortices send activating {{signals to the}} caudate and putamen. The cells of {{the indirect}} pathway in the caudate and putamen that receive these <b>signals</b> are <b>inhibitory</b> and, once activated, they send <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> to the globus pallidus externus, reducing the activity in that nucleus. The globus pallidus externus normally sends <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> to the subthalamic nucleus. On activation of the indirect pathway, these <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> are reduced, which allows more activation of the subthalamic nucleus. Subthalamic nucleus cells can then send more activating signals to {{some parts of the}} globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Thus, parts of these two nuclei are driven to send more <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, which prevents the development of significant activity in the motor cerebral cortices. This behavior prevents the activation of motor cortical areas that would compete with the voluntary movement.|$|R
40|$|AbstractImmunoreceptor signals must be {{appropriately}} transduced {{and regulated}} to achieve effective immunity while controlling inflammation and autoimmunity. It is generally held that these processes are {{mediated by the}} interplay of distinct activating and inhibitory receptors via conserved activating (ITAM) and <b>inhibitory</b> (ITIM) <b>signaling</b> motifs. However, recent evidence indicates that under certain conditions incomplete phosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines leads to <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling.</b> This new regulatory function of ITAMs has been termed ITAMi (inhibitory ITAM).

These <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> are mediated through GABA which is co-released from the DA cells along with dopamine. Dopamine has functions in the light adaptation process by up-regulating melanopsin transcription in ipRGCs and thus increasing the photoreceptor's sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|Ly-49 {{receptor}}s or killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily A (KLRA), are a {{class of}} natural killer cell receptor. Ly-49 proteins are a diverse set of C-type lectins that are expressed on NK cells in some mammals, including rodents but not humans. Their primary function is to bind host MHC class I as a mechanism of self/health recognition. Upon binding ligands, most Ly-49 receptors will deliver an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal,</b> preventing killing of the target cell. In the case of cancer or virally infected cells, MHC-I will often be downregulated in order to limit cytotoxic T cell mediated killing of the cell, whereby NK cells will lack Ly-49 <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal</b> {{and be able to}} kill infected or cancerous target cells.|$|E
5000|$|CTLA4 is {{a member}} of the {{immunoglobulin}} superfamily that is expressed by activated T cells and transmits an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal</b> to T cells. CTLA4 is homologous to the T-cell co-stimulatory protein, CD28, and both molecules bind to CD80 and CD86, also called B7-1 and B7-2 respectively, on antigen-presenting cells. CTLA-4 binds CD80 and CD86 with greater affinity and avidity than CD28 thus enabling it to outcompete CD28 for its ligands. CTLA4 transmits an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal</b> to T cells, whereas CD28 transmits a stimulatory signal. [...] CTLA4 is also found in regulatory T cells and contributes to its inhibitory function. T cell activation through the T cell receptor and CD28 leads to increased expression of CTLA-4.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{signaling}} molecules {{have been}} implicated in the modulation of immune receptor activation by inhibitory coreceptors: an inositol polyphosphate 5 ′-phosphatase, SHIP, and a tyrosine phosphatase, SHP- 1. To address the necessity, interaction, or redundancy of these signaling molecules, we have generated SHP- 1 - or SHIP-deficient B cell lines and determined their ability to mediate <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling.</b> Two distinct classes of inhibitory responses are defined, mediated by the selective recruitment of SHP- 1 or SHIP. The FcγRIIB class of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> is dependent on SHIP and not SHP- 1; conversely, the KIR class requires SHP- 1 and not SHIP. The consequence of this selective recruitment by inhibitory receptor engagement is seen in BCR-triggered apoptosis. SHP- 1 -mediated <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> blocks apoptosis, while SHIP recruitment attenuates a proapoptotic signal initiated by FcγRIIB...|$|R
30|$|The archetypal {{function}} of platelets is haemostasis. Platelets encounter <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> that prevent their activation in the healthy vasculature, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, which are released by endothelial cells (ECs). Platelets circulate {{in close proximity}} to the vessel wall, and the disruption of EC lining overcomes <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> and drives platelet adherence, activation and aggregation, which temporarily plug the damaged vessel. In this process, platelets also activate and confine coagulation at site of damage, particularly via the exposure of an efficient catalytic phospholipidic surface [54].|$|R

40|$|The role of {{platelets}} in hemostasis and thrombosis {{is dependent}} on a complex balance of activatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways. <b>Inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> released from the healthy vasculature suppress platelet activation {{in the absence of}} platelet receptor agonists. Activatory signals present at a site of injury initiate platelet activation and thrombus formation; subsequently, endogenous negative signaling regulators dampen activatory signals to control thrombus growth. Understanding the complex interplay between activatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> networks is an emerging challenge in the study of platelet biology and necessitates a systematic approach to utilize experimental data effectively. In this review, we will explore the key points of platelet regulation and signaling that maintain platelets in a resting state, mediate activation to elicit thrombus formation or provide negative feedback. Platelet signaling will be described in terms of key signaling molecules that are common to the pathways activated by platelet agonists and can be described as regulatory nodes for both positive and negative regulators.

50|$|The {{expression}} {{patterns of}} HLA-F in T cells suggest that HLA-F {{is involved in}} the communication pathway between T reg and activated T cells, where HLA-F signals that the immune response has been activated.

The result is a compensatory movement of the eyes. Typically eye movements lag the head movements by less than 10 ms.|$|E
2500|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein 4, or BMP4, is a transforming {{growth factor}} {{that causes the}} cells of the ectoderm to differentiate into skin cells.

50|$|Cancer cells produce antigens, {{which the}} immune system can use to {{identify}} them. These antigens are recognized by dendritic cells that present the antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the lymph nodes. The CTLs recognize the cancer cells by those antigens and destroy them.

Instead of using chemical stimuli to find mates, males are attracted to the ultraviolet absorbing color of female hindwings. Studies have shown that males respond to paper dummies of the appropriate color and even attempt to mate with them. On the contrary, the ultraviolet reflection found on males strongly inhibits approaches from other males. This suggests that ultraviolet reflectance is also used by males as an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signal</b> directed towards other males.|$|E

40|$|Vertebrate {{neurogenesis}} {{is controlled}} through lateral <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> {{triggered by the}} Notch receptor and its ligand Delta. In the E 4 chick embryo, the capacity of neural precursors to express the neurogenic genes Notch 1 and Delta 1 becomes reduced during S-phase, suggesting that their competence to trigger lateral <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signals</b> varies {{at different stages of}} the cell cycle. Here we show that the reduction of neurogenic gene expression during S-phase is extensive to later developmental stages and to other species; and it correlates with lower expression of lunatic Fringe and diminished capability to induce the expression of cHairy 1 /Hes 1 and Hes 5 - 1. We also show that the cell cycle-dependence of Notch 1 and Delta 1 expression is due to a remarkable decrease of mRNA stability during S-phase.

40|$|An innate immune {{response}} {{is essential for}} survival of the host upon infection, yet excessive inflammation can result in harmful complications [1]. <b>Inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> evolved to limit host responses and prevent inflammatory pathology [2, 3]. Given the significance of inhibitory pathways for immunity and homeostasis, they provide ideal targets for manipulation by bacterial pathogens. Recent evidence highlights that bacteria have developed diverse strategies to exploit these inhibitory pathways to avoid host defense for their own benefit. In this review, we cover these different immune evasion strategies for the first time. The recent literature discussed emphasizes that bacteria subvert host {{immune response}}s not only by direct engagement of inhibitory receptors (i. e., often through "molecular mimicry" of host ligands [4, 5]) but also through virulence factors that resemble intermediates of host <b>inhibitory</b> <b>signaling</b> and interfere with defense functions [6 - 8].
