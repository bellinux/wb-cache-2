5|$|The {{leaders of}} the strike, {{including}} McMenamin and Carney, were charged in federal court under the SmithConnally Act; some thirty strikers were also indicted later. The federal grand jury was convened on August 9 and heard testimony for two months. However, the grand jury returned inconclusive findings; their report stated {{that most of the}} striking workers <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> strike at the start, and blamed a few instigators for escalating the situation, but did not detail the instigators' activities. The report was also critical of the PTC's response to the strike, characterizing it as inadequate and ineffective. The government dropped its charges against the defendants on March 12, 1945, with most of them pleading nolo contendere and receiving a fine of $100 each.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} The 3rd Birthday was {{composed}} by Mitsuto Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Sekito, with additional work by Yoko Shimomura. Shimomura was involved {{from an early}} stage, when The 3rd Birthday was still a mobile game. When she was originally asked to compose for the title, she was involved {{with a number of}} other projects which made handling the entire score difficult. When asked whether she wanted to work with anyone on the composition, she suggested Suzuki and Sekito. The general instruction was to follow the pattern used by the music for Parasite Eve, with Suzuki and Sekito handling the majority of tracks, going so far as referring to the songs from the original Parasite Eve when handling remixes of old themes. In keeping with the game's other development goals, Shimomura wanted to alter some of the established music, although she asked the team to include familiar themes from earlier games for fans. When she started out, she <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game's story, but became familiar with it later in development and also found the project less challenging than she initially anticipated. Suzuki was responsible for a large amount of track mixing. Sekito was mostly involved with choosing and helping with instrumentation, in particular whether to include symphonic music. The composers had a relatively high degree of freedom, but they also had problems when composing some tracks that did not fit into selected scenes.|$|E

They were armed with three rifles and some spears. After a short dialog between Canek and Pacheco, the merchant was killed.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Viscount Walden {{recognized}} his contributions and welcomed the geologist Stoliczka {{to a high}} place among scientific ornithologists but disagreed with Stoliczka's idea of adding new species due to small differences in plumage. Hume however supported Stoliczka and wrote a note in the journal, Ibis, against the cabinet naturalists of London who <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> geography of India. Hume shortly afterwards started the journal Stray Feathers and persuaded ornithologists in India to publish there.|$|E

25|$|When Germany invaded Norway on April 9, 1940, many of Norway’s {{commanding}} {{officers of}} both the Army and the Navy were uncertain {{of what to do}} since they did not receive any orders. This led to many giving up without mounting a defence. Although the highest levels of government ordered an immediate mobilization, the ministers of the Norwegian government <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> details of mobilization, which were left totally to the Ministry of Defence. Since the Minister of Defence was new to his duties, he deferred this action to his Commander-in Chief, General Kristian Laake.|$|E
25|$|Zhao Wenhua had now {{reached the}} apex of his career. However, he had by this time become arrogant and earned the enmity of people from {{government}} officials to the court eunuchs. Even people such as Yan Song and the emperor had become annoyed by his disregard of etiquette. He once tried to bypass Yan Song in pleasing the emperor, presenting a medicinal wine to the emperor claiming {{that it was the}} secret of Yan's longevity. The emperor liked the wine, and later asked Yan Song about it, who was quite surprised and had to confess that he <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> wine. Yan almost severed relations with Zhao Wenhua for this transgression if not for the good words by Yan's wife. In another incident, Zhao Wenhua was so drunk that he failed to bow and kneel when receiving a gift from the emperor.|$|E

25|$|McLain's oldest daughter, Kristin, 26, {{was killed}} on March 20, 1992, in a car {{accident}} caused by a drunk driver. She had been living in Florida and was moving back home to Michigan when she was killed {{just a few miles from}} her parents' home. In part to escape his grief, McLain and several partners bought the Peet Packing Company (Farmer Peet's) located in the small town of Chesaning, Michigan in 1994. McLain was also a partner in the Michigan Radio Network. Both companies went bankrupt two years later. In 1996, he was convicted on charges of embezzlement, mail fraud, and conspiracy in connection with the theft of $2.5 million from the Peet employees' pension fund. McLain spent six years in prison; to this day, he insists he <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shady financial deals alleged by the government. McLain claims he paid restitution for this incident.|$|E
500|$|Rand {{chose the}} {{profession}} of architecture as the background for her novel, although she <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> field beforehand. As a field that combines art, technology, and business, it allowed her to illustrate her primary themes in multiple areas. Rand later wrote that architects provide [...] "both art and a basic need of men's survival". In a speech to a chapter of the American Institute of Architects, Rand drew a connection between architecture and individualism, saying time periods that had improvements in architecture were also those that had more freedom for the individual.|$|E
500|$|The complex {{consists}} {{of a network of}} tunnels dug under a chalk hill, linked to five inclined shafts in which 25 V-3 guns would have been installed, all targeted on London. The guns {{would have been able to}} fire ten dart-like explosive projectiles a minute– 600 rounds every hour– into the British capital, which Winston Churchill later commented would have constituted [...] "the most devastating attack of all". The Allies <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> V-3 but identified the site as a possible launching base for V-2 ballistic missiles, based on reconnaissance photographs and fragmentary intelligence from French sources.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{intended}} {{to move to}} Sudan after the war but a chance meeting with his old commanding officer, Hilary Scott, in St James's led to him being offered a position as a clerk {{at the law firm}} of Slaughter and May. Clark later said of the meeting: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> law, but I accepted. And luck worked." [...] He proved to be skilled at arranging mergers of companies and within six years of joining the firm was made a partner, at the age of 29 years. [...] At Slaughter and May, Clark worked exclusively for the firm's merchant bank clients and was involved in the bitter takeover of Millspaugh by Hadfield. [...] In 1957 Clark became a director of Marchwiel Holdings, better known as Alfred McAlpine the civil engineering firm, and would remain on their board until 1996.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} debate began the Prime Minister rose to speak, {{and said that}} he [...] "sought to correct the {{impression}} [...] gave" [...] that he <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prosecution. This was followed by a motion of censure pushed forward by Robert Horne, and after Horne had presented the motion Hastings rose to speak, and explained the facts of the case. His speech took over an hour, and was frequently interrupted by Conservative MPs. In his speech, Hastings took full responsibility for both the decision to prosecute and the subsequent decision to withdraw the prosecution, asking whether a censure was merited for correcting a mistake. His speech quieted the Conservatives and made it clear that a censure for the entire Parliament was going to be difficult for the Whips to enforce. The Liberal spokesman John Simon stood to speak, however, and called for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the case. This was rejected by MacDonald, and MPs continued to speak for several more hours.|$|E
500|$|Elinor Mavor {{took over}} as editor in early 1979. She had worked for Bernhard as an {{illustrator}} and in the production department of several of his magazines, though not for Amazing. She had also been an editor at Bill of Fare, a restaurant trade magazine. Mavor had read {{a good deal of}} science fiction but <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world of science fiction magazines when she took over. She was not confident that a woman would be accepted as the editor of a science fiction magazine, so she initially used the pseudonym [...] "Omar Gohagen" [...] for both Amazing and Fantastic, dropping it late in 1980. Circulation continued to fall, and Bernhard refused to consider Mavor's request to undertake a subscription drive, which might have helped. Instead, in late 1980, Bernhard decided to merge the two magazines. Fantastics last independent issue was October 1980; thereafter the combined magazine returned to a bimonthly schedule. At the same time the title was changed to Amazing Science Fiction Stories. Bernhard cut Mavor's salary after the merger, as she was editing only one magazine. Despite this, she stayed with Amazing, but was unable to prevent circulation from dropping again, down to only 11,000 newsstand sales in 1982.|$|E

500|$|Kekal has {{acknowledged}} in interviews that the band members, {{at the time}} interviewed, subscribed to Christianity, and {{has been described as}} one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology, and has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. Although Christianity has comprised a part of the band's lyrics, the band has said that from The Painful Experience (3rd album) onward its lyrics have not been associated with religion or ideology at all. Mark Allan Powell commented on this in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, stating that [...] "on the band's first two albums the songs testified to their Christian faith in an upfront way", but that on their third album, the band pulled back from an overt approach that [...] "Jeff says tended to turn people against the band before they gave the music a chance." [...] According to Powell, [...] "they maintain that three-fourths of their albums are purchased by non-Christians." [...] In an interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: [...] "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band. But then we knew we were also accepted within the Christian metal scene as well, that's cool to know, although I think it still less than 50% of our general fan base." ...|$|E
