25|$|Edward {{attended}} the local school, St. Thomas' and helped support {{the family with}} menial jobs. After leaving he was pressured by his mother into joining his brother at the National Telephone Company. After three years his health was affected by the stuffy office conditions and he applied, and was granted, a transfer to the engineering department. Mannock moved to Wellingborough, Northamptonshire in 1911 to take his position. Mannock joined the Territorial Army and served in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) {{at this time to}} keep in touch with his friends from Canterbury at the annual camps. Mannock was promoted to sergeant in 1913. In the spring, he attended a local cricket match and was introduced to Clara Novello Davies, mother of composer Ivor Novello. Mannock was keen to develop his musical talents and was personally tutored by her. Through his local cricket club assumed an interest in politics. He became a political activist, expressed socialist views, was an admirer of Keir Hardie and became the Secretary of the Wellingborough Independent Labour Party in 1912. Mannock remained a staunch supporter of the British Empire but sympathised with the Irish Home Rule movement. He sat as the <b>Honourable</b> <b>Member</b> for Waterford, the seat of John Redmond leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party.|$|E
500|$|Roche {{was also}} capable of humour which was both subtle and unquestionably intentional. Once, upon hearing his {{opponent}} John Philpot Curran expostulate {{that he could}} be [...] "the guardian of his own honour", Sir Boyle offered his [...] "congratulations to the <b>honourable</b> <b>member</b> on his possession of a sinecure." [...] On another occasion, when the Opposition tried to cough him down in a debate, Sir Boyle met the interruption by producing some bullets, with the observation [...] "I have here some excellent pills to cure a cough." [...] His personal courage being beyond dispute, this jest was quite sufficient in those duelling days to procure attention for the remainder of his speech.|$|E

5000|$|As you all know, our Grand Assembly is {{constituted}} by the re-elected <b>honourable</b> <b>members</b> charged with extraordinary powers and <b>honourable</b> <b>members</b> fleeing from the Government Capital which was attacked and occupied.

500|$|Privy Counsellors are accorded {{a formal}} rank of precedence, if not already having a higher one. At the {{beginning}} of each new Parliament, and at the discretion of the Speaker, those members of the House of Commons who are Privy Counsellors usually take the oath of allegiance before all other members except the Speaker and the Father of the House, who is the most senior member of the House. Should a Privy Counsellor rise to speak in the House of Commons {{at the same time as}} another <b>Honourable</b> <b>Member,</b> the Speaker usually gives priority to the [...] "Right Honourable" [...] Member. This parliamentary custom, however, was discouraged under New Labour after 1998, despite the Government not being supposed to exert influence over the Speaker.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to {{opposition}} {{criticism of}} his wife's fund-raising activities voiced in the House of Assembly, he bristled, [...] "Mr. Speaker, I have never had plans to cross this aisle, but in recent weeks that <b>Honourable</b> <b>Member</b> has said {{a few things that}} would encourage me to do so.

5000|$|The [...] "West Lothian Question" [...] {{itself was}} first posed in 1977 during a British House of Commons debate about Scottish and Welsh {{devolution}} proposals. In the 14th November sitting, Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for the Scottish constituency of West Lothian, asked,For {{how long will}} English constituencies and English <b>Honourable</b> <b>members</b> tolerate ... at least 119 <b>Honourable</b> <b>Members</b> from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland exercising an important, and probably often decisive, effect on English politics while they themselves have no say in the same matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? ...|$|R
2500|$|There were {{fears that}} if the gates were not taken by the proper authorities, [...] "others without {{authority}} might". Thus, months before any other collections were made, Baldwin's gates were removed except for those at the main entrance. Two of Beaverbrook's friends after the war claimed that this was Beaverbrook's decision despite Churchill saying, [...] "Lay off Baldwin's gates". At Question Time in the House of Commons the Conservative MP Captain Alan Graham said: [...] "Is the <b>honourable</b> <b>Member</b> aware {{that it is very}} necessary to leave Lord Baldwin his gates in order to protect him from the just indignation of the mob?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Speeches may be {{delivered}} in English or te reo Māori (with an interpreter provided). Speeches are {{addressed to the}} presiding officer, using the words [...] "Mister Speaker"', if a man, or 'Madam Speaker', if a woman. Only the Speaker may be directly addressed in debate; other members must be {{referred to in the}} third person. Traditionally, members do not refer to each other by name, but by electorate or ministerial post, using forms such as [...] "the <b>honourable</b> <b>member</b> for [...] " [...] or [...] "the Minister of [...] ". The Prime Minister is addressed as [...] "the Right Honourable". The Speaker may name a member who he believes has broken the rules of conduct of the House; following a vote this will usually result in the expulsion of said member from the chamber.|$|E
2500|$|During debates, MPs must {{direct their}} {{observations}} to the Chair of the House {{occupied by the}} Speaker or a committee chairman, and not directly to another Member; the phrase [...] "Madam Speaker" [...] or [...] "Mr. Speaker, Sir" [...] is often used for this purpose. Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are addressed by the offices held by them (for example, [...] "the Honourable Minister for Trade and Industry"), while other MPs are referred to by the constituencies they represent ("the <b>Honourable</b> <b>Member</b> for Holland–Bukit Timah GRC") or by their names. The use of the honorific [...] "the Honourable" [...] is not required by the Standing Orders of Parliament, but during a 1988 parliamentary debate the Leader of the House, Wong Kan Seng, {{said it would be}} polite for MPs to refer to their colleagues using the terms [...] "Mr.", [...] "Honourable Mr." [...] or [...] "Honourable Minister" [...] depending on their choice.|$|E

2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the <b>honourable</b> <b>member</b> for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The honourable member,' {{said the}} Speaker, {{with the most}} good-natured voice which he could assume, 'is not perhaps as yet aware {{that he should not}} call another member by his name.

50|$|In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, as {{in other}} lower houses of Parliament and other legislatures, members refer {{to each other as}} <b>honourable</b> <b>members</b> etc. out of courtesy, but they are not {{entitled}} to the style in writing. When members are ordained clergy they will instead be referred to as the <b>honourable</b> and reverend <b>member,</b> with a barrister called the <b>honourable</b> and learned <b>member</b> and serving or ex-serving members of the military (formerly less of a rarity than today) being styled the <b>honourable</b> and gallant <b>member.</b> Where a person is entitled to the prefix The Right Honourable, or The Much Honoured they will use this style instead of The Honourable.|$|R
