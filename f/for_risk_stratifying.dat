40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse the {{clinical}} characteristics {{of patients who}} died on the Stanford heart transplant waiting list {{and to develop a}} method <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratifying</b> status 2 patients (outpatients). METHODS: Data were reviewed from all patients over 18 years, excluding retransplants, who were accepted for heart transplantation over an eight year period from 1986 to 1994. RESULTS: 548 patients were accepted for heart transplantation; 53 died on the waiting list, and 52 survived on the waiting list for over one year. On multivariate analysis only peak oxygen consumption (peak VO 2 : 11. 7 (SD 2. 7) v 15. 1 (5. 2) ml/kg/min, P = 0. 02) and cardiac output (3. 97 (1. 03) v 4. 79 (1. 06) litres/min, P = 0. 04) were found to be independent prognostic risk factors. Peak VO 2 and cardiac index (CI) were then analysed in the last 141 consecutive patients accepted for cardiac transplantation. All deaths and 88 % of the deteriorations to status 1 on the waiting list occurred in patients with either a CI or = 2. 0 and a VO 2 > or = 12 all survived throughout follow up. Using a Cox's proportional hazards model with CI and peak VO 2 as covariates, tables were constructed predicting the chance of surviving for (a) 60 days and (b) 1 year on the waiting list.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} predictors of successful coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction (MI) and associated predictors of the major complications of in-hospital mortality and emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Background. Primary angioplasty is being increasingly used to treat acute MI, but factors affecting the success and major complications have not been well studied. Forty laboratories have been contributing clinical and procedural data to the Society of Cardiac Angiography and Interventions (SCA&I) on primary angioplasty for acute MI. Methods. Univariable and stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis of clinical and procedural variables was used to calculate predictors of success and major complications. Results. There were 4, 366 primary angioplasty procedures reported from 1990 through 1994, with an overall success rate of 91. 5 %, an in-hospital mortality rate of 2. 5 % and a rate of emergency surgery of 4. 3 %. Higher laboratory primary angioplasty volume and lower age were predictive of success. An intraaortic balloon pump in place, cardiogenic shock and a moribund condition had negative predictive effects. Unsuccessful angioplasty, cardiogenic shock or a moribund state were predictive of in-hospital death. Unsuccessful angioplasty, the absence of a history of hypertension and the absence of congestive heart failure were predictive of emergency surgery. Conclusions. The rates of success and major complications in the SCA&I Registry are similar to other series. Predictors of success and major complications can be assessed and may be useful <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratifying</b> candidates for primary angioplasty in acute MI.

40|$|One {{tenet of}} {{behavioral}} economics is the asymmetry in how decision makers evaluate risks involving gains versus risks involving losses. Correspondingly, {{an increasingly important}} question is what neuroanatomical and neurochemical correlates underpin valuation over gains and losses. By employing an imaging genetics strategy, this paper aims at identifying the specific neurotransmitter pathways underlying these decision making processes. We find enhanced striatal activation responding to increases in the magnitude of utility <b>for</b> <b>risks</b> over gains and to increases in the magnitude of disutility <b>for</b> <b>risks</b> over losses, while increased amygdala activation correlates only with the disutility <b>for</b> <b>risks</b> over losses. <b>Stratifying</b> brain activation by genotype, we find that a well-characterized polymorphism in the dopamine transporter (DAT 1) contributes to individual differences in striatal response <b>for</b> gain-oriented <b>risks,</b> whereas a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter (STin 2) partially accounts for individual differences in amygdala responses <b>for</b> loss-oriented <b>risks.</b> Together, our results suggest {{the role of the}} amygdala and corresponding serotonergic pathway in evaluating losses.

Among patients with documented {{coronary artery disease}} who undergo vascular surgery, {{it is unclear whether}} preoperative revascularization reduces postoperative cardiac complications in high-risk subsets defined by the RCRI. Methods and Results—The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis Trial was a randomized, controlled trial that tested the long-term benefit of a preoperative coronary artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery. Using preoperative baseline characteristics to determine the RCRI, we tested the benefit of preoperative revascularization on death and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with multiple risks. Among 462 patients undergoing vascular surgery, there were 72 complications (15. 6 %) within 30 days postsurgery, including 15 deaths (3. 2 %) and 57 nonfatal myocardial infarctions (12. 3 %). The postoperative risk of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction after surgery increased according to the RCRI (odds ratio, 1. 73; 95 % CI, 1. 26 to 2. 38; P 0. 001), with a rate of 1. 6 % in patients with no risk that increased to 23. 4 % in patients with 3 risks. Preoperative revascularization had no influence on the incidence of complications in any risk subset (odds ratio, 0. 86; 95 % CI, 0. 50 to 1. 49; P 0. 60). Among those individuals with 2 risks who also demonstrated ischemia on a preoperative stress-imaging test (N 146), the incidence of events was 23 % in patients with and without preoperative revascularization (P 0. 95).

40|$|Personalised {{medicine}} is replacing the one-drug-fits-all approach with many prognostic models incorporating biomarkers available <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratifying</b> patients. Evidence has been emerging {{that the effects}} of biomarkers change over time and therefore violate the assumption of proportional hazards when performing Cox regression. Analysis using the Cox model when the assumptions are invalid can result in misleading conclusions. This thesis reviews existing approaches for the analysis of non-proportional effects with respect to survival data. A number of well-developed approaches were identified but to date their uptake in practice has been limited. There is a need for more widespread use of flexible modelling to move away from standard analysis using a Cox model when the assumption of proportional hazards is violated. Two novel approaches were applied to investigate the impact of follow-up duration on two residual risk models, IHC 4 and Mammostrat, for predicting risk in early breast cancers using two studies with different lengths of follow up; the Edinburgh Breast Conservation Series (BCS) and the Tamoxifen versus Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial. Similar results were observed between the two approaches that were considered, the multivariable fractional polynomial time (MFPT) approach and Royston-Parmer flexible parametric models, with their respective advantages and disadvantages being discussed. The analyses identified a strong time-varying effect of IHC 4 score with the prognostic effect of IHC 4 score on time-to distant recurrence decreasing with increasing follow-up time. Mammostrat score identified a group of patients with an increased risk of distant recurrence over full follow-up in the TEAM and Edinburgh BCS cohorts. The results suggest a combined IHC 4 and Mammostrat risk score could provide information on the risk of recurrence and warrants further study...|$|E

Objectives: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data to identify these baseline risk factors. Patients/Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, DARE and the Grey literature databases were searched in all languages from 1995 to 2008. Prospective studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible. Studies were included if original patient-level data were provided by the investigators and if CRT was objectively confirmed with valid imaging. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of 17 prespecified baseline characteristics was conducted. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Results: A total sample of 5636 subjects from five RCTs and seven prospective studies was included in the analysis. Among these subjects, 425 CRT events were observed. In multivariate logistic regression, the use of implanted ports as compared with peripherally implanted central venous catheters (PICCs), decreased CRT risk (OR, 0. 43; 95 % CI, 0. 23 – 0. 80), whereas past history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR, 2. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 05 – 3. 92), subclavian venipuncture insertion technique (OR, 2. 16; 95 % CI, 1. 07 – 4. 34) and improper catheter tip location (OR, 1. 92; 95 % CI, 1. 22 – 3. 02), increased CRT risk. Conclusions: CRT risk is increased with use of PICCs, previous history of DVT, subclavian venipuncture insertion technique and improper positioning of the catheter tip. These factors may be useful <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratifying</b> patients to select those for thromboprophylaxis. Prospective studies are needed to validate these finding...|$|E

METHODS: Analyses were based on data collected by the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), which enrolled 5, 632 participants aged 65 - 84 years between 1992 and 2000. During a median follow-up of 7. 8 years, there were 194 cases of incident dementia in the participants with complete data. Cox proportional hazard models <b>for</b> competing <b>risks,</b> <b>stratified</b> by sex, were defined to determine risk factors in relation to developing dementia. RESULTS: The incidence rate of dementia increased from 5. 57 / 1, 000 person-years at 65 - 69 years of age to 30. 06 / 1, 000 person-years at 80 - 84 years. Cox proportional hazard models <b>for</b> competing <b>risks</b> of incidence of dementia and death revealed that, among men, significant risk factors were heart failure, Parkinson's disease, family history of dementia, mild depressive symptomatology and age, while triglycerides were associated with a lower risk of developing dementia. Significant risk factors in women were age, both mild and severe depressive symptomatology, glycemia ≥ 109 mg/dL, and a BMI < 24. 1 kg/m². Even as little as three years of schooling was found to be a significant protective factor against the incidence of dementia only for women.

40|$|Purpose Prediction of {{mortality}} risk {{is important in}} the management of chronic heart failure (CHF). The aim {{of this study was to}} create a prediction model for 5 -year cardiac death including assessment of cardiac sympathetic innervation using data from a multicenter cohort study in Japan. Methods The original pooled database consisted of cohort studies from six sites in Japan. A total of 933 CHF patients who underwent 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging and whose 5 -year outcomes were known were selected from this database. The late MIBG heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR) was used for quantification of cardiac uptake. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression analyses were used to select appropriate variables for predicting 5 -year cardiac mortality. The formula for predicting 5 -year mortality was created using a logistic regression model. Results During the 5 -year follow-up, 205 patients (22 %) died of a cardiac event including heart failure death, sudden cardiac death and fatal acute myocardial infarction (64 %, 30 % and 6 %, respectively). Multivariate logistic analysis selected four parameters, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, age, gender and left ventricular ejection fraction, without HMR (model 1) and five parameters with the addition of HMR (model 2). The net reclassification improvement analysis for all subjects was 13. 8 % (p < 0. 0001) by including HMR and its inclusion was most effective in the downward reclassification of low-risk patients. Nomograms for predicting 5 -year cardiac mortality were created from the five-parameter regression model. Conclusion Cardiac MIBG imaging had a significant additive value for predicting cardiac mortality.

40|$|Many metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties (MoMHAs) were {{implanted}} worldwide {{in the form}} of hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) and total hip arthroplasty. These devices experienced unexpectedly high short-term failure rates, with many revisions performed for adverse reactions to metal debris (ARMD) and pseudotumour (a specific type of ARMD). To identify problems early, worldwide regulatory authorities recommend most MoMHA patients require regular follow-up. However these recommendations are not evidence-based and are very costly. The broad aims of this thesis were to determine the clinical impact of pseudotumour, and to develop evidence-based guidance for the investigation and management of MoMHA patients. A prospective single centre cohort of 1, 429 HRAs identified pseudotumour as the commonest indication for revision surgery. The overall 15 year pseudotumour revision rate was high at 14. 0 %. Young females had the highest risk of pseudotumour revision, whilst males with Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) implants had the lowest risk. Two large prospective cohort studies investigated the role of blood metal ions during follow-up. Patients with BHR implants (n= 494) who had blood metal ions below newly devised thresholds were at low risk of ARMD (cobalt: 2. 15 μg/l for unilateral BHRs; maximum cobalt or chromium: 5. 52 μg/l for bilateral BHRs). Current fixed regulatory authority thresholds missed more patients with ARMD compared with the new thresholds. These findings were subsequently validated in 416 BHR patients at two external European centres. Three observational studies investigated the role of hip imaging during follow-up. Radiographic factors predictive of HRAs with a pseudotumour included acetabular component malposition, osteolysis, and acetabular loosening. A retrospective diagnostic accuracy study demonstrated that ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) both had a role prior to HRA revision surgery. However combined ultrasound and MRI was most effective for both identifying and excluding intra-operative pseudotumours. Thus combined imaging may be useful in complex cases. In a prospective longitudinal cohort of 140 asymptomatic HRAs, 11 % developed new pseudotumours within five years of initial assessment. No patients with a normal initial ultrasound and low blood metal ions (< 2 μg/l) developed new pseudotumours (36 % of hips). These patients do not need regular follow-up. Two large retrospective observational studies were performed involving MoMHA revision procedures recorded in the National Joint Registry for England and Wales. Contrary to previous observations, patients revised for ARMD had half the risk of re-revision and death compared with matched patients undergoing non-ARMD revision surgery (such as for fracture, loosening, and infection). Modifiable predictors of re-revision surgery following ARMD revision were modular component only revisions, and using ceramic-on-ceramic revision bearings. The clinical impact of pseudotumour following HRA is significant and has continued to increase into the second decade. This thesis has developed an evidence-based approach for the investigation and management of MoMHA patients. No single investigation can universally be used during patient surveillance. However important information has now been provided <b>for</b> <b>risk</b> <b>stratifying</b> patients for surveillance, interpreting blood metal ions, clarifying the roles of imaging, and providing parameters to safely exclude many asymptomatic patients from regular surveillance. The outcomes following ARMD revision surgery have improved since the threshold for performing revision was lowered. However outcomes were influenced by modifiable factors (type of revision procedure and bearing), suggesting that surgeons could reduce failure rates further following ARMD revision procedures. </p...|$|E

Study design and participants: Observational cohort study of children presenting with suspected infection {{to an emergency}} department in England. Detailed data were collected prospectively on presenting clinical features, laboratory investigations and outcome. Clinical predictors of serious bacterial infection (SBI) were explored in multivariate logistic regression models using part of the dataset, each model was then validated in an independent part of the dataset, and the best model was chosen for derivation of a clinical <b>risk</b> score <b>for</b> SBI. The ability of this score to <b>risk</b> <b>stratify</b> children with SBI was then assessed in the entire dataset. Main outcome measure: Final diagnosis of SBI according to criteria defined by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health working group on Recognising Acute Illness in Children. Results: Data from 1951 children were analysed. 74 (3. 8 %) had SBI. The sensitivity of individual clinical signs was poor, although some were highly specific for SBI.

New approaches are needed, therefore, to implement these guidelines in everyday practice. Methods and results: We compared an automated method for applying The National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) guidelines with results from routine care for managing LDL-cholesterol. The automated method comprised computerized history-taking and analysis of historical data without physician input. Results from routine care were determined for 213 unselected patients and compared with results from interviews of the same 213 patients by a computerized history-taking program. Data extracted from hospital charts showed that routine care typically did not collect sufficient information to <b>stratify</b> <b>risk</b> and assign treatment targets for LDL-cholesterol and that there were inconsistencies in identifying patients with normal or elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol in relation to risk.

40|$|BACKGROUND Systemic {{glucocorticoids}} {{reduce the}} incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia among extremely preterm infants, but they may compromise brain development. The effects of inhaled glucocorticoids on outcomes in these infants are unclear. METHODS We randomly assigned 863 infants (gestational age, 23 weeks 0 days to 27 weeks 6 days) to early (within 24 hours after birth) inhaled budesonide or placebo until they no longer required oxygen and positive-pressure support or until they reached a postmenstrual age of 32 weeks 0 days. The primary outcome was death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, confirmed by means of standardized oxygen-saturation monitoring, at a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks. RESULTS A total of 175 of 437 infants assigned to budesonide for whom adequate data were available (40. 0 %), as compared with 194 of 419 infants assigned to placebo for whom adequate data were available (46. 3 %), died or had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (relative <b>risk,</b> <b>stratified</b> according to gestational age, 0. 86; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 75 to 1. 00; P = 0. 05).
