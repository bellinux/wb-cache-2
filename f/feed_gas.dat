500|$|NGC 4314 is a face-on barred {{spiral galaxy}} at a {{distance}} of 40 million light-years. [...] It is unique for its region of intense star formation, creating a ring around its nucleus which was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope. The galaxy's prodigious star formation began five million years ago, in a region with a diameter of 1,000 light-years. The core's structure is also unique because the galaxy has spiral arms which <b>feed</b> <b>gas</b> into the bar.|$|E
500|$|Boron nitride aerogel is an aerogel made {{of highly}} porous BN. It {{typically}} {{consists of a}} mixture of deformed BN nanotubes and nanosheets. It can have a density as low as 0.6 mg/cm3 and a specific surface area as high as 1050 m2/g, and therefore has potential applications as an absorbent, catalyst support and gas storage medium. BN aerogels are highly hydrophobic and can absorb up to 160 times their weight in oil. They are resistant to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1200 Â°C, and hence can be reused after the absorbed oil is burned out by flame. BN aerogels can be prepared by template-assisted chemical vapor deposition using borazine as the <b>feed</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} established and solved to describe the dehydration reaction from alcohol to ethylene. The influences of the gas velocity and {{the temperature of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>gas</b> to the process of the reaction were discussed. The results showed that, the influence of the radial diffusion on the reaction characteristics could be ignored while the influence of radial heat conduction to the temperature distribution was significant. The temperature distribution decreased alone the axial direction at first and then increased, that is a lowest point of the temperature could be found. When the velocity of the gas slowed down or the temperature of the <b>feeding</b> <b>gas</b> increased, the conversion of the reactant and the selectivity of the target product could be improved, the distance of the lowest temperature point to the entrance got closer and the outlet temperature became higher...|$|R
50|$|Rectisol is {{the trade}} name for an acid gas removal process that uses {{methanol}} as a solvent to separate acid gases such as hydrogen sulfide {{and carbon dioxide}} from valuable <b>feed</b> <b>gas</b> streams. By doing so, the <b>feed</b> <b>gas</b> is made more suitable for combustion and/or further processing. Rectisol is used most often to treat synthesis gas (primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide) produced by gasification of coal or heavy hydrocarbons, as the methanol solvent is well able to remove trace contaminants such as ammonia, mercury, and hydrogen cyanide usually found in these gases. As an acid gas and large component of valuable <b>feed</b> <b>gas</b> streams, CO2 is separated during the methanol solvent regeneration.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} numerical {{modeling of}} several cold spray processes {{in order to}} predict the gas flow {{as well as the}} particle conditions upon impacting on a substrate. Particle normal velocity was found {{to be the most important}} factor to improve the deposition efficiency and coating quality. Particle velocity was calculated with both Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches. The Lagrangian approach was used to investigate the effect of particle size and substrate geometry in a dilute particle flow. The shape and strength of the bow shock formed near the substrate for different geometries (such as concave, convex, and flat) were studied. Consequently, the particle normal velocities impacting on the substrates located at various stand-off distances were calculated. Furthermore, the numerical simulations were repeated with particles of various sizes as well as different types of <b>feeding</b> <b>gas.</b> The results were compared to obtain the optimum substrate location and the appropriate particle size for each <b>feeding</b> <b>gas.</b> The numerical results were validated against the experimental results for the majority of the process parameters including the gas Mach number and mean particle velocity. The Eulerian approach was also implemented to model dense particulate flows. It was found that a dense particulate flow could significantly decelerate the gas flow and consequently result in small particle velocity...|$|R
