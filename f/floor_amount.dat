The amendments effectively subject most debtors who have an income, as calculated by the Code, above the debtor's state census median income to a 60-month disposable income based test.

The means test provides for a finding of abuse if the debtor's disposable monthly income is higher than a specified <b>floor</b> <b>amount</b> or portion of their debts.

Under this test, any debtor with more than $182.50 in monthly disposable income, under the formula, would face a presumption of abuse.|$|E
50|$|More specifically, gap {{financing}} is subordinated temporary financing paid {{off when the}} first mortgagee disburses the full amount due under the first mortgage loan. This is normal in a situation involving a permanent “floor-ceiling loan,” where the borrower does not meet a rent-roll requirement, and the first mortgagee funds only a <b>floor</b> <b>amount,</b> agreeing to fund the balance in the event the rent-roll requirement is met within a stated period. In this case, the gap lender is often the construction lender. Where the gap lender has agreed prior to construction to make the gap loan, the document that ties together the construction loan, the gap loan, and the permanent loan is the buy-sell agreement. In this agreement, a special provision is inserted providing that if the permanent lender's rent-roll holdback is not fulfilled at {{the time for the}} permanent closing, the construction lender agrees to disburse, at a concurrent closing date, funds equal to the amount withheld by the permanent lender pursuant to its commitment. These gap funds are normally evidenced by a promissory note secured by a junior mortgage subject and subordinate in all respects to the permanent loan documentation. The gap documents usually state unequivocally that, in the event the rent-roll requirement is not met during the rent-roll period, the permanent lender still retains the right on demand to purchase the gap note and discharge of record any second mortgage held by the construction lender. The borrower normally assigns to the construction lender all funds that would otherwise be payable to the borrower in the event the rent-roll requirement is met, with the construction lender agreeing to reassign to the borrower all funds that would be payable pursuant to the rent-roll requirement at such time as the gap loan note is paid in full. In addition, the permanent lender usually requires that the temporary lender and borrower agree that no funds will be disbursed under the gap documents, except at the closing of the permanent loan.|$|E

40|$|Woody biomass {{in terms}} of short {{rotation}} coppice (SRC) could be a promising alternative for producing biomass to generate renewable energy. Even through, from a single farms point of view, SRC {{seems to be an}} interesting land use alternative, farmers do not cultivate SRC. Some studies found out that the real options approach (ROA) could at least partially explain farmers' inertia of cultivating SRC. Nevertheless, those studies do not take into account market competition between farmers and farmers' fear of not having an outlet market in order to dispose the harvested wood chips. This inertia can also cause an investment reluctance concerning building biomass heating stations. In the present study therefore, we focuses on the whole value chain from producing wood chips over generating energy and selling the energy to the end-consumers. We develop an agent-based model which is able to consider market competition and can picture the whole value chain. In order to further motivate farmers to cultivate SRC different types of incentives offered by the biomass heating station are investigated. Our results show that if no incentive system is offered, farmers cultivate SRC reluctantly which leads to a loss of profit of the biomass heating station. With regard to an investment subsidy, it needs to be equal to approximately 300 % of the capital costs of investment to strongly motivate farmers to produce enough wood chips that largely decrease the loss of profit of the biomass heating station. If a price floor is offered, farmers' additional amount of wood chips produced is very small. Therefore, the loss of profit does not significantly decrease if the price <b>floor</b> <b>amounts</b> to 95 %...|$|R

On December 20, 1965, Leary left New York by automobile, intending to take a vacation trip to the Mexican state of Yucatán. He was accompanied by his daughter and son, both teenagers, and two others. On December 22, 1965, the party drove across the International Bridge between the United States and Mexico at Laredo, Texas. They stopped at the Mexican customs station and, after apparently being denied entry, drove back across the bridge.

Accurate modelling of the blast wave evolution is therefore essential for ISM and galaxy formation simulations.

Assuming solar metallicity cooling, the blast wave evolution is followed {{to the beginning of}} the momentum conserving snowplough phase. The model recovers previous results for uniform ambient media. The momentum injection in wind-blown bubbles depend on the swept-up mass and the efficiency of cooling, when the blast wave hits the wind shell. For power-law density distributions with n(r) ∼ r^- 2 (for n(r) > n__ <b>floor)</b> the <b>amount</b> of momentum injection is solely regulated by the background density n__ floor and compares to n__ uni = n__ floor.

All analyses were performed by ETABS and SAP 2000. It was found that the design seismic forces according to the regulations from the time of the design of the facility were approximately three times smaller than the design seismic forces calculated according to Eurocodes.
