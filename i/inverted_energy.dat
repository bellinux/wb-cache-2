25|$|Pyramid {{structure}} {{can vary}} across ecosystems and across time. In some instances biomass pyramids can be inverted. This pattern is often identified in aquatic and coral reef ecosystems. The pattern of biomass inversion {{is attributed to}} different sizes of producers. Aquatic communities are often dominated by producers that are smaller than the consumers that have high growth rates. Aquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of secondary growth as exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, {{they are able to}} reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years. Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass <b>inverted.</b> <b>Energy</b> pyramids, however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included and this is dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

The nonlinear dynamics of the wave mode is modeled with a complex wave amplitude, and {{is characterized by the}} formation of coherent structures in phase space, caused by wave-particle interaction. The transition to a quasilinear regime is modeled with a phenomenological decorrelation of the wave-particle phase. As the decorrelation is increased the coherent phase-space structures diminishes, and frequency chirping events in the marginal stability region is limited. The strength of the decorrelation modifies the saturation level and saturation time of the eigenmode amplitude. QC 20150319 </p...|$|E

Electrification programs, intended to connect new consumers countrywide, have not significantly contributed either to the intensification of electricity consumption or to {{the reduction of the}} use of biomass in households.

For a bond, a four-particle system, charge inversion is the key to explain this shape generically. A parity adapted Hamiltonian reduces from ten to two terms. The analytical perturbed Coulomb function scales attractive and repulsive branches of 13 PECs (HH, HF, LiH, KH, AuH, LiLi, LiF, KLi, NaCs, RbRb,RbCs, CsCs and II) in a single straight line. Turning points are reproduced with a deviation of 0. 3 % (0. 007 angstrom). At the repulsive side, the deviation is 0. 2 % (0. 003 angstrom).

It is shown that only the antilocalization magnetoconductivity is observed at relatively high conductivity, σ(20 - 30) G 0, where G 0 =e 2 / 2 π 2. The antilocalization correction demonstrates a crossover from 0. 5 ln(τ φ/τ) to 1. 0 ln(τ φ/τ) behavior with increasing conductivity (here τ φ and τ are the phase relaxation and transport relaxation times, respectively). It is interpreted {{as a result of}} crossover to the regime when the two chiral branches of the electron energy spectrum independently contribute to the weak antilocalization. At lower conductivity, σ<(20 - 30) G 0, the magnetoconductivity behaves similarly to that in usual 2 D systems with fast spin relaxation: It is negative in low magnetic fields and positive in higher ones. We have found that the temperature dependences of the fitting parameter τ φ corresponding to the phase relaxation time demonstrate reasonable behavior, close to 1 /T, over the whole conductivity range from 5 G 0 up to 130 G 0. However, the τ φ value remains practically independent of conductivity, in contrast to conventional 2 D systems with simple energy spectra, in which τ φ is enhanced with conductivity. © 2012 American Physical Society...|$|E

These kind of materials are narrow gap semiconductors characterized by an <b>inverted</b> <b>energy</b> gap caused by spin-orbit coupling (SOC). TIs possess spin-momentum-locked surface states with linear dispersion forming a Dirac cone with a crossing point at/near the Fermi level.

One of the challenges faced by current investigations of these new type of materials is the significant amount of bulk carriers in transport measurements of the latter binary compounds. One way to to decrease bulk carriers could be to design alloys based on the binary compounds where the Dirac point will be moved far from the bulk bands.

In our approach, the aftershock sequence is regarded as a continuous energy release process, rather than a discrete time series of events. To correct for the contribution of coda wave energy excited by multiple scattering, we use the theoretical envelope synthesized on the basis of the radiative transfer theory as a Green 2 ̆ 7 s function. The site amplification factors are corrected considering the conservation of energy flux and using the coda normalization method.

An ever-growing {{population}} of {{people are looking for}} ways to increase calorie burn without increasing activity levels. People in the shoe industry have capitalized on this concept and created curved bottom shoes. Curved bottom shoes are believed to provide the body with an unstable walking surface, initiating greater muscle activity patterns to stabilize the body, ultimately resulting in an increase in the metabolic cost of walking in curved shoes. The metabolic cost of walking is also determined in part by the exchange of mechanical energy and the cost of swinging the legs. However, it is unclear how walking in curved shoes may affect the pendulum like exchange of mechanical energy in the body and the cost of leg swing. This study investigated the effects of curved bottom shoes on the energetics and mechanics of walking. Sixteen subjects came to the Humboldt State Biomechanics Lab for two testing sessions. They walked on a treadmill and overground at three different speeds (0. 75, 1. 25, 1. 75 m/s) and in three different shoes (flat shoes (FS), curved shoes (CS), and flat shoes weighted to match the weight of curved shoes (WFS)). The metabolic cost of walking was greater in curved bottom shoes compared to the flat shoes (p=. 0001) but similar to weighted flat shoes (p=. 386). However, <b>inverted</b> pendulum <b>energy</b> exchange was greater in curved shoes when compared to both flat shoes (p<. 0001) and weighted flat shoes (p=. 001). In conclusion, walking in curved shoes allows for a greater exchange of mechanical <b>energy</b> via <b>inverted</b> pendulum mechanics but increases the metabolic cost as compared to walking in flat shoes likely as a result of an increased cost of leg swing...|$|R

The model system describes the reduction of cyclopropenyl cation to cyclopropene by the oxidation of lithium hydride to lithium cation. The molecular fragments corresponding to the asymptotic reactive channels characterizing the stepwise mechanisms currently discussed in the literature have been characterized. The binding energy between the fragments is estimated within a simple electrostatic approximate scheme. The results show that a hydride‐ion mechanism is a likely pathway for this particular system. The system is thereafter thoroughly studied from the supermolecule approach. Reaction paths for the ground and first triplet electronic states have been calculated. The hypersurface is explored from a geometrical disposition of the reactants that mimics the one found in several dehydrogenases (perpendicular configuration). A hydride ion {{is found to be}} the particle transferred on the unconstrained as well as the constrained reaction pathways in the ground electronic state. In the triplet state (perpendicular configuration) the mechanism is stepwise: electron transfer followed by a hydrogen atom transfer. It has been noticed that the perpendicular geometrical disposition of the reactants plays an important role by polarizing the susceptible cyclopropene C–H bond in the sense of increasing the electronic density at the hydrogen nucleus.

In order to determine the relationship between energy recovery and speed during treadmill walking, we investigated estimated COM displacement in nine healthy individuals each walking on a treadmill at seven different speeds. In addition, we measured oxygen cost to determine the effort of walking. Our participants formed two distinct groups, those with normal COM energy recovery (N%R) that was similar to ground walking, and those with low COM energy recovery (L%R) that was different from typical ground walking. The low energy recovery in the L%R group was attributed to in-phase potential and kinetic energy fluctuations. Despite the low energy recovery values both groups produced the expected 'U'-shaped oxygen cost speed curve with no significant difference between groups (...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a formal general approach for evaluating the WKB wave function in a forbidden region of a non-separable potential in a three-dimensional space. The wave function is described by two sets of orthogonal wave-fronts, the equi-phase and equi-amplitude surfaces, or equivalently by two sets of paths defined to be normal to these surfaces respectively. We have extended a Huygens type construction to the forbidden region to obtain the multi-dimensional wave function. The construction determines the wave-fronts and the paths. It is found that the equations for the paths obtained from the construction are coupled {{to each other and}} do not reduce to a set of ordinary differential equations. However, if the incident wave is normal to the turning surface, the equations satisfied by the paths can be de-coupled. These equations are found to be equivalent to Newton's equations of motion for the <b>inverted</b> potential and <b>energy.</b> This characteristics has been used to calculate the current density distribution for an STM. In this paper, we use the same approach to derive the expressions for the lateral resolutions and corrugations for a model STM...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time we produce {{high-resolution}} maps of the characteristic energy of precipitating electrons from ground-based instrumentation in the auroral zone over northern Scandinavia. This is done by combining intensity-calibrated optical data at 557. 7 nm from the Digital All-Sky Imager (DASI) with auroral absorption images from the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS). Energy maps are produced with high temporal (10 s) and spatial (10 km) resolution within a common geographic area of 240 × 240 km. Both IRIS and DASI have the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar within their common field of view. EISCAT is capable of making accurate measurements of the electron density height profile which, with the assistance of an atmospheric model, are <b>inverted</b> into equivalent <b>energy</b> spectra of the flux of precipitating electrons. However, incoherent scatter radars generally have a very small field of view (< 1 °), making studies of the energy spectrum of the precipitating particles over a wide field of view impractical. Since IRIS and DASI are sensitive to high- and medium-energy electrons, respectively, EISCAT data are used to calibrate the characteristic energy of the precipitating particles for an assumed energy spectrum against a combination of IRIS and DASI data. This empirical calibration is then used throughout the common field of view of IRIS and DASI. An initial study illustrates the spatial relationship between the different energy ranges during a substorm onset and illustrates a new way to interpret auroral phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper by}} Del Pezzo et al. (2006), {{hereafter}} named DPBZ, {{deals with the}} estimate of the seismic attenuation in the high frequency range for the volcanic area of Mt. Vesuvius. In particular DPBZ use a method based on the fit of the observed local earthquake coda envelopes to the radiative transfer classical equation (see Sato and Fehler, 1998 for a wide and exhaustive review on this argument) {{in terms of the}} intrinsic attenuation and the scattering attenuation coefficients. Ugalde and Carcolé in their comment (hereafter named UC) discuss two points of DPBZ that we summarize here in their essence: (a) Two approximations of the exact solution of the 3 -D radiative transfer model have been calculated, that discussed by Zeng (1991) – hereafter Z 91 – expressed by Formula (5) of UC, and that by Paasschens (1997) – hereafter P 97 – expressed by Formula (6) of UC. UC show that P 97 is more accurate than Z 91, which is instead used in DPBZ. (b) DPBZ obtain the separated estimates of intrinsic- and scattering-attenuation coefficients, respectively !i and !s, first stacking the normalized energy envelopes (starting at 2 Ts lapse time) and then fitting the experimental data with the normalized (in the same way) theoretical curve. UC disagree with this procedure. Their opinion is that DPBZ should have <b>inverted</b> the single <b>energy</b> envelopes and then have averaged the results obtained. In the following we reply to points (a) and (b) in two separate sections...|$|R
