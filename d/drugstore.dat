40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development and}} evaluation of an mHealth intervention for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) referral from <b>drugstores</b> to health facilities in Mwanza Tanzania. SRH {{is an important factor}} for human development. Over the last 2 decades, provision and accessibility to SRH services has benefited from international and national health promotion interventions. In developing countries, use of close to community providers (CTC providers), such as village health workers, has been a key component of health promotion. This has been especially true in Tanzania where up to 70 % of formal primary health care facilities lack health staff. CTC providers have been promoted through international initiatives such as the World Health Organization’s (WHO) task-shifting initiative. WHO’s recognition of CTC providers ranges from cadres at the grassroots level such as village health workers and <b>drugstores</b> to formal auxiliary providers based in health facilities, such as medical aides and nurses. In Tanzania, <b>drugstores</b> provide a range of SRH services ranging from simple advice on how to use a condom to complex prescriptions of antibiotics for STI treatment. Evidence has shown that <b>drugstores</b> – though more likely to have health-related training than any other informal CTC providers – lack skills necessary for provision of SRH services. This may contribute to poor SRH outcomes, such as increase in prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) /human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antibiotic resistance. Accessing SRH services at the formal health facility level is key to improving these outcomes. To create SRH service linkages and integration between <b>drugstores</b> and health facilities in Mwanza, Tanzania, an intervention that pioneered an mHealth SRH referral from <b>drugstores</b> to health facilities was designed and implemented for 18 months from September 2012 to February 2014. Referral between these two SRH providers using mHealth tools had not been attempted before. The intervention provided an electronic platform accessible to 52 <b>drugstores</b> and 18 health facilities in two districts of Mwanza region. Through a toll-free number and password, <b>drugstores</b> referred patients with SRH conditions to health facilities using the text-messaging feature on their mobile phones. From the platform’s in-built data collection tool, SRH uptake data demonstrated that 38 % of patients referred from <b>drugstores</b> accessed HIV, STIs, family planning and maternal health services at the health facility level. A follow-up randomised household survey found that 72 % of the participants would accept such type of referral in future, and among those who had ever visited <b>drugstores</b> for SRH services, 15 % had heard about the intervention. At the end of the intervention, <b>drugstores</b> and health facilities confirmed that it was beneficial to their SRH service provision and {{that they would like to}} continue implementing it. In conclusion, this text messaging intervention pioneered community referral from <b>drugstores</b> to health facilities for SRH treatment by using mobile phones which appeared to be acceptable and effective in Mwanza Tanzania. With the growing use of mobile phones in Africa and the need to provide SRH services beyond the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era, mobile phone-based community referral through CTC providers, such as <b>drugstores,</b> could make an important contribution to achieving Universal Health Coverage targets...|$|R

5|$|Cummings {{explored}} the Richardsonian Romanesque mode {{in several of}} his buildings at Russell Sage. The Paine Mansion at 49 Second Street applied the same style, with arcaded entrance loggia and corner tower, to a home. The brick <b>drugstore</b> annex at 155-157 River Street is a particularly representative commercial example of the style. In 1893 the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago popularized the Classical and Renaissance revivals and Beaux-Arts style. They came to Troy very quickly when Marcus Cummings and his son Frederick designed the Classical Revival county courthouse at 80 Second Street, the third to occupy the site, the following year. A short distance away three years later, the Renaissance Revival Hart Memorial Library was built of Vermont marble, joining the similarly styled 1895 Frear Mansion, also on Second Street.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{conventional}} wisdom that larger buyers have more “countervailing power ” (i. e., receive lower prices from suppliers) than small buyers has motivated a growing theoretical literature. We test the theories using data on wholesale prices for antibiotics sold to large and small <b>drugstores</b> in the United States during the 1990 s. We find that large <b>drugstores</b> obtain small price discounts under intermediate levels of supplier competition but no price discounts from monopoly suppliers. These findings support the subset of theories that identify supplier competition as {{a necessary condition for}} buyers to have countervailing power. To further investigate the importance of supplier competition, we compare prices paid by <b>drugstores</b> relative to hospitals and HMOs, which, unlike <b>drugstores,</b> can induce supplier competition through the institution of restrictive formularies. We find larger discounts in these comparisons, again consistent with theories stressing the importance of supplier competition...|$|R

5|$|As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara <b>drugstore</b> {{near his}} home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with {{businessman}} Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open doors in the pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in the trunk of a pickup truck in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup de grâce. The exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities tend to believe he was most likely killed in Tamaulipas.|$|E

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} in the industrial organization literature explaining the conventional wisdom that larger buyers may have more “countervailing power” than small buyers, in that they receive lower prices from suppliers. We test the theories empirically using data on wholesale prices for antibiotics sold through various distribution channels—chain and independent <b>drugstores,</b> hospitals, HMOs—in the U. S. during the 1990 s. Price discounts depend more on the ability to substitute among alternative suppliers than on sheer buyer size. In particular, hospitals and HMOs, which can use restrictive formularies to enhance their substitution opportunities beyond those available for <b>drugstores,</b> obtain substantially lower prices. Chain <b>drugstores</b> only receive a small size discount relative to independents, at most two percent on average, and then only for products for which <b>drugstores</b> have some substitution opportunities (i. e., not for on-patent branded drugs). Our findings are roughly consistent with collusion models of countervailing power and inconsistent with bargaining models and have implications for recent government proposals to form purchasing alliances to reduce prescription costs...|$|R
