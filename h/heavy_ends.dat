The cross is not unlike other works of Insular art where the artist has represented people in contemporary costume. All, except one, of the figures is depicted bare-headed. The lone figure with headgear is Goliath, who wears a conical helmet. Generally the hair is worn clipped in a straight line over the forehead, though in some cases it is shown to be distinctly curly.

Macalister considered that the artist excelled in the geometric and abstract patterns which appear on the cross. On the ring surrounding the head of the cross, there are 17 different patterns. Macalister stated that geometric patterns fall into three categories: spiral, interlace, and key-patterns.|$|E

As a result the mixtures considered are described by the thermodynamic model chosen through the pseudo-components used, thus allowing the optimization of deasphalting and solvent recovery processes...|$|R

40|$|Phenolic oils were {{produced}} from fast pyrolysis {{of two different}} biomass feedstocks, red oak and corn stover, and evaluated in hydroprocessing tests for production of liquid hydrocarbon products. The phenolic oils {{were produced}} with a bio-oil fractionating process in combination with a simple water wash of the <b>heavy</b> <b>ends</b> from the fractionating process. Phenolic oils derived from the pyrolysis of red oak and corn stover were recovered with yields (wet biomass basis) of 28. 7 and 14. 9 wt %, respectively, and 54. 3 % and 60. 0 % on a carbon basis. Both precious metal catalysts and sulfided base metal catalyst were evaluated for hydrotreating the phenolic oils, as an extrapolation from whole bio-oil hydrotreatment. They were effective in removing heteroatoms with carbon yields as high as 81 % (unadjusted for the 90 % carbon balance). There was substantial heteroatom removal with residual O of only 0. 4 % to 5 %, while N and S were reduced to less than 0. 05 %. Use of the precious metal catalysts resulted in more saturated products less completely hydrotreated compared to the sulfided base metal catalyst, which was operated at higher temperature. The liquid product was 42 – 52 % gasoline range molecules and about 43 % diesel range molecules. Particulate matter in the phenolic oils complicated operation of the reactors, causing plugging in the fixed-beds especially for the corn stover phenolic oil. This difficulty contrasts with the catalyst bed fouling and plugging, which is typically seen with hydrotreatment of whole bio-oil. This problem was substantially alleviated by filtering the phenolic oils before hydrotreating. More thorough washing of the phenolic oils during their preparation from the <b>heavy</b> <b>ends</b> of bio-oil or online filtration of pyrolysis vapors to remove particulate matter before condensation of the bio-oil fractions is recommended...|$|E

The degradation might have developed with the influence of bacteria, oxygen or surface influences. The destruction of C 15 +[*]components being destroyed at a great level makes us think that the primary oil in this area was a pre-petroleum with light properties, and that it has been transformed in the long duration and under atmosphere and reservoir conditions. In bitumen analysis, the medium-level degradation especially in light ends might have influenced <b>heavy</b> <b>ends,</b> and therefore, the interpretations have been performed not solely with these parameters but with assessing all the other data.|$|E

40|$|Biochemical {{conversion}} of crude oils is a multi-step process proceeding {{through a series}} of biochemical reactions. These reactions can be characterized by a set of chemical markers which are associated with the chemical composition of crude oils.

40|$|By {{attempting}} {{to define the}} principal chemical features and the complete ranges of molecular mass of the <b>heavy</b> <b>ends</b> of coal and petroleum derived liquids, this review aims to facilitate process development for improved utilization of heavy fractions (coal and biomass tars and pitches, petroleum asphaltenes and resids). Historically much heavy petroleum derived material {{has been used as}} cheap fuel or simply thrown away. With the rising cash-value of the “bottom of the barrel,” greater emphasis on the detailed chemistry of these materials has become an imperative. This paper reviews analytical techniques used for estimating molecular mass distributions and structural features of complex polydispersed hydrocarbons, with masses above those identifiable by gas-chromatography (or GC-MS). The features of the least soluble – and usually large molecular mass - materials in complex mixtures are not generally observable by examination prior to the fractionation of (i. e. “whole”) complex samples. This has been observed even in cases where the “heavy” fraction accounts for about 50 % of the total sample. The major approach reviewed covers the combined use of UV-fluorescence spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, mass spectroscopy and NMR-spectroscopy. This is preceded by a description and critical review of useful sample fractionation methods found in the literature. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energ...|$|E

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at www. springerlink. com. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of <b>heavy</b> <b>ends</b> to high value liquid fuels is a common unit operation in oil refineries. In this process the heavy feedstock which contains sulphur is cracked to light products. Sulphur content is hence redistributed in the liquid and gaseous products and coke of the catalyst used in this process. The coke is later burnt in the regenerator releasing sulphur into the discharged flue gas as SO 2. In the present work, comprehensive emission inventories for a FCC unit in a typical oil refinery are prepared. These inventories are based on calculations which assume complete combustion of catalyst coke in the regenerator. Yearly material balances for both SO 2 and particulate matters (PM) emissions are carried out taking into account seasonal variations {{in the operation of}} the process unit. The results presented in this paper reflect the variation of sulphur in feedstock originating from various units in the refinery. The refinery operations are not dependant on seasons but controlled by market driven conditions to maximize the profit. The seasonal impact on refinery emissions is minimal due to its operation at optimum capacity fulfilling the international market demand. The data presented and analyzed here can be used to assess the hazardous impact of SO 2 and particulate matter (PM) emissions on surrounding areas of the refinery...|$|E
