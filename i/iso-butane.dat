40|$|The {{effect of}} various factors on the {{catalytic}} performance of <b>iso-butane</b> formation over CuZnZrAl/Pd-Î² hybrid catalyst via synthesis gas or CO 2 hydrogenation has been deeply investigated in this work. It was {{interesting to note that}} the iso-butane/n-butane ratio value was much higher than that of thermodynamic equilibrium (about 1 / 1), whose value was directly related to the reaction condition using this hybrid catalyst. In order to further clearly clarify this finding, various experimental reaction factors were selected to investigate the formation of <b>iso-butane.</b> The results revealed that increasing temperature, H 2 /COx, CO 2 /COx, and/or Pd loading possessed an inhibiting effect on the <b>iso-butane</b> yield. High selectivity of <b>iso-butane</b> could be achieved by increasing the reaction pressure, W/F and the weight ratio of CuZnZrAl methanol catalyst to Pd-Î² catalyst. It is also noted that the addition of water seriously suppressed the reaction activity, resulting in the low ratio of iso-butane/n-butane. A possible reaction route was elucidated based on the latest results.

The sorption measurements of two shales were performed at three different temperatures, 308. 15, 323. 15, and 338. 15 [*]K. For the isolated kerogens, the measurements were conducted at 338. 15 [*]K. Methane and ethane sorption isotherms were measured to 35 [*]bar. Carbon dioxide sorption isotherms were studied to 30 [*]bar. Due to the low vapor pressure at room temperature, the sorption isotherms of propane, n-butane and <b>iso-butane</b> were measured to 8, 2, and 2 [*]bar, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation {{on the performance}} of a domestic refrigerator using pure isobutane and mixture of propane, butane and isobutene as a refrigerant. The experiment was conducted with a refrigerator designed to work with HFC- 134 a under the same no load condition at a surrounding temperature of 25 Â°C and 28 Â°C. The refrigeration capacity, the compressor power, the coefficient of performance (COP), condenser duty and heat rejection ratio were investigated. The compressor consumes 2. 08 kWh/day and 2. 25 kWh/day when R- 134 a was used as refrigerant at 25 Â°C and 28 Â°C ambient temperature but when isobutane was used it consumed 2. 131 kWh/day and 2. 183 kWh/day at same condition. Where as the compressor consumed 2. 625 kWh/day and 2. 758 kWh/day when mixture of 70 Propane, 25 Butane and 5 <b>Iso-butane</b> was used and 2. 515 kWh/day and 2. 579 kWh/day when mixture of 50 Propane, 40 Butane and 10 <b>Iso-butane</b> was used at 25 Â°C and 28 Â°C ambient temperatures respectively.

The production of <b>iso-butane</b> is significant and was not seen with either reactant separately. Similarly, the extent of deactivation as seen by the reduction in the propyne conversion is much less marked than when propyne was fed individually.

30|$|When both {{reactants}} {{are passed}} over the catalyst a unique product distribution is observed. Firstly, no cis- 2 -butene is formed, even though both reactants produce this product when {{passed over the}} catalyst individually; secondly, both <b>iso-butane</b> and iso-butene are formed even though neither reactant produces these products when passed over the catalyst individually. Thirdly, an enhanced initial yield of propene is observed. The absence of cis- 2 -butene is a slightly odd result, although the primary product of butane dehydrogenation is 1 -butene [9] there is rapid isomerisation {{and the production of}} both trans- and cis- 2 -butene. Note that the yield of 1 -butene and trans- 2 -butene is very similar to that found in the absence of propyne if we assume that the butenes are only formed from butane (0.7  % 1 -butene, 0.5  % trans- 2 -butene from the mixed feed cf. 0.6  % 1 -butene, 0.5  % trans- 2 -butene from the butane feed). This implies that either the 1 -butene isomers to trans- 2 -butene first prior to isomerisation to cis- 2 -butene, as this would allow a situation where no cis- 2 -butene was detected, or cis- 2 -butene is formed but reacts in the alkylation reaction to form <b>iso-butane</b> (ene). Interestingly, assuming that a butane molecule must be used to form either <b>iso-butane</b> or iso-butene then all of the butane conversion can be accounted for in the production of 1 -butene, trans- 2 -butene, <b>iso-butane</b> and iso-butene. However, after 25  min time on stream the butane conversion remains approximately the same yet no dehydrogenation products are observed. The likely reason for this is carbon deposition from the propyne poisoning the dehydrogenation activity. It has been shown in previous studies of alkane dehydrogenation [9, 17] that the materials desorbed at room temperature in an oxidising gas are responsible for the major loss in activity for vanadia-based catalysts. In this case it can be seen from Fig.  5 that propyne, methane and carbon monoxide are the principal gases desorbed and these can all be traced back to propyne. The transhydrogenation activity is also lost when the main dehydrogenation activity is lost. This {{can be seen from the}} drop in propene yield. Note that the amount of <b>iso-butane</b> and iso-butene formed match the butane conversion in agreement with the TPO that butane contributes very little to the carbon deposition.|$|E
30|$|GTC {{technology}} uses various {{processes for}} the isomerization of n-butane, LSR, and C 7 + hydrocarbons. Isomalk- 3 SM {{is the process}} used for the isomerization of n-butane to <b>iso-butane</b> [30]. It uses a low-temperature isomerization process, and only non-chlorinated technology is being used for n-butane. <b>Iso-butane</b> is a vital intermediate product that {{is essential for the}} manufacturing of isobutylene or alkylate. Isobutylene is further used for the production of MTBE or important petrochemicals. The isomalk- 3 sm process use mixed metal oxide catalyst that is very selective towards the formation of i-butane and operates at a temperature range of around 150 – 170  °C [31]. The predictable period of the SI- 3 catalyst is about 10  years. The process reduces the requirement for chlorine injection. Contaminants like water, sulfur, and nitrogen for the feedstock are lowered [30, 31].|$|E

Their relative contributions to the total conversion depend on temperature, partial pressure, and the concentration of the acid sites of the catalyst.

The catalyst was prepared by impregnation of Zr(OH) 4 with H 2 SO 4 and platinum solution followed by calcination at 600 Â°C. Ammonia TPD and FT-IR were used to confirm the distribution of acid sites {{and the structure of}} the sulfate species. Nitrogen physisorption and X-ray diffraction were used to confirm the physical structures of Pt/SO 2 - 4 -ZrO 2. XRD pattern showed that the presence of sulfate ion stabilized the metastable tetragonal phase of zirconia and hindered the transition of amorphous phase to monoclinic phase of zirconia. Ammonia TPD profiles indicated the distributions of weak and medium acid sites observed on 0. 1 N and 1. 0 N sulfate in the loaded catalysts. The addition of 2. 0 N and 4. 0 N sulfate ion generated strong acid site and decreased the weak and medium acid sites. However, the XRD results and the specific surface area of the catalysts indicated that the excessive amount of sulfate ion collapsed the structure of the catalyst. The catalysts showed high activity and stability for isomerization of n-butane to <b>iso-butane</b> at 200 Â°C under hydrogen atmosphere. The conversion of n-butane to <b>iso-butane</b> per specific surface area of the catalyst increased with the increasing amount of sulfate ion owing to the existence of the bidentate sulfate and/or polynucleic sulfate species ((ZrO) 2 SO 2), which acts as an active site for the isomerization...|$|E

SZ- 1 had a smaller surface area (90 m 2 g- 1) than SZ- 2 (140 m 2 g- 1) but displayed a one order of magnitude higher maximum n-butane isomerization rate (373 – 423 K, 1 – 5 kPa n-butane at 101. 3 kPa total pressure). Both materials consisted predominantly of tetragonal ZrO 2, contained 9 wt% of sulfate, and adsorbed about 0. 5 mmol g- 1 NH 3.

In the region in which two-stage ignition is observed, 680 - 825 K, {{the duration of the}} first ignition stage decreases sharply in the range 680 - 770 K, but is essentially flat above 770 K. Good quantitative agreement is found between the measurements and calculations for n-butane using a comprehensive model for butane ignition, including both delay times in the two-stage region, with substantial differences being observed for <b>iso-butane,</b> particularly in the NTC region.

A suite of {{non-polar}} adsorptives of different kinetic diameters and shape {{were used to}} determine adsorption and pore filling mechanism of a well-characterised poly(furfuryl alcohol) -based activated carbon. Triplicate measured Type I adsorption isotherms for each adsorptive were averaged to provide standard deviation in relative pressures and associated amounts adsorbed. Plateau amounts adsorbed for N 2, Ar, CH 4, and C 6 H 6, provided Gurvitsch volumes averaged to 0. 368 ± 0. 015 cm 3 (liq) /g. The calculated Gurvitsch volumes were compared with those derived via the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equation. Additional adsorptives were CO 2, <b>iso-butane</b> and SF 6. The results of these 7 adsorptives were used to qualitatively analyse and decode a micropore filling adsorption mechanism. The DR equation was also used for further analysis of the pore filling mechanism. Based on the adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, adsorbates were classified into three groups: (a) Non-polar with non-specific interactions (no dipole, no quadrupole, not readily polarizable: Ar, N 2, CH 4 and <b>iso-butane),</b> adsorbing as a continuous uptake over the observed relative pressure range; (b) Non-polar adsorptives with potential for specific interactions (no dipole, quadrupole moment: CO 2 and C 6 H 6), adsorbing as a condensation process over a relatively narrow relative pressure range in a medium pressure range; (c) Halogenated adsorptives (no dipole, no quadrupole, polarizable: SF 6), adsorbing with an S-shaped uptake extending over a relatively broad relative pressure range...|$|E
40|$|Configurational-bias Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of the adsorption isotherm for <b>iso-butane</b> (iC 4) in MFI zeolite shows a strong inflection at a loading Θ = 4 molecules per unit cell. The {{consequence of the}} isotherm inflection on the loading dependence of the Maxwell-Stefan (M-S) diffusivity, Ð, was investigated using infra-red microscopy (IRM). The experimental data show that Ð decreases nearly linearly as Θ is increased to 4; further increase in Θ results in {{a sharp increase in}} Ð, with a cusp at Θ = 4. Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are used to rationalize the experimental observations. The simulations indicate that significant inter-molecular repulsions are present for Θ > 4...|$|E
30|$|The {{process of}} light naphtha {{isomerization}} mainly bases on the chlorinated platinum promoted alumina catalysts [3]. These active catalysts function {{even at a}} low temperature, which is a favorable condition for the process of isomerization. In earlier times, aluminum chloride {{was used as a}} catalyst in isomerization to produce <b>iso-butane</b> [4]. Afterward, many other catalysts have been developed but operated at a high temperature with reduced conversion of naphtha due to their lower activity. Therefore, highly active dual function catalysts are developed in recent years that can be operated at a lower temperature with high conversion of naphtha [6]. The types of catalysts used for the isomerization process of light naphtha are mixed metal oxide- and zeolite-based catalysts [2].|$|E
