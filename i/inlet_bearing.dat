40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the Bearing Deflectometer Investigation was to gain {{experience}} {{in the use of}} fiber optic displacement probe technology for bearing health monitoring in a liquid hydrogen turbo pump. The work specified in this Task Order was conducted in conjunction with Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory Contract F 04611 - 86 -C- 0010. APD conducted the analysis and design coordination to provide a displacement probe design compatible with the XLR- 134 liquid hydrogen turbo pump assembly (TPA). Specifications and requirements of the bearing deflectometer were established working with Mechanical Technology Instruments, Inc. (MTI). The TPA design accommodated positioning of the probe to measure outer race cyclic deflections of the pump <b>inlet</b> <b>bearing.</b> The fiber optic sensor was installed as required in the TPA and sensor output was recorded during the TPA testing.

40|$|Analysis of {{the flow}} in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) high {{pressure}} oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) <b>bearing</b> no. 1 <b>inlet</b> cavity was completed in support of return-to-flight. With the incorporation of several design changes in the Phase 2 turbopump, rotordynamic stability of the pumps was enhanced, but the durability and life of the LOX-cooled bearings has decreased. During the post-Challenger SSME recertification, the causes of limited bearing durability were investigated. One topic addressed was the flow environment upstream of the pump-end bearing {{and the effect of}} seal exit swirl and a cavity anti-vortex rib on the bearing environment and life. The objective is to define the hydrodynamic environment upstream of the pump-end bearing and determine the effect of seal exit swirl and the anti-vortex rib on <b>bearing</b> <b>inlet</b> swirl. The problem was posed as an axisymmetric cavity flow with the computational domain extending from the seal exit to the <b>bearing</b> <b>inlet.</b> This domain was discretized with 22800 grid points. Boundary conditions were obtained from a 1 -D model of the SSME coolant path. The inlet Mach number was 0. 19 and the problem was solved with the CMINT code utilizing the Briley-McDonald/Beam-Warming algorithm with preconditioning to speed convergence at low Mach numbers. Three parametric cases with inlet swirl of 50 percent shaft speed (labyrinth seal), 20 percent shaft speed (damping seal), and no inlet swirl were considered. Computational results indicate large vortical flow structures in the cavity, with the labyrinth, damping, and no-swirl cases yielding <b>bearing</b> <b>inlet</b> swirl rates of 14, 10, and 9 percent of shaft speed, respectively. When these results were used as input to the SHABRETH bearing model, limited durability could not be explained by these small differences in swirl. Also, based on these results, a proposed design change for the cavity anti-vortex rib was not implemented by the SSME chief engineer...|$|R

In addition to attempting spontaneous combustion, an electric spark and a rub (friction) mechanism were employed to ignite fires.

Fires were also ignited using the rub mechanism with the only test lubricant evaluated, Esso 4040. Major parameters controlling ignitions were: Sump configuration; Bearing and oil temperatures, hot air temperature and flow and bearing speed. Rubbing between stationary parts and rotating parts (eg. labyrinth seal and mating rub strip) is a very potent fire source suggesting that observed accidental fires in gas turbine sumps may well arise from this cause...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of a 3 D <b>inlet</b> {{textured}} slider <b>bearing</b> with {{a temperature}} dependent fluid is performed. Numerical simulations {{are carried out}} for a laminar and steady flow. Hot and cold lubricant mixing in the groove is modelled and examined for different operating conditions. Thermohydrodynamic performance of the bearing is analysed for different texture lengths. Results show that texture has a stronger and positive influence on load carrying capacity when thermal effects are considered. This beneficial effect is at a maximum for the longest dimples with a length shorter than the pad length. Texture is also beneficial for the load carrying capacity when the sliding speed and inlet flow rate are varied: with an appropriate supply mass flow, load carrying capacity can be increased by 6 - 7 % at low sliding speeds.

40|$|PaperPg. 19 - 27. This paper {{presents}} {{the highlights of}} a complete rotor dynamics analysis and bearing optimization study that was performed on a 3800 HP multistage steam turbine. This unit is coupled to a three stage, poster-type, centrifugal air compressor with two high speed pinion shafts engaging a common bull gear. The turbine drives the lower speed pinion at a maximum speed of 10, 500 rpm. Located {{at the other end}} of this same pinion is the first stage impeller wheel. The second and third stages are mounted on the higher speed pinion, rotating at a maximum speed of 13, 600 rpm. The maximum speed of the bull gear is 1, 940 rpm. All the existing compressor bearings are the four-lobe type. The original turbine rotor consists of three stages and has a 41. 34 inch bearing span. The bearings are lemon-bore type with journal diameters of 3. 0 and 4. 0 inches on the inlet and exhaust ends, respectively. This turbine has exhibited subsynchronous vibration, at approximately half rotational speed, during field testing. The half frequency vibration prevented operation above 9, 400 rpm because a shaft resonance was excited and vibration levels became prohibitively high. The analysis of the existing rotor-bearing system predicts that the turbine operates close to the second critical speed and that the rotor is stable under normal load conditions. However, the rotor becomes unstable when the lemon-bore bearings are unloaded. There are two major sources of bearing load in addition to gravity. These loads are misalignment and gear mesh loading. Misalignment can result from differential thermal growth of the turbine and compressor cases and supports. If the coupling does not act as an ideal joint, this differential growth can impose external loads at the bearings. The bearing load resulting from the gear mesh is a reaction to the torque transmission at the gear interface. For example, the turbine driver rotates in the counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the low speed pinion gear tends to climb up the bull gear, which causes an upward external load on the pinion bearings. As in the case of misalignment, if the coupling is not ideal, the turbine bearings can also be affected by these gear mesh reaction loads. This analysis is primarily concerned with the effect of these external loads that oppose gravity and cause degrees of net bearing unloading because the unloading causes rotor instability. The rotor is unstable with 75 pounds unloading at each bearing or 110 pounds unloading at the exhaust end bearing alone (with a normal gravity load at the <b>inlet</b> end <b>bearing).</b> As a solution to the problem, a new set of bearings was designed to stabilize the rotor and move the peak response speeds away from the operating speed range. The new bearings are five-shoe-tilt-pad bearings with load-between-pad orientation. The <b>inlet</b> end <b>bearing</b> has a 3. 0 inch diameter bore with length-to-diameter ratio of 1. 0; and preload of 0. 8. The exhaust end bearing has a 3. 995 inch diameter bore with a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 4 and preload of 0. 0. With the new tilt-pad bearing design there are no response peaks in the normal operating speed range and the system log decrement is 2. 8 times higher than with the existing system, under normal load conditions. The log decrement for the tilt-pad bearings is + 0. 52 for an unloading of 100 pounds. Therefore, the tilt-pads provide a stable rotor support that is not sensitive to unloading...|$|R

A previously developed bearing/shaft thermal {{model of the}} SSME LOX turbopump turbine and bearing was {{used in conjunction with}} SHABERTH to evaluate the thermomechanical operating characteristics of the LOX turbopump end bearings.

Bearing clearance changes due to thermal effects were 40 % for the 4. 0 mil diametrical clearance case and 19 % for the 6. 3 mil clearance case evaluated. The thermal analysis included evaluation of bearing temperatures for a subcooled case and a saturated case. Results indicate that no drastic temperature change occurred between the two cases.

40|$|The IC engine crnakshaft bearings, {{especially}} at the crankpin journals, are very loaded elements. For their proper functioning {{it is necessary to}} define carefully the working conditions, where the quality of oil {{is one of the most}} important factors. From the aspect of the working conditions of journal bearings it is important to ensure a minimum change in oil viscosity in a wide IC engine operating range. Selection of lubricating oil from the standpoint of physical characteristics, primarily the appropriate viscosity, has an important place in the area of reducing friction losses in journal bearings and increasing IC engine efficiency. This paper deals with the impact of lubricating oil viscosity on the working conditions of vehicle turbocharged diesel engine crankpin journals.

5000|$|Seventeenth day -- September 7. -- In {{company with}} Mr. Langford, I {{climbed to the}} summit of a {{neighboring}} peak, the highest of the east range. We were four hours reaching the highest point, climbing for over a mile over shelly, feldspathic granite, after leaving our horses at the limit of pines. Summit at noon, barometer, 20.35; thermometer, 65°; elevation, 10,327 feet. The view from this peak commanded completely the lake, enabling us to sketch a map of its <b>inlets</b> and <b>bearings</b> with considerable accuracy. On the southwestern portion of the lake rose a high mountain of a yellow rock, forming a divide or water-shed {{in the center of}} the great basin, beyond which the waters flowed south and west. The stream we failed in crossing on the previous day rises in the southeast range, running east several miles, and joining another stream from the southwest at Bridger's Lake, a sheet of water about two miles in diameter, at the foot of a rocky peak about twenty-five miles to the south, from whence the stream flows due north, in a straight valley, to the Yellowstone Lake. This valley has a uniform width of about three miles, is level and swampy through its whole extent, with numerous lakelets of considerable size scattered at intervals over its surface. South of Bridger's Lake, and beyond the Snake River divide, were seen two vast columns of vapor, thirty miles away, which rose at least 500 feet above the tops of the hills. These were twenty times as large as any we had previously seen, but lay a long distance out of our course, and were not visited. Looking east, one mountain succeeds another, with precipitous ravines, volcanic, rugged, and in many places impassable, as if all the fusible portions of the mountains had melted and run away, leaving a vast cinder behind. There were no ranges of peaks; it was a great level plain of summits, with the softer portions melted out, the elevations all coming up to the same level, and capped with horizontal beds of surface lava. This formation extended to the limit of vision. The deep and narrow valleys were grassed and timbered, had sparkling streams, and furnished basins for numbers of small lakes; in fact, there are lakes here everywhere, on the summits of the mountains and on their terraced slopes, in valleys and in ravines, of all sizes, shapes, and qualities of water.

40|$|LecturePg. 31 - 42 Analysis, design, and {{optimization}} of {{high performance}} journal and thrust bearings {{in a high}} speed integrally geared compressor are described. The high speed and relatively small bearing size stretches the applicable limits of conventional style tilt pad bearings. The variation in the load magnitude, {{as is the case}} with most gear loaded bearings, requires careful analysis of the stability and unbalance response characteristics. An optimized new flexible pivot bearing was used in this application to provide stable operation throughout the wide ranges of load and <b>inlet</b> temperature. The <b>bearing</b> incorporated a directed lubrication feature to reduce the hot oil carry over which is known to be a major contributor to high bearing temperatures in high speed applications. The precision inherent in the manufacturing process used to produce this style of bearing allowed further optimization of the preload and pivot offset. The use of an offset pivot configuration demonstrated lower sensitivity to bearing clearance variation. The necessity for high rotational speeds in integrally geared compressors increases the frictional power losses in the journal and thrust bearings. The parasitic losses constitute a significant percentage of the overall bearing power losses. Bearing designs that were utilized to reduce both the frictional and parasitic losses in the thrust bearings are discussed. The new thrust bearings were designed to provide an optimum crown-to-film thickness ratio allowing the bearing to carry the design thrust load with fewer pads. The analytical results for the conventional and deflection journal and thrust bearings are presented and compared to the test data. The new bearing resulted in lower steady state vibrations. At surge conditions, the synchronous and subsynchronous vibrations were about 25 percent of the conventional tilt pad bearing. The frictional and parasitic power losses with the new thrust bearing were about 20 percent lower than those of the conventional bearings. The temperature rise was also lower which indicated that the inlet temperature can be further increased with the new bearing allowing a wider operating temperature range and lower frictional losses...|$|R
40|$|Static {{characteristics}} and rotordynamic coefficients were experimentally determined for a four-pad tilting-pad journal bearing with ball-in-socket pivots in loadbetween- pad configuration. A frequency-independent [M]-[C]-[K] model fit the measurements reasonably well, {{except for the}} cross-coupled damping coefficients. Test conditions included speeds from 4, 000 to 12, 000 rpm and unit loads from 0 to 1896 kPa (0 to 275 psi). The test bearing was manufactured by Rotating Machinery Technology (RMT), Inc. Though it has a nominal diameter of 101. 78 mm (4. 0070 in.), measurements indicated significant bearing crush with radial bearing clearances of 99. 6 ?m (3. 92 mils) and 54. 6 ?m (2. 15 mils) in the axes 45 ? counterclockwise and 45 ? clockwise from the loaded axis, respectively. The pad length is 101. 6 mm (4. 00 in.), giving L/D = 1. 00. The pad arc angle is 73 ?, and the pivot offset ratio is 65 %. The preloads of the loaded and unloaded pads are 0. 37 and 0. 58, respectively. A bulk-flow Navier-Stokes model was used for predictions, using adiabatic conditions for the bearing fluid. Because the model assumes constant nominal clearances at all pads, {{the average of the}} measured clearances was used as an estimate. Eccentricities and attitude angles were markedly under predicted while power loss was under predicted at low speeds and very well predicted at high speeds. The maximum detected pad temperature was 71 ?C (160 ?F) and the rise from <b>inlet</b> to maximum <b>bearing</b> temperature was over predicted by 10 - 40 %. Multiple-frequency force inputs were used to excite the bearing. Direct stiffness and damping coefficients were significantly over predicted, but addition of a simple stiffness-in-series model substantially improved the agreement between theory and experiment. Direct added masses were zero or negative at low speeds and increased with speed up to a maximum of about 50 kg; they were normally greater in the unloaded direction. Although significant cross-coupled stiffness terms were present, they always had the same sign. The bearing had zero whirl frequency ratio netting unconditional stability over all test conditions. Static stiffness in the y direction (obtained from steadystate loading) matched the rotordynamic stiffness Kyy (obtained from multiple-frequency excitation) reasonably at low loads but poorly at the maximum test load...|$|R
40|$|Conformal {{contacts}} {{like those}} found in journal or inclined slider bearings are widely encountered in various types of machines from small engines to large turbines. These contacts involve convergent gaps {{that are used to}} separate the surfaces in relative motion and generate pressure in the lubricant film. The contacts have to carry a load while keeping friction as low as possible. Environmental and economic concerns require the machines to operate with minimal power loss. A number of design modifications have been proposed over the years in order to decrease bearing power consumption. There are indications that surface topography can have a significant and positive influence on hydrodynamic performance. Texturing of a load carrying surface is a process that would be beneficial in lubricated conformal contacts as {{it would be possible to}} obtain thicker films and reduced frictional losses. Textured lubricated contacts are analysed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code through different geometries. The effects of the texture on hydrodynamic performance of the contact are investigated. For the simulations performed, the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved under steady-state conditions. The flow is taken to be laminar and two- dimensional. A journal bearing with several dimples created on the stationary part is firstly investigated. A realistic multiphase flow cavitation model is introduced and successfully validated. It is shown that the coefficient of friction can be reduced if dimples of suitable depth are introduced. This can be achieved either in the region of maximum hydrodynamic pressure for a bearing with high eccentricity ratio or just downstream of the maximum film for a bearing with low eccentricity ratio. A new effect of pressure build-up, generated by the surface texture, has been identified at low eccentricity ratios. This pressure build-up effect is more extensively investigated through the study of an inclined slider bearing with a texture located at the inlet part of the contact, i. e. just downstream of the maximum film. The governing mechanism at the origin of an optimum in load carrying capacity for a smooth slider bearing is analysed and the effects of the texture on the pressure build-up and load carrying capacity are explained. The energy received by the fluid from the moving wall is converted into pressure in the first part of the converging contact and into losses in the second part. Convergence ratio can be increased until the limit where flow recirculation begins to occur is reached in order to get the greatest pressure gradient. The texture appears to reach its maximum efficiency when its depth is such that the velocity profile is stretched at its maximum without incoming recirculating flow. Thus, the wall profile shape controlling the velocity profile can be optimized for many hydrodynamic contacts. For such contacts, heat is usually produced due to shearing of the flow and the lubricant is subjected to temperature variations. Since the dynamic viscosity of the lubricant is temperature dependent, variation of the viscosity as well as frictional losses and load carrying capacity is expected. Thermal effects are analysed for different shear rates in this <b>inlet</b> textured slider <b>bearing.</b> Shear losses and subsequent heating reduce load carrying capacity compared with isothermal conditions. Texture has a positive effect in a parallel surface contact when thermal effects are considered. It has been found that for the different convergence ratios considered, the texture enables the sustaining of a load only until a certain critical shear rate is reached. This critical shear stress depends on a number of factors such as the convergence ratio and lubricant parameters including the viscosity-temperature coefficient and the reference dynamic viscosity.
