500|$|After {{her time}} with her new friends at the retreat, Sarah Savage was optimistic. [...] "I left the retreat with a {{different}} outlook on life, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> confidence growing, slowly." [...] She appeared on chat shows ITV Breakfast and Live with Gabby in 2011, and returned to television in March 2013 as a guest on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. She took a job in Brighton, and has a blog that she started during the production of My Transsexual Summer. In the spring of 2013, she started HRT. 2013 was also the inaugural year of Trans* Pride Brighton, the first transgender pride festival in the UK, and she and Fox Fisher served on the organisation committee. In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy or are You a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated. [...] "Before I started transitioning, I never wrote, I never... did anything creative," [...] said Sarah in a 2013 interview. [...] "For some reason... living in a female role {{has allowed me to}} be more creative." ...|$|E
60|$|We knelt close {{together}} at her feet. I could feel Mary's heart throbbing, as she pressed nearer and nearer to my side. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> own heart quickening its beat, with {{a fear that}} was a mystery to me.|$|E
6000|$|I {{suppose the}} {{situation}} lasted {{a fraction of}} a second, though it seemed to me to last an interminable time. Then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> leggings rip and his claw go scoring deeply down my calf. That hurt in a kind of painless, impersonal interesting way. Was my leg coming off? Boot? The weight had gone, that enormous weight! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} lost in the timber since yesterday," [...] he said. [...] "Oh, it was awful, the wind and the snow, and the intense cold. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> feet, and I knew I was {{freezing}} to death. And I hadn't a mouthful to eat!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After such an {{experience}} as mine has been," [...] said Stella, [...] "would {{you think it}} possible that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever again <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> heart troubled by a man--and that man a stranger?" ...|$|R
40|$|As I awoke {{one morning}} from uneasy dreams I found myself {{transformed}} {{in my bed}} into a gigantic insect. Like Gregor Samsa in Kafka’s Metamorphosis, I had mutated into an enormous and abominable cockroach with no prior warning. It just happened. As I woke up, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> how <b>my</b> new legs and antennae moved with sinuous speed. Then I knew what I really had become. I had muted into a Spanish fascist...|$|R
60|$|What {{manner of}} thing was upon me I did not know, {{but that it}} was large and heavy and many-legged <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel.</b> <b>My</b> hands were at its throat before the fangs had a chance to bury {{themselves}} in my neck, and slowly I forced the hairy face from me and closed my fingers, vise-like, upon its windpipe.|$|E
6000|$|A surging {{of the mob}} was {{sweeping}} our horses {{along and}} grinding our knees together. Some fanatic had fallen, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> horse recoil and half rear as it tramped on him, and I could hear the man screaming and the snarling menace from all about rising to a roar. But my head was over my shoulder as I called back to Miriam: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> senses leaving me. In {{the room}} {{across the hall}} {{there was a man}} singing. His voice, that had been loud, came fainter and fainter through the transom. I fell into a sleep, the deep immeasurable sleep in which the very {{existence}} of the outer world was hushed. Dimly I could feel the days go past, then the years, and then the long passage of the centuries.|$|E
6000|$|So I {{went up the}} big {{staircase}} to {{a part of the}} Castle that I did not remember, wondering who [...] "the others" [...] might be. Almost <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have sworn that the shade of Savage accompanied me up those stairs; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him at <b>my</b> side.|$|R
5000|$|... "I wish, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> it in <b>my</b> heart, {{that she}} was fully {{recognized}} in her own life," [...] said Seaga, breaking into tears as his wife Carla moved to comfort him at the podium."She goes to her grave only partly covered in the glory she deserves.|$|R
60|$|So Lucy did {{not wish}} me to {{remember}} certain passages in our earlier youth! Doubtless her present relations to Andrew Drewett rendered the recollection delicate, if not unpleasant. I thought this less like herself than was her wont--Lucy, who was usually so simple-minded, so affectionate, so frank and so true. Nevertheless, love is an engrossing sentiment, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> in <b>my</b> own case, {{and it might be}} that its jealous sensitiveness took the alarm at even that which was so innocent and sincere. The effect of these considerations, added to that of Lucy's remark, was to change the discourse, and we conversed long, in melancholy sadness, of her we had lost, for this life, altogether.|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} dark {{when we got}} to the country, but the man seemed to know where to go. He pulled at my rope, and we began to walk along a road with no people in it at all. We walked on and on, but it was all so new to me that I forgot how tired I was. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> mind {{broadening}} with every step I took.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} with me," [...] Kate said. [...] "As {{to the other}} things, do not be foolish. On these marshes I am like a cat in a dark room. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> way across every inch {{of them on the}} blackest night that ever was. I know how high the tide is. I {{measured}} it but half an hour since by Treadwell's pole. You come with me, miss. You'll not miss your way by a foot. I promise you that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you're {{laughing}} at me. I {{know you think}} I'm abominably vain, but I'm not. There really isn't one spark of vanity in me. And I'm never a bit grudging about paying compliments to other girls when they deserve them. I'm so glad I know you folks. I came up on Saturday and I've nearly died of homesickness ever since. It's a horrible feeling, isn't it? In Bolingbroke I'm an important personage, and in Kingsport I'm just nobody! There were times when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> soul turning a delicate blue. Where do you hang out?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The first stage's theme, called [...] "Captain Neo", is a {{reworked}} {{version of}} a song from an earlier arcade game by Taito, Metal Soldier Isaac II. When a prototype of Darius was exhibited at a trade show, the song {{was used as a}} temporary placeholder. However, upon hearing the song at the trade show, Ogura liked it and decided to keep it: [...] "I was surprised by its overwhelming power, so much that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> it in <b>my</b> bones." ...|$|R
6000|$|And like a fury she dashed {{upon the}} scene. She was {{gritting}} her teeth, making frightful grimaces, snarling, uttering sharp and continuous cries {{that sounded like}} [...] "kh-ah! kh-ah!" [...] So sudden and formidable was her appearance that the boar involuntarily bunched himself together on the defensive and bristled as she swerved toward him. Then she swerved toward me. She had quite taken the breath out of him. I knew just {{what to do in}} that moment of time she had gained. I leaped to meet her, catching her about the waist and holding on hand and foot--yes, by my feet; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold on by them as readily as by <b>my</b> hands. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> in <b>my</b> tense grip the pull of the hair as her skin and her muscles moved beneath with her efforts.|$|R
6000|$|... 261. At another time, though {{just before}} I was pretty well and savoury in my spirit, yet {{suddenly}} there fell upon {{me a great}} cloud of darkness, which did so hide from me the things of God and Christ, that I was as if I had never seen or known them in my life: I was also so over-run in my soul with a senseless heartless frame of spirit, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> soul to move or stir after grace and life by Christ; I was as if my loins were broken, or as if my hands and feet had been tied or bound with chains. At this time also I felt some weakness to seize upon my outward man, which made still the other affliction the more heavy and uncomfortable to me.|$|R
60|$|The {{transition}} {{had been}} so sudden and so unexpected that it left {{me for a moment}} forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis. My first thought was, is this then death! Have I indeed passed over forever into that other life! But I could not well believe this, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me. My breath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out from every pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed the fact that I was anything other than a wraith.|$|E
60|$|On {{the last}} stroke of twelve, the {{cupboard}} {{door in the}} next room opened. There is no need to ask me how I knew it. I couldn't, of course, see it, but I could hear, or sense in some way, the sound of it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> hair, all of it, rising upon my head. I was aware that there was a presence in the adjoining room, I will not say a person, a living soul, but a presence. Anyone who has been {{in the next room}} to a presence will know just how I felt. I could hear a sound as of some one groping on the floor and the faint rattle as of coins.|$|E
60|$|As far as I could {{remember}} {{there were six}} chairs in that Oklahoma, and one table, a great big heavy table, not a good table to hit with your head when rushing madly along. In {{the course of time}} I collided with thirty-five chairs and tables enough to stock that dining-room out there. It was a hospital for decayed furniture, and it was in a worse condition when I got through with it. I went on and on, and at last got to a place where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> way up, and there was a shelf. I knew that wasn't {{in the middle of the}} room. Up to that time I was afraid I had gotten out of the city.|$|E
60|$|I {{entertain}} a {{very strong}} conviction that any one who adds to medical education one iota or tittle beyond what is absolutely necessary, is guilty of a very grave offence. Gentlemen, it will depend upon the knowledge that you happen to possess,--upon your means of applying it within your own field of action,--whether the bills of mortality of your district are increased or diminished; and that, gentlemen, {{is a very serious}} consideration indeed. And, under those circumstances, the subjects with which you have to deal being so difficult, their extent so enormous, and the time at your disposal so limited, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> conscience easy if I did not, on such an occasion as this, raise a protest against employing your energies upon the acquisition of any knowledge which may not be absolutely needed in your future career.|$|R

"I have crawled upon {{my belly}} to the utmost {{edge of the}} still {{standing}} [...] pier, until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> with <b>my</b> hand the jagged splinters left by the [...] fallen planks, and have looked down. But the chasm was full to the [...] brim with darkness. I shouted, but the wind shook my voice into [...] mocking laughter. I sit here, feebly striking at the madness that is [...] creeping nearer and nearer to me. I tell myself {{the whole thing is}} [...] but the fever in my brain. The bridge was rotten. The storm was [...] strong. The cry is but a single one among the many voices of the [...] mountain.

60|$|He {{found the}} speech for a {{monument}} to Lord Palmerston in the Abbey “a delicate and difficult duty” (Feb. 22). “It would have worn me down beforehand had I {{not been able to}} exclude it from my thoughts till the last, and then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> impotence.” Yet he performed the duty with grace and truth. He commemorated Palmerston’s share in the extension of freedom in Europe, and especially in Italy, where, he said, Palmerston’s name might claim a place on a level with her most distinguished patriots. Nor had his interest ever failed in the rescue of the “unhappy African race, whose history is for the most part written only in blood and tears.” He applauded his genial temper, his incomparable tact and ingenuity, his pluck in debate, his delight in a fair stand-up fight, his inclination to avoid whatever tended to exasperate, his incapacity of sustained anger.|$|R
60|$|They {{held water}} to my lips, and I drank greedily. It {{must be remembered}} that all this while I lay {{helpless}} on my back, my arms pinioned along with my body inside the jacket. When they offered me food--dry prison bread--I shook my head. I closed my eyes in advertisement that I was tired of their presence. The pain of my partial resuscitation was unbearable. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> body coming to life. Down the cords of my neck and into my patch of chest over the heart darting pains were making their way. And in my brain the memory was strong that Philippa waited me in the big hall, and I was desirous to escape away back to the half a day and half a night I had just lived in old France.|$|E
6000|$|It was no easy task, {{waiting on}} the cabin table, where sat Wolf Larsen, Johansen, and the six hunters. The cabin was small, to begin with, and to move around, as I was {{compelled}} to, was not made easier by the schooner’s violent pitching and wallowing. But what struck me most forcibly was the total lack of sympathy {{on the part of}} the men whom I served. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> knee through my clothes, swelling, and swelling, and I was sick and faint from the pain of it. I could catch glimpses of my face, white and ghastly, distorted with pain, in the cabin mirror. All the men must have seen my condition, but not one spoke or took notice of me, till I was almost grateful to Wolf Larsen, later on (I was washing the dishes), when he said: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{eyed him}} sourly, as he droned on about 'reactionable endowment', 'surrender-value', and 'interest accumulating on the tontine policy', and tried, as I did so, to analyse the loathing I felt for him. I {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that it was partly due to his pose of doing the whole thing from purely altruistic motives, entirely for my good, and partly because he forced me to face the fact that I was not always going to be young. In an abstract fashion I had already realized that I should in time cease to be thirty, but the way in which Glossop spoke of my sixty-fifth birthday made me feel as if it was due tomorrow. He was a man with a manner suggestive of a funeral mute suffering from suppressed jaundice, and I had never before been so weighed down with a sense of the inevitability of decay and the remorseless passage of time. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> hair whitening.|$|E
5000|$|He {{found that}} {{he could no longer}} bring his mind to think of God, do japa or any other spiritual {{practice}}. He asked Ramana for help and was told {{that this was not a}} problem, that all his practice had carried him to this moment and it could be left behind now because it had served its purpose. When telling Ramana about the story of his search of the Self; Then he looked at me intently. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>my</b> whole body and mind were being washed with waves of purity. They were being purified by his silent gaze. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him looking intently into my Heart. Under that spellbinding gaze I felt every atom of my body being purified. It was as if a new body were being created for me. A process of transformation was going on—the old body was dying, atom by atom, and a new body was being created in its place. Then, suddenly, I understood. I knew that this man who had spoken to me was, in reality, what I already was, what I had always been. There was a sudden impact of recognition as I became aware of the Self.|$|R
6000|$|... "And, {{with all}} this, {{there is nothing}} that I can {{complain}} of--nothing marked enough to justify me in noticing it. His disappointment shrinks from all open confession; his resignation collects itself by such fine degrees that even my watchfulness fails to see the growth of it. Fifty times a day I feel the longing in me to throw my arms round his neck, and say: 'For God's sake, do anything to me, rather than treat me like this!' and fifty times a day the words are forced back into my heart by the cruel considerateness of his conduct; which gives me no excuse for speaking them. I thought I had suffered the sharpest pain that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> when <b>my</b> first husband laid his whip across my face. I thought I knew the worst that despair could do on the day when I knew that the other villain, the meaner villain still, had cast me off. Live and learn. There is sharper pain than I felt under Waldron's whip; there is bitterer despair than the despair I knew when Manuel deserted me.|$|R
60|$|My {{first phase}} was an immense sorrow for myself. It was a purely selfish emotion. You see I had been saving myself up, denying myself half {{the pride of}} life {{and most of its}} indulgence, {{drilling}} myself like a drill-sergeant, with my eyes on those now unattainable hills. Had I known it was to end so soon, I should have planned everything so differently. I lay in bed mourning my truncated existence. Then presently the sorrow broadened. They were so sorry, so genuinely sorry for me. And they considered me so much now. I had this and that they would never have given me before--the stateliest bedding, the costliest food. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> from <b>my</b> bed the suddenly disorganised house, the distressed friends, the new-born solicitude. Insensibly a realisation of enhanced importance came to temper my regrets for my neglected sins. The lost world, that had seemed so brilliant and attractive, dwindled steadily as the days of my illness wore on. I thought more of the world's loss, and less of my own.|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked at}} my bed. Bah! what {{was the use of}} going to bed? She was her own mistress. She was {{perfectly}} free to take her next walk to Browndown alone! and to place herself, for all I knew to the contrary, at the mercy of a dishonorable and designing man. What was I? Only her companion. I had no right to interfere--and yet, if anything happened, I should be blamed. It is so easy to say, [...] "You ought to have done something." [...] Whom could I consult? The worthy old nurse only held the position of servant. Could I address myself to the lymphatic lady with the baby in one hand, and the novel in the other? Absurd! her stepmother was not to be thought of. Her father? Judging by hearsay, I had not derived a favorable impression of the capacity of Reverend Finch for interfering successfully in a matter of this sort. However, he was her father; and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> way cautiously with him at first. Hearing Zillah moving about the corridor, I went out to her. In the course of a little gossip, I introduced the name of the master of the house. How was it I had not seen him yet? For an excellent reason. He had gone to visit a friend at Brighton. It was then Tuesday. He was expected back on [...] "sermon-day"--that is to say on Saturday in the same week.|$|E
60|$|The {{very thought}} of {{striking}} a loud, exploding match was unendurable to me, so strangely nervous did I feel. Or possibly {{it was a}} superstitious mood I had fallen into. It seemed to me {{at that moment that}} I had somehow drifted into a region of mystery, peopled only by unearthly, fantastic beings. The people I had supped with did not seem like creatures of flesh and blood. The small, dark countenance of Don Hilario, with its shifty glances and Mephistophelian smile; Demetria's pale, sorrowful face; and the sunken, insane eyes of her old, white-haired father--were all about me in the moonlight and amongst the tangled greenery. I dared not move; I scarcely breathed; the very weeds with their pale, dusky leaves were like things that had a ghostly life. And while I was in this morbid condition of mind, with that irrational fear momentarily increasing on me, I saw at a distance of about thirty yards a dark object, which seemed to move, fluttering in an uncertain way towards me. I gazed intently on it, but it was motionless now, and appeared like a black, formless shadow within the shade of the trees. Presently it came again towards me, and, passing into the clear moonlight, revealed a human figure. It flitted across the bright space and was lost in the shade of other trees; but it still approached, a waving, fluttering figure, advancing and receding, but always coming nearer. My blood turned cold in my veins; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> hair standing up on my head, until, unable to endure the terrible suspense longer, I jumped up from my seat. A loud exclamation of terror came from the figure, and then I saw that it was Demetria. I stammered out an apology for frightening her by jumping up, and, finding that I had recognised her, she advanced to me.|$|E
6000|$|I recall then in this {{connexion}} no {{moment of}} subjective intermittence, never {{one of those}} alarms as for a suspected hollow beneath one's feet, a felt ingratitude in the scheme adopted, under which confidence fails and opportunity seems but to mock. If the motive of [...] "The Wings of the Dove," [...] as I have noted, was to worry me at moments by a sealing-up of its face--though without prejudice to its again, of a sudden, fairly grimacing with expression--so in this other business I had absolute conviction and constant clearness to deal with; {{it had been a}} frank proposition, the whole bunch of data, installed on my premises like a monotony of fine weather. (The order of composition, in these things, I may mention, was reversed by the order of publication; the earlier written of the two books having appeared as the later.) Even under the weight of my hero's years <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> postulate firm; even under the strain of the difference between those of Madame de Vionnet and those of Chad Newsome, a difference liable to be denounced as shocking, I could still feel it serene. Nothing resisted, nothing betrayed, I seem to make out, in this full and sound sense of the matter; it shed from any side I could turn it to the same golden glow. I rejoiced in the promise of a hero so mature, who would give me thereby the more to bite into--since it's only into thickened motive and accumulated character, I think, that the painter of life bites more than a little. My poor friend should have accumulated character, certainly; or rather would be quite naturally and handsomely possessed of it, {{in the sense that he}} would have, and would always have felt he had, imagination galore, and that this yet wouldn't have wrecked him. It was immeasurable, the opportunity to [...] "do" [...] a man of imagination, for if THERE mightn't be a chance to [...] "bite," [...] where in the world might it be? This personage of course, so enriched, wouldn't give me, for his type, imagination in PREDOMINANCE or as his prime faculty, nor should I, in view of other matters, have found that convenient. So particular a luxury--some occasion, that is, for study of the high gift in SUPREME command of a case or of a career--would still doubtless come on the day I should be ready to pay for it; and till then might, as from far back, remain hung up well in view and just out of reach. The comparative case meanwhile would serve--it was only on the minor scale that I had treated myself even to comparative cases.|$|E
5000|$|Since childhood, Nyamza has {{continued}} to use dance {{as a means to}} interpret, cope with, and reconcile her life's events. When her mother was raped and murdered in 1999, dance gave her the inner strength to somehow face this scarring experience. Additionally, her mother's death greatly influenced the development of her abstract style of dancing, [...] "After <b>my</b> mother died, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> her in <b>my</b> dreams telling me to use my dance to tell real stories.

60|$|Then I {{wondered}} how long I had to live. I tried to examine myself. I felt my pulse. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not at first feel any pulse at all. Then, all of a sudden, it seemed to start off. I pulled out my watch and timed it. I made it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute. I tried to <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> heart. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> heart. It had stopped beating. I have since been induced {{to come to the}} opinion that it must have been there all the time, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it. I patted myself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and I went a bit round each side, and a little way up the back. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> or hear anything. I tried to look at my tongue. I stuck it out as far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried to examine it with the other. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only see the tip, {{and the only thing that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had scarlet fever.|$|R
6000|$|The spring nights {{which came}} to me there at Colony were of a quality quite new to me. The breeze, amiable and moist, was Southern, and the {{moonlight}} falling from the sky like a silent, all-enveloping cataract of silver, lay along the ground so mystically real that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> it with <b>my</b> hand. The air was at once tropic and Western, and this subtle blending of the North and the South, the strange and the familiar, appealed to me with such power that I wrote Zulime a statement of my belief that in becoming a part-owner in this land, I had assured for us both a happy and prosperous future. [...] "I shall come here every spring," [...] I declared, and {{in the glow of}} this enthusiasm, I purchased another farm of two hundred and forty acres and arranged with Seger for its management.|$|R
