5000|$|In both types, a small storage {{bottle of}} {{molecular}} hydrogen, H, leaks a controlled amount of gas into a <b>discharge</b> <b>bulb.</b> The molecules are dissociated in the <b>discharge</b> <b>bulb</b> into individual hydrogen atoms by an arc. This atomic hydrogen {{passes through a}} collimator and a magnetic state selector. The atoms are thereby selected for the desired state and passed on to a storage bulb. The storage bulb is roughly 20 cm high and 10 cm in diameter and made of quartz. Its inside is coated with Teflon, allowing many collisions of the atoms with the wall without perturbation of the atomic state, and slowing the recombination of the hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecules. A durable Teflon & bulb coating technology allows for over 20-year lifetime. The storage bulb is in turn inside a microwave cavity made from a precisely machined copper or silver-plated ceramic cylinder. This cavity is tuned to the [...] GHz resonance frequency of the atoms. A weak static magnetic field is applied parallel to the cavity axis by a solenoid to lift the degeneracy of the magnetic Zeeman sublevels. To decrease the influence of changing external magnetic fields on the transition line frequency and be compliant to electromagnetic interferences, the cavity is surrounded by several nested layers of shields.|$|E
50|$|The North {{lighthouse}} is 56 ft tall, slightly {{taller than}} the south one, and has a focal plane of 157 ft. It produces a quick white flash every 15 seconds, and was originally lit by a 75 mm petroleum vapour burner. Oil was lifted up from a small quay using a sled and winch, and then transported using a small railway (again winch-powered). The remains {{of this can be}} still seen, but it was abandoned in 1971 and the lighthouse now uses a <b>discharge</b> <b>bulb</b> fed from the island's main supply.

50|$|Aerolux gas <b>discharge</b> light <b>bulbs</b> {{contained}} {{low pressure}} gas, either neon or argon, or {{a mixture of}} the two. Also within the bulb were metal sculptures coated with phosphors. These phosphors fluoresced when excited by glow discharge. Because glow discharge occurs readily at 110-120 volts AC, one could use these bulbs in standard household lamps in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The large E39 [...] "Mogul" [...] and E40 [...] "Goliath" [...] base {{are used}} on street lights, and high-wattage lamps (such as a 100-/200-/300-watt three-way) and many high-intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>bulbs.</b> In areas {{following}} the U.S. National Electrical Code, general-use lamps over 300 W cannot use an E26 base and must instead use the E39 base, 300 W lamps may use either base. Medium Edison screw (MES) bulbs for 12 V are also produced for recreational vehicles. Large outdoor Christmas lights use an intermediate base, as do some desk lamps and many microwave ovens. Previously, emergency exit signs {{also tended to}} use the intermediate base, but U.S. and Canadian rules now require long-life and energy-efficient LED lamps, which can be purchased inside a bulb as a retrofit. A medium screw base should not carry more than 25 amperes current; this may limit the practical rating of low voltage lamps.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{methods are}} {{employed}} {{to find the}} nodes. [...] One is to use some type of voltage indicator, such as an RF voltmeter or light bulb, attached {{to a pair of}} contacts that slide up and down the wires. [...] When the bulb reaches a node, the voltage between the wires goes to zero, so the bulb goes out. If the indicator has too low an impedance it will disturb the standing wave on the line, so a high impedance indicator must be used; a regular incandescent bulb has too low a resistance. Lecher and early researchers used long thin Geissler tubes, laying the glass tube directly across the line. The high voltage of early transmitters excited a glow discharge in the gas. In modern times small neon bulbs are often used. One problem with using glow <b>discharge</b> <b>bulbs</b> is their high striking voltage makes it difficult to localize the exact voltage minimum. In precision wavemeters an RF voltmeter is used.|$|R
50|$|A large weapon-light is {{manufactured}} by Surefire; the HellFighter Weaponlight uses a 35 watt high intensity <b>discharge</b> (HID) <b>bulb</b> {{powered by a}} 12 volt car battery or by two BA-5590 military batteries. The bulb is shock-isolated, outputs about 3000 lumens and is mounted in a textured parabolic reflector that provides a beam that is optimized for throw, but also with additional spill light for peripheral illumination. It is bright enough to illuminate targets hundreds of yards away and {{is intended to be}} attached to a machine gun.|$|R
50|$|Like other {{relaxation}} oscillators, {{the neon}} bulb oscillator has poor frequency stability, {{but it can}} be synchronized (entrained) to an external periodic voltage applied in series with the neon bulb. Even if the external frequency is different from the natural frequency of the oscillator, the peaks of the applied signal can exceed the breakdown threshold of the <b>bulb,</b> <b>discharging</b> the capacitor prematurely, so that the period of the oscillator becomes locked to the applied signal.|$|R
2500|$|Tesla {{invented the}} Tesla coil during {{efforts to develop}} a [...] "wireless" [...] {{lighting}} system, with gas <b>discharge</b> light <b>bulbs</b> that would glow in an oscillating electric field from a high voltage, high frequency power source. [...] For a high frequency source Tesla powered a Ruhmkorff coil (induction coil) with his high frequency alternator. [...] He found that the core losses due to the high frequency current overheated the iron core in the Ruhmkorff coil and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings. [...] To fix this problem Tesla changed the design {{so that there was}} an air gap instead of insulating material between the windings, and made the iron core adjustable so it could be moved in or out of the coil [...] He eventually found the highest voltages could be produced when the iron core was omitted. [...] Tesla also found he needed to put the capacitor normally used in the Ruhmkorff circuit between his alternator and the coil's primary winding to avoid burning out the coil. By adjusting the coil and capacitor Tesla found he could take advantage of the resonance set up between the two to achieve even higher frequencies. He found that the highest voltages were generated when the [...] "closed" [...] primary circuit with the capacitor was in resonance with the [...] "open" [...] secondary winding.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to develop such greenhouse constructions and their exploitation technologies which would let to gain maximum harvest with minimal expenditure of electrical and heat energy. In order to reach the preceding statement, it {{is important}} to understand properly also the reaction of plants towards the artificial physical field and the impact of other external factors. For this reason an electrical scheme for the radiation of plants with spectral low-pressure bulbs of gas disruptive <b>discharge</b> and incandescent <b>bulbs</b> in dark heat source regime is offered. Also a device of plant radiation, heating and watering is developed where as the spectral luminescent light bulb ballast resistance in the technique of light for the first time a construction of closed water tank serves which simultaneously performs the function of heating apparatus. Examination is performed on the influence of optical radiation and temperature on the process of plant development...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} with {{an x-ray}} laser test models of how ions behave in plasmas, like {{those found in}} stars and laser fusion research. It takes a strong electric field to ionize atoms or ions {{in the creation of}} plasmas. These fields can be generated in lightning bolts (electric <b>discharges),</b> neon light <b>bulbs,</b> at the focus of a laser, and in the path of particle beams. It is perhaps less obvious that plasma itself can also have sufficiently strong fields within it to further ionize ions, since one might expect equal amounts of positive and negative charge would cancel each other out. In Physical Review Letters, Orlando Ciricosta at the University of Oxford, UK, and colleagues make use of the world’s brightest x-ray laser source, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator [1], to create a plasma dense enough to test models of how ionization occurs in matter approaching that found in astrophysical bodies or created in thermonuclear fusion [2]...|$|R
50|$|Permanent {{lights are}} {{typically}} powered with 115 volt house current. Placed on poles {{at the end}} of a dock or pier, the least expensive lights for outdoor use are security or flood lights using a mercury vapor, high pressure sodium vapor, metal-halide <b>discharge</b> or fluorescent <b>bulb.</b> They cost $25 to $100. While lower cost 115 V AC outdoor flood lights using standard tungsten (incandescent) or tungsten-halogen (quartz) bulbs can also be effective fish attractors, they are energy inefficient. It takes about five 100 watt tungsten lamps to deliver the light equivalent of one security lamp. Security lights are readily available from most hardware or farm supply stores. The fixture includes a photocell controller for automatic dusk-to-dawn operation and comes complete with an appropriate bulb. These lights are very bright (6-8 thousand lumens), efficient in converting electricity to light (operated daily for 8 hours, electrical supply costs $40-$100 per year), have long bulb lifetimes (24,000 hours) and stand up well to outside weather conditions. When used as a fishing light, light output can be redirected toward the water by installing a 5” X 10” piece of aluminum flashing or heavy foil bent into a half circle and placed next to the lamp's circular acrylic lens.|$|R
40|$|Cooling towers, {{because of}} their seeming simplicity, are usually orphans of the {{facilities}} operation. We are all aware that cooling towers are the step-children of the chemical process plant, electric power generating station, and refrigeration system. While engineers are pretty well convinced {{of the importance of}} their sophisticated equipment, and rightly so, they take the cooling towers and the cold water returning from them for granted. Design Conditions are specified for the particular requirements before a cooling tower is purchased. This relates to the volume of circulating water, hot water temperature on the tower, cold water <b>discharge,</b> and wet <b>bulb</b> temperature (consisting of ambient temperature and relative humidity). After the tower is put on the line and the cold water temperature or volume becomes inadequate, engineers look to solutions other than the obvious. While all cooling towers are purchased to function at 100 % of capability in accordance with the required Design Conditions, in actual on-stream employment, the level of operation many times is lower, downwards to as much as 50 % due to a variety of reasons: 1. The present service needed is now greater than the original requirements which the tower was purchased for. 2. ?Slippage? due to usage and perhaps deficient maintenance has reduced the performance of the tower over years of operation. 3. The installation could have been originally undersized due to the low bidder syndrome. 4. New plant expansion needs additional water volume and possibly colder temperatures off the tower...|$|R
