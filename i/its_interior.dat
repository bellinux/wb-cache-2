5|$|The {{surface of}} Metis is heavily cratered, dark, {{and appears to}} be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (presumably ice) from <b>its</b> <b>interior.</b>|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{eccentric}} post-capture orbit {{would have}} {{also resulted in}} tidal heating of <b>its</b> <b>interior,</b> which could have kept Triton fluid for a billion years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton's interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and circularization of the orbit.|$|E
5|$|Although the puffball was {{originally}} described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935, {{it was not}} published validly until 60 years later. The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta, from which it can be usually distinguished in the field by its less prominent pyramidal warts, and microscopically by the antler-like branches of its capillitium (thread-like material among the spores). Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while <b>its</b> <b>interior</b> flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, {{based on}} <b>its</b> <b>interior</b> chemistry, that the comet {{formed in the}} Uranus and Neptune Oort cloud region of the Solar System. A comet which forms farther from the Sun is {{expected}} to have greater amounts of ices with low freezing temperatures, such as ethane, which was present in Tempel 1. Astronomers believe that other comets with compositions similar to Tempel 1 are likely to have formed in the same region.|$|E

5|$|Energy {{from the}} Sun should have {{converted}} {{all traces of}} methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared {{to the age of}} the Solar System. This suggests that methane must be replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself. The ultimate origin of the methane in its atmosphere may be <b>its</b> <b>interior,</b> released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes.|$|E

5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat <b>its</b> <b>interior,</b> various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine {{the outer edge of the}} galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.|$|E

5|$|The new Revelin {{became the}} strongest {{of the city}} fortresses, {{safeguarding}} the eastern land approach to the city. Shaped {{in the form of}} an irregular quadrilateral with one of its sides descending towards the sea, it is protected by a deep ditch on the other. One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Ploče Gate, while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb.

Divided into three large vaulted rooms in <b>its</b> <b>interior,</b> Revelin became the administrative center of the Republic.|$|E
