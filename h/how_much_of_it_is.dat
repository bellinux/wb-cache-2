She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> on film, or <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Particular praise {{was given to}} the album's lyrical content and production quality. Ashleigh Kittle of Allmusic gave it 3 out of 5 stars, comparing the album's overall sound to that of Chapman, Caedmon's Call, and Phillips, Craig & Dean. Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine gave the album a B grade, praising the album as a [...] "promising freshman effort" [...] but critiquing its [...] "tendency to occasionally reflect its primary muse a bit too liberally". Belinda S. Ayers of Christian Broadcasting Network praised the album's lyrics and sound. Steve Best of Cross Rhythms gave Casting Crowns ten out of ten squares, saying, [...] "The passion of lead vocalist and youth pastor Hall jumps out of each set of lyrics, while Chapman's distinctive production touch...makes this a must listen album". While praising the album's overall production and lyrical content, Breimeier said the album [...] "too readily recalls the work of its producers, leaving us to wonder <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> really Casting Crowns" [...] – he gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars. The album received positive reviews from Brian Mansfield of USA Today, Robin Parrish of CMCentral.com, and Michael Herman of Christianity Today.|$|E

He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a [...] "by-product" [...] of his [...] "private poetry-workshop" [...] But the critic William Empson once said, [...] "I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [...] invented, let alone <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him.

[...] In the best medical centers, surgery corrects prolactin levels in 80% of patients with a serum prolactin less than 250nbsp&ng/ml. Even in patients with large tumors that cannot be completely removed, drug therapy may be able to return serum prolactin to the normal range after surgery. [...] Depending {{on the size of the}} tumor and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> removed, studies show that 20 to 50% will recur, usually within five years.|$|E

50|$|In {{the great}} {{compilations}} of ecclesiastical law that {{arose in the}} East since the 3rd century, the Church Orders many canons were attributed to Hippolytus, for example in the Canons of Hippolytus or the Constitutions through Hippolytus. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> this material is genuinely his, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> worked over, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> wrongly attributed to him, {{can no longer be}} determined beyond dispute, however a great deal was incorporated into the Fetha Negest, which once served as the constitutional basis of law in Ethiopia — where he is still remembered as Abulides. During the early 20th century the work known as The Egyptian Church Order was identified as the Apostolic Tradition and attributed to Hippolytus; nowaday this attribution is hotly contested.|$|R
6000|$|Think {{of it with}} me, for {{a moment}} before I go. That harvest of {{amethyst}} bells, over all Scottish and Irish and Cumberland hill and moorland; what substance is there in it, yearly gathered out of the mountain winds,--stayed there, as if the morning and evening clouds had been caught out of them and woven into flowers; 'Ropes of sea-sand'--but that is child's magic {218} merely, compared to the weaving of the Heath out of the cloud.

"Mr. Ireland {{gave up his}} {{position}} as manager of the English Provident: both {{he and his wife}} felt no doubt that on the whole, perhaps, there had been too much talk, too much scandal connected with their name, to be altogether advantageous to the bank. Moreover, Mr. Ireland's health was not so good as it had been. He has a pretty house now at Sittingbourne, and amuses himself during his leisure hours with amateur horticulture, and I, who alone in London besides the persons directly connected with this mysterious affair, know the true solution of the enigma, often wonder <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> known to the ex-manager of the English Provident Bank." ...|$|E

60|$|Now that a truth {{underlies}} such {{a theory}} as this, I am {{the last to}} deny. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the character of each man is inherited, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> depends on his actual bodily organization; <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> alas! on the circumstances <b>of</b> his youth; <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> changes with the mere physical change from youth to old age--who does not know all this, who has ever needed to fight for himself the battle of life? Only, I say, this is but half the truth; and these philosophers cannot state their half-truth, without employing the very words which they repudiate; without using the very personal pronouns, the I and me, the thou and thee, the he and him, to which they deny any real existence. Beside, I ask--Is the experience and {{the conclusion of the}} vast majority of all mankind to go for nothing? For if there be one point on which human beings have been, and are still, agreed, it is this--that each of them is, to his joy or his sorrow, an I; a separate person. And, I should have said, this conviction becomes stronger and stronger in each of them, the more human they become, civilized, and worthy of the respect and affection of their fellow-men.|$|R

60|$|The obvious {{truth is}} that the moment any matter has passed through the human mind it is finally and for ever spoilt for all {{purposes}} of science. It has become a thing incurably mysterious and infinite; this mortal has put on immortality. Even what we call our material desires are spiritual, because they are human. Science can analyse a pork-chop, and say <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> phosphorus and how much is protein; but science cannot analyse any man's wish for a pork-chop, and say <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hunger, how much custom, how much nervous fancy, how much a haunting love of the beautiful. The man's desire for the pork-chop remains literally as mystical and ethereal as his desire for heaven. All attempts, therefore, at a science of any human things, at a science of history, a science of folk-lore, a science of sociology, are by their nature not merely hopeless, but crazy. You can no more be certain in economic history that a man's desire for money was merely a desire for money than you can be certain in hagiology that a saint's desire for God was merely a desire for God. And this kind of vagueness in the primary phenomena of the study is an absolutely final blow to anything in the nature of a science. Men can construct a science with very few instruments, or with very plain instruments; but no one on earth could construct a science with unreliable instruments. A man might work out the whole of mathematics with a handful of pebbles, but not with a handful of clay which was always falling apart into new fragments, and falling together into new combinations. A man might measure heaven and earth with a reed, but not with a growing reed.|$|E

The whole came under the supervision of Washington; and the instrument, as submitted to the press, was in his handwriting, with many ultimate corrections and alterations. Washington had no pride of authorship; his object always was to effect the purpose in hand, and for that he occasionally invoked assistance, to ensure a plain and clear exposition of his thoughts and intentions. The address certainly breathes his spirit throughout, is in perfect accordance with his words and actions. It was published in September, in a Philadelphia paper called the Daily Advertiser.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{no means}} of knowing whether you are patient {{in the pursuit of}} this art; but I am {{inclined}} to think that you are not, and that you do not discipline yourself enough. When one is impelled to write this or that, one has still to consider: [...] "How much of this will tell for what I mean? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> my own wild emotion and superfluous energy--how much remains that is truly belonging to this ideal character and these ideal circumstances?" [...] It is in the laborious struggle to make this distinction, and in the determination to try for it, that the road to the correction of faults lies.

60|$|Such is the poetical account {{given by}} James {{of his love}} adventures in Windsor Castle. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{absolute}} fact, and how much the embellishment of fancy, it is fruitless to conjecture; let us not, however, reject every romantic incident as incompatible with real life, but let us sometimes take a poet at his word. I have noticed merely {{those parts of the}} poem immediately connected with the tower, and have passed over a large part which was in the allegorical vein, so much cultivated at that day. The language, of course, is quaint and antiquated, so that the beauty of many of its golden phrases will scarcely be perceived at the present day, but it is impossible not to be charmed with the genuine sentiment, the delightful artlessness and urbanity, which prevail throughout it. The descriptions of Nature too, with which it is embellished, are given with a truth, a discrimination, and a freshness, worthy of the most cultivated periods of the art.|$|E
6000|$|We shall, therefore, {{ultimately}} find {{it to be}} of incomparably {{greater importance}} to the nation in whose hands the thing is put, than <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> got; and that {{the character of the}} holders may be conjectured by the quality of the store; for such and such a man always asks for such and such a thing; nor only asks for it, but if it can be bettered, betters it: so that possession and possessor reciprocally act on each other, through the entire sum of national possession. The base nation, asking for base things, sinks daily to deeper vileness of nature and weakness in use; while the noble nation, asking for noble things, rises daily into diviner eminence in both; the tendency to degradation being surely marked by [...] "[Greek: ataxia];" [...] that is to say, (expanding the Greek thought), by carelessness as to the hands in which things are put, consequent dispute for the acquisition of them, disorderliness in the accumulation of them, inaccuracy in the estimate of them, and bluntness in conception as to the entire nature of possession.|$|E

And as Pegasus came thither so seldom in these latter years, and scarcely alighted there {{more than once in}} a lifetime, Bellerophon feared that he might grow an old man, and have no strength left in his arms nor courage in his heart, before the winged horse would appear.
