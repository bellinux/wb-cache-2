5|$|Paul {{joined a}} Manchester City side which {{had just been}} relegated to the Second Division, and were thus playing {{at the same level}} as Swansea. Paul made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 1950–51 season, a 4–2 victory against a Preston North <b>End</b> <b>side</b> {{featuring}} Tom Finney. Manchester City went ten matches unbeaten {{at the start of the}} season, until a 4–3 defeat at Doncaster Rovers, where City blew a 3–0 half-time lead. Paul played in all but one match that season, becoming club captain and helping his club win promotion, as runners-up behind champions Preston. Writer HD Davies, under his pen name Old International, attributed much of City's cohesive play over the season to the addition of Paul to the side.|$|E
5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West <b>End)</b> <b>side</b> inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} combat the short-passing threat, the championship-winning Preston North <b>End</b> <b>side</b> of 1888 devised a more {{defensive}} 2–3–5 formation (two defenders, three mid-fielders and five attackers), which would become the standard formation for many teams for {{the best part of}} the next 40 years. One of the half-backs was brought back into defence, which sat deeper than before, making the two defenders full-backs as opposed to three-quarter-backs. Their main job was to mark the opposition's inside forwards and cut out the short passes in mid-field. Furthermore, two forwards were brought back into midfield as half-backs to mark the opposition wingers and negate the pace threat. The remaining half-back became a centre-half, who would patrol the field, drifting from defence to attack as he saw fit. This left two wingers up front (outside-right and outside-left), along with two inside-forwards (inside-right and inside-left) and a centre-forward.|$|E

25|$|The {{station has}} {{undergone}} several improvements in recent years, with the footbridge (which links both entrances and all platforms) improved by {{removal of the}} central barrier to allow use of its full width, new lifts {{for the use of}} disabled persons, as well as newly painted and brightly illuminated waiting rooms. In recent years the two-track reversing sidings (used for turning Bakerloo line trains and occasionally for DC line trains) located between the tracks of the DC line at the northern <b>end</b> <b>side</b> of the station have been replaced by a single siding and the curve at the Down end of platform 2 eased using the space vacated by the removed siding; this in practice leaves the siding unavailable for use by LO trains except when Bakerloo trains are not running. Harrow and Wealdstone (with Willesden Junction) is one of the two stations on the DC line which can be used for turning or stabling trains clear of the running lines during reduced or disrupted services although trains can be reversed using crossovers at more stations.|$|E
500|$|The word anekāntavāda is a {{compound}} of two Sanskrit words: anekānta and vāda. The word anekānta itself is composed of three root words, [...] "an" [...] (not), [...] "eka" [...] (one) and [...] "anta" [...] (<b>end,</b> <b>side),</b> together it connotes [...] "not one ended, sided", [...] "many-sidedness", or [...] "manifoldness". The word vāda means [...] "doctrine, way, speak, thesis". The term anekāntavāda is translated by scholars as the doctrine of [...] "many-sidedness", [...] "non-onesidedness", or [...] "many pointedness".|$|E
500|$|Apple Records {{released}} Living in the Material World {{at the end}} of May 1973, {{with the}} title track sequenced to <b>end</b> <b>side</b> one in the original, LP format. [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] followed another Harrison composition reflecting on his years with the Beatles, [...] "Who Can See It". In keeping with the album content, Tom Wilkes's design for the record's face labels contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world, by featuring a painting of Krishna and his warrior prince Arjuna on side one and a picture of a Mercedes stretch limousine on the reverse. The painting of Krishna and Arjuna came from a version of the Bhagavad Gita published by Prabhupada.|$|E

2500|$|Corps' {{engineers}} initially {{believed that}} {{water in the}} 17th Street Canal overtopped the floodwall, scoured behind the wall, and caused it to collapse. However, three local fire captains confirmed with video footage that the floodwall had failed before water reached the top. [...] The floodwall breached on the lower (New Orleans West <b>End)</b> <b>side</b> inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|The new St Paul's {{church was}} {{designed}} as a nave with an extended semicircular-planned chancel attached to its east end, a side porch at its west <b>end,</b> <b>side</b> vestries for organ and choir, a belfry and attached buttress piers. White banding on facebrick (known as the [...] "blood and bandage" [...] style) featured both internally and externally. Up to 250 people could be accommodated within the church in addition to the choir. Provision was also made for a lych gate and rubble stone wall (at the time claimed to be the first for a church in Queensland). Lych gates, sheltered gateways at the entrance of a church ground, traditionally where clergy met corpses and conducted part of a funeral service, became increasingly popular elements of Australian Anglican church design during the interwar period, often dedicated as war memorials. The [...] "Seek and ye shall find" [...] inscription over the St Paul's gateway was carved by Reverend Neal.|$|E
50|$|A wooden station {{building}} was provided at opening. Opposite {{the station was}} a loop siding, longer than the platform, and behind the station was a dead <b>end</b> <b>siding.</b> Around 1887-1888, the siding was extended, and a goods shed provided.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} year of operation, the station sold 11,510 tickets to Camperdown for a total revenue of £11,157. At the peak of {{operations}} the station had a four road yard, today it has a single dead <b>end</b> <b>siding.</b>|$|R

60|$|Next day, when Master Wingfield and his {{following}} came in, {{none the}} better for having gone to Powhatan's village, all understood {{that it would have}} been wiser had they listened to my master when he counseled them to take exercise at arms, and straightway all the men were set about making a fort with a palisade, which last is the name for a fence built of logs set on <b>end,</b> <b>side</b> by side, in the ground, and rising so high that the enemy may not climb over it. This work took all the time of the laborers until the summer was gone, and in the meanwhile the gentlemen made use of the stores left us by the fleet, until there remained no more than one half pint of wheat to each man for a day's food.|$|E
60|$|So we struck sparks {{on to the}} tinder, {{and from}} them lit the two lamps of seal oil. Then I crept into the hole, Freydisa {{following}} me, to find myself in a narrow passage built of rough stones and roofed with flat slabs of water-worn rock. This tunnel, save for a little dry soil that had sifted into it through the cracks between the stones, was quite clear. We crawled along it without difficulty till {{we came to the}} tomb chamber, which was in the centre of the mound, but at a higher level than the entrance. For the passage sloped upwards, doubtless to allow for drainage. The huge stones with which it was lined and roofed over, were not less than ten feet high and set on <b>end</b> <b>side</b> by side. One of these upright stones was that designed for the door. Had it been in place, we could not have entered the chamber without great labour and the help of many men; but, as it chanced, either it had never been set up after the burial, or this was done so hastily that it had fallen.|$|E
6000|$|From {{the window}} of the dining-room, at that moment, they heard the {{carriage}} drive up. Miss Birdseye lived at the South End; the distance was considerable, and Miss Chancellor had ordered a hackney-coach, it being {{one of the advantages of}} living in Charles Street that stables were near. The logic of her conduct was none of the clearest; for if she had been alone she would have proceeded to her destination by the aid of the street-car; not from economy (for she had the good fortune not to be obliged to consult it to that degree), and not from any love of wandering about Boston at night (a kind of exposure she greatly disliked), but by reason of a theory she devotedly nursed, a theory which bade her put off invidious differences and mingle in the common life. She would have gone on foot to Boylston Street, and there she would have taken the public conveyance (in her heart she loathed it) to the South End. Boston was full of poor girls who had to walk about at night and to squeeze into horse-cars in which every sense was displeased; and why should she hold herself superior to these? Olive Chancellor regulated her conduct on lofty principles, and this is why, having to-night the advantage of a gentleman's protection, she sent for a carriage to obliterate that patronage. If they had gone together in the common way she would have seemed to owe it to him that she should be so daring, and he belonged to a sex to which she wished to be under no obligations. Months before, when she wrote to him, it had been with the sense, rather, of putting him in debt. As they rolled toward the South <b>End,</b> <b>side</b> by side, in a good deal of silence, bouncing and bumping over the railway-tracks very little less, after all, than if their wheels had been fitted to them, and looking out on either side at rows of red houses, dusky in the lamp-light, with protuberant fronts, approached by ladders of stone; as they proceeded, with these contemplative undulations, Miss Chancellor said to her companion, with a concentrated desire to defy him, as a punishment for having thrown her (she couldn't tell why) into such a tremor: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract：Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is {{a primary}} air pollutant {{as an indicator of}} air quality released from motor vehicle combustion. A comparative study of the distributions of CO concentration with no heat source in two tunnel models open and closed at both <b>end</b> <b>sides</b> is simulated with a commercial CFD code. The tunnel models are used to investigate the CO concentration distributions at three Reynolds numbers, which are computed by the inlet velocities of 0. 3, 0. 6 and 1. 0 m/s. For a better tunnel design, the CFD predictive approaches are available in qualitatively studying the distributions of CO concentration. In the case of the tunnel open at both <b>end</b> <b>sides</b> in sixty seconds, the total CO concentrations are approximately twenty eight percent higher than those in the closed case...|$|R
