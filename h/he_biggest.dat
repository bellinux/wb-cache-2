In this book chapter John Talbott struggles to discern and distill the major clinical messages that are embedded in the available scientific evidence. His approach is sensible and grounded. If we examine Dr. Talbott’s visionary message and ap-proach today, what do we see? We scrutinize his work with his blessing, because an implicit part of his exhortation is to keep reexamining the evidence.
