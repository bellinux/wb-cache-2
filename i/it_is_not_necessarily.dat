5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) {{to see where the}} disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to their}} rarity fancy-colored {{diamonds}} are also imitated, and zircon can serve this purpose too. Applying heat treatment to brown zircon can create several bright colors: these are most commonly sky-blue, golden yellow, and red. Blue zircon is very popular, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> color stable; prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light (including the UV component in sunlight) tends to bleach the stone. Heat treatment also imparts greater brittleness to zircon and characteristic inclusions.|$|E

25|$|According to Gwendolyn O’ Neal, {{the author}} of African American Aesthetics of Dress (1997), she states that “while an African-American {{aesthetic}} of dress is neither African nor American, it is shaped by unique ‘cultural’ experiences resulting from being of African descent and living in America”. The famous rapper, Jay Z also echoed the same words O’Neal talks about. In a Black Book Magazine interview Jay Z made, he once defended the upper-class tastes of fashion in the hip hop culture as ‘living it on our terms, {{instead of trying to}} emulate an elite lifestyle’ with the wearing of high-net-worth fashion house brands. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> because of conspicuous consumption that the hip hop lifestyle brought in these high end fashion products.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the first}} past the post system {{means that the}} number of MPs elected may not reflect the overall popular vote share across the parties. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the party with the largest share of the popular vote that ends up with the largest number of MPs. (See details of the {{elections}} in 1951 and February 1974) Since 1935 no party has achieved more than 50% of the popular vote in a British general election. The voting system favours parties with relatively concentrated support: a widely distributed vote leaves a party at risk of getting a large vote share but doing poorly in terms of numbers of seats (as the SDP-Liberal Alliance did in the 1980s), whereas parties with localised votes can win seats with a relatively small share of the vote.|$|E
25|$|It was {{probably}} {{around this time}} that Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered St Paul's Cathedral. Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied the architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of Bernini, the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time. Returning from Paris, {{he made his first}} design for St Paul's. A week later, however, the Great Fire destroyed two-thirds of the city. Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted. With his appointment as King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies' halls. Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of 51 churches; however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> true to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design.|$|E
