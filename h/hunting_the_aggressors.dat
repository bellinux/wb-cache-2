He quickly pull his left arm out while still holding onto it. He pushes him down with his body, using his right knee to push him forward and off-balance. He then grabs his right wrist with the right hand and pulls it outward. His belly is now down on the mat, legs flat. <b>The</b> <b>aggressor</b> is above <b>the</b> opponent with his chest several inches above his back. <b>The</b> <b>aggressor's</b> left knee holds up most of his own body weight. <b>The</b> <b>aggressor's</b> right leg is extended between his legs with the ball of the foot on <b>the</b> floor. <b>The</b> <b>aggressor</b> curls his wrist, then encloses the opponent's left arm inside <b>the</b> <b>aggressor's</b> left elbow joint. With <b>the</b> <b>aggressor's</b> chest is resting on the opponent's left elbow, he uses his body to push his left shoulder into his ear, using both legs for leverage. He slowly moves his feet into a walking position while crouched, walking in a circle and rolling the opponent over onto his back without releasing his arms. The pin is finished by <b>the</b> <b>aggressor</b> leaning on his knees with his chest toward the floor.|$|R

50|$|Postconflict anxiety {{has been}} {{reported}} in crab-eating macaques that have acted as <b>the</b> <b>aggressor.</b> After a conflict within a group, <b>the</b> <b>aggressor</b> appears to scratch itself at a higher rate than before the conflict. Though the scratching behavior cannot definitely be termed as an anxious behavior, evidence suggests this is <b>the</b> case. An <b>aggressor’s</b> scratching decreases significantly after reconciliation. This suggests reconciliation rather than a property of the conflict is the cause of reduction in scratching behavior. Though these results seem counterintuitive, the anxiety of <b>the</b> <b>aggressor</b> appears to have a basis in the risks of ruining cooperative relationships with the opponent.|$|R

5000|$|Subversion and defection: Subversion is the [...] "undermining or {{detachment}} of the loyalties of significant {{political and social}} groups within the victimized state, and their transference to the political or ideological causes of the aggressor".

Furthermore, {{the formation of a}} counter-elite, made up of influential individuals and key leaders, within the victim state establishes the legitimacy and permanency of a new regime. Defection is the transference of allegiance of key individuals and leaders to <b>the</b> <b>aggressor's</b> camp. <b>The</b> individual could relocate or stay-in-place in the victim country, continually influencing local issues and events in <b>the</b> <b>aggressor's</b> favor.

A move of <b>the</b> <b>aggressor</b> is {{to select a}} vertex v of G. A move of the defender is to move tokens located on vertices in NG(v) each along one incident edge. The goal of the defender is to maintain the set of occupied vertices independent while the goal of <b>the</b> <b>aggressor</b> is to make this impossible. We consider {{the maximum number of}} tokens for which <b>the</b> <b>aggressor</b> can not win in a strategic and an adaptive version of the game.

40|$|The ‘integrated hypothesis’ {{predicts that}} {{reconciliation}} (the post-conflict friendly interaction between former opponents observed in various group-living species) functions to reduce anxiety {{and the risk}} of aggression from the former opponent or a bystander {{in the aftermath of a}} conflict. It also predicts that relationship quality between opponents affects the occurrence of reconciliation and modulates the anxious response of the opponents after a conflict. Because of the asymmetric nature of aggressive interactions, the cost of aggression is likely to differ between the victim and <b>the</b> <b>aggressor.</b> <b>The</b> aim of this study was to test the predictions of the ‘integrated hypothesis’ independently for the victim and <b>the</b> <b>aggressor</b> of a conflict. We collected data on two wild groups of Barbary macaques. This study represents, to our knowledge, the first systematic test of the integrated hypothesis on wild, non-provisioned animals. Victims of aggression were at a greater risk of receiving aggression from the former opponent or a bystander after a conflict and showed elevated anxiety. We found no such costs for <b>the</b> <b>aggressor.</b> Reconciliation reduced anxiety in the victim but did not reduce their risk of receiving aggression. Finally, relationship quality affected the occurrence of reconciliation but did not modulate post-conflict anxiety. The results of our study show that the costs of aggression are asymmetrically distributed between the victim and <b>the</b> <b>aggressor.</b> Such differences are likely to lead to different social tactics used by the victim and <b>the</b> <b>aggressor</b> in <b>the</b> aftermath of a conflict...|$|R
