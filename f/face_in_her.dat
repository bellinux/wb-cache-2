25|$|Genie's father fed Genie {{as little}} as {{possible}} and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only baby food, cereal, Pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced her brother, spooned food into her mouth as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough the person feeding her rubbed her <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> food. These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her. In early 1972 Genie's mother told researchers that at night, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 PM, woke up for a few minutes, and fell back asleep for an additional 6 hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.|$|E
500|$|Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet [...] "had {{the thing}} that you look for" [...] and that there was [...] "a quality in her <b>face,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eyes," [...] that he [...] "just knew people would be ready to go the {{distance}} with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, [...] "She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [...] that's not going to happen." [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 20-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as [...] "an Audrey Hepburn type" [...] and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, [...] "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." [...] Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, [...] "From Your Rose", and lobbied him by phone. [...] "You don't understand!" [...] she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. [...] "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.|$|E

2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of [...] "he thought {{her to be a}} harlot; for she had covered her face," [...] the Gemara {{questioned}} how that could be so, for the Rabbis considered covering one's face an act of modesty. Rabbi Eleazar explained that Tamar had covered her <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> father-in-law's house (and thus Judah had never seen her face and did not recognize her), for Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan that every daughter-in-law who is modest in her father-in-law's house merits that kings and prophets should issue from her. In support of that proposition, the Gemara noted that kings descended from Tamar through David. And prophets descended from Tamar, as [...] says, [...] "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz," [...] and Rabbi Levi taught that there is a tradition that Amoz was the brother of Amaziah the King of Judah, and thus a descendant of David and thus of Tamar..|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is an array of love songs, with songs such as [...] "My Boy" [...] and [...] "Girl" [...] portraying Duffy in a {{protective}} manner, with respect to her lover. On [...] "Breath Away", Duffy laments that her lover is [...] "taking her breath away." [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] questions the difficulties involved with falling in love. Elsewhere, Duffy also took inspiration from her own life experiences. [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] was subconsciously written about Duffy's friend who [...] "lost her mum aged ten". Duffy continued, [...] "she told me they played [...] "Unchained Melody" [...] at her mum's funeral. I now realise my lyric comes from seeing my friend at the school disco, shaking, her <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands, while the other kids were smooching to this song". The following track, [...] "Keeping My Baby" [...] was written in a similar way, as Duffy only released the song is {{about the fact that}} [...] "one aunt told her she'd end up a single mother on benefits", as it is [...] "sung {{from the point of view}} of a pregnant girl".|$|E
2500|$|On 10 January 1889, she {{was given}} the habit and {{received}} the name Thérèse of the Child Jesus. On 8 September 1890, Thérèse took her vows. The ceremony of taking the veil followed on the 24th, when she added to her name in religion, [...] "of the Holy Face", a title which was to become increasingly important {{in the development and}} character of her inner life. In his [...] "A l'ecole de Therese de Lisieux: maitresse de la vie spirituelle, [...] "Bishop Guy Gaucher emphasizes that Therese saw the devotions to the Child Jesus and to the Holy Face as so completely linked that she signed herself [...] "Therese de l'Enfant Jesus de la Sainte Face"—Therese of the Child Jesus of the Holy <b>Face.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> poem [...] "My Heaven down here", composed in 1895, Therese expressed the notion that by the divine union of love, the soul takes on the semblance of Christ. By contemplating the sufferings associated with the Holy Face of Jesus, she felt she could become closer to Christ. She wrote the words [...] "Make me resemble you, Jesus!" [...] on a small card and attached a stamp with an image of the Holy Face. She pinned the prayer in a small container over her heart.|$|E

The two reminisce about the [...] "Angel of Music" [...] stories that her late father used to tell them and Christine confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing ("Little Lotte"). Raoul indulges what he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When Raoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the jealous Phantom's voice and she entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom obliges by appearing as a ghostly, partially masked <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mirror ("The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)"). Believing {{him to be the}} Angel of Music sent by her deceased father, Christine is irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her down into the cellars of the Opéra house. The two then board a small boat and cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair ("The Phantom of the Opera"). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her. When he reveals a mirror that reflects an image of her in a wedding dress, the figure in the mirror gestures to Christine and she faints.

When the Yuan {{brothers}} were exhausted from their wars against each other, Cao Cao attacked and defeated them, swiftly conquering the territories {{that used to be}} controlled by the Yuans. In 204, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shang at the Battle of Ye and his forces occupied the city. Cao Cao's son, Cao Pi, entered Yuan Shao's residence and met Lady Liu (Yuan Shao's widow) and Lady Zhen. Lady Zhen was so terrified that she buried her <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother-in-law's lap. Cao Pi said, [...] "What's going on, Madam Liu? Ask that lady to lift up her head!" [...] Cao Pi was very impressed and entranced by Lady Zhen's beauty when he saw her. His father allowed him to marry her later. Another account of this incident stated that Lady Liu and Lady Zhen were in Yuan Shang's residence when Cao Pi entered. Lady Zhen's hair was dishevelled and she was crying behind her mother-in-law. When Cao Pi asked, Lady Liu told him the woman behind her was Yuan Xi's wife. Cao Pi was so entranced by Lady Zhen's beauty that he married her and treated her well. Yuan Xi was still alive at the time. Yuan Shang came to join him after his defeat by Cao Cao. In 207, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Xi, Yuan Shang and their Wuhuan allies at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, after which they fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang. Gongsun Kang feared that they would become a threat to him, so he lured them into a trap, executed them, and sent their heads to Cao Cao.|$|E
