40|$|The quantum {{mechanics}} of closed {{systems such as}} the universe is formulated using an extension of familiar probability theory that incorporates negative probabilities. Probabilities must be positive for sets of alternative <b>histories</b> <b>that</b> are the basis of fair settleable bets. However, in {{quantum mechanics}} there are sets of alternative <b>histories</b> <b>that</b> can be described but which cannot {{be the basis for}} fair settleable bets. Members of such sets can be assigned extended probabilities that are sometimes negative. A prescription for extended probabilities is introduced that assigns extended probabilities to all <b>histories</b> <b>that</b> can be described, fine grained or coarse grained, members of decoherent sets or not. All probability sum rules are satisfied exactly. Sets of <b>histories</b> <b>that</b> are recorded to sufficient precision are the basis of settleable bets. This formulation is compared with the decoherent (consistent) histories formulation of quantum theory. Prospects are discussed for using this formulation to provide testable alternatives to quantum theory or further generalizations of it.
