In this paper, the existence of cold electron beam-like components accompanying EQM waves is considered based on waveform and statistical analyses. Linear dispersion analyses using realistic plasma parameters revealed that the cold electron beams cause destabilization of electron acoustic waves at frequencies consistent with those of observed EQM waves. The results of observations and linear analyses suggest that EQM waves are generated by the destabilization of the electron acoustic mode.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{substrate}} is biased to a negative voltage (few KV's), the resultant electric field drives electrons away from {{the substrate}} in the time scale of the inverse electron plasma frequency ωe−1 ( [...] ~ l0−9 sec). Thus an ion matrix Debye sheath which is depleted of electrons forms around it. The negatively biased substrate will accelerate the ions within a time scale of the inverse <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency</b> ωi−1 ( [...] ~ 10−6 sec). This ion movement lowers the ion density in the bulk, which causes the sheath-plasma boundary to expand in order to sustain the applied potential drop,in the process exposing more ions. The plasma sheath expands until either a steady-state condition is reached, which is called Child Langmuir law limit; or the high voltage is switched off {{as in the case}} of Pulsed DC biasing. Pulse biasing is preferred over DC biasing because it creates less damage during the pulse ON time and neutralization of unwanted charges accumulated on the wafer in the afterglow period (i.e. after the pulse has ended). In case of pulsed biasing the TON time of the pulse is generally kept at 20-40 µs, while the TOFF is kept at 0.5-2 ms i.e. a duty cycle of 1-8%. The power supply used is in range of 500 V to hundreds of KV and the pressure in the range of 1-100 mTorr. This is the basic principle of the operation of immersion type PIII.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This topic, new {{to basic}} {{nonlinear}} plasma physics, {{is related to}} and inspired by an important recent result in laser-plasma interaction [1]. This result has been related to the so-called SEAS process [2](Stimulated Electron Acoustic Scattering). Vlasov code simulation studies on our efforts to drive up such waves with an imposed (ponderomotive) driver of limited duration show that long-lived travelling wave excitations (well below the electron <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency</b> and with phase velocities comparable to the electron thermal velocity) only survive {{only if they are}} nonlinear and not too weak, with considerable harmonic phase-locked content. We have named these Kinetic Electrostatic Electron Nonlinear waves and find that that (in contrast to previous assumptions) the production of KEEN excitations is not particularly resonant. They thus do not deserve the adjective "acoustic", since they can be driven over a considerable range of velocities.

In a few cases, enhanced ion acoustic wave intensities have been observed in direct association with abrupt increases in the anisotropy of the solar wind electron distribution. This relationship strongly suggests that the ion acoustic waves detected by Helios far from the earth are produced by an electron heat flux instability, as was suggested by Forslund.

The initial temperatures of the electrons and the 400 times heavier ions are equal. Shocks form on electron time scales at Mach numbers between 1. 7 and 2. 2.

This potential pre-heats the electrons ahead of the shock even in the absence of beam instabilities and decouples the electron temperature in the foreshock ahead of the shock from the one in the far upstream plasma. The effective Mach number of the shock is reduced by this electron heating.

40|$|This thesis {{constitutes}} {{a study of}} micron-sized particle behaviour in low-pressure radio <b>frequency</b> (RF) laboratory <b>plasmas</b> and of the plasma sheath in which these particles were suspended. A summary of the theoretical aspects of dust in a plasma includes reviews of the mechanisms behind {{the formation of the}} plasma sheath, development of a novel approach to the determination of the limiting RF amplitude at which the sheath will collapse, and a discussion of charging theories for isolated probes in the plasma and plasma sheath. Forces that act on dust suspended in the plasma sheath, including forces on isolated dust grains and the interparticulate forces within plasma crystals are then addressed. A novel theory of damped dust oscillations in the plasma sheath is developed. The existence of a harmonic potential well is postulated to explain the suspension of the dust. It is shown that the analysis of dust trajectories can lead to the determination of a number of dust parameters, including the drag force and charge on the dust. However the theory requires knowledge of the potential function in the sheath to obtain quantitative results. A numerical model is then developed to obtain the potential functions required by the oscillation theory. It describes a collisionless to moderately collisional plasma sheath driven by low to moderate RF amplitudes at frequencies between the electron and <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Output from the model includes the potential, field, charge density, carrier densities, and ion speed as functions of height above the electrode. Parameter variation is shown to affect the model output in the expected manner. The numerical model shows that the potential function was very nearly parabolic over the entire sheath. Analysis of eight independent models demonstrates that this parabolic result was general. Finally, the experimental apparatus and procedure used to determine the dust charge and drag on suspended dust of a variety of sizes are fully described. Two methods for charge determination are discussed, one involving analysis of damped dust oscillations and the other involving the balance of forces on the dust. Results are shown to agree well with each other, with those of other researchers, and with theory.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the lower-hybrid drift instability(LHDI) in a thin Harris current sheet with a guide field. This includes three-dimensional analytical and numerical analyses using the gyrokinetic electron, fully-kinetic ion(GeFi) description, which are compared with results from the Vlasov approach and simulations. Previous fully-kinetic studies solve the electron Valsov equation by integrating along the unperturbed phase-space orbits, including the complete electron-cyclotron motion. The LHDI satisfies ω ce and k perp ρ e ∼ 1, where ω ce and ρ e are the electron cyclotron frequency and Larmor radius, respectively, and k perp & is the wavevector perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field. By treating the electron response with gyrokinetic theory, the fast cyclotron motion is removed which greatly simplifies the derivation of the LHDI eigenvalue equations. This allows a more comprehensive LHDI analysis, which is carried out over the entire domain of unstable wavevectors. To our knowledge, an extensive scan of the operative domain of the LHDI in current sheets with a guide field has never been done. The results will show that two types of electromagnetic LHDIs are active in the current sheet. The Type A LHDI is generally consistent with the existing theoretical descriptions of the LHDI, namely, quasi-electrostatic modes localized near the current sheet edges with k ρ e ∼ 1, k || = 0, and ω ^ 2 ∼ ω pi ^ 2 /(1 +ω pe ^ 2 / ω ce ^ 2) $, where ω pe and ω pi are the electron and <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>frequencies,</b> respectively. However, we will show that in sufficiently thin current sheets, i. e. strong equilibrium drifts, the Type A LHDI is destabilized by finite k || in the short wavelength domain, kρ ce > 0. 5. This destabilization increases the range of propagation angles, k || /k perp, for which the modes are operative, which reduces the localizing and stabilizing effects of magnetic shear. The dominant Type A modes are localized near the current sheet edge, z ∼ 1. 5 L, due to the stabilizing resonant dissipation of the electron grad B drift, which is strongest near the current sheet center. At longer wavelengths, k^ 2 ρ e ρ i ∼ 1, a second group of instabilities arise, which we define as Type B LHDIs. The Type B LHDIs are operative for a large range of propagation angles, and are suppressed when the electron grad B drift is removed. The dominant Type B instabilities are localized near the current sheet center, z ∼ 0. 2 L, with moderate k || /k perp and significant magnetic field perturbations. The Type B LHDIs resemble fluctuations observed in nature, and simulations, which have undergone limited analytical analysis. These modes are of general relevance to the evolution of thin current sheets, and may contribute to collisionless magnetic reconnection theory as a source of anomalous resistivity...|$|R
