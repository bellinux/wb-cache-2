5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. <b>Five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation {{that there may have}} been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders' {{management}} proposed {{playing a}} 2005 regular season match in Melbourne when Jade Stadium was unavailable. Although <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> unions within the Crusaders region supported having {{the regular season}} game in Melbourne, the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) vetoed the proposal. In 2006, the Crusaders did play a pre-season match in Melbourne against the Western Force at Olympic Park Stadium. They did {{the same in the}} 2008 preseason as well, also against the Force.|$|E

5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed that <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphians {{elected a}} seventeen-member city council in 1955, with ten members {{representing}} districts of the city, {{and the remaining}} seven being elected at-large. For the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates, and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> seats, leaving two for the minority party. The Democrats' citywide dominance continued into the city council races, as they retained control of nine of ten districts and five of seven at-large seats.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian uprisings {{were two}} major and three smaller uprisings by the Prussians, {{one of the}} Baltic tribes, against the Teutonic Knights {{that took place in}} the 13th century during the Prussian Crusade. The crusading {{military}} order, supported by the Popes and Christian Europe, sought to conquer and convert the pagan Prussians. In the first ten years of the crusade <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> major Prussian clans fell under the control of the less numerous Teutonic Knights. However, the Prussians rose against their conquerors on five occasions.|$|E

5|$|The {{performance}} was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood {{and most of}} the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> movements on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|Under the new charter, Philadelphians {{elected a}} seventeen-member city council in 1951, with ten members {{representing}} districts of the city, {{and the remaining}} seven being elected at-large. By {{the rules of the}} limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result that the majority party could only take <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> seats, leaving two for the minority party. The Democrats' citywide triumph continued into the city council races, as they took nine of ten districts and five of seven at-large seats.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. By {{the rules}} of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E

5|$|While Sawyer {{was serving}} overseas, the reform {{coalition}} swept the Democrats into power in Philadelphia {{for the first}} time in 67 years. When he returned to Philadelphia, Clark asked him to run for an at-large seat on City Council in 1955. By the rules of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only choose five. The result was that the majority party could take only <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> seats, leaving two for the minority party. Sawyer was elected to one such seat and served a single four-year term. In that position, he sponsored legislation to establish the city's One Percent for Fine Arts program, which required one percent of the cost of construction projects in Center City to be spent on public art. He also worked for the creation of a Police Review Board. City Council did not pass that bill, but Mayor James Tate later created the board through an executive order.|$|E
5|$|After ranking 17th of 48 {{clubs in}} the Football League North in 1942–43, York progressed through the War Cup {{qualifying}} stages, reaching the semi-final of a major cup competition for the first time. They were beaten 4–1 over two legs by Sheffield Wednesday. In the 1943–44 Football League North, the team finished 31st of 50 clubs, and after qualifying for the War Cup knock-out stages were eliminated 7–2 over two legs by Bradford Park Avenue in the second round. York experienced selection problems in 1944–45 with many players leaving for war service; after ranking 42nd of 54 {{clubs in the}} Football League North, they then failed {{to qualify for the}} War Cup knock-out stages. They extended their programme by competing in the Tyne, Wear and Tees Cup. Although hostilities had finished by the start of 1945–46, there was insufficient time for the Football League to restore its usual competitions. York finished midtable in the Third Division North (East) {{in the first half of}} the season, before reaching the second round of the Third Division North (East) Cup after qualifying through the group stages. The FA Cup resumed this season, and for the first and only time ties were played on a two-legged basis. York reached the fourth round, at which point they were beaten 11–1 on aggregate by Sheffield Wednesday. York made a profit in <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> seasons played during the war.|$|E

In the first game of the 2006 National League Division Series against the Dodgers, Mota was the winning pitcher when he pitched two innings, although he blew a 4–1 lead by giving up three runs and allowing the Dodgers to tie the game. Mota pitched two scoreless innings in the Mets' series-winning 9–5 victory over the Dodgers in Game 3. In the 2006 National League Championship Series, Mota appeared in <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> games in the series. He blew a lead in an eventual Game 2 loss, but he did not give up a run in the other four games as the Mets lost to St. Louis in seven games. On October 30, he filed for free agency.|$|E
