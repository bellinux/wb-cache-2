5|$|The 1966 playoff {{included}} three players <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus,</b> Tommy Jacobs and Gay Brewer. Nicklaus won the playoff {{with a round}} of 70, Jacobs finished 2nd with a 72 and Brewer finished 3rd with a 78.|$|E
5|$|In a poll {{of sports}} fans {{conducted}} by ABCSports, Thorpe was voted the Greatest Athlete of the Twentieth Century out of 15 other athletes including Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Wayne Gretzky, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus,</b> and Michael Jordan. In 2015, proposed designs for the 2018 Native American dollar coin featuring Thorpe were released.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, {{the winner}} of the {{previous}} year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner {{at the end of the}} tournament. In 1966, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself. When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 the Masters began {{presenting}} an award, {{known as}} the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur {{and then go on}} to win the Masters as a professional. These players are Cary Middlecoff, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus,</b> Ben Crenshaw, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Sergio García.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Arnold Palmer {{took over}} as the honorary starter. Palmer also had the honor in 2008 and 2009. At the 2010 and 2011 Masters Tournaments, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> joined Palmer as an honorary co-starter for the event. In 2012, Gary Player joined them. Palmer {{announced}} in March 2016 that a lingering shoulder issue would prevent him from partaking in the 2016 tee shot. Palmer was still in attendance for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Many golfing {{events have}} been {{hosted by the}} Whitecraigs Golf Club. The club was visited by the United States Ryder Cup teams of 1929 and 1933. The teams {{included}} many golfing legends such as Walter Hagen, Gene Sarazen and Horton Smith. Whitecraigs hosted the World Seniors' Golf Championship in 1976. In 1983, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> visited the club to play an exhibition match and run a clinic.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{has spent}} the most {{consecutive}} and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He {{is one of five}} players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus)</b> to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so. Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons.|$|E
5|$|He has won 14 {{professional}} major golf championships, {{where he}} trails only <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> who leads with 18, and 79 PGA Tour events, second all-time behind Sam Snead, who had 82 wins. Woods leads all active golfers in career major wins and career PGA Tour wins. He {{is the youngest}} player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour. Additionally, Woods {{is only the second}} golfer (after Nicklaus) to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times. Woods has won 18 World Golf Championships, and won at least one of those events in each of the first 11 years after they began in 1999. Woods and Rory McIlroy are the only golfers to win both The Silver Medal and The Gold Medal at The Open Championship.|$|E
5|$|Sörenstam has {{undertaken}} {{a number of}} golf course design projects. Her first, the Annika Course, was completed at Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzen, China, in 2003; the second was officially launched in January 2006 and opened in 2008 at Euphoria Golf Estate & Hydro in South Africa. She recently announced a new project at Mines Golf City, near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Projects closer to home include a redesign of the Patriots Point Links Course near Charleston, South Carolina and a course at Red Mountain Resort, British Columbia. She and <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> lost out on their bid to build the Olympic golf course in Rio to Gil Hanse and his consultant Amy Alcott. In 2010, a golf course at Golden Bay Resort was opened in South Korea. She designed this golf course, and Hanhwa Hotels & Resorts Corporation developed. This was the first project for her after-retirement golf course design.|$|E
5|$|When Woods was 13 years old, {{he played}} in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major {{national}} junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{began his}} 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) {{where he started}} off well, but {{struggled}} on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out {{in the second round}} by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.|$|E
5|$|The 1967 match {{continued}} {{the trend of}} American victories, as the United States won 23½–8½ at Champions Golf Club. Unlike in previous years, the 1969 match was much closer. The match {{came down to the}} last hole of the final singles match between American <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> and British golfer Tony Jacklin. Nicklaus made his putt, which left Jacklin with a putt to tie the match. Despite this, Nicklaus conceded the putt, picking up Jacklin's ball marker. As a result their match was tied, as was the contest at 16–16. The United States won again in 1971, beating Great Britain 18½–13½. The 1973 match was the first held in Scotland at Muirfield. The outcome remained the same as Great Britain lost 19–13. The 1975 match at Laurel Valley Golf Club was similar with the United States winning 21–11. The format changed again in 1977, as matches were reduced by nearly a third leaving 20 points available. The changed requested by Great Britain & Ireland did little to change the outcome, as the United States won 12½–7½. Golfers from continental Europe were allowed to compete {{for the first time in}} 1979. There was another change to the format, the first two days now consisted of eight foursomes and fourballs, with twelve singles matches on the final day. Again, the changes had little effect on the outcome as the United States won 17–11.|$|E
5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus,</b> and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} prettier swingers {{of the club}} than <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus.</b> There may have been better ball-strikers than <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus.</b> There have {{definitely}} been better short-game exponents than <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus.</b> Other golfers have putted as well as <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus.</b> There may have been golfers as dedicated and fiercely competitive as <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus.</b> But no individual {{has been able to}} develop, combine and sustain all of the complex physical skills and the immense mental and emotional resources the game demands at its highest level as well as <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> has {{for as long as he}} has.|$|E
25|$|Between 1988 and 1998, Nicklaus {{also gave}} {{his name to}} promote the {{successful}} <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> Golf computer game series developed by Accolade. Several of the golf courses he designed were incorporated into the fourth incarnation of the game <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> 4 published in 1997. In addition, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> 6: Golden Bear Challenge by Activision was published in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Was {{inducted}} into the Asian Pacific Golf Hall of Fame with <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> in 2011 at a ceremony in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Hogan {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} {{greatest}} player of all time by Golf Digest magazine. <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> was first, and Sam Snead was third.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Hogan {{was ranked}} as the fourth {{greatest}} player {{of all time}} by Golf Magazine. <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> was first, Tiger Woods was second, and Bobby Jones was third.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus owns Nicklaus Golf Equipment, {{founded in}} 1992. Nicklaus Golf Equipment {{manufactures}} equipment in three brands: Golden Bear, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> Signature, and Nicklaus Premium. These brands {{are designed to}} target golfers {{at different stages of}} golfing ability.|$|E
25|$|Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters {{announced}} on 5 July 2011 that Player {{had been invited}} to join <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> and Arnold Palmer as an honorary starter. The Big Three were reunited in this capacity starting with the 2012 tournament.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Jones co-founded the Everglades Foundation, which {{advocates for}} {{conservation}} of the Everglades, tropical wetlands in Florida. He chairs the organization’s board, which includes Jimmy Buffett, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus,</b> David Lawrence Jr., Jon L. Mills, and William Wrigley Jr. II, among others.|$|E
25|$|Some things cannot {{possibly}} happen, {{because they}} are both too improbable and too perfect. The U.S. hockey team cannot beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics. <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> cannot shoot 65 to win The Masters at age 46. Nothing else comes immediately to mind.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> and {{his wife}} Barbara {{purchased}} Parker's Members Only grizzly bear sculpture which had been {{for sale in the}} Western Wildlife Gallery in San Francisco. Later, in 2003, Nicklaus would add another bronze sculpture by Parker called Elk Horn Mountain to his collection.|$|E
25|$|At the 1990 Masters, Faldo {{successfully}} {{defended his}} Masters title. He {{came from behind}} {{to get into a}} playoff with Raymond Floyd, once again winning on the second playoff hole after Floyd pulled his approach shot into a pond left of the green. Faldo became the first player to win back-to-back Masters titles since <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> in 1965-66.|$|E
25|$|At {{the close}} of his first 11 seasons, Woods's 54 wins and 12 major wins had surpassed the all-time eleven-season PGA Tour total win record of 51 (set by Byron Nelson) and total majors record of 11 (set by <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus).</b> He was named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for a record-tying fourth time.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, he {{competed in}} the Masters Tournament for the last time, marking his 50th {{consecutive}} appearance in that event. At his death, he and <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> {{were the only two}} Masters champions to be regular members of Masters organizer Augusta National Golf Club (as opposed to the honorary membership the club grants to all Masters champions).|$|E
25|$|Irwin {{demonstrated}} great consistency {{during the}} late 1970s. For four years between January 1975 {{to the end of}} the 1978 season, Irwin made the cut in 86 consecutive PGA Tour events. To date, this is the fourth longest streak of consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour, behind Tiger Woods (142), Byron Nelson (113) and <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> (105).|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2015 Masters, Mickelson's {{best finish}} in 2015 was {{a tie for}} 17th. At the 2015 Masters, Mickelson shot rounds of 70-68-67-69 to finish tied for second with Justin Rose, four shots behind {{champion}} Jordan Spieth. The second-place finish was Mickelson's 10th such finish in a major, placing him second all time only to <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> in that regard.|$|E
25|$|Nelson {{was ranked}} as the fifth {{greatest}} golfer {{of all time}} by Golf Digest magazine in 2000. On this list, <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> was first, Nelson's longtime rivals Ben Hogan and Sam Snead were second and third respectively, and Bobby Jones was fourth. A 2009 Sports Illustrated panel ranked him seventh on its list of all-time greatest golfers, behind Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Jones, Hogan, Snead, and Arnold Palmer.|$|E
25|$|By 1991, Warnaco’s {{lingerie}} division had license {{agreements with}} Valentino, Ungaro, Scaasi, Bob Mackie, Victoria’s Secret and Fruit of the Loom. The menswear division produced shirts, sweaters, neckties and other accessories under names including Christian Dior, Hathaway, Chaps by Ralph Lauren, and <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus.</b> At {{the end of}} 1991, the company produced $195.4 million in gross profits and Linda Wachner was named Business Woman of the Year by Fortune Magazine.|$|E
25|$|His nine career {{professional}} major championships tie him with Gary Player for fourth all-time, trailing only <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> (18), Tiger Woods (14) and Walter Hagen (11). He {{is one of}} only five golfers to have won all four major championships currently open to professionals (the Masters Tournament, The Open (despite only playing once), the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship). The other four are Nicklaus, Woods, Player, and Gene Sarazen.|$|E
25|$|Spieth, age 21, {{became the}} {{youngest}} U.S. Open champion in 92 years, since Bobby Jones in 1923. Also the reigning Masters champion, Spieth is the youngest to win the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year, passing Tiger Woods, who won both in 2002 at age 26. Others to win the first two majors of the year were Craig Wood (1941), Ben Hogan (1951, 1953), Arnold Palmer (1960), and <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> (1972).|$|E
25|$|The third Battle at Bighorn {{took place}} on July 29, 2002, and saw another change of format as Tiger Woods and Sergio García, who had fought out the first Bighorn match, were joined by two of golfs all time greats in a fourball betterball matchplay contest. Woods was paired with 18 time major winner <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus,</b> and García with 6 time major winner Lee Trevino, who triumphed over Nicklaus in a {{play-off}} for the 1971 U.S. Open.|$|E
25|$|The American Sports Medicine Institute (ASMI), {{located at}} St. Vincent’s Hospital in Birmingham, {{was founded by}} Dr. James Andrews in 1987. The institute’s mission is to understand, prevent, and treat sports-related injuries. ASMI turned Birmingham into a major medical {{destination}} for professional athletes around the country. Dr. Andrews has operated on Bo Jackson, Drew Brees, Roger Clemens, John Smoltz, Charles Barkley, Michael Jordan, and <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> to name a few. His orthopedics practice is frequently mentioned in books and articles.|$|E
25|$|A more {{relevant}} comparison on cut streaks is the 105 consecutive cuts made by <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> between 1970 and 1976, ending at the 1976 World Open. The cut format from that era was virtually {{identical to the}} current PGA Tour practice, and most events in Nicklaus' streak, except for the Tournament of Champions (now the SBS Championship), the World Series of Golf (now the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational), and the U.S. Professional Match Play Championship (10 events for Nicklaus) had a cut made after 36 holes.|$|E
25|$|At the 1986 Masters, Norman {{started with}} the lead until he double-bogeyed the 10th hole. After making four {{consecutive}} birdies on holes 14 to 17, Norman was tied with <b>Jack</b> <b>Nicklaus</b> going to the 18th. Norman missed a par putt on the 18th that would have sent the two into a sudden death playoff. At the 1986 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, Norman again led after 54 holes. However, Norman faltered on the final day, finishing with a final round 75 placing him six strokes behind the winner, Raymond Floyd.|$|E
