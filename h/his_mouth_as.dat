5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Kretchmer's twelfth directing credit. One scene in the episode depicts Veronica and Max sitting {{in the backseat of}} a vehicle with Chelsea's pimp (a woman) and several bodyguards. Kretchmer decided to place one of the physically domineering bodyguards between Max and Veronica for comedic effect. In addition, Thomas noted that the actress of the pimp, Jackie Debatin, appeared in a similar role in an episode of The Office several weeks after the episode aired. The scene in which Keith, in a Sheriff's uniform, spots Don Lamb in his car was difficult to edit because although there was initially no radio music playing, Michael Muhney, the actor of Lamb, was moving <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> if singing lyrics. Thomas reported difficulty in finding a song that would match the movements.|$|E

25|$|In May 1950, the Gilberton {{publishing}} company produced a comic-book adaptation of The Man Who Laughs {{as part of}} their prestigious Classics Illustrated series. This adaptation featured artwork by Alex A. Blum, much of it closely resembling the 1928 film (including the anachronistic Ferris wheel). The character of Gwynplaine is drawn as a handsome young man, quite normal except for two prominent creases at the sides of <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> <b>As</b> this comic book was intended for juvenile readers, there may have been an intentional editorial decision to minimise the appearance of Gwynplaine's disfigurement. A revised Classics Illustrated edition, with a more faithful script by Al Sundel, and a painted cover and new interior art by Norman Nodel, was issued in the spring of 1962. Nodel's artwork showed a Gwynplaine far more disfigured than the character's appearance in either the 1928 film or the 1950 Classics edition.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Frederick J. McNulty, the ship's {{assistant}} surgeon, {{eventually became}} a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as Superintendent of the City Lunatic Asylum at Austin Farm and, later, opened there a private sanitarium called Pine Grove Retreat at Roslindale while continuing to reside at 706 Huntington Avenue, Boston. He became a primary historical source for chroniclers of the adventures of the Shenandoah. A man of adventurous and irascible temper, Whittle recounts McNulty having laid the ship's barber out with a single blow when the barber shoved shaving soap in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> part of the crew's hazing of the ship's officers in celebration of crossing the equator. McNulty enlisted as a surgical officer in the Chilean Navy immediately after the surrender of the Shenandoah and later in 1869 accepted a commission in the Cuban Patriot Army, but was repeatedly prevented from traveling to join the Army by U.S. government authorities before settling in Boston in 1879. McNulty is variously reported {{to have been a}} native of Ireland, the District of Columbia and Richmond, Virginia, but was most likely a native of Ireland. He graduated from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in the District of Columbia and lived in Richmond, Virginia before resigning his commission in the medical service of the U.S. Navy to accept a commission in the Confederate States Navy. McNulty died at his home in Boston on June 14, 1897, at the age of 62.|$|E

Ray hides under Sabrina's bed as she reenters the room; lying on a sex doll with both breasts and a penis, he is almost discovered.

500|$|After leaving rehab, Goldstein began {{attending}} raves and {{experimenting with}} MDMA and nitrous oxide. He also started deejaying, {{breaking into a}} friend's home while he was away for the weekend to practice on his turntables and eventually going on to practice freestyle deejaying {{every day for a}} whole summer. Goldstein started using crack cocaine by the age of 20. He said that consuming the drug and deejaying were [...] "about all he did" [...] {{for the next four years}} of his life. He would often disappear from friends and family for days at a time. In 1997, he attempted suicide; the gun jammed in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> he pulled the trigger. Shortly afterwards, a friend encouraged Goldstein to become sober. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, avoided his friends who still took drugs, and dedicated himself to working as a DJ. Goldstein relapsed after 90 days though subsequently restarted and completed the program. People who complete the AA program are encouraged to sponsor other addicts through the recovery process; Goldstein became a sponsor for several people.|$|E
500|$|The opening song, [...] "And It Stoned Me", {{was written}} about {{feelings}} of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and mountain stream. Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he {{had as a}} 12 year old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from {{an old man who}} said he had retrieved it from a stream. [...] "We drank some and everything seemed to stop for me", the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison's reference to [...] "" [...] in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic's Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song's conclusion. [...] "This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing", Hinton remarked, noting how its rhythm is played in triplets rather than rock's archetypical quadruple time signature. [...] "Crazy Love" [...] was recorded with Morrison's voice so close to the microphone that it captured the click of Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.|$|E
500|$|The 9th century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical {{discussion of}} instruments cited the lyra (lūrā) as the typical {{instrument of the}} Byzantines along with the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the salandj (probably a bagpipe). The first of these, the early bowed stringed instrument known as the Byzantine lyra, would {{come to be called}} the lira da braccio, in Venice, where it is considered by many to have been the predecessor of the contemporary violin, which later flourished there. The bowed [...] "lyra" [...] is still played in former Byzantine regions, where it is known as the Politiki lyra (lit. [...] "lyra of the City" [...] i.e. Constantinople) in Greece, the Calabrian lira in Southern Italy, and the Lijerica in Dalmatia. The second instrument, the organ, originated in the Hellenistic world (see Hydraulis) and was used in the Hippodrome during races. [...] A pipe organ with [...] "great leaden pipes" [...] was sent by the emperor Constantine V to Pepin the Short, King of the Franks in 757. [...] Pepin's son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning its establishment in Western church music. The final Byzantine instrument, the aulos was a double reeded woodwind like the modern oboe or Armenian duduk. Other forms include the plagiaulos (πλαγίαυλος, from πλάγιος [...] "sideways"), which resembled the flute, and the askaulos (ἀσκός askos – wine-skin), a bagpipe. These bagpipes, also known as Dankiyo (from ancient Greek: angion (Τὸ ἀγγεῖον) [...] "the container"), had been played even in Roman times. Dio Chrysostom wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe (tibia, Roman reedpipes similar to Greek aulos) with <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit. The bagpipes continued to be played throughout the empire's former realms through to the present.

[...] Juliet, the sixteen-year-old Claire Danes, was praised for portraying a poise and wisdom beyond her years, and as the first screen Juliet whose speech sounded spontaneous. Miriam Margolyes played the nurse for laughs as a plump Hispanic, forever crying [...] "Hooliet! Hooliet!"

2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} held {{his head to one side}} towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>as</b> if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile.

2500|$|The first [...] "Mad Money Main Event" [...] was {{broadcast}} on July20, 2005. Cramer had his show taped {{in front of}} a live studio audience of about 150 guests.

The [...] "Main Event" [...] was introduced by boxing announcer Michael Buffer with his catch phrase [...] "Let's get ready to rumble!". The featured guest on the show was then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer (a classmate of Cramer at Harvard Law School). Cramer went into the crowd and gave high fives to audience members who claimed to have had made money by following his stock tips. True to the commercials, it featured a segment titled [...] "Am I Nuts?", which had audience members asking Cramer about their stocks. Mad Money was expanded to a special 90 minute edition for this occasion.|$|E
