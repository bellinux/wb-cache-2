5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows.

5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and <b>hybrids</b> had decreased <b>vigour.</b> Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{influence}} of grapevine rootstocks on vine vigour and crop yield {{is recognized as}} an integral part of viticultural management. However, the genetic potential of Vitis species rootstock <b>hybrids</b> for <b>vigour</b> and yield control is not fully exploited in Australian viticulture. The effect of 55 novel inter- and intra-species hybrids and five traditional hybrid rootstock cultivars on winter pruning weight, berry size and fruit yield of grafted Shiraz vines is presented. The genetic predictions that resulted from this analysis were used to illustrate how rootstocks that best perform for a combination of traits may be selected. Methods and Results: The use of linear mixed models and residual maximum likelihood procedures took into account repeated measures and spatial variation within a large field trial (720 vines). Over 6 years of assessment, variation of up to 93. 9 % in winter pruning weight, 81. 9 % in fruit yield and 21. 0 % in berry weight between rootstocks was estimated. Conclusions: The effect of rootstock genotype accounted for marked differences in conferred pruning weight, berry weight and fruit yield from trial averages. Comparison of statistical analysis techniques illustrated that the choice of such techniques may influence the outcome of genetic selection from field trial data. Significance of the Study: Such quantification of the variation between vines in vigour, fruit yield and berry size due to rootstock genotype provides a framework for selection of well-performing genotypes for inclusion in advanced generations of the CSIRO vine rootstock breeding program...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{variability}} was {{studied for}} eight quantitative traits in fourteen parental lines of hybrid rice. The characters were plant height, flag leaf initiation day, first panicle initiation day, days to 100 % flowering, days to maturity, grain yield/ 10 hills, spikelet fertility/ 10 panicles and no. of effective tillers/hill. Two additional characters (flag leaf length and spikelet length) {{were included in}} heterosis study. In general high component of variation and coefficient of variability were observed {{for most of the}} characters. The highest component of variation, coefficient of variability and heritability were noticed in grain yield/ 10 hills. Characters those with high genetic variability and genetic advance were considered to be important for selecting the desirable lines. Heterosis was studied in ten F 1 lines for 10 characters. In general, the hybrids performed significantly better than the respective parents. Mid parent, standard variety and better parent heterosis were observed for all the characters under study. In comparison of F 1 hybrids with their respective mid parent, standard variety and better parent showed significant heterosis for most of the studied characters. Among the 10 hybrids three lines viz., IR 62829 AxIR 62036 - 222 - 3 - 3 - 1 - 2 R, IR 58025 AxIR 61614 - 38 - 19 - 3 - 2 R and IR 68888 AxIR 56381 - 139 - 2 - 2 R exhibited the highest heterosis in grain yield/ 10 hills. In conclusion, there was an ample scope for developing suitable hybrid rice from the studied parental lines as the <b>hybrids</b> exhibited <b>vigour</b> and earliness...|$|R
5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour.</b> These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour.</b> While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
5|$|Crossbreeding {{increases}} {{production efficiency}} because of <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour,</b> and allows complementary traits of {{parents to be}} combined to produce progeny better suited to different environments or markets. Crossbreeding {{through the use of}} Limousin terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds allows the complementary traits of higher marbling and fat cover provided by the British breed cows, and required or preferred by some markets, to be combined with the higher yield and feed conversion efficiency of Limousin sires.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour,</b> or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E

The activities undertaken over the 5 -year period (2004 - 09) included: - On-station selection of the following trials: two clone trials, two intra-population hybrid trials, three hybrid trials, {{and the establishment of}} a regional hybrid trial; - On-farm survey about the planting materials used by the farmers and the establishment of 36 demonstration plots on farms including 15 improved varieties selected by CNRA and 15 farmers' selections. The traits evaluated were yield, yield efficiency, percentage of rotten pods and the average weight of one pod. The analyses of the on-station trials showed highly significant differences among the genotypes tested, many of which showed superiority with regard to the control varieties. Genetic parameters were calculated and discussed for the intra-population hybrid trials. This permitted to apply a selection index to increase selection efficiency in these trials. A list of elite hybrids that are candidates for multilocation variety trials has been established. The first results of the Regional Variety Trials shows superiority of the CÃ´te d'Ivoire <b>hybrids</b> for <b>vigour</b> and precocity compared to the introduced varieties. The farm survey included 1133 farmers over the six main cocoa-producing regions. The results show that most farmers use their own farm or neighbours' farms as sources of new planting materials and that yield and precocity are the main selection criteria. The relevance of establishing demonstration plots on-farm to stimulate the farmers to adopt breeders' selections as well as to identify superior farm selections is presented.

40|$|Hybridization {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} mechanisms by which rapid evolution can occur in exotic species. If <b>hybrids</b> show increased <b>vigour,</b> this could significantly contribute to invasion success. Here, we compared the success of the two invasive knotweeds, Fallopia japonica and F. sachalinensis, and their hybrid, F. x bohemica, in competing against experimental communities of native plants. Using plant material from multiple clones of each taxon collected across a latitudinal gradient in Central Europe, we found that knotweed hybrids performed significantly better in competition with a native community and that they more strongly reduced the growth of the native plants. One of the parental species, F. sachalinensis, regenerated significantly less well from rhizomes, and this difference disappeared if activated carbon was added to the substrate, which suggests allelopathic inhibition of F. sachalinensis regeneration by native plants. We found substantial within-taxon variation in competitive success in all knotweed taxa, but variation was generally greatest in the hybrid. Interestingly, there was also significant variation within the genetically uniform F. japonica, possibly reflecting epigenetic differences. Our study shows that invasive knotweed hybrids are indeed more competitive than their parents and that hybridization increased the invasiveness of the exotic knotweed complex...|$|R
40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) as {{a source}} of {{vegetable}} oil and proteins is grown {{in many parts of the}} world. It is the fourth important vegetable oil crop, producing 9 million tonnes per year. The present study was attempted to identify the effective mating partners and assign probable heterotic groups by estimating the genetic variation among the experimental materials. In order to evaluate the genetic diversity of 49 sunflower promising inbred lines, selected morphological features as well as oil percentage were precisely investigated. Sunflower stocks including 18 R-lines and 31 B-lines were planted based on a simple lattice (7 Ã 7) design with two replications. Relationships among (i) quantitative and quantitative; (ii) qualitative and quantitative; and (iii) qualitative and qualitative traits were estimated by correlation analysis, ANOVA and chi square test, respectively. Results of ANOVA revealed significant differences (P< 0. 01) between the lines for most of the characters. A considerable outcome appeared when negative correlation between oil percentage and seed weight was achieved. Classification of lines based on cluster analysis separated them into two distinct groups of male and female. These achievements were confirmed by plot analysis based on the first two principal components. Moreover, the results of factor analysis indicated that four factors could explain 73. 92 % of the total variance. To sum up, the high genetic diversity that was demonstrated among 49 sunflower inbred promising lines suggested that selection of parents for hybridization needed to be based on genetic diversity. According to these findings, the heterotic groups that may lead the crosses to production of <b>vigour</b> <b>hybrids</b> were recommended.

5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour,</b> often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|Loss of <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour</b> occurs and {{phenotype}} varies {{greatly in}} subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour,</b> and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
40|$|Many {{plant species}} can hybridise and produce fertile offspring. Hybridization between {{cultivated}} species and their wild relatives has raised concerns {{with regard to}} GM crops, as it constitutes a possible route along which the transgene could disperse from crops into related wild species, establish itself in the natural population, and persist under natural conditions. This may cause unintended ecological consequences such as the formation of more invasive weeds and genetic erosion. After crop-wild hybridization, {{the persistence of the}} hybrids and of the crop genes (including the transgenes) in later generations depends on their genetic make-up, which consists of specific combinations of wild and crop genomic segments, and on the environmental conditions. Therefore, knowledge on the dynamics of crop-wild hybridization and introgression using conventional crop varieties is needed as it constitutes the baseline for putting into perspective the effects of transgene introgression under natural conditions. Â  This study focused on understanding the genetic process of hybridization and introgression from cultivated to wild relative species using cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and its closest wild relative, prickly lettuce (L. serriola L.) as a crop-wild complex model. Natural populations of prickly lettuce in Europe were tested for the occurrence of crop-wild hybrids using Bayesian-based programmes (Structure, InStruct and NewHybrids) which returned a crop-wild hybrid occurrence of 7 %. Â  However, the geographical location of the hybrids led to the conclusion that crop-wild hybridization is not the cause of the recent northward spread of L. serriola in Europe. To test for the importance of the crop genomic segments to the performance of lettuce crop-wild hybrids, three hybrid generations were created (F 2 as a selfing generation, and BC 1 and BC 2, backcrossed to the wild genotype to mimick the introgression process) by crossing L. sativa (cv. Dynamite) with L. serriola collected from Eys (the Netherlands). The three populations were genotyped with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers for genetic analysis. Because {{of the importance of the}} abiotic stresses as selection factors under natural conditions and the prospective of generating GM crop varieties with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, the three populations were evaluated for vigour at the rosette stage under greenhouse conditions of non-stress, drought, salinity and nutrient deficiency. The BC 1 population was also evaluated under field conditions at two locations (Wageningen and Sijbekarspel, the Netherlands) for <b>hybrid</b> germination, <b>vigour,</b> survival and reproduction. Based on the location and allelic effect of the QTLs for germination, vigour, survival and reproductive traits in the current lettuce crop-wild cross, genomic regions were suggested where transgenes could be or could not be located in order to mitigate their persistence in crop-wild hybrids through genetic hitchhiking and background selection.

5|$|The {{two major}} Limousin hybrids are Brahmousin (a cross between Brahman and Limousin cattle)) and Lim-Flex (a cross between Angus and Limousin cattle), which were both {{developed}} before {{the significance of}} the F94L myostatin variant had been quantified. When Limousins homozygous for the F94L myostatin mutation are used in crossbreeding, only one of the mutations will be inherited (that is, progeny will be heterozygous for the mutation), and a high level of phenotypic uniformity and <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour</b> would be expected in the progeny. However, breeding using heterozygous animals as parents, which could include purebred Limousins of low percentage Full French content, and Lim-Flex and Brahmousin hybrids that have not been bred to a uniform (homozygous) standard over several generations, would produce progeny with inconsistent carcase characteristics and production value depending upon whether or not the F94L mutation was inherited.|$|E

2500|$|Genomics is an {{interdisciplinary}} {{field of science}} {{within the field of}} molecular biology. A genome is a complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism, and as such, focuses on the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes.

Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research to understand even the most currently complex biological systems such as the brain. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics uses high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble, and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes. [...] The field also includes studies of intragenomic (within the genome) phenomena such as heterosis (<b>hybrid</b> <b>vigour),</b> epistasis (effect of one gene on another), pleiotropy (one gene affecting more than one trait) and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome.
