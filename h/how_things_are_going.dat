2500|$|Pacioli saw {{accounting}} as an ad-hoc ordering system {{devised by}} the merchant. Its regular use provides the merchant with continued {{information about his}} business, and allows him to evaluate <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> and to act accordingly. Pacioli recommends the Venetian method of double-entry bookkeeping above all others. Three major books of account are at the direct basis of this system: ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 19, 1856, {{while at}} Old Fort Cedar, Captain Augustus Pleasonton writes from the {{headquarters}} of the Sioux Expedition at Fort Pierre orders to return to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for recruiting duty. Starr is there by July 17 and in a letter dated April 11, 1857, from the assistant adjutant general, L. Thomas, he is sent back West. [...] In a June 26, 1857 letter he describes to his daughter Kate where he is and <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> at the post.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{financial}} model {{may have been}} broken for the Trail Blazers, it was anything but for Portland Arena Management. [...] Rose Quarter GM Mike Scanlon of Global Spectrum stated {{that the company was}} [...] "very happy with <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> at the Rose Garden", and referred to Global's stewardship of the Garden as a [...] "very positive experience". [...] He noted that the arena did 45 concerts in 2005, and that same year landed another sports tenant, the Portland LumberJax of the National Lacrosse League.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. McWilliams sped to {{the nursery}} to see <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on there. She was {{back in a moment}} with a new dread. She said: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{thought he}} would give Lillie a little {{practical}} insight into his business,--show her exactly what his income was, and make some estimates of his expenses, just {{that she might have}} some little idea <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On 20 February 2008, in {{the wake}} of a major {{research}} on the ten-year-mismanagement, it was announced that Cruyff would be the new technical director at his boyhood club Ajax, his fourth stint with the Amsterdam club. Cruyff announced in March that he was pulling out of his planned return to Ajax because of [...] "professional difference of opinion" [...] between him and Ajax's new manager, Marco van Basten. Van Basten said that Cruyff's plans were [...] "going too fast", because he was [...] "not so dissatisfied with <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> now".|$|E
2500|$|This {{personal}} {{loss was}} immediately followed, on 15 May, by {{the resignation of}} Admiral Fisher after continuing disagreements with Churchill and in frustration at the disappointing developments in Gallipoli. Aged 74, Fisher's behaviour had grown increasingly erratic and, in frequent letters to Lloyd George, he gave vent to his frustrations with the First Lord of the Admiralty; [...] "Fisher writes to me every day or two {{to let me know}} <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> He {{has a great deal of}} trouble with his chief, who is always wanting to do something big and striking." [...] Adverse events, press hostility, Tory opposition and personal sorrows assailed Asquith, and his position was further weakened by his Liberal colleagues. Cassar considers that Lloyd George displayed a distinct lack of loyalty, and Koss writes of the contemporary rumours that Churchill had [...] "been up to his old game of intriguing all round" [...] and reports a claim that Churchill [...] "unquestionably inspired" [...] the Repington Letter, in collusion with Sir John French. Lacking cohesion internally, and attacked from without, Asquith determined that his government could not continue and he wrote to the King, [...] "I have come decidedly to the conclusion that the [...] must be reconstituted on a broad and non-party basis." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY MOGTON Well, must {{be content}} with that, I suppose. Better not come in; the room's rather crowded. I'll keep you {{informed}} <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And {{then his}} {{daughter}} spoke, seeing <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> with him. [...] "Father," [...] said she, [...] "this gentleman has called {{because he has}} had a letter from Abraham Mollett; and he was speaking about what Abraham has been doing in Ireland." ...|$|R
60|$|Stanley's daily {{journeys}} {{were not}} likely to be long ones, as he had instructions to stop at all villages; and to see <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on, and whether the people had any complaints to make of oppression and exaction by their local authorities.|$|R
50|$|On January 21, 1981, Mike Allen, 32, was supervising bell dive No. 342 {{on board}} the Stena Seaspread, {{adjacent}} to the Thistle SALM. Just after 10 o’clock that morning, Allen’s boss, dive superintendent Mike O’Meara stepped into the control van to ask <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, just {{at present}} I won't give no advice at all. We will see <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> after a bit. Now let's {{take a look}} round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The assault has begun!" [...] Harry exclaimed. [...] "We {{shall not}} see much, {{but we may}} get some idea as to <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> from the lookout." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But she is--and {{has your}} {{interest}} entirely at heart," [...] said Jessie, stoutly, [...] "and he only comes {{here to tell}} us <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on at the works." ...|$|E
60|$|Heaven knows! I've {{walked through}} the streets till I'm dog-tired. Oh, the {{suspense}} is too awful. My feet carried me to the Old Bailey, and I would have given anything {{to go in and}} see <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> but I'd promised the Pater I wouldn't.|$|R
60|$|On {{three or}} four {{occasions}} his grandfather asked him <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> at Noningsby, striving to interest himself in something as to which the outlook was not altogether dismal, and by degrees learned,--not exactly all the truth--but {{as much of the}} truth as Peregrine knew.|$|R
60|$|Seeing <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> you may <b>be</b> {{sure that}} Arkal did not remain an idle spectator. He dropped {{again from the}} outer end of the bough he had reached, and when the bear rose once more to its feet, it found a foe {{on either side of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he {{observed}} pleasantly, [...] "I am {{out of place}} here. Drop me a line {{and let me know}} <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to the Hotel Capitol at Washington." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to know}} <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> up there," [...] mused Dick. [...] "It will be too bad if Josiah Crabtree {{succeeds in}} marrying Mrs. Stanhope while we are away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{look him}} up; ferret him out; tell {{him a bit}} of my mind. I'll thank you to pass the bottle. D---- me doctor; I mean to know <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on." ...|$|E
60|$|Priscilla, meantime, was racking {{her brain}} to {{discover}} how she could help Philip; for since she had broken off her engagement no one spoke of him to her, and she could only judge of <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> with him by what she saw and heard as she went about her daily task.|$|R
60|$|Malcolm crossed at once. After {{despatching}} {{the message}} to the king and sending the officer back with the boats he had for the moment nothing to do, and made his way into the town to inquire from the officers of Ramsay's detachment <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> He found the men drawn up.|$|R
50|$|Through a video podcast, {{which was}} {{broadcast}} through YouTube, MySpace and iTunes, the band uploaded episodes of <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> offering {{a taste of}} what was to come and what recording was like among other things such as Ross giving a step to step guide on how to make the perfect cup of tea.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is, {{whether we}} ought to make a straight path to Ravensnest," [...] observed Guert, [...] "or proceed first to the surveyor's, and see <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on in that direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never hear {{a word of}} it from year's end to year's end, and I {{speak the}} talk too. But I wanted to ask <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on at home--old Tyler and Brown and the rest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (if one may quote Tennyson in {{this century}} of free verse). Hence I cannot know <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> so well as I used to know them, and the {{aforesaid}} limitations must quite prevent my knowing hence- forward.|$|E
5000|$|Diana Steenbergen from IGN {{rated the}} episode with 9.5/10 {{saying that it}} was another {{whirlwind}} episode. [...] "episode was chock full of surprises, including a couple head-spinning shockers at the end. Just when you thought you knew <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to go down, Klaus pulls out a Plan B that no one saw coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In some ways, {{it might}} be better if I went home at once," [...] Blake said at last. [...] "I could come back and join you as soon as I saw <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> The Colonel would feel easier if I were with him; but, all the same, I'm {{inclined}} to stay away." ...|$|R
2500|$|... a {{tremendous}} force {{in my personal}} and professional life. He was always {{in and out of}} my office, asking <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> Even as he was trying to convince me to do something I absolutely did not want to do, I always felt his intentions for me were the best. Marvin was always honest and unpretentious.|$|R
6000|$|... "He hasn't a {{doubt of}} it," [...] I went on diplomatically. [...] "But we felt--and I felt personally, {{that we ought}} to be in touch with you, to work along with you, to keep {{informed}} <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Marston admitted. [...] "I {{was rather}} keen about the business; in fact, I'm keen yet. I {{like to know}} <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> even if I can't help; but the boat's a temptation and Harry doesn't need me all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There were giants {{in those}} days," [...] he said, not {{understanding}} what wont and training will do. And their walk that day led them along the hills {{until they could}} see the city shimmering far away in the valley. [...] "I wonder <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on there," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|But in {{the course}} of time, when she saw <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> and <b>how</b> very little she had to fear from Sue's rivalry, she had a fit of generosity.

60|$|Here's {{a pretty}} kettle of fish, thought I to myself as I strolled {{back to the}} waggon to see <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on there, {{and how to get}} the live fish out of the kettle before they boil or spoil is more than I know. I wonder why fate is always finding me such jobs to do.|$|R
60|$|Whatever comment Mrs. Pett {{might have}} made on this {{suggestion}} was checked by the entrance of Ann.
