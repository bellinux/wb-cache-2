30|$|What should {{monetary}} policymakers make {{of these}} findings? The UK Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cares about migration because {{changes in the}} level of immigration can alter the level of wages consistent with the inflation target. 15 While immigration clearly increases the supply of labour, immigrants are consumers too and so the demand for goods and labour rise too (see King (2007); Barwell (2007)). <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> immigration to have a small, significant, negative impact on UK average wages. This suggests that the supply effects have dominated the demand effects over our sample period - 1992 – 2016.|$|R

40|$|Theoretical and psychophysical {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that humans learn to make reaching movements in novel dynamic environments by building specific internal models (IMs). <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> electromyographic correlates of internal model formation. We recorded EMG from four muscles as subjects learned to move a manipulandum that created systematic forces (a “force field”). We also simulated a biomechanical controller, which generated movements based on an adaptive IM of the inverse dynamics of the human arm and the manipulandum. The simulation defined two metrics of muscle activation. The first metric measured the component of the EMG of each muscle that counteracted the force field. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that early in training, the field-appropriate EMG was driven by an error feedback signal. As subjects practiced, the peak of the field-appropriate EMG shifted temporally to earlier in the movement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{involvement}} of microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) in {{the function of}} mast cells, melanocytes, and osteoclasts has recently started to be investigated in depth. In a previous study, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> Hint {{to be associated with}} MITF in mast cells and showed that it suppresses MITF's transcriptional activity. <b>Here,</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> that lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is also associated with MITF and forms a multicomplex with MITF and Hint. We have also shown that Ap 4 A, an endogenous molecule consisting of two adenosine linked by four phosphate which is known to be synthesized by LysRS, is accumulated intracellularily above 700 μM in IgE-Ag-activated mast cells, binds to Hint, liberates MITF, and thus leads to the activation of MITF-dependent gene expression. This implies that LysRS plays a key role via Ap 4 A as an important signaling molecule in MITF transcriptional activity...|$|R
40|$|Ubiquitously {{expressed}} transcript (UXT) is a prefoldinlike {{protein that}} has been suggested {{to be involved in}} human tumorigenesis. <b>Here,</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> that UXT is overexpressed in a number of human tumor tissues but not in the matching normal tissues. We demonstrate that UXT is located in human centrosomes and is associated with γ-tubulin. In addition, overexpression of UXT disrupts centrosome structure. Furthermore, abrogation of UXT protein expression by small interfering RNA knockdown leads to cell death. Together, our findings suggest that UXT is a component of centrosome and is essential for cell viability. We propose that UXT may facilitate transformation by corrupting regulated centrosome functions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractXenopus laevis are a rich {{resource}} for vertebrate embryology and cell biology. Transplantation and transgenesis have provided much {{information about the}} developmental mechanisms of embryogenesis and molecule function, however existing methods have faced limitations regarding either the precise localization of gene expression or flexibility in the timing of gene transfer. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> that electroporation of tailbud (stage 29 / 30) embryos is a rapid and efficient method of combining cell-specific expression with variation in temporal delivery. At the low voltages required for electroporation, embryos resumed normal swimming behavior and development. We conclude that electroporation has wide experimental application to Xenopus developmental and cell biology...|$|R
