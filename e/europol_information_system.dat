The police serve as border guards for the outer border of the Schengen Area. The busiest are Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which has 130 man-years tied to it, Storskog on the Russian border and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These are the only borders with designated border employees—all other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for customs, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. Norway participates in a series of international police cooperation, such as Interpol, <b>Europol,</b> the Schengen <b>Information</b> <b>System,</b> Frontex, and the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we generalise {{the notion of}} (algebraic) <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to {{continuous}} <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Just as algebraic <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are concrete representations of Scott domains, continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are concrete representations of continuous Scott domains. The class of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> can be generated from the subclass of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> {{in the sense that}} the category of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is equivalent to the Karoubi envelope of the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Because qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> correspond to the qualitative domains of Girard (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 45, 159 - 192 (1986)) this implies that the category of continuous Scott domains is equivalent to the Karoubi envelope of the category of qualitative domains. We show how constructions on qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> (such as product and function space) can be "translated" to constructions on continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Among other things, we prove that the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is weak Cartesian closed.
