40|$|Prevention of {{potential}} failure {{is required for}} reliable and safe operations of machineries and the prevention of catastrophic failure {{can be done by}} appropriate maintenance. Preventive maintenance (PM) is the practice of maintaining equipment on a regular schedule based on <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> or <b>meter</b> readings. The intent of PM is to “prevent” maintenance problems or failures before they take place by following routine and comprehensive maintenance procedures. The goal is to achieve fewer, shorter, and more predictable outages. ASchedule or Preventive maintenance is the best suitable technique to avoid unwanted futuristic failures through condition monitoring or signature analysis for rotating machineries. The main reason for setting up a preventive maintenance program is to prevent unscheduled outages from failure of equipment. Depending on the circumstances, an unscheduled outage will be, at least, very inconvenient and can be extremely expensive...|$|R
40|$|Non-adherence with {{antidepressant}} medication regimens is now recognised as {{a substantial}} problem when evaluating depression outcome. Given the behavioural demands of light treatment (LT), {{it might be}} expected that non-adherence {{would be even more}} pronounced in LT, a form of intervention for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). However, little research has focused upon the extent to which patients in light treatment protocols adhere to set regimens. Nineteen patients with SAD were allocated to either treatment with bright white light (intervention) or dim red light (control condition) in a four-week protocol. Light exposure was estimated automatically (without participants' knowledge) with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> <b>meters</b> built into the light box. Daily diaries were also used to measure self-reported light box use. Participants were instructed to use the light box for 30 min each day during week 1, 45 during week 2 and one hour during weeks 3 and 4 (total duration of prescribed light exposure 1365 min). The results indicated that mean duration of light box operation for the entire sample was 59. 3 % of the prescribed 1365 min. Six of nineteen (31. 6 %) patients dropped out of treatment. Amongst those completing treatment, adherence to the prescribed duration of exposure averaged 83. 3 % (S. D. = 31. 4). A trend was found for the intervention condition to generate a lower dropout rate, as well as a trend for the degree of adherence to be greater in the intervention condition. Importantly, there was no association between adherence as measured automatically and the higher rates of self-reported adherence as measured in diaries. In summary, the results of this pilot study suggest that adherence with light treatment is of a similar order of magnitude to antidepressant medication adherence. Patient self-report was found to be unrelated to objectively estimated duration of light box use, a finding with significant research and clinical implications. Future research studies should routinely measure and evaluate adherence with light therapy and evidence-based techniques for maximising treatment adherence should be incorporated into routine clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Summary. We explore Bayesian {{analysis}} for continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models {{based on a}} conditional reference prior. For CTMC models, inference of the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> be-tween chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> increases. Moreover, improper priors on the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition to the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time,</b> an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes the CTMC. Usually, experts have good prior knowledge about {{the parameters of the}} infinitesimal rate matrix, and thus can provide well-informed priors. We show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> yields a proper posterior distribution. Finally, we demonstrate that, when compared to anal-yses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, Bayesian analysis on the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The conditional reference prior therefore represents a better default prior choice for widely-used estimation software...|$|R

40|$|Cross-sections of resin strands. Techniques were {{developed}} to make in situ measurements of gelled resin to determine linear shrinkage, stress-strain response and stress relaxation of single strands of SL 5170 epoxy and SL 5149 photocurable resins. Epoxy strands shrank approximately 1. 4 % and the acrylate strands about 1. 0 % after a single exposure. No forces were measured during cure shrinkage of strands following the first laser exposure. In multiple laser exposures, the acrylate continues to shrink; whereas (University of Dayton data) no additional shrinkage is observed in epoxy strands on a second hit. In force relaxation tests, a strand is drawn and then a 0. 5 % step strain is applied after different <b>elapsed</b> <b>times.</b> The epoxy initial modulus evolves (increases) with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> following draw of the strand, and this evolution in modulus occurs after linear shrinkage has stopped. On the other hand, acrylates show no evolution of modulus with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> following a single laser draw; i. e., once shrinkage stops after one laser hit, the initial modulus remains stable with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time.</b> Finally, relaxation response times of epoxy strands get larger with increasing <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> after laser draw. In acrylate strands there was no evolution in initial modulus with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> after a single draw so relaxation times are not a function of <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> after a single hit with the laser...|$|R

40|$|We show {{analytically}} {{that the}} answer to the question, "The longer it has been since the last earthquake, the longer the expected time till the next ?" depends crucially on the statistics of the fluctuations in the interval times between earthquakes. The periodic, uniform, semigaussian, Rayleigh and truncated statistical distributions of interval times, as well as the Weibull distributions with exponent greater than 1, all have decreasing expected time to the next earthquake with increasing time since the last one, for long times since the last earthquake; the log-normal and power-law distributions and the Weibull distributions with exponents smaller than 1, have increasing times to the next earthquake as the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> since the last increases, for long <b>elapsed</b> <b>times.</b> There is an identifiable crossover between these models, which is gauged by the rate of fall-off of the long-term tail of the distribution in comparison with an exponential fall-off. The response to the question for short <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> is also evaluated. The lognormal and power-law distributions give one response for short <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> and the opposite for long <b>elapsed</b> <b>times.</b> Even the sampling of a finite number of intervals from the Poisson distribution will lead to an increasing estimate of time to the next earthquake for increasing <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> since the last one.
