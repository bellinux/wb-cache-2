50|$|Veronica officinalis (<b>heath</b> <b>speedwell,</b> common gypsyweed, common speedwell, or Paul's betony) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia. It has been introduced to North America and is widely naturalised there.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} feature of the site is its rich birdlife, including the rare willow tit. Deans Brook rises on the course, {{and a number of}} small streams converge towards Stoneyfields Lake, created by damming the brook when the site was a country estate. The lake and streams support many species of water loving plants. The area close to Scratchwood is acid grassland which has uncommon species such as dyer's greenweed and <b>heath</b> <b>speedwell.</b> There are some larger areas of woodland, such as Hemmings Wood {{at the southern end of}} the course.|$|E
50|$|Little light penetrates to the {{woodland}} {{floor in}} the most wooded places and {{large areas of the}} wood are devoid of either shrub, field or ground layers of vegetation. Consequently, parts of the wood can present a dark and gloomy appearance in the summer months. Nevertheless, in the few glade areas, caused by the collapse of an occasional canopy tree, or by more recent coppicing, the flora is of considerable interest. Pill sedge hangs on in its only known Haringey site, and tiny populations of cow-wheat, slender St. John's wort, wood anemone, and <b>heath</b> <b>speedwell</b> manage to survive, though they seldom flower.|$|E
