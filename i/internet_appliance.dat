2500|$|Nintendo {{released}} a peripheral platform called 64DD, where [...] "DD" [...] stands for [...] "Disk Drive". Connecting {{to the expansion}} slot {{at the bottom of}} the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an <b>Internet</b> <b>appliance,</b> a multimedia workstation, and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese Randnet online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four Mario Artist games (Paint Studio, Talent Studio, Communication Kit, and Polygon Studio). Many more planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan, despite always being announced for America and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Katz Media {{signed a}} number of {{agreements}} with companies across Europe and Canada. One agreement was to publish CD-ROM-based catalogs for Redwall Retail Stores, and use the Pippin as an interactive kiosk that would be set up in stores running the CD-ROMs. Katz Media also attempted to push the KMP 2000 into Canada – a country where, in May 1997, only 20 percent of its citizens {{had access to the}} Internet. The idea was to use the country's existing cable network to bring in Internet access, and the KMP 2000 was {{to be used as a}}n <b>Internet</b> <b>appliance</b> that would be issued to subscribers. A hotel chain in Europe signed a deal with Katz Media to use the KMP 2000 in hotel rooms, so that guests could access the Internet. Katz Media then signed with a hospital in France, using the KMP 2000 as an online system so that, as a team, physicians could pull up and review case studies, and collaborate on diagnoses and treatments. On June 16, 1997, the Netface Consortium in the Netherlands selected the KMP 2000 as the device to be used as a part of what the company called [...] "the world's first Internet shopping mall." [...] CAI-Westland owned a two-way cable system with 55,000 subscribers, and the KMP 2000 was to be given to the subscribers as a device to shop for products from a consortium of 23 companies.|$|E

Many solutions are provided to connect those home appliances on net by wireless way or through wire.

This thesis investigates a core implementation of TCP/IP served for <b>internet</b> <b>appliances.</b> We also present the design architecture of this TCP/IP core and those simulation and testing results. We also add one simplified version of application layer, HTTP part, to the TCP/IP core, to make a simple hardware web server.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1999, Be had a [...] "focus shift," [...] {{giving their}} desktop OS away for free (with {{commercial}} distributions sold by third-party vendors, similar to Linux distributions) to focus on BeIA, a build of BeOS specifically targeted to <b>internet</b> <b>appliances.</b> The company lost several employees who disagreed with this strategy and who {{had no desire to}} work on an appliance OS. While there was vendor interest in BeIA and at least one shipping product based on it (the Sony eVilla), the market for <b>internet</b> <b>appliances</b> proved to be nearly non-existent, and Be laid off most of its employees in 2001, with its assets and the remaining engineers being bought by Palm, Inc. for $11 million that August.

40|$|Although various {{research}} efforts have reported {{some success in}} solving difficult problems related to intelligent environments, very little {{progress has been made}} in implementing a truly intelligent system in reality. This paper looks at intelligent environments from a networking and connectivity point of view in order to gain a fresh perspective.

Next, we present a classification of the essential components of an intelligent environment, and observe that a connectivity infrastructure does exist in the form of a network of <b>Internet</b> <b>Appliances.</b> We also note, however, that the intelligence components necessary for an intelligent environment are lacking. Therefore, we discuss challenges and provide directions for future research so that we can move from a network of <b>Internet</b> <b>Appliances</b> to <b>Internet</b> Intelligent Environments. ...|$|R
