5000|$|The Problem-Based Learning Pathway (PBL) {{emphasizes}} student-centered self-directed {{learning through}} small group interaction, with limited faculty involvement. The PBL pathway {{is the sole}} pathway offered at the Bradenton and Greensberg campuses. The Lecture Discussion Pathway (LDP) is a traditional curriculum where subjects are taught in a lecture format. Basic science courses include gross anatomy, biochemistry, immunology, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology and physiology. Clinical sciences are taught in a systems-based format. The <b>Directed</b> <b>Study</b> Pathway (DSP) is a unique program, which begins with significant daily classroom time in the first semester, which then transitions into specific [...] "directed study" [...] modules {{for the duration of}} the first two years of medical school.|$|E
5000|$|Independent {{study is}} a form of {{education}} offered by many high schools, colleges, and other educational institutions. It is sometimes referred to as <b>directed</b> <b>study,</b> and is an educational activity undertaken by an individual with little to no supervision. Typically a student and professor or teacher agree upon a topic for the student to research with guidance from the instructor for an agreed upon amount of credits. Independent studies provide a way for well-motivated students to pursue a topic of interest that does not necessarily fit into a traditional academic curriculum. [...] They are a way for students to learn specialized material or gain research experience.|$|E

CCLS students are working professionals, parents and spouses with work, school and family commitments seeking a bachelor's or master's degree from an accredited university. CCLS serves over 9,000 adult students worldwide and offers campus-based, online and <b>directed</b> <b>study</b> formats. CCLS consists of two distinct schools: the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the School of Education and Counseling. Both of the schools offers bachelor's and master's degrees and certificate programs. CCLS has been named a Top Military Friendly School for 2012 by GI Jobs.|$|E

50|$|The {{style of}} {{learning}} at SEEC {{is very different}} from the style taught at most high schools around the province. Classes are typically multi-disciplinary and often held outdoors. For example, students may go for a hike up a mountain, navigating via GPS, and then write a reflection on the experience. This will complete prescribed learning outcomes from a variety of courses, including PE, Geography, and English. Typically, each semester will focus on four courses, with students also having the freedom to create an IDS. An IDS, or Independent <b>Directed</b> <b>Study,</b> is a course that a student can independently design according to their own interests, as long as it follows at least one Prescribed Learning Outcome of at least one provincially recognized course.|$|E
