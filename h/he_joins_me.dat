50|$|Shojaei {{started his}} career with Sepahan at youth level. After {{spending}} four years in Division 1, in 2011 <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>Mes</b> Kerman.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> I {{pointed down}} into the streets of Kadabra and to the {{advancing}} columns beyond, above which floated bravely in the arctic air the flags and banners of Helium.|$|R
60|$|One evening, not ten short days since, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> whilst {{walking in}} my alley. He took my hand. I {{looked up in}} his face. I thought he meant to arrest my attention.|$|R
60|$|Lamartine was a {{few minutes}} late. He drove up in a large motor-car with an elderly gentleman, who {{remained}} inside, and with whom he talked {{for a few minutes}} earnestly before <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Just then I heard a rustle, and turning, saw Claude toiling {{down to me}} {{over the}} hill-side. <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me,</b> footsore and weary, but in great excitement; for the first minute or two he could not speak, and at last, - ...|$|R
50|$|Ghrobani {{started his}} {{professional}} career with Nassaji. Later <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> Gahar and reunite {{with his former}} coach Davoud Mahabadi to help them to promote to Iran Pro League with scoring 7 times in Azadegan League. After a successful season in Gahar, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>Mes</b> Sarcheshmeh. On July 13, 2013 <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> Naft Tehran with a two-year contract.|$|R
6000|$|... "At that {{settlement}} {{you will}} find one Captain Remember Baker; tell him {{what has been done}} at this point, and say it is my wish <b>he</b> <b>join</b> <b>me</b> here without delay. Select the lightest boat you can find for crossing the lake, and make all haste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{find a new}} bond {{of union}} between us," [...] he said, as <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "We both feel that." [...] He pointed to the grandly darkening view. [...] "The two men who could have painted the mystery of those growing shadows and fading lights, lie in the graves of Rembrandt and Turner. Shall we go to tea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{waited for}} him on the pier while he went to see her ladyship. <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> again with his bitterest smile. [...] "What did I tell you? She is not well enough to see me to-day. The doctor looks grave, and the {{companion}} puts her handkerchief to her eyes. We may be kept in this place for weeks to come." ...|$|R
60|$|The servant {{was waiting}} for us at the open door. I went an without making any answer. Grosse waited to see Oscar enter the house before him. Oscar's face darkened as <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> in the hall. He looked half angry, half confused. Grosse pushed himself roughly between us, and gave me his arm. I went up-stairs with him, {{wondering}} what it all meant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{had been}} seen of Nugent, when I reached this house. It was not till {{a quarter of an}} hour later that I heard his voice at the door, calling to me, and asking if I had come back. I answered, and <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> in the sitting-room. Nugent's first words to me were these:--" [...] 'Oscar, I have come to ask your pardon, and to bid you good-bye.' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>joined</b> Steel Azin in Summer 2010 {{and stayed}} there for a season but again {{injuries}} did not allow {{him to become a}} regular player and after the relegation of the team his contract was automatically canceled. <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>Mes</b> Kerman in January 2012 and halfway through the season after he missed the first half because of the injury he had {{and was one of the}} regular players of the team. <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> Saba in Summer 2012. He was released by Saba on December 2012 after the appointment of Samad Marfavi as the new coach.|$|R
60|$|To cap it all, Wickson's hunting lodge was {{a quarter}} of a mile from my hiding-place. This, instead of being a danger, was an added security. We were {{sheltered}} under the very aegis of one of the minor oligarchs. Suspicion, by the nature of the situation, was turned aside. The last place in the world the spies of the Iron Heel would dream of looking for me, and for Ernest when <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me,</b> was Wickson's deer-park.|$|R
6000|$|... "He had one chance, but {{he threw}} it away," [...] said Stacy energetically. [...] "If, {{instead of going}} off to Europe by himself to brood over it, <b>he</b> had <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> in business, he'd have been another man." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was after}} one {{tremendous}} day when {{his eyes had}} glared on me like lightning--and his voice sharp and broken seemed unable to express {{the extent of his}} emotion that in the evening when I was alone <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> with a calm countenance, and not noticing my tears which I quickly dried when he approached, told me that in three days that [sic] he intended to remove with me to his estate in Yorkshire, and bidding me prepare left me hastily as if afraid of being questioned.|$|R
6000|$|... "One minute, Miss Jillgall. My girl, {{when you}} give Miss Helena that note, {{try to get a}} sly look at her when she opens it, and come {{and tell me what you}} have seen." [...] <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> in the dining-room, and closed the door. [...] "The other day," [...] he went on, [...] "when I told you what I had {{discovered}} in the chemist's shop, I think I mentioned a young man who was called to speak to a question of identity--an assistant who knew Miss Helena Gracedieu by sight." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} late when it occurred, for my relative, {{who had been}} {{receiving}} even more telegrams than usual during the day, went off to his study after dinner, and only emerged when the household had retired to bed. I heard him go round locking the doors, as custom was of a night, and finally <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> in the billiard-room. His stout figure was wrapped in a dressing-gown, and he wore a pair of red Turkish slippers without any heels. Settling down into an arm-chair, he brewed himself a glass of grog, in which I could not help noticing that the whisky considerably predominated over the water.|$|R
60|$|When I {{returned}} to Singapore I took {{with me the}} Malay lad named Ali, who subsequently accompanied me all over the Archipelago. Charles Allen preferred staying at the Mission-house, and afterwards obtained employment in Sarawak and in Singapore, until <b>he</b> again <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> four years later at Amboyna in the Moluccas.|$|R
50|$|His good {{performances}} {{have earned}} him a number of caps in Team Melli. During the management of Ali Daei as Team Melli head coach, he had become an important {{member of the national}} team. Though, under new Esteghlal coach, Samad Marfavi, he became a substitute player during the first weeks of the season. This led to him not being nominated for the crucial 2011 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Jordan. After spending two seasons with Esteghlal, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> Steel Azin, where he stayed for a season before joining Rah Ahan in 2011 where <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> Daei and stayed for a season. <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>Mes</b> Kerman for 2012-13 season and moved to Fajr Sepasi halfway through the season as he did not get any playing time in Mes. He signed with Aluminium in summer 2013 for one season.|$|R
6000|$|... "And as," [...] he said, [...] "the scraper of chins hath {{no great}} {{love for the}} {{stretcher}} of throats, <b>he</b> has <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> in obtaining from the King an order, commanding the Provost to suspend all proceedings, under whatever pretence, against Quentin Durward; and to respect, on all occasions, the privileges of the Scottish guard." ...|$|R
60|$|They went, {{for their}} going was {{reported}} to me, and I, I entered into hell because I knew that my lord thought me false, {{and that he would}} never learn the truth, namely, that what I did I did to save his life, until at length he came to his own country, if ever he came there, and opened the chests of treasure, if ever he opened them, which perhaps he would not care to do. And all that while he would believe me the wife of Joshua, and--oh! I cannot write of it. And I, I should be dead; I, I could not tell him the truth until <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> in that land of death, if there men and women can talk together any more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care a straw {{whether he}} be angry or not. He allows me eight hundred a year, {{and he knows}} that if he stopped it I should go to the Jews the next day. I could not help myself. He can't leave an acre away from me, and yet <b>he</b> won't <b>join</b> <b>me</b> in raising money for the sake of paying Laura her fortune." ...|$|R
50|$|Zamehran {{started his}} {{professional}} career with Payam Mashhad in 2009 while he promoted to first team by Davoud Mahabadi. He made his debut for Payam in 2010-11 season. Later {{he moved to}} Siah Jamegan in Division 2. After shining with Mashadi side in Division 2, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>Mes</b> Sarcheshmeh. In summer 2013 <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> newly established side, Padideh. {{he was part of}} Padideh in promoting to Pro League in 2014. In 2014-15 season he failed in making any appearances for Padideh, so <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> to Siah Jamegan with a loan contract until end of the season in winter transfer window. He scored 4 times in 10 matches for Siah Jamegan and helped them to promoting to Pro League. In Summer 2015 he moved to Siah Jamegan permanently with a contract until 2016. He made his professional debut in 2-1 loss against Esteghlal on July 30, 2015 where he used as a substitute for Reza Enayati. In his 2nd appearance for Siah Jamegan, he scored against Naft Tehran in 1-0 win.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Tudor is {{not very}} well this morning,' said Mr. Neverbend. 'As his going down is not {{necessary}} for the inquiry, and is {{merely a matter of}} taste on his part, <b>he</b> has not <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> this morning. Come, gentlemen, are we ready?' ...|$|R
60|$|Therefore I {{was driven}} {{at last to}} asking Richard if he would mind convincing me that it really was all over there, as he had said, {{and that it was}} not his mere impression. He showed me without {{hesitation}} a correspondence making it quite plain that his retirement was arranged. I found, from what he told me, that Mr. Vholes had copies of these papers and had been in consultation with him throughout. Beyond ascertaining this, and having been the bearer of Ada's letter, and being (as I was going to be) Richard's companion back to London, I had done no good by coming down. Admitting this to myself with a reluctant heart, I said I would return to the hotel and wait until <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> there, so <b>he</b> threw a cloak over his shoulders and saw me to the gate, and Charley and I went back along the beach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, here I am, my good friend; {{and here}} I {{have been so}} long, that {{anywhere}} else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. <b>He</b> promised to <b>join</b> <b>me</b> here, and pay his respects to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My partner has {{a horror}} of the swamps," [...] Marston remarked with a smile. [...] "If he was not keen to earn some money, he would not enter the lagoon. <b>He</b> has not <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> long and wants his friends to {{think he has a}} talent for business." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were now}} good friends. When {{the other young}} ones {{gathered}} around to tease, <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> with <b>me</b> in attacking them; and so viciously did we behave that before long I was let alone. Lop-Ear made me acquainted with the village. There was little that he could tell me of conditions and customs--he had not the necessary vocabulary; but by observing his actions I learned much, and also he showed me places and things.|$|R
60|$|I {{will think}} of Charley (from whom I have heard here) and soon write to him definitely. At present I think <b>he</b> had better <b>join</b> <b>me</b> at Boulogne. I shall not bring the little boys over, as, if we keep our time, {{it would be too}} long before Christmas Day.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help but laugh at his grim humour, and <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> in with <b>me</b> in one of those rare laughs of real {{enjoyment}} {{which was one of the}} attributes of this fierce Tharkian chief which marked him from the others of his kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because it is a {{place of}} greater danger!" [...] I cried, still {{swarming}} up the shaky bars of wood which were nailed across the side of the building, and when I was come to {{what was left of the}} floor above, I threatened to throw Pierre down if <b>he</b> attempted to <b>join</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I told Leslie {{what had}} happened, and <b>he</b> agreed to <b>join</b> <b>me</b> {{in time to}} escape, for there was no saying what fate might befall us in London; and, indeed, the very next morning severities commenced, {{the whole of the}} troops being obliged to suffer the indignity of having their arms tied behind them, and so being marched into London.|$|R
6000|$|The dog flew towards them, but {{instantly}} ran howling back to me, having {{probably been}} chastised by a stick or a stone. Uncertain {{as to the}} plan of tactics or of treaty which Mr. Geddes might think proper to adopt, I was about to retire into the cottage, when <b>he</b> suddenly <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> at the door, and, slipping his arm through mine, said, 'Let us go to meet them manfully; we have done {{nothing to be ashamed}} of.--Friends,' he said, raising his voice as we approached them, 'who and what are you, and with what purpose are you here on my property?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Confederate General Richard Taylor, son of U.S. President and General Zachary Taylor, {{decided to}} {{challenge}} the Union at Mansfield, rather than waiting until Union commander Nathaniel P. Banks reached Shreveport. This tactic allowed Taylor to face the enemy on more equal terms because the Confederate troops were heavily outnumbered. At noon on April 8, 1864, some 6,400 Union troops faced 10,500 Confederates. The Union formed a line of battle along a rail fence and ridge called [...] "Honeycutt Hill". On orders from Taylor, General Alfred Mouton and his division charged the rail fence. Mouton {{was killed in the}} attack, but General Camille Armand de Polignac, a native of France, continued the advance and overwhelmed Union troops. In a plaque in the museum Taylor is quoted as having said: [...] "The death of the gallant Mouton affected <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me</b> soon after I reached Western Louisiana and had ever proven faithful to duty. Modest, unselfish, and patriotic, he showed best in action, always leading his men." [...] In addition to the monument in his honor, Mouton is honored with an interpretative nature trail in the park.|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the blessings}} {{reserved}} for her here, {{which most of}} all concerns us, was the occasional sight of her Brother. Brother {{in a day or}} two ["18th November," [...] she says; which date is wrong, if it were of moment (see OEuvres de Frederic, xxvii. part 1st, where their CORRESPONDENCE is).] ran over from Ruppin, on short leave, and had his first interview. Very kind and affectionate; quite the old Brother again; and [...] "blushed" [...] when, at supper, Mamma and the Princesses, especially that wicked Charlotte (Papa not present), tore up his poor Bride at such a rate. [...] "Has not a word to answer you, but YES or NO," [...] said they; [...] "stupid as a block." [...] "But were you ever at her toilette?" [...] said the wicked Charlotte: [...] "Out of shape, completely: considerable waddings, I promise you: and then"--still worse features, from that wicked Charlotte, in presence of the domestics here. Wicked Charlotte; who is to be her Sister-in-law soon;--and who is always flirting with my Husband, as if she liked that better!--Crown-Prince retired, directly after supper: as did I, to my apartment, where in a minute or two <b>he</b> <b>joined</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{started to}} show his talent in Zob Ahan and finally moved to Persepolis. The 2007/08 season was his first season at Persepolis and head coach Afshin Ghotbi {{believed}} in him so much that Heidari played in all matches except one for which he received a suspension. He scored the most important goal {{of his career in}} the 96th minute against Sepahan {{on the final day of}} the season which won the league for Persepolis after six years.During the 2008/09 season he was once again put in the starting line up by Afshin Ghotbi but when Ghotbi resigned and Peyrovani took over, Heidari was replaced and played as substitute for some time before being put back in the starting eleven for the AFC Champions League by new coach Nelo Vingada. He extended his contract with Persepolis for two more years in July 2009. He continued as being one of the regular players for 2009-10 season and had a good scoring stats for the season. He became captain of Persepolis on January 2011.He won the Hazfi Cup in 2011 with Persepolis but after the managerial changes the new coach Hamid Estili announced that he does not need Sepehr and he may leave the club. <b>He</b> <b>joined</b> <b>Mes</b> Kerman on 6 July 2011.|$|R
