Depending on the airflow characteristics of the engine, it may be desirable to lower the ramp angle or move the cone rearwards to refocus the shockwaves onto the cowl lip to maximise intake airflow.|$|R
40|$|Cassana {{is placed}} in the Magra River Valley (Tuscany, Italy). A large and slow complex {{landslide}} involves the ancient village and causes severe damage and high risk. Many investigations were performed, aiming at gathering data and information and developing methodologies, in order to realize countermeasures and mitigate the risk. Geological and geomorphological investigations, subsurface exploration (core drillings, seismic refraction survey), geotechnical analysis, deformation and piezometer monitoring were carried out. Moreover, chemical and isotopic analyses on the underground waters were performed, aiming at identifying their <b>intake</b> <b>areas</b> and underground ways in the landslide bodies close to the village. The geochemical and isotopic investigations gave a meaningful contribution in reconstructing a geometric, kinematic and hydrogeological model of the Cassana landslide. This allowed the elaboration of a hypothetical outline of the underground water circulation and the individuation of some <b>intake</b> <b>areas</b> and preferential ways of the underground waters, greatly influencing the landslide and village instability. In conclusion, the geochemical and isotopic approach to the slope instability represents a possible and innovatory application of the chemical-isotopic technique in investigating the landslide causes...|$|R

This led them to an obscure report by two NACA wind tunnel experts, who wrote a report in 1956 titled [...] "Aircraft Configurations Developing High Lift-Drag Ratios at High Supersonic Speeds". Known today as compression lift, {{the idea was to}} use the shock wave generated off the nose or other sharp points on the aircraft as a source of high-pressure air. By carefully positioning the wing in relation to the shock, the shock's high pressure could be captured {{on the bottom of the}} wing and generate additional lift. To take maximum advantage of this effect, they redesigned the underside of the aircraft to feature a large triangular <b>intake</b> <b>area</b> far forward of the engines, better positioning the shock in relation to the wing. The former individually podded engines were repositioned in a single large duct under the fuselage.|$|E

40|$|Background: Trauma {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the burden of disease and mortality throughout the world, but particularly in developing countries. In Tanzania, {{there is an enormous}} research gap on trauma; the limited data available reflects realities in cities and areas with moderately- to highly-resourced treatment centers. Our aim was to provide a description of the injury epidemiology across all of Tanzania. Our data will serve as a basis for future larger studies. Methods: This is a subgroup analysis of a cross-sectional, prospective study of the clinical epidemiology of patients presenting at all public district and regional hospitals in Tanzania. The study was conducted between May 2012 and December 2012. A team of emergency doctors used a purpose-designed data collection sheet to gather the demographic and clinical information of all patients presenting during the day-site visit to each hospital. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges are reported. Results: A total of 5227 patients were seen in 24 -h period in 105 (100 % response rate) district (or designated district) and regional hospitals in mainland Tanzania. Of these patients, 508 (9. 7 %) presented with trauma-related complaints. Among patients with trauma-related complaints, 286 (56. 3 %) were male, and the overall median age of 30 (interquartile range of 22 – 35) years. Road traffic crash was the most common mechanism of injury, accounting for 227 (44. 7 %) complaints. Open wounds and bone fractures were the two most frequent diagnoses, with a combined 300 (59 %) cases. Most of the patients - 325 (64 %) - were discharged, 11 (2. 2 %) went to operating theatres and 4 (0. 8 %) of patients died while receiving care at the acute <b>intake</b> <b>areas.</b> Conclusions: Trauma-related complaints constitute a substantial burden among patients seeking care in acute <b>intake</b> <b>areas</b> of hospitals across Tanzania. There is a need to develop, implement and study systems that can support the improvement of trauma care and optimize outcomes of trauma patients...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} {{to those who have}} loved and inspired me over the past years. i Summary Increased engine power output and efficiency, whilst still satisfying environmental requirements, have been major objectives for vehicle manufacturers in recent years. Vehicle performance enhancement by providing greater engine power coupled with style-driven desires has reduced the size of the engine compartment and the <b>intake</b> <b>areas</b> for internal (underhood) airflow. These changes tend to add extra heat to the engine cooling system and reduce the volume of air passing through the radiator. As a consequence, the cooling airflow through the radiator tends to be reduced and highly distorted. In this study, radiator airflow in a modern passenger vehicle was investigated and it was shown that the bumper bar significantly influenced the cooling airflow, leading to three-dimensional vortices in its wake and generating an area of relatively low velocity across at least one third of the radiator core. Ineffective use o...|$|R

40|$|Water {{begins to}} flow from higher-energy to lower-energy {{positions}} as soon as sediment begins to accumulate in a new sedimentary basin, and flow continues during the sedimentary development of the basin. Water expelled by compaction from the compactible less-permeable beds displaces water in the less-compactible more-permeable beds. Compaction flow also causes subsidence {{that contributes to the}} sedimentary development of a basin. The pattern of flow is determined by the stratigraphy. In transgressive sequences, it is downwards in mudstone to the basal permeable unit and then lateral towards the land of the time. In regressive sequences, it is upwards and downwards in mudstones towards the intercalated sandstones and then lateral in these towards the land. In compacting sequences of alternating sandstones and mudstones, the sandstones drain distinct isolated hydraulic units that are related to the stratigraphy. When a sedimentary basin ceases to accumulate sediment and compaction has reached equilibrium, the flow patterns change and the main energy comes from elevation of the <b>intake</b> <b>areas.</b> In rift basins the main source of compaction water is the thick mudstone in the post-unconformity-disconformity sequence.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} research is to solve problems of water-budget estimation in particularly indeterminate conditions, of the kind that are frequently encountered in the field, in which absence or insufficiency of hydrographic instrumentation prevents the adequate evaluation of runoff. To do this we have developed techniques that are based on the method of Kennessey (1930), in which the runoff coefficient of a watershed in estimated using three physiographic variables (slope angle, permeability, and vegetation cover) and a parameter that delines the climatic conditions of the lacal area. Our comparison of the Kennessey method with instrumental records {{from a wide variety of}} instrumented drainage basins in centrai Italy shows that the method provides reliable estimates of runoff. Our analysis al so indicates the best criteria tor its application, as shown by the examples and results presented in this article. This research enables us to present a new application of the method, namely the runoff coefficient map, which, in addition to its specific usefulness far the evaluation of runoff, has three advantages. First, it supplies a mare realistic vision of the local distribution of runoff/rainfali ratios; second, it allows one to overcome the spatial constraints imposed by the narrow frame of reference represented by the watershed; and third, it makes an important contribution to the solution of other hydrogeological problems, such as the evaluation of the amount of water required far adequate recharge of the <b>intake</b> <b>areas</b> of deep aquifers ar the maintenance of geothermal processes.
