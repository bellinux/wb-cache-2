Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness, pilot qualification, the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried. The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972. In 1991 it started working within the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Requirements</b> (JAR), throughout the European Union (EU). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues, retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA. Proposed developments seek to establish EASA as the single authority throughout the EU, taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of EASA.|$|E

With in-line tandem seating, the trainer {{was developed in}} accordance with the Federal Aviation Regulations (<b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Requirements)</b> 23 regulations for acrobatic category of airplanes and it provides an easy transition to Kobac and then to jet at higher training levels. The LASTA is equipped with a six-cylinder 224 kW (300 HP) engine of the opposed-cylinder type, and a two-bladed metal propeller Hartzell HC-C2YR-4CF/FC 8475-6, which provides maximum flight velocity (at an altitude of 3000m and a takeoff weight of 1085 kg) of 345 km/h. The empty weight is 888 kg, and the maximum takeoff weight is 1210 kg for the aerobatic category and 1450 kg for the utility (armed) category. The total aircraft length is 7.97m. The trapezoidal wings have a wingspan of 9.7 m and a surface of 12.9 m2. The altitude barrier of flight is 6000 m. This propeller-driven low-wing aircraft has a tricycle retractable landing gear suitable for rough-field operations. Onboard GPS and Instrument Landing System (ILS) support the operations during CAT-II weather conditions. The aircraft is equipped with Mode S transponder for flight identification. Besides for training purposes, it can be used for combat fire training, rocket firing and bombing. The armed version of the LASTA 95 can be equipped with 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine guns, 57 mm rocket launchers or bombs weighing up to 120 kg on two hardpoints.|$|E

This article outlines the development of a European NTS behavioral marker system for crew resource management evaluation called NOTECHS and presents preliminary results from an ongoing test phase of this system (<b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Requirements</b> Translation and Elaboration of Legislation [JARTEL]). The JARTEL project has involved 105 instructors from 14 European airlines who were given a short training session to use the NOTECHS system. After the training phase, these instructor pilots used the system to evaluate the individual CRM skills of captains and first officers in 8 different video scenarios filmed in a Boeing 757 simulator. Issues relating to rater training, reliability, and accuracy, as well as the instructors 2 Ì† 7 opinions on the acceptability of the method, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|European {{aviation}} {{is moving}} into an exciting phase now, the administrative structure is changing. Aviation rules and aviation medicine {{will get a}} new structure as well. The nature of air traffic required an international scope in rulemaking â€“ especially in such a confined continent as Europe with 41 countries, about 380 Million inhabitants and 317 billion person kilometres flown each year. For economic reasons it became necessary to develop common standards for certification of aircraft {{in the beginning of}} the 1970 ies, maintenance followed later on. The Cyprus arrangement of 01 July 1990 created the JAA (Joint Aviation Authorities). <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Requirements</b> were drafted to replace existing national provisions and have been implemented from the end of the 1990 ies. The areas of air operations and pilot licensing have been covered as well. The latter comprises of aviation medicine as well. The implementation of JAR-FCL 3, which covers the medical requirements for pilots, started from 1999 on in the several JAA member states. A detailed overview about development and structure of JAA, tools for harmonisation, rulemaking and amendment of requirements, medical standards, review procedures for contentious or marginal cases is described...|$|E
