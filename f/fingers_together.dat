500|$|Goalkeepers {{must be able}} {{to perform}} the eggbeater kick to a high standard. Before the eggbeater kick, goalkeepers would use breaststroke which meant that they could not stay up for very long and players found it easier to score. By using the eggbeater kick, goalkeepers can raise their bodies high enough in the water to be able to block shots at the goal for longer periods of time. This can be used conjunctively with sculling, [...] in which the goalkeeper keeps their hands closed (with the <b>fingers</b> <b>together)</b> and moves them {{forwards}} and backwards.|$|E

50|$|A {{single centre}} stick {{controls}} the ailerons and elevators. Electrical pitch trim {{is controlled by}} two buttons {{on the top of}} the stick, operated by the thumb. A push to talk button is on the front of the stick, operated by the index <b>finger,</b> <b>together</b> with a vertical hand operated brake lever similar to a motorcycle front brake lever.|$|R

500|$|While {{playing with}} Providence in 1883, Irwin broke {{the third and}} fourth fingers of his left hand. Not wanting to miss any games, he {{obtained}} an oversized buckskin driving glove, padded it and sewed {{the third and fourth}} <b>fingers</b> <b>together</b> to allow space for bandages. He used the glove even after his fingers healed. John Montgomery Ward of New York soon took the field with a similar glove. By the following season, almost every professional player was using the [...] "Irwin glove." [...] Prior to 1884, use of gloves was limited to first basemen and catchers. In 1882, Irwin committed a league-high 78 errors in 84 games. He committed 66 errors in 98 games the following year. Over his next two seasons with the glove, Irwin committed 98 errors in 163 games.|$|E
500|$|Other {{crew members}} accept the cancellation, but Shatner and Nimoy try {{to hang on}} to their Star Trek personae as Kirk and Spock. However, Nimoy is {{eventually}} reduced to a sobbing, nervous wreck, and is carried off the set. Shatner remains defiantly in the Captain's chair, as Herb Goodman mentions to Shatner he {{got a phone call from}} a margarine company. Finally, the set is completely dismantled, and still in his chair, Shatner, as Captain Kirk, makes a final entry into his log recalling his previous three years of space exploration, concluding: [...] "And except for one television network, we have found intelligence everywhere in the galaxy." [...] Raising his hand in the Vulcan salute, he goes on, [...] "Live long and prosper". Then he brings his <b>fingers</b> <b>together,</b> his hand still raised, and adds, [...] "Promise".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{this long}} gestation, the boiler's origins {{appear to have}} been most direct. Yarrow's initial {{conversation}} with William Crush, head of the boiler department, is recorded to have included a rather direct approach and Yarrow's statements, [...] "We must wake-up about water-tube boilers", [...] "Why not a boiler like this?" [...] (placing his <b>fingers</b> <b>together</b> as if praying), and [...] "Straight tubes?" [...] already expressed two of the boiler's three basic design principles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{voice of}} Howard, Chip Zien, was not cast until after {{shooting}} completed. Because Ed Gale's voice {{was difficult to}} hear when he wore his suit, Huyck ordered Gale to perform his scenes without speaking any of the required dialogue, which was later synchronized during the editing process. Lead puppeteer Tim Rose was given a microphone attached to a small speaker, which would allow Rose to speak the dialogue to help the actors respond to Howard's dialogue. While wearing his suit, Gale could only see through Howard's mouth, and had to sense his location without proper eyesight. Gale often had to walk backwards before beginning rehearsals. In between takes, a hair dryer was stuffed in Howard's bill to keep Gale cool. Gale taped two of his <b>fingers</b> <b>together</b> [...] to wear the three-fingered hands created for the Howard costume. A total of six actors gave physical performances as Howard.|$|E
2500|$|... "Berlin", set {{later in}} the season, {{features}} Tony and Ziva departing for Germany to track down Ilan Bodnar, her father's killer. Before the episode aired, Glasberg disclosed that they would share a slow dance while there, resulting in [...] "a very personal moment of vulnerability where her guard goes down and she lets herself melt into his arms". De Pablo added, [...] "You also see [...] as a man Teddy Bear — like, a very sweet but manly man, a guy who's really {{taking care of a}} situation and really wants to make it better, a guy who's not looking for the joke or is uncomfortable staring at a woman or reaching out to hold her hand." [...] This is highlighted in the closing scenes as the two of them drive home from the airport, and Ziva explains her animosity towards Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), the new director of Mossad: Elbaz was the reason her parents split up. She tells Tony, [...] "If it were not for Orli, things would be different. I would be a different person." [...] Tony then takes her hand, and Ziva intertwines their <b>fingers</b> <b>together.</b> Tony replies, [...] "Then I should catch her before she leaves, you know, and thank her." [...] The episode ends with a cliffhanger when an unknown vehicle crashes into them, leaving their fates unknown.|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} demonstrated, by mining observational data, that forest-living orangutans {{can communicate}} using gestures that qualify as pantomime. 1 Pantomimes, like other iconic gestures, physically resemble their referents. 2, 3 More elaborately, pantomimes involve enacting their referents. 4 Holding thumb and <b>finger</b> <b>together</b> at the lips and blowing between them to mean “balloon” is one example. 5 Here we sketch evidence of pantomime in other great apes, methodological concerns and sophisticated cognitive capabilities that great ape pantomimes suggest...|$|R

50|$|A {{common problem}} players {{had with the}} game was {{that many of the}} events {{required}} a power meter to be built up by rapidly pressing the A button, then releasing it with the B button. Many players could not press the A button fast enough to build up enough power, though it could be done with a turbo controller, or using a method similar to stringing a guitar, by holding the controller against the players chest or a flat surface and using the thumb and index <b>finger</b> <b>together</b> running them rapidly across the A button.|$|R

5000|$|The main protagonist, Goku, learns from {{an alien}} species {{on how to}} {{teleport}} across the universe in the manga / anime series Dragon Ball. The technique was coined, [...] "Instant Transmission" [...] (瞬間移動, Shunkan Idō, lit. Instant Movement), where Goku would focus his index and middle <b>finger</b> <b>together</b> towards his forehead and concentrate on a location he could sense through clairvoyant means through the practice of Qi Gong/Ki that is prevalent in the Dragon Ball universe. It was taught to Goku {{when he was on}} Planet Yardrat after his deadly battle with Frieza on Planet Namek.|$|R
