25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

Roosevelt in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour {{millions of dollars into}} the pursuit of an atomic bomb. When George B. Pegram and Harold Urey visited Britain to see how the project, now known as Tube Alloys, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will." ...|$|E

500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying [...] "Some of the stories <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach." [...] Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came [...] "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, but love for my children and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals." ...|$|E

In 2014 he wrote that he still had investigators working the case and knew more than {{he was able to}} say.

The album sold 55,000 copies {{in its first}} week and landed at No. 20 on the Billboard charts, his highest debut to date. Yanni described the album as more of an even-tempered [...] "listening" [...] album, less dramatic than the live concert albums Live at the Acropolis or Tribute. He explained that he himself created all of the album's sounds, including apparent vocalizations, through the manipulation of sound in his studio.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2010, it was {{announced}} that Paul Reubens was working with Judd Apatow on a new Pee-wee Herman feature film set up at Universal Pictures, with Reubens and Paul Rust set to write the script. In an October 2014, interview with Rolling Stone, Reubens gave an update on the status of the film, saying: [...] "It's been months and months of being right {{on the verge of being}} announced…I thought something was going to go public yesterday, actually, and that you’d be the first person I’d be talking about this with. But I’m thinking there will be something made public very soon. It's going to get made shortly after the new year. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about it right now, because…I mean, it's amazing. It's going to be amazing. It think it first got leaked four years ago or so that the movie was going to be made, and ever since then it's just been stalling and stalling. So I'm really ready for this to happen. But I’m not kidding: It's very imminent." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alternative Press in September 2010 (in an article praising the album 10 years later) when asked [...] "What's your least favorite thing about the album?" [...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a wonderful person and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix. [...] I just find it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to." [...] The album was included in Rock Sounds 101 Modern Classics list at number 4.

Then comes [...] "Kisses Down Low", an R and electronic track written by Marquel Middlebrooks, Timothy and Theron Thomas, Rowland, Mike Will Made It, with the latter producing the song. Rap-Up described the song as a [...] "bedroom banger", whilst Billboards Andrew Hampp described the song as an [...] "unofficial" [...] sequel to Rowland's most successful and sexually explicit single, 2010's [...] "Motivation" [...] (featuring Lil Wayne). Third in the album, is the adult contemporary-influenced [...] "Gone", which features American rapper Wiz Khalifa. Harmony Samuels produced the [...] "base-heavy" [...] and radio friendly [...] "snapping" [...] beat which features a prominent sample of [...] "Big Yellow Taxi", a 1970s single by American singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. It lyrically speaks about a [...] "man who played with her heart" [...] and how [...] "she’s done putting up with his games". Lyrics from Rowland include [...] "There's a million ways that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> / But I think I would rather show you that it's over / And I won't be back no more", whilst Khalifa raps [...] "I been here before / And you know Kelly never lied / So {{you can get your}} stuff / And get to going / I'll get back to getting high".|$|E

2500|$|His sister-in-law, Princess Charlotte, {{claims that}} the King did {{participate}} in homosexual activity after his trip to Italy in 1784 {{and that there were}} several rumors about this: she claims that she herself had witnessed that the park at Drottningholm Palace had become a place where male courtiers searched for homosexual partners, and in a letter to Sophie von Fersen, she writes in code: [...] "It is said that the King recently attacked a young man in the park at night and offered him the post of chamberlain to the Queen if he agreed to his lusts, but the young man preferred to leave. Agree that this is to take things to far. It is said that the trips to Svartsjö Palace are made to be provide privacy, it is unbelievable, but {{it is what it is}} said. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a million things about this." [...] In 1791, Sophia Magdalena herself paid a surprise visit to the King during his stay at the Gustav III's Pavilion, where the King had spent more time since he came in conflict with the nobility after the 1789 parliament; and where he was reputed to indulge in orgies. She found the King in bed, and he asked one of his favorites, Count Fabian Wrede, to show her around. In the King's private chamber, however, the Queen found the actor and page of the King, Lars Hjortsberg, sleeping, naked. The Queen reacted by interrupting the tour by saying to Wrede that he apparently did not know his way around Haga, as he had obviously showed her the chamber of the staff rather than the King by mistake.|$|E
