5|$|While {{being treated}} for various injuries, Favre {{developed}} an addiction to Vicodin, which became publicly known when he suffered a seizure during a hospital visit. Amid an NFL investigation, he went public to avoid any rumors about his condition. In May 1996, he went <b>into</b> <b>treatment</b> and remained in rehabilitation for 46 days. Had he chosen not to go, the NFL would have imposed a $900,000 fine.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s, {{new drugs}} became {{available}} and were incorporated <b>into</b> <b>treatment</b> {{for the mentally}} ill. The new drugs effectively reduced severe symptoms, allowing the mentally ill to live in environments less stringent than institutions, such as halfway houses, nursing homes, or their own homes. Drug therapy also allowed many mentally ill to obtain employment.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} active investigations <b>into</b> <b>treatments</b> for a compromised blood–brain barrier.

25|$|A double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study in}} adult polydrug users in a detoxification program showed {{the efficacy of}} prasterone treatment combined with psychosocial enrichment and after-care. Prasterone administration positively affected decision-making, mood and well-being as early as one month <b>into</b> <b>treatment,</b> and had a long-lasting preventive effect on relapse to drug use. In a 16-month follow-up, relapse rates of prasterone-treated subjects were only 11.5%. No adverse symptoms were found. These findings demonstrate the long-term effect of prasterone on drug relapse.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{carries a}} black box warning for drug-induced {{agranulocytosis}}. Without monitoring, agranulocytosis occurs in about 1% {{of people who}} take clozapine {{during the first few}} months of treatment; the risk of developing it is highest about three months <b>into</b> <b>treatment,</b> and decreases substantially thereafter, to less than 0.01% after one year. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} reasons that EBPs have been so {{successfully}} incorporated <b>into</b> <b>treatment</b> services is the vast amount of studies linking clients’ improved health outcomes and the general attitude that treatments should be based in scientific evidence (Institute of Medicine, 2001; Sackett & Haynes, 1995). It is now assumed that professionals must be well-informed and up-to-date with the newest knowledge in order to best serve their clients and remain professionally relevant (Gibbs, 2003; Pace, 2008; Patterson et al., 2012).|$|E

25|$|Untreated filthy {{surface runoff}} was (as of 2008) {{the main source}} of pollution; in the 1980s it contributed one to eight times more {{petrochemical}} waste than direct industrial waste. As of 2008, nearly 80% of the surface runoff in the Central Administrative District is still flushed into the Moskva and Yauza untreated. Until 2000 the river was used in winter as a dump for snow collected from the streets, adding chlorides, soot, rubbish and more oil into the mix. This practice is now banned; the city now employs a network of snow-melting dumps that feed polluted water <b>into</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities.|$|E
25|$|Even as {{clinical}} psychology was growing, working {{with issues of}} serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I {{with the development of}} two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. Due {{in large part to the}} success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of {{clinical psychology}} for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field <b>into</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{computer}} {{technology has been}} incorporated <b>into</b> <b>treatment</b> options. A key indication for good prognosis is treatment intensity. A minimum of two–three hours per week has been specified to produce positive results. The main advantage of using computers {{is that it can}} greatly increase intensity of therapy. These programs consist of a large variety of exercises and can be done at home in addition to face-to-face treatment with a therapist. However, since aphasia presents differently among individuals, these programs must be dynamic and flexible in order to adapt to the variability in impairments. Another barrier is the capability of computer programs to imitate normal speech and keep up with the speed of regular conversation. Therefore, {{computer technology}} seems to be limited in a communicative setting, however is effective in producing improvements in communication training.|$|E

25|$|Epithelial {{surfaces}} may sustain {{damage from}} radiation therapy. Depending {{on the area}} being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks <b>into</b> <b>treatment.</b> The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and {{for up to about}} one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this moist desquamation is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.|$|E

[...] Martha Logan takes part in a plot to get her husband to confess that he conspired with terrorists.

500|$|Bladder: Symptomatology of the {{urinary tract}} {{is common in}} MS. Treatments for bladder {{problems}} {{vary depending on the}} origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided <b>into</b> <b>treatment</b> of bladder control and incontinence, and of urinary tract infections. Regarding bladder control, some examples of medications used are desmopressin for nocturia and anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin and tolterodine for urinary urgency. Non-pharmacological management includes pelvic floor muscle training, stimulation, pessaries, bladder retraining, changes to daily life habits such as clothing, use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women; [...] and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization. Regarding long term catheterization, it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible. Some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in MS but are general recommendations for those who have neurogenic bladder.|$|E
