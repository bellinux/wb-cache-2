5|$|In The Ethnostate, Robertson {{declares}} polyethnicity as {{an ideal}} that only lessens each culture.

Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of <b>ethnicity</b> and thus hinders each <b>ethnicity</b> in all aspects of culture.|$|E

5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{immigrants}} to the United States, the [...] "melting pot" [...] process has been equated with Americanization, that is, cultural assimilation and acculturation. The [...] "melting pot" [...] metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of <b>ethnicities,</b> yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage. Thus African-Americans are fully culturally integrated into American culture and institutions. Yet {{more than a century}} after the abolition of slavery, intermarriage between African-Americans and other <b>ethnicities</b> is much less common than between different white <b>ethnicities,</b> or between white and Asian <b>ethnicities.</b> Intermarriage between whites and non-whites, and especially African-Americans, has long been a taboo in the United States, and was illegal in many US states (see anti-miscegenation laws) until 1967.|$|R

Christianity plays an important part to the indigenous cultures in the interior side in the daily lives of the Kadazan-Dusun, Lundayeh, Murut and Rungus beside their old practice of the traditional Animism and Paganism.

30|$|Fei Xiaotong {{called it}} “Tibetan-Yi Corridor” because {{nowadays}} the Tibetan and Yi {{people are the}} two most populous ethnic groups in the corridor, occupying the widest area, and they were thus used as reference. However, with regards to the ethnic connotation of the Tibetan-Yi Corridor, in 1981  Ma Yao used the term “the corridor of the Tibeto-Burman ethnic group” in a speech delivered {{at the opening of the}} Institute of Chinese South-Western <b>Ethnicities.</b> Although this nomenclature may not be as aesthetically pleasing and widespread as “Tibetan-Yi Corridor,” it reflects more accurately the ethnic connotation of this corridor.

40|$|We {{examine the}} long-run {{consequences}} of the scramble for Africa among European powers in the late 19 th century and uncover the following empirical regularities. First, using information on the spatial distribution of African <b>ethnicities</b> before colonization, we show that borders were arbitrarily drawn. Apart from the land mass and water area of an <b>ethnicity's</b> historical homeland, no other geographic, ecological, historical, and ethnic-specific traits predict which ethnic groups have been partitioned by the national border. Second, using data on the location of civil conflicts after independence, we show that partitioned ethnic groups have suffered significantly more warfare; moreover, partitioned <b>ethnicities</b> have experienced more prolonged and more devastating civil wars. Third, we identify sizeable spillovers; civil conflict spreads from the homeland of partitioned <b>ethnicities</b> to nearby ethnic regions. These results are robust to a rich set of controls at a fine level and the inclusion of country fixed effects and ethnic-family fixed effects. The uncovered evidence thus identifies a sizable causal impact of the scramble for Africa on warfare. Africa; borders; conflict; development; <b>ethnicities...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for bias from population stratification has raised doubts to candidate gene case-control studies. We evaluated such potential in relating a binary disease outcome with candidate gene(s) when study population consists of multiple <b>ethnicities.</b> Logistic regression models were fitted between the disease outcome and gene(s). Biases on main effects and interaction estimates due to population stratification {{were evaluated by}} comparing regression coefficients in mis-specified models that ignored <b>ethnicities</b> with their counterparts in models that accounted for <b>ethnicities.</b> These were carried out in three parts. In part I, bias on one candidate gene effect estimation was evaluated; In part II, two genes in different degrees of linkage disequilibria and with multiplicative interaction effects were specified to examine potential biases due to population stratification in estimates of gene-gene interaction as well as main effects. In part III, bias correction was considered for one candidate gene using a single null marker {{under a variety of}} conditions. We illustrated large sample biases due to population stratification under various common practical settings, and derived algebraic bounds for the biases under extreme conditions. Our results indicated that the magnitude of biases due to population stratification increased when differences in genotype frequencies and disease risks across <b>ethnicities</b> increased. Biases due to population stratification decreased as the number of <b>ethnicities</b> increased. Biases in interaction estimates were most serious when two genes were in linkage disequilibria, even when marginal distributions of both genes were the same across <b>ethnicities.</b> For one candidate gene, introducing a single null marker to the regressions that ignored <b>ethnicities</b> could reduce bias substantially. ...|$|R
