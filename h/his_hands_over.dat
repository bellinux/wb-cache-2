5|$|In late 1961, {{there were}} violent {{confrontations}} between NOI members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested. They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised. Just after midnight on April27, 1962, two LAPD officers shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27 without provocation. A large crowd of angry Muslims came outside from the mosque. The officers attempted to intimidate the crowd. One officer was disarmed by the crowd; his partner {{was shot in}} the elbow by a third officer. More than 70 backup officers arrived. They raided the mosque and randomly beat NOI members. Police officers shot seven Muslims, including William X Rogers, who was hit in the back and paralyzed for life, and Ronald Stokes, a Korean War veteran, who was shot from behind while raising <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> his head to surrender, killing him.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.|$|E
5|$|Murrell {{claimed that}} he could exorcise malevolent spirits, destroy witches, and restore lost or stolen {{property}} to its owner, {{as well as providing}} services as an astrologer, herbalist, and animal healer. He charged a halfpenny for curing warts, and two shillings and six pence for breaking a witch's spell. He was reputed to cure sick animals by passing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> their affected area, muttering a prayer, and then hanging an amulet about their neck, and was requested to use these powers at farms in Essex, Suffolk, and northern Kent. During his lifetime, Murrell was known {{on both sides of the}} Thames Estuary, although not apparently beyond that. He did however receive postal correspondence from a range of places, including from Essex girls who were working as maids in London.|$|E

25|$|When Elisha heard, {{he invited}} the king to send Naaman to him, and so Naaman came to Elisha's {{house with his}} horses and his chariots. Elisha sent a {{messenger}} to Naaman {{to tell him to}} wash seven times in the Jordan River and be healed, but that angered Naaman, who expected Elisha to come out, call on the name of God, and wave <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> Naaman. Naaman asked whether the Amanah and Pharpar rivers of Damascus were not better than any river in Israel, so that he might wash in them and be clean.|$|E
25|$|Thereafter {{the three}} men {{formally}} seized the convent in favour of the new Jesuit college founded in Stade in order to Catholicise the local population. Jesuit Father Kalkhoven literally appropriated the abbatial ring, the kitchen pothook, the keys of the convent, and a sod from the convent garden, representing its landed estates. Kalkhoven also took possession of the Lutheran former abbey church by ceremonially posing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> the altar. Already on 26July/ 5August 1630O.S./N.S. socage farmers from Himmelpforten had been gathered {{in order to make}} them render homage to their new lord, the Society of Jesus. Kalkhoven then usurped the title of Provost of Himmelpforten. Kalkhoven appointed Erich Raschke as administrator, later expelled by the Swedes who took Himmelpforten in early May 1632.|$|E
500|$|In his defence, Tabak {{claimed that}} the killing had not been sexually motivated, and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed {{when he tried to}} kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a [...] "flirty comment" [...] and invited him to drink with her. He said that after she screamed he held <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> her mouth and around her neck to silence her. He denied {{suggestions}} of a struggle, claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and [...] "... for about 20 seconds". He told the court that after dumping the body he was [...] "... in a state of panic".|$|E

500|$|Beiderbecke's father, {{the son of}} German immigrants, was a well-to-do {{coal and}} lumber merchant, named after the Iron Chancellor of his native Germany. Beiderbecke's mother was the {{daughter}} of a Mississippi riverboat captain. She played the organ at Davenport's First Presbyterian Church, and encouraged young Bix's interest in the piano. Beiderbecke was the youngest of three children. His brother, Burnie, was born in 1895, and his sister, Mary Louise, in 1898. He began playing piano at age two or three. His sister recalls that he stood on the floor and played it with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> his head. Five years later, he was the subject of an admiring article in the Davenport Daily Democrat that proclaimed: [...] "Seven-year-old boy musical wonder! Little Bickie Beiderbecke plays any selection he hears." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of keyboard tone clusters {{is widely considered}} an [...] "extended technique"—large clusters require unusual playing methods often involving the fist, the flat of the hand, or the forearm. Thelonious Monk and Karlheinz Stockhausen each performed clusters with their elbows; Stockhausen developed a method for playing cluster glissandi with special gloves. Don Pullen would play moving clusters by rolling the backs of <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> the keyboard. Boards of various dimension are sometimes employed, as in the Concord Sonata ( [...] 1904–19) of Charles Ives; they can be weighted down to execute clusters of long duration. Several of Lou Harrison's scores call {{for the use of}} an [...] "octave bar", crafted to facilitate high-speed keyboard cluster performance. Designed by Harrison with his partner William Colvig, the octave bar is ...|$|E
500|$|Fitzsimmons went {{to court}} to {{overturn}} Earp's decision. Newspaper accounts and testimony {{over the next two}} weeks revealed a conspiracy among the boxing promoters to fix the fight's outcome. Newspapers across the United States republished the stories from the San Francisco papers and looked for local angles. On December 14, 1896, the San Francisco Call quoted a story from the New York Journal by Alfred H. Lewis, [...] "who knew the 'bad men' in Arizona. He said that the Earps in Tombstone were [...] "stage robbers" [...] who [...] "stood up stages and plundered express companies for a livelihood... The Earps, Wyatt, Virgil, Warren and Julian, had treated themselves to many a killing... Warren Earp, who was a stage-company guard, meekly put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> his head... it was from all standpoints a family affair {{on the part of the}} Earps. Often they got as high as $25,000... Virgil, as marshal, would enlist Wyatt, Warren and Julian, together with Curly Bill, their cousin, and hunt the hold-ups." [...] Earp was parodied in editorial cartoon caricatures by newspapers across the United States.|$|E

500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> his head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the May 2014 {{military}} coup, Pravit and {{a fellow}} journalist, Thanapol Eawsakul, were summoned by the military on 23 May 2014. Before answering the summons, Pravit told the Thai media, [...] "I hope people will not give up the spirit and that General Prayuth {{will be the last}} dictator of Thailand". He was said to have added: [...] "They can detain me, but can never detain my conscience". He thereupon taped his mouth shut and put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> his ears. On the following day he went with a lawyer and representatives of the UN to the headquarters of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). He was questioned for five hours without his lawyer being present and was then taken to an unidentified detention center.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Talmud, {{the reading}} of the Shema morning and evening fulfils the commandment [...] "You shall meditate therein day and night". As soon as a child begins to speak, his father is {{directed}} to teach him the verse [...] "Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob" [...] (Deut. 33:4), and teach him to read the Shema (Talmud, Sukkah 42a). The reciting of the first verse of the Shema is called [...] "the acceptance of the yoke of the kingship of God" [...] (kabalat ol malchut shamayim) (Mishnah Berachot 2:5). Judah ha-Nasi, who spent all day involved with his studies and teaching, said just the first verse of the Shema in the morning (Talmud Berachot 13b) [...] "as he passed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> his eyes" [...] which appears to be the origin of the Jewish custom to cover the eyes with the right hand whilst reciting the first verse.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Gunther Schuller declared, [...] "On {{one point}} there is {{universal}} agreement: Tatum's awesome technique." [...] That technique {{was marked by}} a calm physical demeanor and efficiency. [...] Tatum did not indulge in theatrical physical or facial expression. [...] The effortless gliding of <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> difficult passages baffled most who witnessed the phenomenon. [...] He especially astonished other pianists to whom Tatum appeared to be [...] "playing the impossible." [...] Even when playing scintillating runs at high velocity, it appeared that his fingers hardly moved. [...] Hank Jones said: When I finally met him and {{got a chance to}} hear him play in person, it seemed as if he wasn't really exerting much effort, he had an effortless way of playing. It was deceptive. You'd watch him and you couldn't believe what was coming out, what was reaching your ears. He didn't have that much motion at the piano. He didn’t make a big show of moving around and waving his hands and going through all sorts of physical gyrations to produce the music that he produced, so that in itself is amazing. There had to be intense concentration there, but you couldn’t tell by just looking at him play.|$|E

2500|$|Late in the 2008–09 season, Ovechkin {{garnered}} {{some criticism}} over his exuberant after-goal celebrations. In 28 February 2009, segment of Hockey Night in Canadas Coach's Corner, Canadian hockey analyst Don Cherry likened Ovechkin's celebrations of {{jumping into the}} boards and his teammates to that of soccer players, concluding {{that this was not}} the Canadian way and advising Canadian kids to ignore Ovechkin's example. Capitals coach Bruce Boudreau came to Ovechkin's defense, stating Cherry [...] "doesn't know Alex like we know Alex", and Ovechkin himself stated that he [...] "doesn't care" [...] about Cherry. The next notable incident happened on 19 March 2009, in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After scoring his 50th goal of the season, Ovechkin put his stick on the ice, pretending to warm <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> it because it was [...] "hot." [...] The incident sparked an immediate response from Tampa Bay coach Rick Tocchet, who said that [...] " [...] went down a notch in my books." [...] Boudreau had also stated that he would discuss the incident with Ovechkin, and teammate Mike Green, despite being the first to celebrate with Ovechkin afterwards, commented that he did not wish to join in the pre-meditated celebration. Ovechkin himself was unapologetic, and said about Don Cherry in particular, [...] "He's going to be pissed off for sure...I love it!." ...|$|E
