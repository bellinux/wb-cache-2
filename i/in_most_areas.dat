Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas</b> the ordinary legislative procedure applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass.

5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas,</b> males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
5|$|Buses are an {{important}} part of the Northern transport mix, with bus ridership above the England and Wales average in all three Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England, and the region saw intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car ownership in the same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher than <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas</b> of the South.|$|E

5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas.</b> Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to the}} border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|On {{the island}} of Barbados, {{sustained}} winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) while gusts reached 92mph (149km/h), which damaged many trees and roofs. A total of 531houses were damaged, of which 43 were completely destroyed. Additionally, four hotels sustained some damage. The winds left most of island without electricity, though officials worked quickly to restore the power. Rainfall from the storm was light, with less than 1inch (25mm) <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas.</b> Storm surge and wave action caused beach erosion that severely damaged most coastal roads. One death was reported on the island, and damage was estimated at more than $5million (2004USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} twelve {{thousand}} years {{the most significant}} new geological features have been the deposits of peat {{and the development of}} coastal alluvium. Post-glacial rises in sea level have been combined with isostatic rises of the land resulting in a relative fall in sea level <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas.</b> In some places, such as Culbin in Moray, these changes in relative sea level have created a complex series of shorelines. A rare type of Scottish coastline found largely in the Hebrides consists of machair habitat, a low lying dune pasture land formed as the sea level dropped leaving a raised beach. In the present day, Scotland continues to move slowly north.|$|E

5|$|Providing an {{adequate}} water supply for Hong Kong {{has always been}} difficult because the region has few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate groundwater sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard granite bedrock found <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas</b> in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water demand is met by importing water from the Dongjiang River in neighbouring Guangdong province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed {{by the use of}} seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.|$|E
5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas,</b> with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis {{seized from}} the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles {{of weapons and}} raw materials such as copper, tin, oil and nickel. Financial demands were levied on {{the governments of the}} occupied countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas</b> of Europe, {{but not as much as}} during World War I. Greece experienced famine in the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war.|$|E

5|$|Across eastern Mexico, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused mudslides and floods, which {{damaged or destroyed}} 90,000houses, and damaged or destroyed about 3,088,000acres (1,250,000hectares) of crop fields; thousands of livestock were also killed. The floods affected 819 Municipalities of Mexico in 17states and the federal district, leaving about 500,000people homeless, of whom half were in Tabasco and Veracruz states. Several ports were closed due to the floods. Although power lines were downed, most electrical systems were not damaged, and power was quickly restored within a week <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas.</b> A total of 39rivers overflowed, which washed away bridges, roads, dams, and some entire houses, and {{there were thousands of}} landslides, mostly in unpopulated areas. Collectively, 28federal highways and 300rural roads were closed or damaged. The federal highway network sustained damage in 1,237locations as a result of 1,164landslides or mudslides and 28damaged bridges. Damage was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos).|$|E
5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{increasingly}} {{supported the}} RSK and the Croatian Police {{were unable to}} cope with the situation, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (HV) in November. The development of the Croatian armed forces was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the Battle of the barracks, the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. Even though the Sarajevo Agreement led to a ceasefire <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas</b> of Croatia, the siege and fighting around Dubrovnik continued until May 1992.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains {{from the}} remnant {{low-pressure}} area of Bonnie led to heavy rains {{in several states}} in the Southeastern United States. Rainfall was generally minor <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas,</b> however in Arkansas, rains totaled up to 11.75in (254mm) at the South Arkansas Regional Airport. Several roads were washed out in Ouachita County near Elliott. A number of roads and bridges were also washed out in Union County, with damage totaling $200,000. U.S. Route 79 was closed between Magnolia and Stephens because of standing water. Three or four families evacuated near the Ouachita-Union County line after the Smackover Creek overflowed its banks and flooded 20homes. There was also a small area of heavy rains totaling up to 5in (127mm) along the border of Tennessee and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{influenced}} by its parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas,</b> but nearly every level features a character who may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora's party in Halloween Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both, can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain Halloween costumes in Halloween Town {{to blend in with}} the locals.|$|E
5|$|Some cotton {{crops in}} the Southeast United States {{received}} needed rainfall from Danny, {{while others were}} harmed, as 100,000 acres of cotton fields in Alabama were too heavily damaged for their crop to be salvaged. The effects of Danny caused the gasoline production of Gulf Coast oil refineries to decline and thus contributed {{to an increase in}} gas prices in the months following Danny throughout the United States. A severe drought had been in place in the Mid-Atlantic region during the month of July. The high amount of rainfall caused by Danny helped to ease dry conditions in portions of the Mid-Atlantic, but not sufficiently to stop the drought from developing further <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>areas</b> from northern Virginia to southern New England.|$|E
