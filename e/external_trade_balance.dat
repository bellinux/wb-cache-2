40|$|Comportamentally, the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> is {{determined}} by the state of the national economy, external factors and by the evolution of the currencies in which the trade is done. The evolution of the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> is the mirror of the external imbalance recorded by Romania in the period between 1990 - 2009. That’s why, an analysis in which is needed to discover the sources that cause the trade deficit, is not only opportune, but also imperative, because the existence of the trade deficit determines the amassment of external debt, which subdues Romania to numerous efforts in order to pay back the debt and the interest. The present paper analysis the evolution of the Romanian <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> with its elements, from 1990 till the end of 2009, in order to find out its essential characteristics and what are the sources for the trade deficit of this country, by emphasizing on the continuity and discontinuity factors from the evolution of the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> and also the resources for financing the deficit. The paper points out the characteristics of the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> evolution, and the measure by which the currency evolution had an influence. The analysis offers these conclusions: Romania needs urgent measures to attract foreign direct investments to balance the external trade deficit, and needs to assess thoroughly the means by which it finance its deficit; the authorities should focus with the utmost responsibility the idea of a sustainable <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> and to adopt the necessary decisions, because the continuous deficit will put in peril the durability of any economic growth and the deflation process. <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> current account, sold, deficit...|$|E

40|$|Workers ’ {{remittances}} {{represent a}} major source of private external finance for many developing countries. Moreover, these flows which have been on the upward trend in recent times are now widely regarded as important financial flows to many developing countries that receive them in large quantity. One major concern about remittances is that in countries receiving significant flows, the local currencies could appreciate artificially due to over-valuation; this might in turn be harmful to the overall trade balance and long-run economic growth of the receiving economies. This study investigates the possibility of this phenomenon in some selected Sub-Saharan African countries. The hypothesized link between workers ’ remittances and <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> was specified in a linear dynamic panel data model and estimated using the system Generalized Method of Moments. A major finding shows that remittance inflows have a contemporaneous negative but statistically insignificant impact on <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> across the sampled countries.

40|$|After {{two decades}} of {{economic}} decline and stagnation, Africa has witnessed a remarkable overall economic and agricultural recovery over the last decade. Figure 1 below shows that the average rate of agricultural and overall GDP growth has increased steadily {{since the middle of}} the 1990 s. More importantly, growth is also spreading to more countries, with an increasing number of countries growing at higher rates {{towards the end of the}} period under consideration. The reforms of the 1980 s, albeit costly and at times messy, had succeeded in stabilizing African economies after {{two decades of}} macroeconomic turmoil. They improved the economic environment and created conditions for the current recovery. Figure 2 shows the sharp decrease in average rates of inflation across the continent, following the reform of the 1980 s and the concomitant surge in foreign direct investments. Country fiscal and <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> have shown similarly remarkable improvements, as foreign exchange reserves as a share of GDP continued to rise and budgetary deficits fell. African economies became more competitive in international markets. Agricultural exports by African countries grew faster than the world average during the first half of this decade. As a consequence, the share of Africa in global agricultural trade, which had fallen to 2 percent in the late 1980 s from 8 percent in the 1960 s, rose slightly in the 1990 s and has since stabilized around 3 %.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{relationship}} between state budget and <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> is important as economic subject, not only at the level of developing countries, but also at of advanced ones, too. Such importance emerged clearly when 1980 s witnessed in United States of America a deficit in both state budget and <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> which was called at that time as the twin or dual deficit. We can say that the analysis of relationship between state budget and <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> states the extent of mutual effect between financial and trade policies of any economy, namely; any change in the outcome of either one may affect the other in the same degree. To put in other words, the instruments of financial policy represented by total incomes and total expenditures can affect the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> through the movement of exports and imports and vice-versa.

With respect to 28 major oil exporting countries, an increase in oil prices leads to an improved real oil <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> although it is detrimental to non-oil and total <b>trade</b> <b>balances.</b> This finding {{might be due to}} the expenditure effect arising from increases in proceeds from oil exports. A decrease in oil prices is found to be beneficial for both total and oil <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> in these oil exporting countries. Forty major oil importers seem to be increasingly shielded from positive oil shocks over the 1970 s and 1980 s; however, they must worry about oil price declines. A decline in oil prices has a negative impact on both total and real oil <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> resulting from increased oil imports in emerging economies. Hence, a decline in oil prices is beneficial to oil exporters due to the quantity effect outweighing the price effect, while for oil importers a stable oil price is more desirable than a price decline.

40|$|RECENT {{decades have}} seen {{substantial}} increases in public consumption and transfer payments by governments in many countries, financed by higher taxation. What effects have these changes had? It is often argued that these developments affect market-production of services adversely: high marginal tax rates may shift {{the production of}} some services from markets to households, while government provision of highly subsidized services to households ("public consumption") may shift some service production away both from markets and households to the public sector. However, such assertions are usually based on partial equilibrium analyses of households and firms. We wish to see whether, or rather under what conditions, they also hold in general equilibrium or disequilibrium. A general (dis) equilibrium framework also allows one to study the consequences for aggregate private sector employment, unemployment, the budget surplus, the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and the welfare of households. To explore these issues, {{we set up a}} simple general (dis) equilibrium model (in Section 2). A higher income tax rate is assumed to finance either larger tranfers (Section 3) or freely provided services to households (Section 4). The private sector produces two goods, one of which is traded internationally at an exogenous price. The other is a non-traded service, the price of which adjusts to clear the market for it. The domestic labour market, however, is assumed not to clear: there is unemployment. Key features of our model include a detailed treatment of household production of services; the effects of "public consumption " for household behaviour; and the differential response of employed and unemployed house-holds, as only the latter type of household is "income-constrained " in its demand for goods and services. In this paper, labour is internationally immobile, but can move between sectors. Capital is internationally immobile and sector-specific. In the interests of simplicity, there is no explicit role for monetary or financial variables in the model. 2. The model The model incorporates a household sector, a production sector for a tradeable good and a production sector for a non-traded good. It als...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the data}} {{provided}} by the Romanian National Institute of Statistics and Eurostat, the balance-of-payments current account registered a permanent and increasing deficit since 1990, while the domestic production was accelerated decreasing and the FDI inflows were far from being {{enough to cover the}} internal consumption needs. These being the facts, the present paper aims to underline the fact there is a direct correlation between the increasing external debt of Romania in the last years, and the balance of trade increasing deficit, which is due mainly to the lack of domestic capital, {{as well as to the}} decreasing productivity. The research methodology is based on a theoretical model of external debt sustainability, using time series data for Romania and using a multi-equation model. The results show that the relationship between external debt and the balance of trade deficit should be analysed with a simultaneous equation model, because there is a two-way relationship between debt service and deficit growth: the higher the imports, the higher the external debt, and as a consequence, the higher the balance of trade deficit, if the productivity is low. This result is consistent with the Romanian experience, and its implications are very large and will multiply over the years, if there will be no adequate policies meant to revival the private sector, mainly the SMEs. In this respect, the paper concludes that the Romanian government should immediately take the necessary measures to facilitate the easy access to capital for the private investors, which will further stimulate the internal production, with a direct impact onto the increase of exports, which will determine on the one hand, the reduction of the balance of trade deficit and simultaneous, the increasing of the necessary budgetary revenues to pay back the external debt. Otherwise, all costs will be supported by the next generations, with no return, if the probability for declaring "default" will be successfully surpass in the short run.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effect of {{constrained}} trade finance on trade flows in countries undergoing financial and balance of payments crises. Most of the countries that had a major crisis had a significant trade contraction, while trade-related finance declined sharply. However, trade may also be affected by other variables such as world demand, domestic demand, banking crises, changes in export and import prices, and real exchange rate depreciation. To estimate {{the effect of}} constrained trade finance on trade flows, we estimate import and export volume equations including explicitly trade financing as an explanatory variable {{in addition to the}} usual variables such as relative prices and income. We conclude that constrained trade finance is a factor in explaining both export and import volumes in the short-run. A fall in <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> finance explains a relatively small part of the trade loss during crises, while a fall in trade financing in connection with domestic banking crisis can lead to a substantial loss of trade.

The level of recorded revenues from the commercialization of products and services varies from country to country, and there is rarely a mutually beneficial exchange situation from these operations. Trade efficiency analysis lies in {{the determination of the}} terms of trade. In the current paper, international developments are analyzed based on net terms of trade index used by UNCTAD. Statistical data are provided by the World Bank, where export and import price index and the volume of imports and exports by countries were considered. The classification of the countries has been done according to the geographical orientation and based on the purchasing power parity, thus creating two tables, the first table highlighting seven regions, and the second table with seven categories of states including OPEC and non-OPEC members. The terms of trade evolution are influenced by certain important factors in the production process of goods and services. Some of these factors are mentioned: labour productivity; changes in commodity prices; yet, only the last factor is examined in this paper. Based on World Bank commodity price data, the evolution of major energy inputs such as crude oil, gas, coal, and major industrial raw materials such as aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin, zinc, silver, gold, platinum and iron was analysed and interpreted. For Romania, the data on terms of trade evolution shows a dramatic situation.

An error correction model (ECM) {{was used to examine}} the short-term and long-term effects of nominal and real effective exchange rate depreciation on the <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> While there is no long-run relationship between the real effective exchange rate and the <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate will lead to a deterioration of the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in the long term. Further, the results indicate that there is a positive causality relationship from the real GDP to the <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> Conversely, growth in money supply will worsen the country’s <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in the long run. The empirical findings show that currency devaluation is not an effective policy tool to improve the country’s <b>trade</b> <b>balance...</b>|$|R
