The European database of patents (Espacenet), Word Patent Index (DERWENT) and the Brazilian Patent Base of INPI were used, combining keywords and <b>International</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Classifications.</b> The major applicants, countries of publication and claims categories were mapped. The 212 patent requests collected are mainly distributed in Chemistry, Pharmacy and Pharmacology areas. The results obtained revealed that the US was the main country with studies directed to this technological area (59 patent applications) and the major applicant was the company Astrazeneca AB. Therefore, we can understand that this is a promising technology that may reflect in an increase of R&D activities and patent applications in this area...|$|R

40|$|We search an autocatalytic {{structure}} in networks of technological fields and evaluate its significance for technological change. To this aim we define a technology network {{based on the}} <b>International</b> <b>Patents</b> <b>Classification,</b> and we study if autocatalytic structures in the network foster innovation {{as measured by the}} rate of production of patents. The network is identified through patenting activity of geographical regions in different technology fields. Through our analysis we show how the technological landscape of the patents database evolves as a self-organising autocatalytic structure that grows in size, and arrives to cover the most part of the technology network. Technology classes in the core of the autocatalytic structure perform better in terms of their innovativeness, as measured by the rate of growth of the number of patents. Finally, the links between classes that define the autocatalytic structure of the technology network break the hierarchical structure of the database, and indicate that recombinant innovation and its autocatalytic patterns are an important stylised fact of technological change...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the patenting behavior and long-run performance of German firms that went public (IPOs) on the “Neuer Markt ” {{during the period from}} 1997 to 2002. The main objective of the empirical analysis is to examine whether IPOs with patents outperformed those firms with no patented technology. The technology is measured by both the patent stock and patent indicators. The impact of patents on performance is ana-lyzed with buy-and-hold-abnormal returns (BHAR), the three-factor Fama-French asset pricing model as well as cross-sectional-regressions. In the regression analysis we include specific patent variables such as the number of <b>International</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Classifications</b> (IPC), family size, the number of backward- and forward citations, and the frequency of cited ar-ticles. The empirical evidence suggests that innovation as measured by patents and patent indicators has a positive impact on the long-run performance and success of initial public offerings. Thus, innovation, patents, and intellectual capital are important factors that {{have a positive impact on}} the success, valuation, and the long-run performance of start-up technology firms...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a method of}} {{identifying}} trends in technological convergence {{on the level of}} technical fields is proposed. Defining convergence as an inherently stable process of structuring inter-technological patterns over time, German patent data are used to project them onto the structure of the output of standards via a concordance list of <b>International</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Classifications</b> (IPC) symbols and International Classification of Standards (ICS) classes. Using a set of criteria for a reliable measurement of technological convergence, a set of methods, such as explorative identification of agglomerations of technical fields, the analyses of the breadth of technical fields to differentiate between focused and diffused convergence trends and in-depth analysis using a revised version of the Cross-Impact Assessment method, are devised to measure the level and trend of technological convergence. The structures of convergence in technological development and standardisation are in general moderately positively correlated, but that there are significant differences on how these converging trends are covered in the stock of active standards at the level of technical fields...|$|R

Developments are still relatively research-based, with a large portion of academic participation, although consumer applications such as flexible touchscreen displays are getting closer to reality. A range of different research strategies are evident from patent collaborations; Samsung exhibits a reasonable amount of collaboration whilst other top applicants show none. In contrast to the specialism evident from most applicants, Samsung is active in a very diverse range of graphene-related technology. Inventions are classified {{in a wide range of}} <b>International</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Classifications</b> (IPCs), though the majority of these relate to its chemistry and processing; the others define a varying range of potential applications for graphene.

This study investigated the survival rates of patents in the semiconductor industry by using a survival analysis and incorporated a predictive model for patent maintenance times. The technical characteristics of the patents, the assignee factors, and the statuses of the patents were used as the predictive factors for patent maintenance time. The results revealed a small entity size {{and the number of}} assignees are the risk factors that increase the likelihood of the maintenance time of a patent decreasing. The litigation status of a patent and the number of its <b>international</b> <b>patent</b> <b>classifications,</b> claims, forward citations, and assignments were determined to be the protection factors that raise the likelihood of its maintenance time extending. Additionally, substantial differences were noted between small entities and nonsmall entities and between being litigated and not in their effects on the survival rates of patents. This study examined the factors that affect the survival rates of patents and provides a reference for the managers and investors of intellectual property rights to use when assessing technical and commercial patent values...|$|R
40|$|Searching of {{databases}} (textual or numeric) {{is likely}} to be effective and efficient only if the user is familiar with the classification, categorizing, and indexing schemes (metadata vocabularies) being searched. Therefore, it is obviously beneficial to provide a bridge between the user’s ordinary language and the metadata vocabularies of the unfamiliar database in order to compensate for abbreviated, cryptic, or specialized terminologies. Advanced search technologies would utilize customized “Entry Vocabulary Modules” (EVM) which respond adaptively to the user’s ordinary language query with a ranked list of search terms in the target metadata vocabularies that may more accurately represent what is sought in the unfamiliar database. These “Entry Vocabulary Modules ” can serve both as an indexing device and a search aid.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} a subtask of the QUAERO 1 {{research}} program, a major innovating research project related to the automatic processing of multimedia and multilingual content. The objective {{discussed in this article}} is to propose a new method for the classification of scientific papers, developed {{in the context of an}} <b>international</b> <b>patents</b> <b>classification</b> plan related to the same field. The practical purpose of this work is to provide an assistance tool to experts in their task of evaluation of the originality and novelty of a patent, by offering to the latter the most relevant scientific citations. This issue raises new challenges in categorization research as the <b>patent</b> <b>classification</b> plan is not directly adapted to the structure of scientific documents, classes have high citation or cited topic and that there is not always a balanced distribution of the available examples within the different learning classes. We propose, as a solution to this problem, to apply an improved K-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithm based on the exploitation of association rules occurring between the index terms of the documents and the ones of the patent classes. By using a reference dataset of patents belonging to the field of pharmacology, on the one hand, and a bibliographic dataset of the same field issued from the Medline collection, on the other hand, we show that this new approach, which combines the advantages of numerical and symbolical approaches, improves considerably categorization performance, as compared to the usual categorization methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, 2010 : Secure Access dataset includes details on applications to the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) for patents, designs and trade marks by businesses or individuals. The patent file holds the main information for all patents in Great Britain attained through the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills' Optics extract in June/July 2010. The file includes patent applications filed between 1978 and 2009. There should be no multiple observations due to the uniqueness and single occurrence of an application number within these datasets. A patent can {{have more than one}} IPC classification, depending on how many purposes it fulfils. The trade mark analysable dataset was created using the trade mark licensee data, which relates to trademarks applied for with the IPO. The data were extracted in July 2010 and include applications filed between 1876 and 2010. The licensee data is that provided to the IPO's external customers and holds the same information as contained within the IPO website. This dataset represents one of four relating to trade marks; this covers all trade marks applied for within the UK - there are three other datasets relating to trade marks applied for via the Madrid UK/Madrid EP agreements and Office of Harmonization for the Internal Market. The UK design data represent all designs applied for with the IPO between 1974 and 2010. The data were extracted in May 2010. The patent, design and trade mark data provided are readily available from online sources. The data are provided for Secure Access so that users can link the data to Secure Access business surveys using Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) reference numbers, which are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Other Secure Access business surveys with which users may wish to combine the IPO data include the Annual Respondents Database (SN 6644), the UK Innovation Survey (SN 6699), and the Business Expenditure on Research and Development survey (SN 6690). In preparing the patent, design and trade mark data for release, certain variables that can lead to the identification of businesses or individuals on the IPO website have been anonymised. These variables include applicant numbers, application numbers and design numbers. The patent data include postcodes for a proportion of the applicants. The trade mark data include the country of the proprietor. The design data include no spatial units.
