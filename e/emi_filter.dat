40|$|Abstract—Conducted {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) generated by PWM inverter-fed induction motor drive systems, which are currently {{widely used in}} many industrial and/or avionic applications, causes severe parasitic current problems, especially at high frequencies (HF). These restrict power electronic drive’s evolution. In order to reduce or minimize these problems, several techniques can be applied. In this paper, insertion of an optimized passive <b>EMI</b> <b>filter</b> is proposed. This filter is optimized by taking into account real impedances of each part of a considered AC motor drive system contrarily to commercial EMI filters designed by considering internal impedance of disturbance source and load, equal to 50 Ω.
