25|$|A {{programming}} {{language is a}} machine-readable artificial language. Programming languages {{can be used to}} create programs that specify the behavior of a machine, to express algorithms precisely, or as a mode of human communication. The first {{programming language}}s predate the modern computer. In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also written as λ-calculus, is a formal system designed to investigate function definition, <b>function</b> <b>application</b> and recursion. It was invented by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics, but has now emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability, recursion theory, and as a fundamental basis and a modern paradigm to computer programming and software languages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} known that algorithms {{can be expressed}} using simple <b>function</b> <b>applications</b> only. In this paper we will show {{that it is possible}} to make a systematic translation of algebraic data types and pattern-based function definitions, like they are used in most modern functional programming languages, to <b>function</b> <b>applications.</b> The translated algebraic data types closely resemble the original type definitions. We developed an efficient interpreter for the resulting functions. The interpreter has a simple and elegant structure because there is no need for special handling of data structures and pattern matching. Despite the lack of optimisations its performance turns out to be competitive in a comparison with other interpreters like Hugs, Helium, GHCi and Amanda. ...|$|R
