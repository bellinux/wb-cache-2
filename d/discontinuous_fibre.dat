40|$|In nature, both {{material}} and structure are formed {{according to the}} principles of biologically controlled self-assembly, a process defined as the spontaneous and reversible ordering of small molecular building blocks under the influence of noncovalent, static interactions. The orientation and distribution of reinforcing entities in engineering composites is key to enabling structural efficiency, yet the architecture remains simplistic when compared to the distinctive and unique hierarchies found in Nature. These biological 'composite' materials achieve such configurations by accurately controlling the orientation of anisotropic nano- and micro-sized 'building blocks', thereby reinforcing the material in specific directions to carry the multidirectional external loads at different length scales. Capturing the design principles underlying the exquisite architecture of such biological materials will overcome many of the mechanical limitations of current engineering composites. The scientific vision for this study is the development of a novel and highly ordered complex architecture fibrous material for additive layer manufacturing. Using novel chemistry and controlled field-effect assembly, functionally graded, stiffness modulated architectures, analogous to those found in nature, are synthesised to realise enhanced mechanical performance, multidimensional composite structures. To achieve this, both hierarchical <b>discontinuous</b> <b>fibres</b> (glass fibres with ZnO nanrods) and a new type of ultrasonic device has been developed.

Hybrid composites, made with different types of fibres that provide a balanced suite of modulus, strength and ductility, allow avoiding catastrophic failure that is a key limitation of composites. Two different material combinations of high strength carbon/E-glass and high modulus carbon/E-glass were selected. Several highly aligned and well dispersed short fibre hybrid composites with different carbon/glass ratios were manufactured and tested in tension in order to investigate the carbon ratio effect on the stress–strain curve. Good pseudo-ductile responses were obtained from the high modulus carbon/E-glass composites due to the fragmentation of the carbon fibres. The experimental results were also compared with an analytical solution. The intermingled hybrid composite with 0. 25 relative carbon ratio gave the maximum pseudo-ductile strain, 1. 1 %, with a 110 GPa tensile modulus. Moreover, the initial modulus of the intermingled hybrids with 0. 4 relative carbon ratio is 134 GPa, 3. 5 times higher than that of E-glass/epoxy composites.

Polypropylene fibres were prepared under various manufacturing conditions using a laboratory extruder, to ascertain the effect of these conditions on fibre characteristics. The relevant properties of cement paste likely to influence the polypropylene fibres and the eventual composite were investigated. An investigation of continuous aligned fibre composites in tension, containing various volume concentrations of fibres, showed that multiple cracking occurred despite the elastic modulus of the fibre being considerably lower than that of the hardened cement paste. Factors which enabled fibre/matrix contact to be maintained during the multiple cracking process, despite the unfavourable Poisson's ratio of polypropylene, were considered. <b>Discontinuous</b> aligned <b>fibre</b> composites were tested in tension, to ascertain the effect of volume concentration and length of fibres on the shear stress transfer between fibre and matrix and on multiple cracking.

The development of continuous natural fibre reinforced polymers is essential for manufacturing materials {{that can be used}} in load bearing applications. Similar to traditional composite polymer materials, high-performance natural fibre composite systems should be based on continuous textile reinforcements like unidirectional tapes or woven fabrics. The first problem to be addressed in this process is the optimisation of the yarn to be used in the manufacturing of the textile reinforcement. Subsequently, a number of different fabric types (i. e. biaxial plain weaves, unidirectional fabrics and non-crimp fabrics) were produced and evaluated as reinforcement in composites manufactured by well established manufacturing techniques such as hand lay-up, vacuum infusion, pultrusion and resin transfer moulding (RTM). As expected, the developed materials can not directly compete in terms of strength with unidirectional glass fibre composites. However, they are clearly able to compete with these materials in terms of stiffness, especially if the low density of flax is taken into account.

In this research, the mechanical properties of hybrid fibre reinforced concrete composite (HyFRCC) were investigated by combining polypropylene fibre (PP) with steel fibre (ST). PP fibre is good in preventing micro cracks while steel fibre is reliable in preventing macro cracks {{in concrete}}. Specimens incorporated with ST and PP fibres were in the mix proportion of 100 - 0 %, 75 - 25 %, 50 - 50 %, 25 - 75 %, and 0 - 100 % at volume fraction of 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, and 1. 5 %. Compression test, flexural test, splitting tensile test, flexural toughness, and Young’s Modulus were carried out to determine the mechanical properties of HyFRCC. By combining these two fibres in concrete, the crack growth reduced where PP fibre was found to improve the tensile strain capacity, while ST fibre contributed to the improvement on the ultimate tensile strength. HyFRCC specimens also delayed the failure phenomena due to the different tensile strength of PP and ST fibres compared with the sudden failure experienced by plain concrete. The experimental test results found that HyFRCC with the combined mix proportion of 75 % ST fibre + 25 % PP fibre at volume fraction of 1. 5 % can be adjudged as the optimum percentage. This optimum percentage was then applied in reinforced concrete beams to study the structural performance in flexural of shear. In conclusion, HyFRCC beam is tougher and stronger compared with the control beam based on the load-deflection relationship. Crack pattern of HyFRCC beam shows that the crack width and crack spacing reduces compared with the control beam.

The {{performance of a}} fibre composite part depends {{to a great extent}} on the fibre orientation pattern. In this regard, the rheology of fibre suspensions is important and more experimental and theoretical developments are needed for suspensions in practical applications. This thesis deals with both issues and provides new insights into the rheological behaviour of fibre suspensions. The first part of the thesis focuses on the problem of measuring the viscosity of a suspension of fibres that are not short compared to the dimensions of the measurement device. Various geometry effects in shear using parallel-plate and cone-and-plate configurations are examined. A modified cone-and-plate device of unusually large diameter and truncation is developed that provides reduced free edge and wall effects. In a subsequent study using the modified geometry, a systematic study is carried out on semi-concentrated suspensions of polyamide fibres in silicone oil to understand the effect of relevant microstructural properties, i. e. volume fraction, aspect ratio and the absolute size of the fibres.

Directed fibre preforming (DFP) is one possible process which has several advantages when compared with competing techniques. Low material and process costs coupled with short cycle times means the process is suited to medium volume production (typically < 10, 000 ppa). Predicting mechanical performance remains a major obstacle to industrial adoption however, due to the stochastic nature of fibre distribution. This is of particular importance for structural applications where minimum property requirements and a greater certainty of performance must be achieved. This thesis employs a stochastic macroscale modelling approach to predict fibre locations during the reinforcement deposition stage. This is achieved through process characterisation studying the effects of key microstructural and process-specific parameters on fibre distribution and orientation. The proposed DFP simulation software can generate realistic fibre networks for complex three-dimensional component geometries providing feedback on preform quality. This information is used to optimise the preform structure via process input parameters such as robot trajectory and material properties with validation tests conducted to assess model accuracy. An interface between the simulation software and commercial finite element code facilitates mechanical property analysis for full-scale components using realistic load cases.

Quasi-static models are, then, developed by using a "Forced Balance Approach" to define mechanical response properties of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced composite materials. Subsequently, simultaneous optimization of damping, stiffness and weight is carried out by using the so-called "Inverted Utility Function Method".

Harakeke and hemp fibres, amongst other natural fibres, possess respectable mechanical properties along with other advantages such as low cost, low production energy requirements and abundant availability. Polylactic acid (PLA), a sustainable alternative to petrochemical-derived polymers, is produced on a mass scale from 100 % renewable resources and can be degraded at end of life by simple hydrolysis under the appropriate conditions. It has high stiffness, strength, thermal and UV stability, but is low in toughness. Limited applications of natural fibre reinforced PLA composites so far is mainly due to low mechanical properties of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>fibre</b> composites made using injection moulding or compression moulding using randomly oriented fibre mats attributed to poor fibre orientation and fibre-matrix incompatibility. Presented {{in this study are}} experimental investigations of the properties of PLA reinforced aligned discontinuous harakeke and hemp fibre mats produced using a dynamic sheet former (DSF) to provide improved performance of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. Harakeke and hemp fibres were treated using either a solution of 5 wt% or 10 wt% NaOH or combination of 5 wt% NaOH with 2 wt% Na 2 SO 3 at elevated temperatures in a small pressure vessel. Treated fibres were assessed using single fibre tensile testing, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that 5 wt% NaOH/ 2 wt% Na 2 SO 3 and 5 wt% NaOH effectively removed non-cellulosic materials from harakeke and hemp fibre surfaces, respectively, giving good fibre separation without greatly reducing the tensile strength of the fibres. It was also found that these treatments lead to a higher crystallinity index and improved thermal stability of fibres. Fibre alignment in fibre mats produced using a DSF was observed using light microscopy. Visual observation supported that the fibre alignment had occurred. Fibre orientation factors (Kɵ) determined for harakeke and hemp composites using the Bowyer-Bader model were found higher compared to Kɵ values obtained for other natural composites prepared using injection and compression moulding. Improved fibre orientation resulted in improved reinforcement giving large increases for tensile strengths up to approximately 90 and 60 % for harakeke and hemp composites reinforced with inclusion of 30 and 25 wt% fibre respectively. The effect of silane and peroxide as additional fibre treatments and MA-g-PLA as a coupling agent was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), composite swelling analysis, tensile testing, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron micrographs of fractured composite surfaces revealed that the gaps between fibres and matrix for composites with fibres treated using silane and peroxide and composites coupled with MA-g-PLA were smaller compared to the surfaces for composites with fibres treated using just alkali. Improved interfacial strength was also supported by lower swelling indices, lower peaks on tan δ and higher residual composites weights, compared to those values obtained for composites with fibres treated using just alkali, which was found to lead to higher composite tensile strengths. Harakeke and hemp fibre composites were plasticised using hyper-branched polymer (HBP) and assessed using SEM, tensile and impact testing. SEM micrographs for plasticised composites revealed longer pultruding fibres than un-plasticised composites, with gaps between the fibre and matrix appearing to be slightly larger, indicating a weaker interface between fibres and matrix compared to those composites without plasticiser. Improved composite ductility and impact strength were demonstrated for plasticised composites without dramatic reduction of composite tensile strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{is facing a}} great challenge - reducing {{the weight of their}} vehicles. Carbon fibre composites are regarded by many as the only real option as traditional engineering materials are now running out of potential for further weight reduction. In this doctoral thesis a framework is presented which will provide guidelines for the conceptual phase of the development of an automotive composite body structure. The framework is initiated by defining ideal material diversity, as well as initial partition of the body structure based on process and material selection. Then, a further analysis of the structures is made in order to evaluate whether a more cost efficient solution can be found by further dividing the structure. Such a differential design approach is analysed in the third part of the work, studying both the financial and structural effects of such partitioning. In order to increase the understanding of the intimate relationship between design, material and manufacturing process, balancing manufacturing and structural optimization is addressed. Finally, drape simulation tools are used to assess the geometric complexity of composite structures in order to further quantify suitable split lines in cases of differential design approach. Different carbon fibre composite material systems and processes are compared and evaluated in the work. The results show that a high-performance material system with continuous fibres is both more cost and performance effective as compared to industrialised, <b>discontinuous</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. Further analysis shows the importance of balancing the design for manufacturing and the structural weight optimization of the structures in order to reach a cost and weight effective design. When restricting composite design freedom with manufacturing constraints, the great benefits of structural composites disappear and with this both weight and cost effectiveness.

30|$|These {{conductive}} fillers or hybrid yarns can {{be formed}} by using continues filaments like stainless steel or copper wires placed alongside (plied) with non-conducting textile materials, placed as core material with covering {{of textile materials}} or {{in the form of}} <b>discontinuous</b> cut staple <b>fibres</b> (limiting factor), blended together with some non-conductive natural or synthetic textile materials. Rajendrakumar and Thilagavathi (2012), plied polyester filament with 0.04  mm copper wire on a ring doubling machine to investigate the effects of fabric weave and pick density on electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMSE). They concluded that the plain weave posed better EMSE as more number of interlacements reduces the contact resistance, they further concluded that the pick density is directly related to increased EMSE.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} tensile {{properties}} {{of a novel}} type of hybrid composites that contain stiff but brittle webs of <b>discontinuous</b> carbon <b>fibres,</b> and tough but compliant plies of self-reinforced polypropylene (SRPP). The goal is to achieve a better balance between stiffness, strength and toughness. In {{the scope of this}} study, the effect of fibre volume fraction on the ductility of the hybrid was evaluated, and failure mechanisms that govern the transition between brittle and ductile behaviour were assessed. Hybrids with volume fraction of less than 7 % exhibited quasi-ductile response, while reaching the modulus of 6. 1 GPa and the failure strain of 10 %. Through the modelling work it was shown that the initial elastic behaviour of the hybrid can be estimated using the incremental rule-of-mixtures. It was found that catastrophic interply delamination is not a dominant failure mode, and consequentially, the strength of the hybrid can be predicted from the failure strengths of the web and the SRPP. Overall, this family of hybrids has attractive properties that can be tuned to specific applications by controlling the fibre volume fraction. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Natural fibers can be {{attractive}} reinforcing materials in thermosetting polymers {{due to their}} low density and high specific mechanical properties. Although the research effort in this area has grown substantially over the last 20 years, manufacturing technologies {{to make use of}} short natural fibers in high volume fraction composites; are still limited. Natural fibers, after retting and preprocessing, are discontinuous and easily form entangled bundles. Dispersion and mixing these short fibers with resin to manufacture high quality, high volume fraction composites presents a significant challenge. In this paper, a novel pneumatic design for dispersion of natural fibers in their original discontinuous form is described. In this design, compressed air is used to create vacuum to feed and convey fibres while breaking down fibre clumps and dispersing them in an aerosolized resin stream. Model composite materials, made using proof-of-concept prototype equipment, were imaged with both optical and X-ray tomography to evaluate fibre and resin dispersion. The images indicated that the system was capable of providing an intimate mixture of resin and detangled fibres for two different resin viscosities. The new pneumatic process could serve as the basis of a system to produce well-dispersed high-volume fraction composites containing <b>discontinuous</b> natural <b>fibres</b> drawn directly from a loosely packed source...|$|R
