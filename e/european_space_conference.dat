From 1968, Canada held observer {{status in the}} <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Conference</b> (ESC), a ministerial-level organization set up to determine future European space activities, and it continued in this limited role after ESA was created in 1975. Since January 1, 1979, Canada has had the special status of a [...] "Cooperating State" [...] with the ESA, paying for the privilege and also investing in working time and providing scientific instruments which are placed on ESA probes. Canada is allowed to participate in optional programs; it also has {{to contribute to the}} General Budget {{but not as much as}} associate membership would have entailed. This status was unique at the time and remains so today.|$|E
50|$|In November 1968, a <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Conference</b> held in Bonn {{decided on}} a {{proposal}} to merge the ELDO with the ESRO, forming a pan-European space authority by early 1970; known as the European Space Agency (ESA), this organisation would not be formed until 1975. Britain was lukewarm to the idea and {{did not believe that}} Europe could launch satellites economically. By 1970, the French launch base in French Guiana had cost £45 million, and in that year France became the most important partner in the project, then planning to build two-thirds of the rocket as well as owning the launch site. Although only on paper, Britain's involvement in the project has been much reduced, after being largely responsible (with an Australian launch site) for getting the entire project going in the first place. However, all of the launchers, to {{the very end of the}} programme, were completely dependent on the British rocket used for the first stage.|$|E

40|$|The ESA {{meteoroid}} model predicts {{impacts of}} meteoroids {{in the mass}} range between $ 10 ^{- 18 }$ to $ 10 ^ 0 $ g on spacecraft surfaces. It covers heliocentric distances from 0. 3 to 20 AU. Measurements of the dust detector on board the highly successful joint ESA/NASA mission Ulysses have shown, that the flux of meteoroids with masses between $ 10 ^{- 15 }$ and $ 10 ^{- 12 }$ g is, {{at least in the}} outer Solar System, dominated by interstellar dust grains that traverse the Solar System as it travels through the local interstellar cloud. We present a simple semi-analytic interstellar dust model that can easily be included in the ESA meteoroid model, together with a more precise determination of the flux direction of the interstellar dust stream. The model {{is based on the assumption}} that interstellar dust dynamics have two effects: solar gravitation and radiation pressure determines the spatial distribution, and Lorentz-interaction of the charged particles creates a temporal variation.

The predictions are validated against reference wind tunnel measurements under zero streamwise pressure gradient. The analytical method is then tested for a low and moderate adverse pressure gradient. Comparison against experimental and DNS data show a good predictive ability under a zero pressure gradient and a moderate adverse pressure gardient, with the numerical method providing a complete velocity profile through the laminar sub-layer down to the wall. The application of the method is useful to computational fluid dynamic practitioners for generating an equilibrium thick turbulent boundary layer at the computational domain inflow...|$|R
40|$|Formation-flying {{studies to}} date have {{required}} continuous and minute corrections of the orbital elements and attitudes of the spacecraft. This increases the complexity, and associated risk, of controlling the formation, which often makes formation-flying studies infeasible for technological and economic reasons. Passive formation-flying is a novel space-flight concept, which offers a remedy to those problems. Spacecraft in a passive formation are allowed to drift and rotate slowly, but by using advanced metrology and statistical modelling methods, their relative positions, velocities, and orientations are determined with very high accuracy. The metrology data is used directly by the payloads to compensate for spacecraft motions in software. The normally very stringent spacecraft control requirements are thereby relaxed, which significantly reduces mission complexity and cost. Space-borne low-frequency radio astronomy {{has been identified as}} a key science application for a conceptual pathfinder mission using this novel approach. The mission, called FIRST (Formation-flying sub-Ionospheric Radio astronomy Science and Technology) Explorer, is currently under study by the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> Agency (ESA). Its objective is to demonstrate passive formation-flying {{and at the same time}} perform unique world class science with a very high serendipity factor, by opening a new frequency window to astronomy.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Space Age optical sensors {{have been one of the}} main instruments for positioning and tracking known space objects. Nowadays, the unrelenting growth of man-made objects together with the overcrowding of the useful satellite orbits, and the real space debris and NEO hazards, has made necessary to carry out surveys of the space looking for uncatalogued objects. Optical telescopes play a key role in the Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) as a primary Space Situational Awareness element and, it is known, that the best instrument for this task is a fully robotic wide-field telescope with a minimum aperture of 40 cm. The Baker-Nunn Cameras (BNCs) were produced by the Smithsonian Institution during the late 50 s as an optical tracking system for artificial satellites. These wide-field telescopes of 50 cm of aperture were manufactured by Perkin- Elmer (optics) and Boller & Chivens (mechanics) with the highest quality specifications. The TFRM is a fully robotic refurbished BNC that exploits the excellent mechanical and optical original design to obtain an equatorial telescope with a useful 4. 4 x 4. 4 CCD field of view. TFRM is therefore a European asset very well suited for SST (satellites and space debris) and NEO observations. Moreover, its control system allows tracking of all kinds of orbits, including LEOs.

40|$|Two ESA high {{temperature}} missions, BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter, are planned {{to start in}} 2018. Severe environmental conditions with sun intensities up to 10. 6 resp. 12. 8 solar constants will be encountered during both missions. Different tests have been performed to qualify the main component for the solar array, the solar cell. The key qualification test for these {{high temperature}}, high intensity missions is a combined test which exposes {{a large number of}} cells simultaneously to the complete AM 0 spectrum at the required irradiance and temperature. During the last <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> Power <b>Conference</b> in 2014, the development and performance of the appropriate test setup in the VTC 1. 5 chamber located at ESTEC was presented. In the meanwhile, the BepiColombo 4000 hour qualification test is successfully finished. This paper summarizes the results of the qualification test and highlights the main findings. Specifically, the following topics will be treated. Different methods like electrical performance, thermo-optical and external quantum efficiency measurements have been used to characterize the behaviour of the solar cells after illumination under these conditions. A special focus has been put on the electrical performance. A comparison to other solar cell qualification tests under solely UV radiation has been undertaken. The results have also been compared to a theoretical model. However, the paper will not cover only characterization results but will also give some insight in challenges experienced during the test execution itself. Deviating from other solar cell qualification tests, a representatively equipped photovoltaic assembly on carbon fibre reinforced cyanate has also been included. On these coupon segments, solar cell assemblies connected to shunt diodes and placed next to optical surface reflectors have been exposed to AM 0 illumination to qualify the solar cells including their surroundings which therefore covers also contamination effects. Last but not least, first results from the Solar Orbiter qualification are presented. This test with additional 1000 hours and increased intensity has been completed recently...|$|R
