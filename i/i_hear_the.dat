500|$|Many scholars, {{early and}} contemporary, {{consider}} Cotton {{to be the}} [...] "preeminent minister and theologian of the Massachusetts Bay Colony." [...] Fellow Boston Church minister John Wilson wrote: [...] "Mr. Cotton preaches with such authority, demonstration, and life that, methinks, when he preaches out of any prophet or apostle I hear not him; I hear that very prophet and apostle. [...] Yea, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> Lord Jesus Christ speaking in my heart." [...] Wilson also called Cotton deliberate, careful, and {{in touch with the}} wisdom of God. [...] Cotton's contemporary John Davenport founded the New Haven Colony, and he considered Cotton's opinion to be law.|$|E

500|$|Several {{recurring}} musical motives can {{be heard}} in Takemitsu's works. In particular the pitch motive E♭-E-A {{can be heard}} in many of his later works, whose titles refer to water in some form (Toward the Sea, 1981; Rain Tree Sketch, 1982; <b>I</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>the</b> Water Dreaming, 1987). [...] When spelt in German (Es-E-A), the motive {{can be seen as a}} musical [...] "transliteration" [...] of the word [...] "sea". Takemitsu used this motive (usually transposed) to indicate the presence of water in his [...] "musical landscapes", even in works whose titles do not directly refer to water, such as A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden (1977; see ex. 5).|$|E
500|$|In 1984 Starkey {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and in 1994 a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was also given an Honorary Fellowship at his Cambridge College, Fitzwilliam College. He {{has worked as}} curator on several exhibitions, {{including}} an exhibit in 2003 on Elizabeth I, following which he had lunch with her namesake, Elizabeth II. [...] Several years later he told a reporter that the monarch {{had no interest in}} her predecessors, other than those who followed her great grandfather. [...] "I don't think she's at all comfortable with anybody – I would hesitate to use the word intellectual – but it's useful. [...] I think she's got elements a bit like Goebbels in her attitude to culture – you remember: 'every time <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> word culture I reach for my revolver.' [...] I think the queen reaches for her mask." [...] His remarks were criticised by Penny Junor, a royal biographer, and Robert Lacey, a royal historian.|$|E
500|$|Takemitsu's words here {{highlight}} his changing stylistic trends {{from the}} late 1970s into the 1980s, which {{have been described as}} [...] "an increased use of diatonic material [...] references to tertian harmony and jazz voicing", which do not, however, project a sense of [...] "large-scale tonality". Many of the works from this period have titles that include a reference to water: Toward the Sea (1981), Rain Tree and Rain Coming (1982), riverrun and <b>I</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>the</b> Water Dreaming (1987). Takemitsu wrote in his notes for the score of Rain Coming that [...] "... the complete collection [...] entitled [...] "Waterscape" ... it was the composer's intention to create a series of works, which like their subject, pass through various metamorphoses, culminating in a sea of tonality." [...] Throughout these works, the S-E-A motive (discussed further below) features prominently, and points to an increased emphasis on the melodic element in Takemitsu's music that began during this later period.|$|E

500|$|Hunt played several instruments, {{including}} guitar, keyboards, drums, bass synthesizer, and {{the electronic}} drum. When he finished writing and recording the demos, Hunt began the album's primary recording sessions at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles. With What Were You Hoping For?, Hunt pursued a [...] "harder edge" [...] and rawer aesthetic than featured on his previous work. He {{also wanted to}} explore a self-described [...] "gnarly" [...] guitar sound inspired {{by the work of}} Muddy Waters and The Stooges' 1973 album Raw Power. Hunt attempted the sound in the past, but encountered discouragement from management. He discussed his direction for the album in an interview for The Boombox, stating [...] "t wasn't necessarily punk music. It was more about trying to capture the growl of a cello. That to me is as nasty as it can get. That's a beautiful sound to me. When people talk about the distortion on the guitar, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> same thing with that growl of a cello." [...] Hunt wanted to take advantage of his newfound feeling of artistic freedom and lack of concern over marketability.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to previous albums, Graduation features fewer guest appearances from other recording artists. West elaborated {{that it was}} a fully conscious decision to keep his guest vocalists at a minimum, saying that, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> records of my favorite bands – The Killers or Coldplay – you only hear one voice from start to finish." [...] R singers T-Pain and Dwele, New York rappers Mos Def and ALBe. Back, and famed hip-hop record producer DJ Premier are featured in individual tracks primarily to deliver hooks and refrains. However, though he originally intended for Graduation to be completely devoid of guest rap verses, West decided to invite New Orleans rapper Lil Wayne on the track [...] "Barry Bonds". At the time, the two MCs had been working together, with West contributing to the production of Lil Wayne's sixth studio album Tha Carter III. As for the absence of skits, West explained, [...] "There's just serious songs, hooks, chords, and ideas. No special effects or antics ... and no fake Bernie Mac!" [...] West instead decided to record two earthy musical interludes in place of the hip-hop skits. He incorporated African sounds and polyrhythmic percussion into both. However, for unknown reasons, the two musical interludes were omitted from the studio album.|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Savior's Shadow" [...] {{was written}} by Shelton, Alexander, and Randall, while {{production}} was handled by longtime collaborator Scott Hendricks. It is composed in the key of D major using common time with a tempo of 96-100 beats per minute. His vocal range, which spanned from A3-E5, {{was accompanied by a}} piano, in addition to backup vocals. An [...] "introspective" [...] gospel song, it serves as [...] "a guide" [...] to demonstrate his faith [...] "through trying times". The gospel section and string arrangements was imagined by Charlie Judge, while Russ Pahl helped Shelton in creating [...] "bittersweet steel notes" [...] for the production. Shelton sings: [...] "I feel the rain, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> thunder / As He cries for me", demonstrating that Jesus was [...] "a powerful source of strength" [...] for the singer. The first verse displays Shelton's [...] "longing and willingness to stand" [...] with Jesus after his relationship struggles: [...] "Though the devil tried to break me / My sweet Jesus won't forsake me / When I'm in my Savior's shadow where I'm supposed to be". Jeff Nelson of People claimed that the single offered some of Shelton's [...] "most revealing lyrics", particularly the aforementioned lines. The song commences with the singer praying: [...] "I'm standing in my Savior's shadow, following his footsteps there / Every mountain, every ocean, He hears my prayer".|$|E
500|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Early modern period James, 2nd Lord Hamilton became a privy counsellor to his first cousin, James IV of Scotland and helped to arrange his marriage to Princess Margaret Tudor of England. As a reward he was created Earl of Arran in 1503. The local economy {{for much of this}} period was based on the run rig system, the basic crops being oats, barley and potatoes. The population slowly grew to about 6,500. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on the island's population. These [...] "improvements" [...] typically led to land that had been rented out to as many as 27 families being converted into a single farm. In some cases, land was promised in Canada for each adult emigrant male. In April 1829, for example, 86 islanders boarded the brig Caledonia for the two-month journey, half their fares being paid for by the Duke. However, on arrival in Quebec only [...] was made available to the heads of extended families. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island devastated. The writer James Hogg wrote: [...] "Ah! Wae's me. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Hamilton's crofters are a' gaun away, man and mother's son, frae the Isle o' Arran. Pity on us!". A memorial to this has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a [...] "the ultimate in crossover nightmares" [...] and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying [...] "Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when I read that she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', and <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jeremiah's [...] "confessions" [...] are {{a type of}} {{individual}} lament. Such laments are found elsewhere in the psalms and the Book of Job. Like Job, Jeremiah curses {{the day of his}} birth (Jer. 20:14–18 and Job 3:3–10). Likewise, Jeremiah's exclamation [...] "For <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> whispering of many: Terror is all around!" [...] (Jer. 20:10) matches Psalm 31:13 exactly. However, Jeremiah's laments are made unique by his insistence that he has been called by Yahweh to deliver his messages. These laments [...] "provide a unique look at the prophet's inner struggle with faith, persecution, and human suffering".|$|E
