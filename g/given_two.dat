Opting for the former, he gives 'birth' to the kidney stones, concurrent with Phoebe’s birth.|$|E

The railway was officially opened on 19 September, and two locomotives hauling twenty-five carriages carrying 400 passengers left Kittybrewster at 11am.

5|$|Another short {{stint in}} Southeastern Championship Wrestling followed, with LeDuc being <b>given</b> <b>two</b> more reigns with the Southeastern Heavyweight title. He was put over his former partner Bob Armstrong for the belt in August 1983 {{and began a}} feud with Robert Fuller, another former partner.

LeDuc held the belt until vacating the title when he left the promotion.|$|E

5|$|During 2009, Ramsay had {{financial}} issues with tax payments. A liquidation petition was placed by HM Revenue and Customs against Plane Food, Maze, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and The Narrow. He was <b>given</b> <b>two</b> weeks {{to pay the}} tax debts accumulated by Plane Food. It was announced on 10 December that he had achieved this and the restaurant remained open. His 2010 opening, Bread Street Kitchen, {{was based on the}} same concept as Plane Food, as its location within the One New Change office and retail development created a similar need to cater for quick dining and a high volume of single diners.|$|E
5|$|Each {{apprentice}} {{was to be}} <b>given</b> <b>two</b> sets of clothing, suitable linen, stockings, hats, and shoes, and a new set {{each year}} thereafter.

5|$|In 1606 Vincenzo's heir Francesco {{commissioned}} from Monteverdi {{the opera}} L'Orfeo, to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of 1607. It was <b>given</b> <b>two</b> performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, {{in the title}} role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of Euridice witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600.

All the music for this opera is lost apart from Ariadne's Lament, which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment Il ballo delle ingrate.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, the Senate {{took up the}} {{question}} of ending the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, a senator from Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be <b>given</b> <b>two</b> years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E
5|$|Johnston then {{knocked over}} Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned {{onto the front}} foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evanswho was <b>given</b> <b>two</b> livesto the crease at 6/60.

The second {{catching}} opportunity went in the same direction before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E

5|$|Later that year, LeDuc {{returned}} to Southeastern Championship Wrestling and was <b>given</b> <b>two</b> more tag team title reigns while teaming with Fuller. Ultimately, however, the team split up and vacated the title. LeDuc was then booked in singles competition, winning the Southeastern Heavyweight Championship twice more with victories over Jacques Rougeau, Jr. and Terry Gordy.

5|$|Later, Weed {{encounters}} a dog named Yukimura, and learns {{that a group}} of monkeys have been terrorizing the area. Leading them is Shōgun, a vicious baboon that feeds on young monkeys and puppies. Shōgun had previously attacked Yukimura and his family, permanently damaging his adopted father Saheiji. Weed, his comrades, Yukimura, and several rebellious monkeys attack Shōgun and his followers. Yukimura is able to injure Shōgun enough to ensure his death, but dies in the process.
