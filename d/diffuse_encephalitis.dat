40|$|Six {{cases of}} post-infectious {{encephalomyelitis}} are described. A preceding non-specific viral-like illness occurred 4 to 20 {{days before the}} onset of the neurological deficits. The clinical syndromes included transverse myelitis, focal encephalitis and encephalomyelitis (each in one case) and <b>diffuse</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in 3. Magnetic resonance imaging appeared to be the investigation of choice. High dose corticosteroids were given to 4 patients who recovered partially or fully. The patient with focal encephalitis had a spontaneous and complete recovery.

40|$|Narcolepsy {{associated}} with localized brain lesions {{is described in}} a 10 -month-old Argentine Dogo. Neurological examination and MRI study suggested an inflammatory lesion of the left frontal lobe. Post-mortem examination revealed <b>diffuse</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in the forebrain and marked necrotic lesions in the ventral pontine area. Immunohistochemistry for distemper virus antigen showed positive staining of the cytoplasm of many neurones of the pons and cerebral cortex. The pathological pattern was suggestive of post-vaccinal distemper encephalitis and the localization of the lesions {{was consistent with the}} neurological syndrome shown by the animal. At any event, the possibility of coincidental findings of distemper encephalitis and idiopathic narcolepsy must be accounted for...|$|E

40|$|The {{first case}} of phocine {{distemper}} in a seal from Canadian waters {{and the first}} case of clinical phocine distemper in a harp seal, Phoca groenlandica, is reported. A two-month-old female harp seal stranded on Prince Edward Island in May 1991. Significant clinical findings were lethargy and severe conjunctivitis. Pulmonary congestion was the main necropsy finding, and histological lesions included <b>diffuse</b> demyelinating nonsuppurative <b>encephalitis</b> and mild multifocal interstitial pneumonia. Acidophilic intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions were present in cerebral neurons and astrocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining confirmed phocine distemper virus (PDV) antigen in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons, bronchiolar gland epithelium and transitional epithelium of the bladder.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{outbreaks}} of trypanosomiasis by Trypanosoma evansi in {{horses in the}} municipality of Chaves, Marajó Island, Pará State, Brazil are reported. The first outbreak occurred in April 2011 in a farm with 147 horses; of these, 47 (31. 97 %) got sick, and 40 (27. 21 %) died. The second outbreak occurred in May 2012 and involved nine properties. Of a total of 679 horses, 209 (30. 07 %) got sick, and 183 (26. 97 %) died. The main clinical signs observed in these horses were weight loss, abdominal edema, toe dragging, and pelvic muscle atrophy. Necropsy was performed in two horses, one from each outbreak. Macroscopic alterations were not seen in the horse from the first outbreak; however, the horse from the second outbreak exhibited emaciation, pallor and icterus, as well as enlarged spleen with prominent white pulp at cut surface. Histopathology of {{the central nervous system}} of both animals revealed mild to severe, <b>diffuse</b> lymphoplasmacytic <b>encephalitis,</b> with presence of Mott cells. Immunohistochemistry for T. evansi revealed structures similar to intralesional trypomastigote forms. Between November and December of 2013, an epidemiological survey was carried out in the municipalities of Cachoeira do Arari, Santa Cruz do Arari, Salvaterra, Soure, and Chaves. Only Santa Cruz do Arari and Chaves had reported cases of the disease. Blood samples were collected from 243 horses for detection of T. evansi DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 20 were positive...|$|R
40|$|Anti-neuronal {{autoimmune}} encephalitis (AIE) comprises {{a recently}} characterized group of immune-mediated disorders {{that result in}} limbic, multifocal, or <b>diffuse</b> <b>encephalitis</b> due to direct interaction of autoantibodies with neuronal surface or synaptic proteins. The pathological effects of the autoantibodies {{vary according to the}} target antigen but when they are removed neuronal dysfunction is commonly reversed. Ongoing research on AIE constantly increases the number of novel autoantibodies and expands the spectrum of neurological syndromes that are important in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric illness, dementia, or viral encephalitis. This review summarizes recent advances in AIE, focusing on pathogenetic mechanisms and novel associations with other CNS disorders such as neurodegeneration, relapsing symptoms post-herpes simplex virus encephalitis, and demyelinating diseases. In addition, an algorithmic approach to detect and characterize neuronal cell surface autoantibodies is proposed...|$|E
40|$|We report our {{pediatric}} {{experience with}} lacosarnide, a new antiepileptic drug, {{approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration as adjunctive therapy in focal epilepsy in patients more than 17 years old. We retrospectively reviewed charts for lacosamide use and seizure frequency outcome in patients with focal epilepsy (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Sixteen patients (7 boys) were identified (median dose 275 mg daily, 4. 7 mg/kg daily; mean age 14. 9 years, range 8 - 21 years). Patients were receiving a median of 2 antiepileptic drugs (interquartile range [IQR] 1. 7 - 3) {{in addition to having}} undergone previous epilepsy surgery (n = 3), vagus nerve stimulation (n = 9), and ketogenic diet (n = 3). Causes included structural (encephalomalacia and <b>diffuse</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> 1 each; stroke in 2) and genetic abnormalities (Aarskog and Rett syndromes, 1 each) or cause not known (n = 10). Median seizure frequency at baseline was 57 per month (IQR 7 - 75), and after a median follow-up of 4 months (range 1 - 13 months) of receiving lacosamide, it was 12. 5 per month (IQR 3 - 75), (P = 50 % reduction seizure frequency) and 10 as having disease that did not respond to therapy (= 50 % seizure reduction) without severe adverse events.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the genetic characteristics of Toxoplasma gondii samples collected from 62 patients with toxoplasmosis in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. DNA samples were isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid and amniotic fluids of 25 patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis and AIDS, two patients with acute toxoplasmosis, 12 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis, six newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis and 17 pregnant women with acute infection. Diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was based in clinical, radiological and laboratory features. Genotyping was performed using multilocus PCR–RFLP genetic markers including SAG 1, SAG 2, 5 ′- and 3 ′-SAG 2, alt. SAG 2, SAG 3, BTUB, GRA 6, C 22 - 8, c 29 - 2, L 358, PK 1 and Apico. Among the 62 clinical samples, 20 (32 %) were successfully genotyped at eight or more genetic loci and were grouped to three distinct genotypes.

40|$|Surveillance for lyssaviruses was {{conducted}} among bat populations in 8 provinces in Thailand. In 2002 and 2003, {{a total of}} 932 bats of 11 species were captured and released after serum collection. Lyssavirus infection was determined by conducting virus neutralization assays on bat serum samples. Of collected samples, 538 were either hemolysed or insufficient in volume, which left 394 suitable for analysis. These samples included the following: Pteropus lylei (n = 335), Eonycteris spelaea (n = 45), Hipposideros armiger (n = 13), and Rousettus leschennaulti (n = 1). No serum samples had evidence of neutralizing antibodies when tested against rabies virus. However, 16 samples had detectable neutralizing antibodies against Aravan virus, Khujand virus, Irkut virus, or Australian bat lyssavirus; all were specifically associated with fruit bats P. lylei (n = 15) and E. spelaea (n = 1). These {{results are consistent with}} the presence of naturally occurring viruses related to new putative lyssavirus genotypes. Rabies is an acute encephalitis caused by a lyssavirus. On a global basis, bats have been associated with several different genotypes of lyssavirus (1 – 5). Two human infections with Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) have been reported, the clinical signs of which were consistent with classical rabies infection, namely a <b>diffuse,</b> nonsuppurative <b>encephalitis</b> (3). A serosurvey for agents similar to ABLV among bats in the Philippines detected a prevalence of 9. 5 % (22 / 231) (6).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} results of {{clinical}} assessment and MRI with neuropathological findings in the diagnosis of HIV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) associated CNS disease. METHODS: A retrospective study of 35 patients infected with HIV who were examined at necropsy between four and 70 (median 20) days after neurological assessment and MRI. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients, 19 had diffuse white matter hyperintensity on T 2 weighted MRI, six of whom also had focal lesions. Nine other patients had focal white matter lesions and seven had changes in cortical atrophy only. Necropsy in the 19 with diffuse white matter hyperintensity showed HIV leukoencephalopathy (HIVLEP) with encephalitis in 10, CMV encephalitis in three, both HIVLEP/HIV encephalitis and CMV encephalitis in one, lymphoma in three, and non-specific inflammation in two. Necropsy in the 16 other patients without diffuse white matter hyperintensity showed CMV encephalitis in six, HIV encephalitis (without HIVLEP) in two, CMV encephalitis and HIVLEP/HIV encephalitis in one, non-HIV associated abnormalities in five, herpes simplex encephalitis in one, and lymphoma in one. CMV DNA was detected in CSF of five of seven patients with CMV encephalitis and in two of two with CMV associated polyradiculopathy but without CMV <b>encephalitis.</b> <b>Diffuse</b> white matter hyperintensity on MRI had a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 66. 6 %, and a positive predictive value of 58 % for diagnosis of HIVLEP. CONCLUSION: Diffuse white matter hyperintensity on MRI can be due to either HIV or CMV associated pathology or non-specific abnormalities...|$|R

40|$|Neurological {{disorders}} {{caused by}} Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{in patients with}} Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are rarely reported in the Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) period. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the main clinical and laboratory features of patients with CMV-related neurological complications in HIV-infected patients admitted to a referral center in São Paulo, Brazil. CMV disease requires the identification of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Thirteen cases were identified between January, 2004 and December, 2008. The median age of patients was 38 years and nine (69 %) were men. At admission all patients were aware of their HIV status and only four (31 %) patients were on HAART. Patients who were not on antiretroviral therapy before admission received HAART while inpatients. CMV disease was the first AIDS-defining illness in eight (62 %) patients. The neurologic syndromes identified were <b>diffuse</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (n = 7; 62 %), polyradiculopathy (n = 7; 54 %), focal encephalitis (rhombencephalitis) (n = 1; 8 %), and ventriculo-encephalitis (n = 1; 8 %). Seven (54 %) patients presented extra-neural CMV disease and four (31 %) had retinitis. The median of CD 4 + T-cell count was 13 cells/µL (range: 1 - 124 cells/µL). Overall in-hospital mortality was 38 %. Eight patients used ganciclovir or foscarnet (in-hospital mortality: 50 %) and five patients used ganciclovir and foscarnet (in-hospital mortality: 20 %). None of the patients fulfilled the diagnosis criteria of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Four patients were lost to follow-up, and three patients presented immune recovery and discontinued secondary prophylaxis. Although infrequent, distinct neurological syndromes caused by CMV continue to cause high mortality among AIDS patients. Survival depends upon the use of effective antiviral therapy against CMV and the early introduction of HAART...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Diffuse viral {{encephalitis}} {{may lack}} fever and other cardinal signs of infection and hence its distinction from other acute encephalopathic illnesses is challenging. Often, the EEG changes seen routinely are nonspecific and reflect diffuse encephalopathic changes only. The {{aim of this}} study was to use nonlinear dynamic mathematical techniques for analyzing the EEG data in order to look for any characteristic diagnostic patterns in diffuse forms of encephalitis. It was diagnosed on clinical, imaging and cerebrospinal fluid criteria in three young male patients. Metabolic and toxic encephalopathies were ruled out through appropriate investigations. Digital EEGs were done on the 3 rd to 5 th day of onset. The digital EEGs of 5 male and 5 female age and sex matched healthy volunteers served as controls. Two sample t-test indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the average values in amplitude between the two groups. However, the standard deviation (or variance) of the EEG signals at FP 1 -F 7 and FP 2 -F 8 are significantly higher for the patients than the normal subjects. The regularisation dimension is significantly less for the patients (average between 1. 24 - 1. 43) when compared to the normal persons (average between 1. 41 - 1. 63) for the EEG signals from all locations except for the Fz-Cz signal. Similarly the wavelet dimension is significantly less (P = 0. 05 *) for the patients (1. 122) when compared to the normal person (1. 458). EEGs are subdued in the case of the patients with presence of uniform patterns, manifested in the values of regularisation and wavelet dimensions, when compared to the normal person, indicating a decrease in chaotic nature.
