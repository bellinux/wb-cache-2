5|$|Bahá'í teachings are in {{some ways}} similar to other monotheistic faiths: God is {{considered}} single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. As such, Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings {{is the goal of}} a unified world order that <b>ensures</b> <b>the</b> prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.|$|E

Soon after, Joan is able to lift the siege. The story continues with various French victories and the English are pushed back from fort after fort. Eventually, the English are pushed back to Tourelles. While the English fight their way there, one of the generals, Salisbury, is able to wound Joan.

Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time in wheelchairs to experience what life is like for him. Meanwhile, Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) if he cannot pay her ultrasound bill. Puck (Mark Salling) fights with Finn, whom he feels is not doing enough to support Quinn.

She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is able to find a job.|$|E
5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod <b>ensures</b> <b>the</b> wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, <b>ensures</b> <b>the</b> player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E
