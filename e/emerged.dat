Yet it is only recently that foresighted firms have embraced <b>emerging</b> technologies and <b>emerging</b> markets through entrepreneurial activity. <b>Emerging</b> technologies and <b>emerging</b> markets present both unique challenges and tremendous opportunities for those firms and individuals who focus their search for competitive advantage on them. Here, we provide examples of effective commercial pathways for both intra- and entrepreneurial ventures embracing these phenomena. First, we describe how one intrapreneurial large firm is investigating <b>emerging</b> markets such as India and China (<b>emerging</b> economies) with <b>emerging</b> technologies to create a worldwide business solution power. Then the investigation of an <b>emerging</b> technology is provided, that of nanotechnology, by a small entrepreneurial firm utilizing <b>emerging</b> market skill sets to define and enable worldwide business solutions. Interestingly, both of the respective commercialization strategies are based on competency theory albeit, used differently. Finally, we discuss the ability of large and small firm competency-based strategies to wrest value from the opportunities inherent in <b>emerging</b> markets and technologies...|$|R

Much of the north fell to the Delhi sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire.
