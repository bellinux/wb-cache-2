5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} towards them {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} ordered to abandon ship after about forty minutes of the {{bombardment}} using the only remaining operable motor lifeboat of the three stowed on board. One officer and four enlisted men were injured, {{but no one was}} killed. The Turks continued their bombardment <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> until Ben-my-Chree listed to starboard and sank in shallow water. Later in the day, the captain and the chief engineer returned to the wreck to rescue the ship's mascots, a cat and dog which had both survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} of hazardous goods through the crossing {{is governed by}} the European ADR Agreement. The Dartford Crossing is class C, which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids. The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols through the tunnel was banned. Certain hazardous goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted) may require escorting by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. The crossing authority must hold exercises {{in conjunction with the}} emergency services. In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E

5|$|At this point, the Erie Railroad {{continued}} {{on with a}} new station at Harriman, which remained prosperous for years to come. In June 1931, James Gorney, a resident of Pine Island, allegedly attempted to rob the station and station agent. Harriman police shot Gorney in the leg, which was crippling enough that it required amputation of the leg. His lawyer, who got him off third-degree burglary charges and several acquittals, also negotiated a payment of $20,000 to Gorney from Harriman for {{the pain and suffering}} of the amputated leg, despite the attempted crime he was shot for. The jury deliberated <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> before reaching a verdict of awarding Gorney the money.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1989 {{the actor}} Jack Douglas and Richard Hope-Hawkins {{organised}} a benefit concert for Terry-Thomas, after discovering {{he was living}} in virtual obscurity, poverty and ill health. The gala, held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ran <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours,</b> and featured 120artists with Phil Collins topping the bill and Michael Caine as the gala chairman. The show raised over £75,000 for Terry-Thomas and Parkinson's UK. The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry-Thomas to move out of his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in Godalming, Surrey. He died there on 8 January 1990, at the age of 78. The funeral service was held at St. John the Baptist Church, Busbridge, where the theme from Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines was played; he was cremated at Guildford Crematorium.|$|E

5|$|Rounding a corner, {{they see}} a cat and hide under a basket, but the cat then sits {{on top of the}} basket <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours,</b> {{trapping}} the pair. Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{as fast as}} he {{had been}} on the {{previous}} tour, Constantine was still capable of short bursts of very fast bowling. However, the slowness of the pitch reduced the effectiveness of the Bodyline tactics, and Constantine took one for 55; England's captain Douglas Jardine, who had implemented the Bodyline tactics in Australia, batted <b>for</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> to score his only Test century. The public disapproval expressed during and after the match was instrumental in turning English attitudes against Bodyline, something Constantine considered hypocritical. In the West Indies' second innings Constantine's innings of 64 in an hour ensured that the match was drawn. Nelson initially agreed to release him for the third Test, with Essex all-rounder Stan Nichols to be Constantine's substitute for the club team. When Jardine heard, he convinced the England selectors to include Nichols in the England team for the Test, the deal collapsed and Constantine did not play. Most critics believed that the West Indies underachieved in the Test series; Constantine believed that one cause was the inadequacy of Grant as captain. In all first-class games on the tour Constantine scored 181 runs at 20.11 and took 14 wickets at 22.14.|$|E
