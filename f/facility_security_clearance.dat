After review and approval of that information, the FSO submits the completed e-QIP to the Defense Industrial <b>Security</b> <b>Clearance</b> Office (DISCO) for review. Once DISCO approves the information, it is sent on to Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which conducts the actual investigation and sends the findings back to DISCO. DISCO then either gives clearance, or forwards the results to Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) for further action.|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The {{free flow of information}} among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies could prove vital to fighting the war on terrorism. State and local law enforcement officials are key stakeholders in the United States' efforts to combat terrorism, and as such, they may require access to classified national security information to help prevent or respond to terrorist attacks. In order to gain access to such information, state and local law enforcement officials generally need federal <b>security</b> <b>clearances.</b> The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) grants <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> and shares classified information with state and local law enforcement officials. Immediately following September 11, 2001, some state and local law enforcement officials expressed frustration with the complexity of the process for obtaining <b>security</b> <b>clearances.</b> Others expressed frustration with the length of time it took to obtain a <b>security</b> <b>clearance.</b> These frustrations exacerbated the general concern among law enforcement stakeholders that the lack of <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> could impede the flow of critical information from the FBI to {{the state and local level}}, from the state and local level to the FBI, and laterally from one state or local agency to another. In turn, this potential lack of access to critical terrorism-related information might place local law enforcement officials at a disadvantage in their efforts to respond to or combat a terrorist threat. The Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary asked us to examine several issues regarding the FBI's process for granting <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> to state and local law enforcement officials. This report provides information on: (1) the FBI's process for granting <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> to state and local law enforcement officials, (2) the extent to which the FBI has met its time frame goals for processing <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> applications for state and local law enforcement officials and factors that could affect the timely processing of <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> applications, and (3) efforts undertaken by the FBI to enhance its <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> and information-sharing processes with state and local law enforcement officials. ...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses our key findings and recommendations in our report that we are releasing today on some aspects of personnel <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> reforms. We conducted our review {{in response to a}} congressional request. This is the fourth in a series of hearings, in which Congress has asked GAO to testify; and this Subcommittee's continued oversight has helped focus attention on the need for personnel security reform. Personnel <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> allow government and industry personnel to gain access to classified information that, through unauthorized disclosure, can in some cases cause exceptionally grave damage to U. S. national security. The July 2010 and subsequent October 2010 recent unauthorized leak of almost 500, 000 classified documents posted to the Internet related to the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq provides a cogent example of the inherent risks involved when granting an individual a <b>security</b> <b>clearance.</b> To ameliorate these risks, government agencies rely on a multiphased personnel <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> process. However, with the increase in demand over the past decade for personnel with <b>security</b> <b>clearances,</b> we and others have identified problems with the <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> process with respect to delays and incomplete documentation. As a result, we have designated the Department of Defense's (DOD) clearance program [...] which represents a vast majority of the initial <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> adjudicated by the federal government [...] as a high-risk area since 2005. In light of longstanding concerns regarding delays in processing clearances and other issues, Congress set objectives and established requirements for improving the clearance process in section 3001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA). IRTPA established objectives for timeliness, requirements for reciprocity [...] an agency's acceptance of a background investigation or clearance determination completed by any authorized investigative or adjudicative agency [...] and an integrated, secure database to house clearance information. In 2007, DOD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) formed the Joint <b>Security</b> <b>Clearance</b> Process Reform Team, known as the Joint Reform Team, to transform the <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> process governmentwide. In the following year, Executive Order 13467 was issued, establishing a Suitability and <b>Security</b> <b>Clearance</b> Performance Accountability Council (Performance Accountability Council) that is responsible for driving the implementation of reform and is accountable to the President for achieving the reform effort's goals. This governance structure was put in place, in part, to sustain the momentum of clearance reforms. We have previously noted that top leadership must be committed to organizational transformation. To this end, committed executive leadership has worked to reform the personnel <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> process by improving timeliness and developing quality measures. Congressional oversight through hearings held by this subcommittee in February, July and September 2008, and in October 2009 has helped focus attention on the need for <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> reform. In addition, the recently passed Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires reports by the President on the <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> process, including information on timeliness and quality. This statement highlights the key findings and recommendations from the report we are issuing today. Specifically, it will focus {{on the extent to which}} select executive branch agencies (1) investigate and adjudicate initial personnel <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> applications for civilian, military, and industry personnel in a timely manner; (2) honor previously granted personnel <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> and the challenges, if any, that exist related to reciprocity; and (3) share personnel clearance information in a single, integrated database. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1984, High Tech Gays, {{a social}} {{organization}} of homosexuals {{employed in the}} technology industry founded in 1983 in San Jose, California, challenged {{the policy of the}} Defense Industrial <b>Security</b> <b>Clearance</b> Organization (DISCO), a unit of the U.S. Department of Defense, that routinely denied <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> to applicants who were known or thought to be homosexual. The group brought the suit as a class action with three named plaintiffs. DISCO's policy was to deny high-level <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> to anyone who had participated in homosexual activity within the past fifteen years and to require more extensive review of applications for <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> on the part of gays. The plaintiffs were employed by businesses doing work under contract to the Department of Defense.|$|R

5000|$|Dual {{citizenship}} {{is associated with}} two categories of security concerns: foreign influence and foreign preference. Dual citizenship in itself is not the major problem in obtaining or retaining <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> in the USA. If a <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> applicant's dual {{citizenship is}} [...] "based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country", {{that can be a}} mitigating condition. However, exercising (taking advantage of the entitlements of) a non-U.S. citizenship can cause problems. For example, possession and/or use of a foreign passport is a condition disqualifying from <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> and [...] "is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country" [...] as is explicitly clarified in a Department of Defense policy memorandum which defines a guideline requiring that [...] "any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official permission for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government". This guideline has been followed in administrative rulings by the Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) office of Industrial <b>Security</b> <b>Clearance</b> Review (ISCR), which decides cases involving <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> for Contractor personnel doing classified work for all DoD components.
