5|$|Further {{progress}} in the 1970s was made {{with the arrival of}} the microchip, and the ensuing exponential increase in processing power has meant the development of fast and powerful systems.

5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> free molecular oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Chaired {{by former}} TD Anne Colley, this working group {{included}} GLEN, {{the gay rights}} lobby organisation, who said they expected a recommendation for civil marriage. The group facilitated a conference on the topic in May 2006, as input to its reports which was attended by experts from other countries which <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> civil unions and same-sex marriage. During his speech, McDowell was interrupted {{by members of the}} Ancient Order of Hibernians opposed to the Government plans.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by human impact on the environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve the genetics of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization. Humans <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} 60 years several Commonwealth {{countries}} <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> their own honours systems, {{separate from the}} British Honours System. Australia, Canada and New Zealand have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the Military Cross with their own awards. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, the {{astronomer}} David Charbonneau, {{who led the}} team that made the Hubble observations, cautioned that the telescope itself may <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> variations that caused the theoretical model to suggest the presence of water.

5|$|Rotavirus {{vaccines}} are licensed in over 100 countries, {{and more}} than 80 countries <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> routine rotavirus vaccination, almost half {{with the support of}} Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. To make rotavirus vaccines available, accessible, and affordable in all countries—particularly low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur PATH, the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance have partnered with research institutions and governments to generate and disseminate evidence, lower prices, and accelerate introduction.|$|E
5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers. Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E

5|$|Needham may <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> Charteris to Sally Salisbury around 1708. Salisbury was the {{pre-eminent}} prostitute {{of the day}} and {{was kept}} by Charteris for a short time as mistress at the beginning of her career. When her previous bawd, Mother Wisebourne, died in 1719, she became a member of Needham's household and brought with her a clientele from the highest ranks of society. Salisbury brought further fame to Needham's house by involving another of her girls in the theft of the Earl of Cardigan's clothes. The two women accompanied him to Newmarket where he became drunk, and after putting him to bed at an inn they stole his clothes and jewellery and returned to London. The Earl treated the matter as a joke.|$|E

5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E
5|$|Shankar {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the top sitar players of {{the second half of the}} 20th century. He popularised performing on the bass octave of the sitar for the alap section and became known for a distinctive playing style in the middle and high registers that used quick and short deviations of the playing string and his sound creation through stops and strikes on the main playing string. Narayana Menon of The New Grove Dictionary noted Shankar's liking for rhythmic novelties, among them the use of unconventional rhythmic cycles. Hans Neuhoff of Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart has argued that Shankar's playing style was not widely adopted and that he was surpassed by other sitar players in the performance of melodic passages. Shankar's interplay with Alla Rakha improved appreciation for tabla playing in Hindustani classical music. Shankar promoted the jugalbandi duet concert style and claims to <b>have</b> <b>introduced</b> new ragas Tilak Shyam, Nat Bhairav and Bairagi.|$|E
5|$|The schoolboys {{sections}} of Shamrock Rovers and Tallaght Town merged in 1997 {{to form a}} new section to serve the Tallaght area of South West Dublin.
