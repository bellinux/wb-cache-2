40|$|Arctic coastal {{systems are}} very {{sensitive}} to the freshwater budget mainly formed by river runoff. Great biases in estimation of total river runoff load to the Arctic Ocean proposed by the number of various scientific groups and insufficiency of physically-based, short-term, spatially diverse runoff predictions lead to strong necessity of state-of-art hydrological techniques implementation. At the moment the most powerful tools for the land hydrological cycle modeling are physically-based, conceptual or data-driven models. Better model – wider sources of hydrometeorological and landscape-related information we need to use to perform robust calculations. Severe climatic conditions of Arctic coastal region have led to weak river runoff monitoring net and a high level of uncertainties related to difficulties of direct measurements.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for specifying, training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models. Our focus is on simplifying cutting <b>edge</b> <b>machine</b> learning for practitioners {{in order to bring}} such technologies into production. Recognizing the fast evolution of the field of deep learning, we make no attempt to capture the design space of all possible model architectures in a domain- specific language (DSL) or similar configuration language. We allow users to write code to define their models, but provide abstractions that guide develop- ers to write models in ways conducive to productionization. We also provide a unifying Estimator interface, making it possible to write downstream infrastructure (e. g. distributed training, hyperparameter tuning) independent of the model implementation. We balance the competing demands for flexibility and simplicity by offering APIs at different levels of abstraction, making common model architectures available out of the box, while providing a library of utilities designed to speed up experimentation with model architectures. To make out of the box models flexible and usable across a wide range of problems, these canned Estimators are parameterized not only over traditional hyperparameters, but also using feature columns, a declarative specification describing how to interpret input data. We discuss our experience in using this framework in re- search and production environments, and show the impact on code health, maintainability, and development speed.

40|$|Abstract � In a {{trend that}} {{reflects}} the increasing demand for intelligent applications driven by business data, IBM today is building out {{a significant number of}} applications that leverage machine learning technologies to optimize business process decisions. This talk highlights this trend; and describes the many different ways in which leading <b>edge</b> <b>machine</b> learning concepts are being utilized in business applications developed by IBM for its internal use and for clients. 1. Overview IBM has embarked upon a major strategy that focuses on Business Analytics and Optimization as a key technology for helping businesses optimize their routine operational and strategic decisions. This strategy essentially acknowledges the natural progression and evolution in the way businesses have been leveraging information, from the traditional “descriptive ” analytics methods, to increasing use of “predictive analytics”, and eventually “prescriptive ” analytics. Descriptive analytics of data allows a user to get a retrospective view on the business, getting answers to questions like “what happened”, “how many times”, and “where”. Predictive analytics allows a user to get a prospective view on the business, getting answers to questions like “what could happen”, “what if these trends continue”, and “what might happen next if [...] ”. Prescriptive analytics allows a user to obtain an actionable solution, getting an answer to the question, “what is the set of required actions ” to take to achieve a business objective, under a given set of predictions and business constraints. Several case studies have overwhelmingly demonstrated that businesses dramatically improve their competitive presence by embracing predictive and prescriptive applications to optimize their business decision making.

40|$|The fate of {{contemporary}} scientific research in biology and medicine {{is bound to}} the advancements in computational methods. The unprecedented data explosion in microscopy and the crescent interest of life scientists in studying more complex and more subtle interactions stimulate the research for innovative computational solutions on challenging real world applications. Extensions and novel formulations of generic and flexible methods based on learning/inference are necessary {{to cope with the}} large variety of the produced data and to avoid continuous reimplementation and heavy parameter tuning. This thesis exploits cutting <b>edge</b> <b>machine</b> learning methods based on structured probabilistic models and weakly supervised learning to provide four novel solutions in the areas of large-scale microscopic imaging and multiple objects tracking. Chapter 2 introduces a weakly supervised learning framework to tackle the problem of detecting defect images while mining massive microscopic imagery databases. This thesis demonstrates accurate prediction with low user annotation effort. Chapter 3 presents a learning approach for counting overlapping objects in images based on local structured predictors. This problem has numerous applications in high throughput microscopy screening such as cells counting for drug toxicity assays. Chapter 4 develops a deterministic graphical model to impose temporal consistency in objects counts when dealing with a video sequence. This Chapter shows that global (temporal and spatial) structural inference consistently improves over local (only spatial) predictions. The method developed in Chapter 4 is used in a novel downstream tracking algorithm which is introduced in Chapter 5. This Chapter tackles, for the first time, the difficult problem of tracking heavily overlapping, translucent and indistinguishable objects. The mutual occlusion event handling of such objects is formulated as a novel structured inference problem based on the minimization of a convex multi-commodity flow energy. The optimal weights of the energy terms are learned with partial user supervision using structured learning with latent variables. To support behavioral biologists, we apply this method to the problem of tracking a community of interacting Drosophila larvae...|$|E
