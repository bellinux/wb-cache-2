5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, {{the leading cause}} being irreversible shock with multiple organ <b>failure</b> (a possible complication of severe infections). Improvements in diagnosis and treatment {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ <b>failure</b> are likely to die unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include heart <b>failure</b> and pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Engine <b>failure</b> causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic <b>failure</b> of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine <b>failure</b> the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine <b>failure</b> was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine <b>failure.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heart <b>failure</b> {{is where}} the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart <b>failure</b> of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart <b>failure</b> can also lead to right heart <b>failure</b> (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart <b>failure</b> include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive <b>failures</b> are minor {{errors in}} {{thinking}} reported by clinical and non-clinical individuals during everyday life. It {{is not yet}} clear how subjectively-reported cognitive <b>failures</b> relate to objective neuropsychological ability. We aimed to consolidate the definition of cognitive <b>failures,</b> outline evidence for the relationship with objective cognition, and develop a unified model of factors that increase cognitive <b>failures.</b> We conducted a systematic review of cognitive <b>failures,</b> identifying 45 articles according to the PRISMA statement. <b>Failures</b> were defined as reflecting proneness to errors in 2 ̆ 7 real world 2 ̆ 7 planned thought and action. Vulnerability to <b>failures</b> was not consistently associated with objective cognitive performance. A range of stable and variable factors were linked to increased risk of cognitive <b>failures.</b> We conclude that cognitive <b>failures</b> measure real world cognitive capacity rather than pure 2 ̆ 7 unchallenged 2 ̆ 7 ability. Momentary state may interact with predisposing trait factors to increase the likelihood of <b>failures</b> occurring. Inclusion of self-reported cognitive <b>failures</b> in objective cognitive research will increase the translational relevance of ability into more ecologically valid aspects of real world functioning...|$|R

Complications following severe cholangitis include renal <b>failure,</b> respiratory <b>failure</b> (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney <b>failure</b> is {{the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney <b>failure</b> is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney <b>failure.</b> If kidney <b>failure</b> occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E

40|$|Although {{objective}} {{measures of}} memory performance typically indicate memory declines with age, self-reported memory <b>failures</b> often show {{no relation to}} age. In contrast, self-reported attention <b>failures</b> are reliably negatively correlated with age. This contrast suggests the possibility that age-related awareness and reporting of memory <b>failures</b> might be masked by a concurrent decrease in attention <b>failures,</b> which would reduce encoding <b>failures</b> with age and hence reduce perceived memory <b>failures.</b> Self-reported problems of attention and memory were evaluated in two samples with the ages spanning eight decades. Initial analysis indicated that attention <b>failures</b> significantly decreased with age, whereas memory problems did not to differ across age. The association of self-reported memory <b>failures</b> became significantly positive, however, when residualized on attention lapses. In contrast, the correlation between attention lapses and age was modestly affected when memory <b>failures</b> were controlled. These results highlight the close relation of attention lapses and memory problems and, beyond the implications of individual differences in attention for memory research, suggest the advisability of assessing attention <b>failures</b> for a full evaluation of memory problems...|$|R
