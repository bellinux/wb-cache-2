Pinafore and The Mikado into children's books called The Pinafore Picture Book and The Story of The Mikado <b>giving,</b> <b>in</b> some cases, backstory that is {{not found in the}} librettos. Many other children's books have since been written retelling {{the stories of}} the operas or {{adapting}} characters or events from them. In the 19th century, the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan songs and music were adapted as dance pieces.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} of marriage is stated to have come into existence after he married {{to set an example}} for other humans to follow. His life is also credited by Jains with starting the {{institution of}} charity (daana) from layperson to mendicants, when he received surgarcane juice in his hand from king Sreyamsa, to break his fast. This is accepted in the Jain tradition as what started the tradition of alms <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E

5|$|To reach a {{complete}} peace Thurisind had first {{to deal with}} Ildigis who had found hospitality at Thurisind's court. Audoin demanded yet again to have him turned in, and Justinian joined in the request. Thurisind, despite his reluctance to resume the war with both Audoin and Justinian, {{did not want to}} openly breach the rules of hospitality and thus tried to evade the request by demanding in his turn to have Ostrogotha given to him; in the end, to avoid both openly <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> {{and at the same time}} renewing the war, both kings murdered their respective guests but kept secret their involvement in the act.|$|E
5|$|Seeing little {{prospect}} of the Queen <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> and receiving her daughter-in-law, the Cumberlands moved to Germany in 1818. They had difficulty living within their means in Britain, {{and the cost of}} living was much lower in Germany. Queen Charlotte died on 17 November 1818, but the Cumberlands remained in Germany, living principally in Berlin, where the Duchess had relatives. In 1817, the Duchess had a stillborn daughter; in 1819 she gave birth to a boy, Prince George of Cumberland. The Duke occasionally visited England, where he stayed with his eldest brother, who in 1820 succeeded to the British and Hanoverian thrones as George IV. George III's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, died six days before his father, but left a daughter, Princess Victoria of Kent. With the death of George III, Ernest became fourth in line to the British throne, following the Duke of York (who would die without legitimate issue in 1827), the Duke of Clarence, and Princess Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends.

5|$|While {{making a}} {{delivery}} in the Historic District, Cole is instructed {{to open the}} package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling several city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after {{he is accused of}} triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. <b>Giving</b> <b>in</b> to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler.|$|E

Charlotte is no exception, and when she makes Arthur soup, she is rewarded by him throwing it in her face.

25|$|The Industrial Revolution {{concentrated}} labour into mills, {{factories and}} mines, thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions to help advance {{the interests of}} working people.

Employers had to decide between <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> to the union demands {{at a cost to}} themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.|$|E

Kabbalah defines God as the force of <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> existence.
