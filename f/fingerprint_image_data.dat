40|$|A modular, {{unsupervised}} {{neural network}} architecture for clustering and classification of complex data sets is presented. The adaptive fuzzy leader clustering (AFLC) architecture is a hybrid neural-fuzzy system that learns on-line in a stable and efficient manner. The initial classification is performed in two stages: a simple competitive stage and a distance metric comparison stage. The cluster prototypes are then incrementally updated by relocating the centroid positions from fuzzy C-means system equations for the centroids and the membership values. The AFLC algorithm {{is applied to the}} Anderson Iris data and laser-luminescent <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> <b>data.</b> It is concluded that the AFLC algorithm successfully classifies features extracted from real data, discrete or continuous...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The need {{of sharing}} <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> <b>data</b> in many emerg-ing {{applications}} raises {{concerns about the}} protection of privacy. It has become possible to use automated algorithms for inferring soft biometrics from fingerprint images. Even if we cannot uniquely match the person to an existing fingerprint, revealing their age or gender may lead to undesirable consequences. Our research is focused on de-identifying fingerprint images in order to obfuscate soft biometrics. In this paper, we first discuss a general framework for soft biometrics fingerprint de-identification. We implemented the framework {{to reduce the risk}} of successful estimation of gender from fingerprint images using ad-hoc image filtering. We evaluate the proposed approach through experiments using a data set of rolled fingerprints collected at West Virginia University. Results show the proposed method is effective in preventing gender estimation from fingerprint images...|$|E
40|$|Extreme {{learning}} machine (ELM) {{has been extensively}} studied in machine learning community {{during the last few}} decades due to its high efficiency and the unification of classification, regression, and so forth. Though bearing such merits, existing ELM algorithms cannot efficiently handle the issue of missing data, which is relatively common in practical applications. The problem of missing data is commonly handled by imputation (i. e., replacing missing values with substituted values according to available information). However, imputation methods are not always effective. In this paper, we propose a sample-based learning framework to address this issue. Based on this framework, we develop two sample-based ELM algorithms for classification and regression, respectively. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted in synthetic data sets, UCI benchmark data sets, and a real world <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> <b>data</b> set. As indicated, without introducing extra computational complexity, the proposed algorithms do more accurate and stable learning than other state-of-the-art ones, {{especially in the case of}} higher missing ratio...|$|E

At user’s home, the client’s account information is encrypted and embedded into the <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> via <b>data</b> hiding method secretly. Then the <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> with embedded <b>data</b> {{is transferred to}} the bank over Internet. At bank side, the client’s account information is extracted. It is used to retrieve the client’s registered fingerprint from central database, which is then matched with extracted fingerprint via fingerprint recognition method to verify user’s identity. This system is more reliable and secure than transferring password alone. The data are embedded with quantization watermark in the JPEG 2000 coding pipeline. Compare to our previous proposed system, the interaction time can be reduced because less data will be transmitted. When the <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> is compressed to 1 / 4 ~ 1 / 20 of its original size, the embedded watermark can still be recovered.

40|$|This is {{an excerpt}} from the content Synonyms Fingerprint benchmark; Fingerprint corpora; Fingerprint dataset Definition Fingerprint {{databases}} are structured collections of fingerprint data mainly used for either evaluation or operational recognition purposes. Fingerprint data in databases for evaluation are usually detached from the identity of corresponding individuals. These databases are publicly available for research purposes, and they usually consist of raw fingerprint images acquired with live-scan sensors or digitized from inked fingerprint impressions on paper. Databases for evaluation are the basis for research in automatic fingerprint recognition, and together with specific experimental protocols, they are the basis for a number of technology evaluations and benchmarks. This is the type of fingerprint databases further covered here. On the other hand, fingerprint databases for operational recognition are typically proprietary, they usually incorporate personal information about the enrolled people together with the fingerprint data, and they can incorporate either raw <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> <b>data</b> or some form of distinctive fingerprint descriptors such as minutiae templates. These fingerprint databases represent one of the modules in operational automated fingerprint recognition systems, and they will not be adressed here...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the development and performance tests of a contact-free fingerprint sensor, TrueFinger 3 D (TF 3 D). This contactless fingerprint sensor is designed to be perfectly interoperable with <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> <b>data</b> captured with contact-based sensors or ink pads. This is achieved by acquiring a 3 D dataset of the fingertip together with the image of the papillary lines. Based on the 3 D data, the papillary lines image can be processed to compensate perspective foreshortening or even emulate deformation effects caused with contact-based sensors. The 3 D measurement mechanism and the image processing are described in detail. The resulting fingerprint images taken by the contactless sensor are then matched with images taken by regular contact-based fingerprint readers at different force levels. The comparison shows that the geometric distortion of our contactless sensor TF 3 D is comparable to that of contact-based sensors deployed under regular conditions. Our test also shows that contact -based sensors operated under irregular or strong force conditions suffer from a substantial performance degradation, not seen with the contactless sensor TF 3 D, which has perfect reproducibility. The results also indicate perfect interoperability of the TF 3 D with any contact-based data and should therefore entitle the sensor to a certification for governmental use...|$|E

If the sensor is not equipped with an appropriate algorithm aimed to detect the ﬁngerprint spoof, the system processes the obtained image as a one belonging to a real ﬁngerprint. In order to face this problem, several presentation attacks detection (PAD) algorithms have been proposed so far. Current methods heavily rely on features extracted from a large data set of fake and real <b>ﬁngerprint</b> <b>images,</b> and an appropriate classiﬁer trained with such data to distinguish between live (real) and fake (spoof) <b>ﬁngerprint</b> <b>images.</b> Building such <b>data</b> set requires a signiﬁcant eﬀort for fabricating samples of fake ﬁngerprints, with the most eﬀective materials used to circumvent the sensor.

Biometric authentication is achieved by considering the <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> of the client. Secondly we ensure a secured communication link between the client machine to the bank server using an optimized energy efficient and wavelet based AES processor.
