5|$|By Monday May 8, the <b>fire</b> <b>perimeter</b> {{extended}} from west of Highway 154, {{in the hills}} burned in the 1990 Painted Cave Fire, across the front country of the Santa Ynez Mountains east through Mission Canyon, Rattlesnake Canyon, and into the hills above Montecito, reaching the area burned by the Gap Fire in July 2008 and the Tea Fire in November 2008. Intense sundowner winds caused the fire to spread rapidly during evening and nighttime hours during its first three days.|$|E
5|$|Increased fire {{monitoring}} through {{ground based}} and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed.

5|$|The Forest Service {{and other}} {{scientists}} are currently studying the biological effects from the fire. There were 45 California spotted owl breeding sites within the Rim <b>Fire</b> <b>perimeter</b> on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded occupancy rate for California spotted owls. Spotted owl sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs {{at the same rate}} as unburned sites. The Rim Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus unburned sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, as is often the case with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E
30|$|The {{differences}} observed here {{show that}} fire size information gathered from various {{fire detection systems}} may vary considerably. Selecting the optimal fire size and location information is easier for a single large fire, such as the Tripod Fire Complex, where good field-based observations were available and <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> are maintained within publicly available databases such as GeoMac and MTBS. In the fire community, NIFC <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> are considered the most accurate fire size information available (R. Harrod, personal communication). For smaller <b>fires,</b> precise <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> may not be available.|$|R
30|$|The {{method of}} {{recording}} <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> also changed during {{the twentieth century}} and could have influenced records of pyrogeography. Early fire atlas records were derived from hand-drawn maps of <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> and <b>fire</b> incident reports, whereas recent perimeters are derived from field mapping with GPS receivers, remote sensing, or, during some large fires, infrared mapping.|$|R
30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>perimeters.</b> The CONAFOR <b>fire</b> {{ignition}} {{dates and}} <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> {{were not available}} to identify fires that occurred in 2010 or before. Two LANDSAT images for each calendar year between 1984 and 2010, one from late spring (May to June) and the other from early fall (September to October), were visually examined to identify fire locations. We did not analyze years after 2010 because no fires more than 10 ha in size occurred between 2010 and 2015. <b>Fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> were digitized from RdNBR (relative differenced normalized burn ratio; Miller and Thode 2007) images derived from the earliest possible post-fire image and a pre-fire image with a matching pre-fire date. To ensure consistency and high spatial precision, digitization was performed at on-screen display scales between 1 : 12 000 and 1 : 24 000.|$|R
5|$|The United States Forest Service made {{it their}} highest {{priority}} {{fire at the}} time because of the threat to local communities and its proximity to Yosemite National Park. Though Giant Sequoia trees, {{some of the biggest}} and oldest living things on Earth, are very fire-tolerant and need fire to reproduce, concerns rose as the fire approached them. Park officials set sprinklers to help protect nearby Sequoia trees, but the sprinklers were later removed and careful low-intensity prescribed burns were used. Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the <b>fire</b> <b>perimeter</b> where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area. Smoke from the fire caused unhealthy air conditions in Reno, Nevada, and the Lake Tahoe area {{during the first week of}} the fire, forcing the cancellation of several outdoor events. School children were sent home due to smoky conditions as well. From Yosemite to the San Joaquin Valley, air quality reached unhealthy levels several times according to the National Weather Service. Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, a family camp operated by the city of Berkeley, established in 1922, was burned to the ground. Nearby Camp Tawonga suffered some damage, including the loss of three buildings. Camp Mather, operated by the city of San Francisco, suffered minor damage, as did the San Jose Camp run by the city of San Jose.|$|E
2500|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation re-opened Route 20 on August 31.

Between September 11 and September 14, the fire continued to burning slowly down slope through the Three Sisters Wilderness toward lava beds, which create a natural fire break because there was no fuel to burn in the lava fields. [...] During this period, fire crews patrolled the existing fire lines and finished mopping up hot spots. [...] Forest Service and Oregon Department of Transportation crews also removed hazardous trees from the Route 242 corridor and repaired culverts along the roadway.|$|E
30|$|<b>Perimeters</b> in <b>fire</b> atlas data simplify reality. Unfortunately, {{unburned}} islands within <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> are not mapped (Kolden and Weisberg 2007), and atlases {{like the}} one from the northern Rockies contain <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters,</b> but not burn severity. Because atlas perimeters do not discern unburned islands, they likely overestimate the area burned by any single fire, although {{the degree to which}} this is true is generally unknown (Kolden et al. 2012). The perimeters are approximate and ground truthing is necessary before relying on them for many applications. Accuracy of most perimeters is unknown and likely varies through time and among management units. For example, Shapiro-Miller et al. (2007) found that the <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> in the northern Rockies fire atlas agreed with fire scar records, and Farris et al. (2010) similarly found that fire atlas and fire scar records were in strong agreement. Yet Kolden and Weisberg (2007) found poor agreement between manually mapped <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> (created through a number of different undocumented methods) and Landsat-derived perimeters, especially in areas of complex topography. Fire atlas data should be regarded with healthy skepticism and supplemented with other sources of information whenever possible.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} wildland–urban {{interface}} communities affected by wildfire is increasing, and both wildfire suppression and losses are costly. However, {{little is known}} about post-wildfire response by homeowners and communities after buildings are lost. Our goal was to characterise rebuilding and new development after wildfires across the conterminous United States. We analysed all wildfires in the conterminous USA from 2000 to 2005. We mapped 42 724 buildings, of which 34 836 were present before the fire and survived, 3604 were burned, 2403 were post-fire new development, and 1881 were burned and rebuilt. Before the fires, 38 440 buildings were present within <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> (surviving plus burned). Within 5 years post-fire, there were 39 120 buildings (surviving, rebuilt and new development). Nationally, only 25 % of burned homes were rebuilt within 5 years, though rates were higher in the west, the south and Kansas. New development rates inside versus outside <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> were similar. That the number of buildings inside <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> within 5 years post-fire was greater than pre-fire indicated that homeowners are either willing to face wildfir...|$|R
2500|$|On September 3, weather {{throughout}} Central Oregon {{was hot and}} dry. [...] While {{the fire}} stayed within established fire lines, large areas inside the perimeter continued to burn slowly, mostly along the ground. [...] In the southwest, the fire is moving slowly down slope into the old Pole Creek burn area and in the west it reached the fire break along Route 242. [...] Several pumper trucks along with ground crew worked around Lava Camp Lake to mop-up hot spots and protect the campground infrastructure. Mop-up also continued along {{the south and east}} flanks; however, heavy smoke kept helicopters from assisting ground crews. [...] On September 4, clean-up began along Route 242. [...] The Forest service worked with the Oregon Department of Transportation to remove logs, rock, and other debris from the roadway. [...] During the day, the Forest Service revised their estimate of the fire's size. [...] New estimate was [...] [...] They also increase their estimate of containment to 60 percent and reduce the number of firefighter on station to 318. On September 5, gusty winds were a good test of existing fire lines. [...] On the southwest flank, the wind pushed the fire toward North Matthieu Lake. [...] On the positive side, the wind cleared out much of the smoke, allowing air operation to begin again. [...] Helicopters made water drops to help ground crew mop-up hot spots in the private forest land near the north edge of the fire and along Route 242. [...] Mop-up and restoration work continued along the rest of the <b>fire</b> <b>perimeter</b> while unneeded heavy equipment was released for use on other fires. [...] The number of firefighter on station {{at the end of the}} day was 295. [...] No change in the fire's size or containment was reported. [...] In the evening, fire managers and local officials held another town meeting at Sisters High School to update local residents on the Milli Fire. [...] After consulting with fire managers on the morning of September 6, the Deschutes County Sheriff's office announced that all evacuation warnings related to the Milli Fire were dropped. [...] This reflected local officials confidence that containment lines around the Sisters community were secure.|$|E

30|$|As a consequence, {{maintaining}} and improving fire atlas records is valuable and that value will only continue to increase. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group (2006) adopted national interagency standards for digital polygon fire histories, {{but did not}} include all of the fire descriptors we think are ecologically or methodologically significant, such as source of perimeter location (e.g., GPS, satellite, hand-drawn polygon), fire cause (lightning or human), fire start and end date, fire management actions, minimum mapping unit, assumptions made while gathering and developing the data, data dictionaries (i.e., definition of values in an attribute column), software used to digitize <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters,</b> and process steps used to assemble polygon fire histories. Ideally, they would also capture unburned islands within <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> and daily <b>fire</b> progression.|$|R
30|$|Inconsistent {{methods of}} mapping <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> in the {{northern}} Rockies fire atlas are another source of uncertainty. Prior to the mid 1930 s, fires in the atlas were primarily mapped from stand ages interpreted from aerial photographs (J.H. Logsdon, USDA Forest Service Idaho Panhandle National Forests, personal communication; Rollins et al. 2001), but fire reports and maps, newspaper accounts, journals, and interviews were also used (Gibson 2006). Mapping has improved through the century and perimeters are now often interpreted from satellite imagery. However, even today, mapping methods vary widely and range from satellite-derived data and airborne imagery (including infrared mapping of perimeters of actively burning <b>fires)</b> to hand-drawn <b>perimeters.</b> Depending on the method and the person employing it, simple or complex perimeters could result. We did not find a systematic bias {{in the northern}} Rockies atlas in shape complexity of the fire polygons through time. Other atlases may differ in this respect; this could be revealed with simple analyses of the complexity in mapped <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters.</b>|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} is to monitor vegetation recovery after the large fires of 2003 in Portugal. We use a time-series of MODIS Terra Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data, at 250 m spatial resolution and with 16 -day image composites (MOD 13 A 1 product). These data were screened with the Time Series Generator (TiSeG) software, to detect and replace bad or missing data. The analysis begins in early 2000, to characterize pre-fire vegetation dynamics, extends until late 2008, and relies on <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> mapped from Landsat imagery at 30 m spatial resolution to locate the 2003 fires.

50|$|On Friday, May 15, {{the weather}} changed {{and a light}} rain fell in the fire area, {{allowing}} crews an opportunity to contain the fire.

30|$|Although {{there is}} a long history of reconstructing <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters,</b> less has been done to {{integrate}} the spatial representations with temporal measures of fire frequency. This can be addressed with a spatially explicit method for calculating and representing MFI, or a spatial mean fire interval (SMFI), to improve the assessment of spatio-temporal heterogeneity of fire regimes by enabling finer grain analyses of the causes and effects of fire within study areas. An SMFI could also be visually represented {{in the form of a}} map, improving the accessibility to users with different levels of expertise (Tang and Bishop 2002). Furthermore, while an SMFI cannot address false negatives associated with fires that left no scar evidence, it may compensate for low-severity fires that may have burned over broad areas and scarred few trees, as the method estimates <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> over an area based on a set of scarred trees.|$|R
30|$|Fire size, return interval, and rotation. Because Kolden (2007) {{concluded}} that manually-mapped perimeters correlated poorly with remotely-sensed <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters,</b> {{we used the}} <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> derived by Thode (2005) from satellite imagery to calculate the areal extent of each fire. We determined the fire return interval for each fire that reburned areas burned by previous fires by calculating {{the number of years}} between fires weighted by the reburned area including areas that burned multiple times. For example, if a 1, 000 ha fire reburned 100 ha of a 9 yr old fire and 200 ha of a 15 yr old fire, the return interval for that fire would be 13 [(9 × 100)/ 300 + (15 × 200)/ 300]. Fire rotation was calculated by dividing the area in each vegetation zone (Figure 1) by the area burned in that zone for all fires and each fire management type (Table 1).|$|R
30|$|Mapping and {{measuring}} of wildfire perimeters and area burned has evolved considerably {{since the early}} 20 th century. All active wildfires that have suppression personnel present are usually mapped at least once per day ([URL] This process assists fire managers in determining their resource needs and daily assignments. Additionally, <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> need to be mapped as rapidly and efficiently as possible following the fire to begin Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) efforts. Currently, most <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> are mapped {{in one of two}} ways. The primary method utilizes a Global Positioning System (GPS) mounted on a helicopter, where the pilot obtains boundary georeference points by flying the burn <b>perimeter.</b> On <b>fires</b> where a helicopter is not available, fire managers walk the burn perimeter or use infrared photography.

30|$|Areas {{of greater}} terrain {{roughness}} were prone to increased manual mapping error {{on the side}} of commission. There are at least two explanations for this. First, much of the area falsely classified as burned consists of small island polygons. As described in the introduction, unburned islands within a burned area are almost always included in manually mapped <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters,</b> since it is unsafe to map these locations during or even immediately following a fire, and more efficient to simply include them in the burned area. This is visually consistent with the imagery and the published <b>fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> for this study; there are several cases where a published perimeter skirts the base of a slope or canyon instead of following the fingers of burned area that lay on ridges or in canyons. Since errors of omission were not significantly correlated to TR, the weaker significant correlation between TR and overall mapping agreement can be attributed primarily to over-mapping in the areas of higher TR.|$|R
40|$|Parks for {{purposes}} of simulating the spread of prescribed natural fires. This paper summarizes {{the state of the}} model as of March 1993 and the process begun to validate the technique [...] The model treats fire growth as a spreading wave using equations for elliptical fire fronts developed by Richards (1989). <b>Fire</b> <b>perimeters</b> are represented by a series of points (X,Y coordinates). Calculations are made for each point to fmd their new positions after user-specified timesteps; collectively, these points represent the changing fire front. Under uniform conditions of topography, fuels, and weather, the fire spreads as an ellipse with eccentricity determined by the magnitude of the resultant windslope vector (Alexander 1985). The fire attains complex shapes, however, under actual conditions where all factors are heterogeneous. The model requires data on topography and fuels, such as raster-based GIS (geographic information system) data themes. Weather information is currently input as files containing initial fuel moistures, daily temperature and humidity patterns, and wind changes. Temperature and humidity at an observation point were extended over the landscape as detailed by Rothermel and others (1986). Wind speed is modified for canopy coverage, but {{in the absence of a}} weather model, wind speed and direction are simply assumed to be constant during a time-step over all terrain.
