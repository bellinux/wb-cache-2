5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
25|$|Common {{applications}} {{occur in}} auto racing, helicopter horizontal stabilizers, and aircraft where <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> is essential, such as banner-towing airplanes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Higher</b> <b>lift</b> allows greater airflow; {{although}} even {{by allowing}} a larger volume of air to pass thru the larger opening, the brevity {{of the typical}} duration with a <b>higher</b> <b>lift</b> cam results in less airflow than with a cam with lower lift but more duration, all else being equal. On forced induction motors this <b>higher</b> <b>lift</b> could yield better results than longer duration, particularly on the intake side. Notably though, <b>higher</b> <b>lift</b> has more potential problems than increased duration, in particular as valve train rpm rises which can result in less efficient running or loss of torque.|$|R

25|$|After {{the arrival}} of the first {{production}} 707 in 1957 the Dash 80 was adapted into a general experimental aircraft and used by Boeing to test a variety of new technologies and systems. One of its most important tasks during the late 1950s was to test systems for the new Boeing 727, including the fitting of a fifth engine in the rear fuselage. Other tests included experiments with different airfoil shapes and a number of <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices such as blown flaps, in which compressed air bled from the engines is directed over the flaps to increase lift during takeoff and landing.|$|E
25|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} {{are limited}} in forward speed {{by a combination of}} sonic tip speed and retreating blade stall. As the advance ratio increases, the relative velocity experienced by the retreating blade decreases so that the tip of the blade experiences zero velocity at an advance ratio of one. Helicopter rotors pitch the retreating blade to a higher angle of attack to maintain lift as the relative velocity decreases. At a sufficiently high advance ratio, the blade will reach the stalling angle of attack and experience retreating blade stall. Specially designed airfoils can increase the operating advance ratio by utilizing <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> coefficient airfoils. Currently, single rotor helicopters are practically limited to advance ratios less than 0.7.|$|E

25|$|The Welkin {{required}} a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise {{the number of}} seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in {{the features of the}} Welkin four hours to undertake a pre-flight check of this system. The wings were so large that the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> Fowler flaps of the Whirlwind were not needed, and were replaced by a simple split flap. The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament − four Hispano 20 mm cannon − was the same as the Whirlwind's, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, muzzle flash was also less likely to dazzle the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} element of this automatic system is a lever arm attached to a mass in the centre-fuselage, which is connected with the pitch controls. The moment generated by the mass is arranged to reach an equilibrium condition with the pitch control forces at each flight condition, with the flaps moving to a <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> coefficient position at low speeds or {{when there is a}} high pitch control load, and vice versa, maintaining the optimum angle of attack for the aerofoil. The automatic system on the Mü28 is identical in operation with the aircraft inverted, due to the use of a symmetrical section aerofoil set at zero degrees incidence, with the automatic system only turned off for takeoff and landing, and over-ridden manually as desired by the pilot.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, John J. Montgomery, an American {{trained in}} physics, began experimenting with glider designs. Using a water table with {{circulating}} {{water and a}} smoke chamber he began applying the physics of fluid dynamics to describe the motions of flow over curved surfaces such as airfoils. In 1889, Charles Renard, a French aeronautical engineer, became {{the first person to}} reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight. Renard and German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz explored the wing loading (weight to wing-area ratio) of birds, eventually concluding that humans could not fly under their own power by attaching wings onto their arms. Otto Lilienthal, following the work of Sir George Cayley, {{was the first person to}} become highly successful with glider flights. Lilienthal believed that thin, curved airfoils would produce <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> and low drag.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} of replacing the conventional wing on a transatlantic business jet with a larger, strut braced wing of aspect ratio 25 were evaluated. The lifting struts reduce both the induced drag and structural {{weight of the}} heavier, high aspect ratio wing. Compared to the conventional airplane, the strut braced wing design offers significantly <b>higher</b> <b>lift</b> to drag ratios achieved at <b>higher</b> <b>lift</b> coefficients and, consequently, a combination of lower speeds and higher altitudes. The strut braced wing airplane provides fuel savings with an attendant increase in construction costs...|$|R
25|$|Kawasaki {{developed}} the C-X {{in parallel with}} the P-X, which it had also been selected to develop. As a cost saving measure, major airframe parts and system components were shared between the two aircraft. They use the same basic wing structure, although it is installed at different sweep angle and dihedral on the two versions, with different <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> devices and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and gear control unit. As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion yen (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs; for example, the development contract for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon alone was $3.89 billion.|$|E

Additionally, the design featured large variable-sweep wings in order to provide both <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> during takeoff and landing, and low drag during a high-speed dash phase. [...] With the wings set to their widest position the aircraft had considerably better lift and power than the B-52, allowing it to operate from a much wider variety of bases.
