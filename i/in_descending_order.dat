The fungus was inoculated into rice and a traditional product (Monascus-fermented rice, anka, red koji) was produced after the colonization of fungal mycelia. Our {{objective was to}} evaluate the antioxidant properties of methanolic extracts from inoculated rice products [monascal polished rice (MPR) and monascal dehulled rice (MDR) ] as compared to uninoculated rice products [polished rice (PR) and dehulled rice (DR) ]. With regard to EC 50 values (mg extract/ml) of methanolic extracts, inhibitions of peroxidation were excellent and <b>in</b> the <b>descending</b> <b>order</b> of PR > DR > MDR > MPR. Effectiveness in reducing powers was <b>in</b> the <b>descending</b> <b>order</b> of MPR >> MDR >> DR > PR. Scavenging abilities on 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radicals were <b>in</b> the <b>descending</b> <b>order</b> of MPR > MDR > PR similar to DR. Chelating abilities on ferrous ions were <b>in</b> the <b>descending</b> <b>order</b> of MPR similar to MDR > PR > DR. Total phenols were the major naturally occurring antioxidant components found. Overall, monascal rice products were better in reducing power, scavenging and chelating abilities and higher in total phenol content than uninoculated rice products.

The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 <b>in</b> <b>descending</b> <b>order,</b> although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium {{is usually}} almost pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a {{half-life}} comparable {{to the age of}} the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U <b>in</b> <b>descending</b> <b>order</b> of their contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.) The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only 230Th is usually detectable, occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.|$|E
