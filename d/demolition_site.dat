5|$|In 1966, Williams {{became a}} {{professional}} musician and {{moved back to}} London, where he worked at a <b>demolition</b> <b>site</b> and in supermarkets, and played in short-lived bands. Williams met guitarist Laurie Wisefield (later a member of Wishbone Ash), and the two became members of a band, Sugar, which soon broke up.|$|E
25|$|At {{daylight}} on the 23 May the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was {{north of}} the planned <b>demolition</b> <b>site</b> and {{in touch with the}} Imperial Mounted Division, which was to demonstrate against the Beersheba line and prevent any Ottoman troops attempting to stop the destruction of the railway. Only a few snipers tried to interrupted the work.|$|E
25|$|Further {{location}} shooting {{took place}} on 18 November which were exterior scenes featuring Smith's travels in the proletarian sector. According to Peter Cushing, speaking on Late Night Line-Up in 1965, these scenes were filmed on the <b>demolition</b> <b>site</b> that became BBC Television Centre. Following the filming, rehearsals for the cast began at Mary Ward Settlement, Tavistock Place from 22 November (moving to 60 Paddington Street from 29 November). During these rehearsals, the cast memorised their lines and cues as important in a live television production as in a stage play.|$|E
25|$|Concrete, {{which must}} be free of trash, wood, paper and other such materials, is {{collected}} from <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> and put through a crushing machine, often along with asphalt, bricks and rocks.|$|R
25|$|Extra {{stone for}} the walls {{came from a}} nearby quarry and the bluestone, granite and {{limestone}} from <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> across Melbourne. Some of the flagstones and roofing slates had originally been shipped from Ireland and Wales as ballast aboard the sailing ships that serviced Australia in the 19th century.|$|R
30|$|CCA-treated was {{introduced}} in Japan in 1963 and no longer in use from 1997 by the voluntary action of the wood preservative industry [1]. The reasons were emissions of Cr compounds to factory effluent and incinerated ash [2], and As compounds to flue gas [3], though CCA treatment has been effective {{for the preservation of}} wood. As the estimated volume of CCA-treated wood waste at <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> will reach its peak at 130, 000  m 3 in 2015 and then gradually decreases to almost zero for the next hundred years, a guideline for the disposal of CCA-treated wood was established under the act for the recycling of building materials. However, a method that can rapidly and accurately identify CCA-treated wood at <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> has not yet been developed until today.|$|R
500|$|Further {{spurred by}} the start of {{demolition}} on the afternoon of 12 December 2006, more protesters started gathering spontaneously after workers removed the bell and the clock face from the tower, leaving a big hole. Activists, including [...] "Long Hair" [...] Leung Kwok-hung, rushed into and occupied part of the <b>demolition</b> <b>site,</b> chanting slogans from the roof of an excavator and demanded to meet Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands, Michael Suen Ming-yeung. Protesters formed a human chain at the entrance of the construction site so as to try to stop the construction crew and machines from further demolishing the site.|$|E
500|$|One of CERA's {{objectives}} in approving the implosion {{was to find}} out how the soil behaved, as Radio Network House was built on one of the worst soils in Christchurch. Seismograph readings showed ground velocity of 12mm/s, which is comparable to a large truck slowly driving across the <b>demolition</b> <b>site.</b> With any residual concerns about the performance of poor soils during building implosions removed, it will be much easier for other building owners to obtain consent from CERA. Further implosions are likely, with a representative from Controlled Demolition, Inc. describing the Christchurch market as a [...] "target-rich environment". So far, only the Christchurch Central Police Station has since also been demolished by implosion in early 2015; this happened in May 2015.|$|E
500|$|Mulder sees Diabra, {{a diplomat}} from Burkina Faso. Diabra tells him an old folk {{tale of the}} Bambara people about the Teliko, which were nocturnal [...] "spirits of the air". Meanwhile, Scully {{examines}} a PET scan of Aboah, which shows {{that he has no}} pituitary gland. Aboah escapes the hospital and meets Duff in a car; he paralyses Duff {{in the same manner as}} his other victims and inserts a long metal object up his nose. A policeman finds Duff and requests an ambulance, and the police tell Mulder and Scully that they are sweeping the area for Aboah. Driving around, Mulder tells Scully that he thinks Aboah is the mythical Teliko. He stops at a <b>demolition</b> <b>site,</b> remembering that Pendrell found asbestos fibers on Sanders' body. Mulder and Scully split up at the site; Mulder is pierced as Kittel was and is taken into a duct by Aboah. Meanwhile, Scully, having heard Mulder's shouts for help, tracks him in the duct and is able to get him out of it, finding then the missing men dead, all of them with their skins depigmented. While calling for medical assistance by phone, Aboah is about to jump on her but Mulder's look alerts her and she quickly turns around and shoots at him. In her field journal, Scully writes that Aboah will stand trial if he lives long enough. She muses that Aboah's condition and survival may be discovered by science, but humans have a fear of an alien among them which causes them to [...] "deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate".|$|E
50|$|ACF became {{increasingly}} involved in urban issues. ACF Councillor and unionist Jack Mundey was the force behind 'green bans' that saw unions withdraw their labour from <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> to protect historic urban precincts like The Rocks in Sydney. Pollution, {{climate change and}} population became topics of debate {{on the pages of}} habitat.|$|R

5000|$|News {{reports on}} June 7 {{following}} the collapse indicated that despite multiple complaints, the shoddy demolition work at 22nd and Market Street went uninspected {{for more than}} three weeks before the deadly collapse. Subsequent reports indicated that Ronald Wagenhoffer had reported he visited the site on May 14 and found no violations. At the time, the city did not require demolition contractors to establish their qualifications. On June 7, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter held a press conference and issued two press statements in which he apologized to the dead and their families as well as the injured survivors and their families. Nutter also announced new demolition rules and standards designed to prevent similar tragedies. [...] The new rules will require the same level of city monitoring and contractor expertise at private <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> that have been required during <b>demolition</b> at public <b>sites.</b> The new rules will prohibit contractors from using heavy machinery to demolish buildings adjacent to occupied structures, which was done at the 22nd and Market demolition. City inspectors were sent to over 300 <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> to check for safety violations.|$|R
500|$|In 1983, {{a class-action}} lawsuit was {{filed against the}} Trump Organization, {{concerning}} unpaid labor union pension and medical obligations. Trump testified in 1990 that he was unaware that 200 undocumented Polish immigrants, some of whom lived at the site during a 1980 transit strike and worked round-the-clock shifts, {{were involved in the}} destruction of the Bonwit Teller building and the Trump Tower project. Trump said that he rarely visited the <b>demolition</b> <b>site</b> and never noticed the laborers, who were known as the [...] "Polish Brigade" [...] and who were visually distinct for their lack of hard hats. A labor consultant and FBI informant testified that Trump was aware of the illegal workers' status. In testimony, Trump stated that he and an executive used the pseudonym [...] "John Baron" [...] in some of his business dealings, although Trump said that he did not do so until years after Trump Tower was constructed. A labor lawyer testified that he was threatened over the phone with a $100 million lawsuit by a John Baron who supposedly worked for the Trump Organization. Donald Trump later told a reporter, [...] "Lots of people use pen names. Ernest Hemingway used one." [...] A judge ruled in favor of the Polish laborers in 1991, saying that the organization had to pay the workers. The case went through several appeals from both sides as well as non-jury trials, and was reassigned to different judges several times. At one point, it was compared by a presiding judge to Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the seemingly unending case that forms the backbone of Charles Dickens' Bleak House. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in 1999, with its records sealed.|$|E
2500|$|Paula Jefferson, head of Beachcroft LLP's Disease Group, said: [...] "Any {{organisation}} {{involved in}} any activity in the future, where there {{is the potential for}} release of harmful substances in to the atmosphere, should ensure that they have taken all necessary steps to identify the potential contamination and to then ensure that they either employ, or have themselves the necessary skills, to deal with that contamination. The principles in the judgment apply not just when there is demolition in progress, but to any activity where there is potential for exposure in to the atmosphere. Where there is any known potential for such exposure, then regard should be had to not just the onsite workforce but also to those living and working in the surrounding area. In the Corby case the area of risk was 4km from the <b>demolition</b> <b>site.</b> The area for potential exposure will clearly vary depending on the circumstances of each case. In essence, the message remains the same - proper risk assessment is key and must include identifying the appropriate people to do the job and not cutting corners, which, as has been proved for Corby Borough Council, is likely to be false economy." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1958, {{the mill}} was restored. A {{tremendous}} amount of work went into the restoration, which included fixing water damage to the wheel, rebuilding several walls around the wheel pit, installing a new steel axle, replacing millstones and their timber framework, replacing floorboards, windows and more. Great care was taken to use old materials, mostly obtained from <b>demolition</b> <b>sites.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{one aspect of}} {{occupational}} dioxin exposure that is novel and unexpected. Exposures {{in excess of the}} German threshold limit value of 50 pg international toxicity equivalent (I-TEQ) /m 3 are very frequent, unpredictable, and sometimes very high [...] up to 6612 pg I-TEQ/m 3 [...] during thermal oxygen cutting at scrap metal and <b>demolition</b> <b>sites.</b> The same procedure involving virgin steel in steel trade and mass production of steel objects gave no such evidence, even though no final conclusions can be drawn because of the low number of samples analyzed. Low dioxin exposures during inert gas electric arc welding confirm previous literature findings, whereas soldering and thermal oxygen cutting in the presence of polyvinyl chloride give rise to concern. The consequences of occupational dioxin exposure were studied by analysis of the dioxin-blood concentration, the body burden, of men performing thermal oxygen cutting at scrap metal reclamation and <b>demolition</b> <b>sites,</b> in steel trade and producing plants as well as for industrial welders and white-collar workers. The results concerning body burdens are in excellent agreement with the dioxin exposure as characterized by dioxin air concentration in the workplace. The significant positive correlation between duration and frequency of performing thermal oxygen cutting at metal reclamation and <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> expressed in job-years and dioxin body burden speaks for the occupational origin of the observed overload after long times. The results reported here lead to consequences for occupational health, which are discussed and require immediate attention...|$|R
50|$|A {{lawsuit was}} filed on June 6 for {{financial}} damages {{on behalf of}} Nadine White, the survivor who was buried under rubble. City officials began inspecting hundreds of <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> throughout the city.

5000|$|In 1999, the {{wrecking}} ball {{was described as}} [...] "one {{of the most common}} forms of large-scale coarse demolition." [...] Although the {{wrecking ball}} is still {{the most efficient way to}} raze a concrete frame structure, its use is decreasing. With the invention of hydraulic excavators and other machinery, the wrecking ball has become less common at <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> as its working efficiency is less than that of high reach excavators.|$|R
5000|$|The Destruction of Lower Manhattan (1969) was Lyon's next work, {{published}} by Macmillan Publishers in 1969. [...] The book documents the large-scale demolition taking place throughout Lower Manhattan in 1967. Included are photographs of {{soon to be}} demolished streets and buildings, portraits of the neighborhood's last remaining stragglers and pictures from within the <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> themselves. The book was eventually remaindered for one dollar each, but soon attained {{the status of a}} collector's item. It was reprinted in 2005.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the {{excavator}} follows requirements of machines for demolition work. The excavator is equipped with an innovative type of under carriage, which not only increases mobility over the <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> but also the visibility from the driver’s cabin. The components of the excavator, that improve the demolition work, are special types of tracks, suspensions and articulated steering. Tracks can change their shape to increase the stability and also {{to adapt to the}} diff erent types of ground. The suspensions with tracks are able to adapt to the terrain thereby they lighten the asperity. Suspension can also tilt or even raise the excavator and thereby increase the angle of visibility from the cabin. This function is necessary mainly when taking down higher constructions. Articulated steering is a new function that has never been used for excavators. This steering was chosen due to fl exible movement over <b>demolition</b> <b>sites.</b> The main aim of the project is to create a new {{design of the}} excavator, but more importantly to distinguish the excavator from the excavators already on the market, with regards to its esthetics and under carriage innovation...|$|R

50|$|Concrete {{aggregate}} {{collected from}} <b>demolition</b> <b>sites</b> is put through a crushing machine, often along with asphalt, bricks, dirt, and rocks.
