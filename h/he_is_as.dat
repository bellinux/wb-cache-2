5|$|As a naturalistic writer, he was {{amongst the}} first English-language authors {{to absorb the}} lessons of the French realists, and was {{particularly}} influenced by the works of Émile Zola. His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist.|$|E
5|$|His first {{mainstream}} {{success was}} the 1976 album Oxygène. Recorded {{in a makeshift}} studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 12million copies. Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience {{of more than a}} million people at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> a musician.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains elements}} typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions. But {{in other respects}} it conforms to the then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. Typical of depictions of the crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> wide as he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.|$|E
5000|$|The English word 'goldfinch' {{was used}} {{in the second half of}} the 14th century by Geoffrey Chaucer in his {{unfinished}} The Cook's Tale: [...] "Gaillard <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> goldfynch in the shawe (Gaily dressed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>is</b> a goldfinch in the woods)".|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|Surely a {{permanent}} commitment {{like that is}} contrary to all our foreign policy. What do the words 'unprovoked attack' by Germany mean? They are dangerously vague. I've been discussing them with Rosebery and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> uneasy as I am. He {{wrote a letter to}} the Press about it, and the Times refused to publish it.|$|E

Dana first meets {{him as a}} young accident-prone boy {{torn between}} an indulgent mother and a strict father and sees him grow to replace Tom Weylin as slave master. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> needy as his mother, but possessive and controlling like his father. His arrogance and greediness leads to him to rape and impregnate his longtime friend Alice (Dana’s great-great-great-grandmother), making him Dana’s ancestor. He desperately seeks validation through Alice and Dana's love, but still views them as his property.|$|E

25|$|Van der Weyden {{worked from}} life models, and his {{observations}} were acute, yet he often idealised certain elements of his models' facial features, {{and they are}} typically statuesque, especially in his triptychs. All of his forms are rendered with rich, warm colourisation and a sympathetic expression, while he {{is known for his}} expressive pathos and naturalism. His portraits tend to be half length and half profile, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> sympathetic here as in his religious triptychs. Van der Weyden used an unusually broad range of colours and varied tones; in his finest work the same tone is not repeated in any other area of the canvas; even the whites are varied.|$|E
25|$|During Teen Titans, Superboy {{developed}} Kryptonian powers including heat vision, x-ray vision, and super-hearing. He {{also developed}} Kryptonian invulnerability. He also has developed Kryptonian level super strength, as shown when he battled the hugely powerful Superboy-Prime and {{even managed to}} damage him {{with some of his}} blows, when some characters such as Black Adam could not. When the Titans encountered their future selves, he found his future self had greater telekinetic abilities (no longer limited to tactile telekinesis), was stronger, more durable, and faster. Superboy later states that he has developed telescopic vision and eventually figures out how to use his freeze breath. It has also been shown in Teen Titans that he is much faster, traveling from San Francisco to the Arctic {{in less than an hour}} whilst carrying Nightwing. Superboy, like Superman, derives his Kryptonian powers from the absorption of solar energy from the Earth's yellow sun, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> vulnerable to Kryptonite and magic as is the Man of Steel.|$|E

500|$|With his {{controversial}} {{revival of the}} character in 2008, Fabian Nicieza chose to portray the mantle of Anarky as being possessed by a villain other than Lonnie Machin {{on the grounds that}} Lonnie was too heroic to act out the part of a black hat: [...] "Since Lonnie is too smart to be immature and NOT a 'villain,' I wanted Anarky, but it couldn't be Lonnie without compromising who <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> a character." ...|$|E

500|$|As a {{self-described}} [...] "bleeding-heart conservative", Kemp represented {{a part of}} the suburban Buffalo region known as the Southtowns (that traditionally voted Democratic) in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1989. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> fondly remembered for his good hair and handsome looks as for his athletic prowess and political savvy, and was described as having the charisma of the earlier J.F.K. (John F. Kennedy). David Rosenbaum described Kemp as an independent politician who often legislated outside his committees' jurisdictions and often spoke in favor of ideals and principles rather than his party's political platforms. As a supply-sider, he was not a proponent of balanced budgeting and trivialized it while speaking of growth as an economic goal.|$|E

500|$|Princess Jasmine is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who appears in Walt Disney Animation Studios' 31st animated feature film Aladdin (1992). Voiced by American actress Linda Larkin – with a singing voice provided by Filipina singer Lea Salonga – Jasmine is the spirited Princess of Agrabah, who has grown weary {{of her life}} of palace confinement. Despite an age-old law stipulating that the princess must marry a prince in time for her upcoming birthday, Jasmine is instead determined to marry someone she loves for who <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> opposed to what he owns. Created by directors Ron Clements and John Musker with screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Jasmine is based on Badroulbadour, a princess who appears in the One Thousand and One Nights folktale [...] "Aladdin and the Magical Lamp".|$|E
500|$|In all {{first-class}} matches on the tour, Bosanquet scored 587 runs at {{an average}} of 36.68 and took 37 wickets {{at an average}} of 27.27.

Following the team's return home, Bosanquet wrote an article giving his impressions of the tour for Wisden. The main Wisden report stated: [...] "Bosanquet's value with the ball cannot be judged from the averages, as on his bad days <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> <b>as</b> everyone knows, {{one of the most expensive}} of living bowlers.
