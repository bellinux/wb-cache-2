He voices his mind {{in a way}} that is annoying when he thinks Mia is being particularly ridiculous, but goes along with her schemes anyway. He also turns a blind eye to Mia and Michael when they make out, for which Mia is grateful. He gets on very well with Michael (especially in the first book when Lars seems to know that Michael likes Mia), never offers any opinion on Lilly, and becomes friends with Tina's bodyguard, Wahim. Lars also likes Mia's French teacher Mademoiselle Klein. He is known to be a 'big softie' <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside.</b>|$|E
500|$|David L.G. Arnold {{comments}} in the book Leaving Springfield that the episode is a satire on [...] "society's lazy, uninformed attitude about the electoral process", as well as [...] "a comment on the role in society of a cadre of elites (the Republican party) who see themselves as naturally suited to lead". The episode also portrays Republicans as willing {{to break the law}} in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob's line: [...] "Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside</b> you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king. That's why I did this: to protect you from yourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The 100m at the DN Galan {{meeting in}} Stockholm saw Gay's first match-up {{of the year}} against Bolt. He {{surprised}} the Olympic and World champion with a resounding victory, beating him with 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97seconds. This was {{only the second time}} Bolt had lost a 100m final â€“ the first occurring in July 2008 against Powell (also at Stockholm Olympic Stadium). Gay broke Powell's stadium record and earned a one carat diamond for the feat. Gay chose not to overstate the significance of the win, acknowledging that Bolt was far from peak fitness: [...] "It feels great to beat Usain but <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside</b> I know he is not 100%. I look forward to beating him when he is". With Bolt and Powell both out with injuries, Gay won unchallenged at the London Grand Prix the following week, running a world leading time of 9.78seconds despite poor weather. A victory at the Memorial van Damme in 9.79seconds earned him the first Diamond Race Trophy for the 100m.|$|E

500|$|The {{songs on}} Superunknown {{captured}} the metal influences of the band's previous works while showcasing the group's newly evolving style. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} band's [...] "earlier punk influences are rarely detectable, replaced by surprisingly effective appropriations of pop and psychedelia." [...] Cornell labeled the album as more [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "versatile" [...] than the band's previous releases. The songs on the album are more experimental and diverse than the band's previous recordings, with some songs having a Middle-Eastern or Indian flavor (for example [...] "Half", sung by Shepherd). Some songs also show a Beatles influence, such as [...] "Head Down" [...] and [...] "Black Hole Sun". In a 1994 interview with Guitar World, Thayil explained, [...] "We looked <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside</b> {{the very core of}} our souls and there was a little Ringo sitting there. Oh sure, we like telling people it's John Lennon or George Harrison; but when you really look deep inside of Soundgarden, there's a little Ringo wanting to get out." [...] Drummer Matt Cameron said that the experimentation on the album was [...] "just a matter of refinement." [...] According to The A.V. Club, the album [...] "both redefined and transcended grunge". Michael Beinhorn stated that to achieve the intensity of Superunknown, he sought influence from European electronic music, such as the British Aphex Twin and the Dutch genre of Gabber, described by him as [...] "some of the rawest music made".|$|E
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside.</b> With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under Casolaro's body, paramedics {{found an}} empty Milwaukee beer can, two white plastic liner-trash bags, {{and a single}} edge razor blade. There was also a half-empty wine bottle nearby. Ridgeway and Vaughan write that nothing {{was placed in the}} bathtub drain to prevent debris from {{draining}} away, and none of the bathwater was saved. Other than the gruesome scene, the hotel room was clean and orderly. There was a legal pad and a pen present on the desk; a single page had been torn from the pad, and a message written on it: [...] "To those who I love the most: Please forgive me for the worst possible thing I could have done. Most of all I'm sorry to my son. I know <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside</b> that God will let me in." ...|$|E
60|$|But somehow Farmer Brown's boy couldn't {{bring himself}} quite to taking {{such a step}} as getting a new dog.

60|$|At last, after a long, long time, {{he heard}} just the faintest splash. He pricked up {{his ears and}} peeped out on the pond with the hungriest look in his yellow eyes. There was a little line of silver coming {{straight}} toward him. He {{knew that it was}} made by Paddy the Beaver swimming. Nearer and nearer it drew. Old Man Coyote chuckled way <b>down</b> <b>deep</b> <b>inside,</b> without making a sound. He could see Paddy's head now, and Paddy was coming straight in, as if he hadn't a fear in the world.|$|R
60|$|Sammy looked disappointed. You see, he {{had just}} begun to learn that the {{greatest}} pleasure in the world comes from doing things for other people. For {{the first time since he}} could remember, someone wanted him around land it gave him such a good feeling <b>down</b> <b>deep</b> <b>inside!</b> Perhaps it was because he remembered that good feeling that the next spring he was so willing and anxious to help poor Mrs. Quack. What he did for her and all about her terrible adventures I will tell you in the next book.|$|R
60|$|Elsa put {{her hand}} through the hole, too, to see {{the extent of the}} mischief. Yes! that was it, her father must more than once have missed the pocket and put his hand into the hole, making it bigger and bigger. Why! there was a whole lot of rubbish <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside</b> the lining. Elsa drew out an empty tobacco-pouch, a bit of string, a length of tinder, and from the very bottom, where it lay in a crinkled mass, a ball of {{crumpled}} paper.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{with all}} his keen sight, old Whitetail had failed to see some one else who was sitting right in plain sight. He had failed because his mind {{was so full of}} Grandfather Frog and Longlegs that he forgot to look around, as he usually does. Just {{skimming}} the tops of the bulrushes he sailed swiftly out over the Smiling Pool and reached down with his great, cruel claws to clutch Grandfather Frog, who sat there pretending to be asleep, but all the time watching Longlegs and <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside</b> chuckling to think how he was fooling Longlegs.|$|E
60|$|When he saw Farmer Brown's boy put {{the eggs}} back and climb down the tree without any, {{he had to}} blink his eyes {{to make sure that}} he saw straight. He just couldn't believe what he saw. At first he was dreadfully {{disappointed}} and angry. It looked very much as if he weren't going to get even with Hooty after all. He flew over to his favorite tree to think things over. Now sometimes it is a good thing to sit by oneself and think things over. It gives the little small voice <b>deep</b> <b>down</b> <b>inside</b> a chance to be heard. It was just that way with Blacky now.|$|E

[...] "In the Hands of Angels," [...] retelling of the story of the album The Union, thanks Mr. John ("the guv'ner" [...] in the lyrics), who knew all the places I needed to go and made me feel the love <b>down</b> <b>deep</b> <b>inside.</b> Leon Russell Russell re-emerged in 2010 when Elton John called on him to record the album that became The Union.

5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} the post-touchdown kickoff to its 26-yard line. The Hokie offense picked up short gains on {{first and second}} down before Tech quarterback Erik Chapman threw his second interception of the game, a pass that was tipped {{into the air and}} caught by NC State defender Derrick Taylor. The Wolfpack offense took over at the 46-yard line of Virginia Tech. On its first play after the interception, Kramer completed a 19-yard pass to Haywood Jeffires. After a short run, Kramer completed a 13-yard pass to Jeffries for another first <b>down.</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>inside</b> the Tech red zone, it took the Wolfpack two more plays before Kramer connected on a pass to tight end Ralph Britt for a touchdown. NC State now led 2110 with just over four minutes remaining before halftime.|$|R
60|$|After old Whitetail the Marshhawk passed Johnny Chuck without {{offering}} to touch him, Johnny {{began to feel}} very brave and bold and important. He strutted and swaggered along {{as much as his}} short legs would let him. He held his head very high. Already he felt that he had had an adventure and he longed for more. He forgot the terrible lonesome feeling of a little while before. He forgot that he had given away the only home he had. He didn't know just why, but right <b>down</b> <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> he had a sudden feeling that he really didn't care a thing about that old home. In fact, {{he felt as if he}} wouldn't care if he never had another home. Yes, Sir, that is the way that Johnny Chuck felt. Do you know why? Just because he had just begun to realize how big and strong he really was.|$|R

40|$|When {{helping others}} is an {{expression}} of conventional goodness, it stifles womenâ€™s cognitive and emotional development and disables those they are trying to help. Drawing on Gilliganâ€™s theory of moral development, the author analyzes the dysfunctional aspects of helping and the paradox of conventional goodness. She argues that women persist in this behavior because they have developed a conceptual schema that habitually guides them in resolving moral dilemmas. Practitioners and educators need to explore these issues further, since the majority of social workers are women and hence have been socialized to equate "helping " with being "good. " While in counseling, a social work student described herself and her problems this way: I am lonely <b>down</b> <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> somewhere. Understand, though, that I have people in my life; that is not the problem. Not hardly. I feel like I do things for everyone else. I take them places or listen to their problems or just plain have the energy for the rela...|$|R
