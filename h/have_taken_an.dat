5|$|Hugh was {{suspected}} {{of involvement in}} the Young King's revolt in 1173. He does not seem to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> active part, but King Henry II suspected him of supporting the rebellion. When King William the Lion of Scotland invaded northern England in the spring of 1174, Hugh either connived at the invasion or helped the rebels and the Scottish king. Suspicion fell upon the bishop because he was cautious in defending against the Scottish raids. Hugh also concluded truces with the Scots that allowed them free passage through the ecclesiastical lands in return for no damage being done to those lands. Lastly, the bishop's nephew Hugh IV de Puiset, who was Count of Bar in France, brought an armed force to Hartlepool, supposedly to help defend Hugh, but King Henry feared that this was an attempt to aid the rebellion of the Young King. After the revolt had been put down, King Henry II ordered Hugh's castle of Northallerton destroyed. Hugh also was required to surrender his other castles.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} neighbour Mercia was, {{under the}} rule of kings Æthelbald, Offa and Coenwulf, the dominant kingdom in Anglo-Saxon England. Offa, the greatest of the three, ruled Mercia until 796, followed soon after by Coenwulf. Offa's dominance was secured in part by marriage alliances with the other major kingdoms: Beorhtric of Wessex and Æthelred of Northumbria were married to his daughters. Further afield, Charlemagne, the pre-eminent ruler in the Christian West, appears to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> active interest in Northumbrian affairs. Charlemagne initially ruled Francia and parts of Italy, but by 796 had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain. He was a staunch defender of the Papacy, and in the popes and the church hierarchy he had allies whose influence extended to Northumbria and beyond. Events in southern Britain to 796 have sometimes been portrayed as a struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|The only bowler to {{have taken}} three career hat-tricks is Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka, while three other bowlers (Wasim Akram, Saqlain Mushtaq and Chaminda Vaas) have taken two hat-tricks. Hat-tricks are {{dominated}} by fast bowlers with Pakistan's Saqlain Mushtaq, Bangladesh's Abdur Razzak and Taijul Islam, Zimbabwe's Prosper Utseya, South Africa's JP Duminy, Sri Lanka's Wanidu Hasaranga and India's Kuldeep Yadav, the only seven spinners to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> ODI hat-trick. Vaas of Sri Lanka became the only bowler to claim a hat-trick {{in the first three}} balls of any form of international cricket when he took the first three wickets off the opening three balls of their match against Bangladesh during the 2003 World Cup. Lasith Malinga is also the only player to claim 4 consecutive wickets in 4 balls, a feat he achieved against South Africa. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their ODI debut: Taijul Islam from Bangladesh in a match against Zimbabwe, Kagiso Rabada from South Africa against Bangladesh, and Wanidu Hasaranga from Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe. Eight hat-tricks have occurred in World Cup matches.|$|E

25|$|Eleanor's {{marriage}} to Henry was {{reputed to be}} tumultuous and argumentative, although sufficiently cooperative to produce at least eight pregnancies.

Eleanor appears to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> ambivalent attitude towards these affairs. Geoffrey of York, for example, was an illegitimate son of Henry, but acknowledged by Henry as his child and raised at Westminster in the care of the queen.|$|E

25|$|John Fortescue's {{description}} of England's mixed monarchy as a dominium politicum et regale (a political and regal kingdom) has been profoundly {{influential in the}} history of British constitutional thought. During the 20th century, the earlier portrayal of Fortescue as a constitutionalist has come under pressure from legal and constitutional historians. Scholars of literature <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> interest in Fortescue's contribution to the development of English prose, and in his role as a Lancastrian writer. More recently, Fortescue's constitutional thought has been reassessed and his Lancastrian affiliation has been challenged.|$|E
25|$|It {{was natural}} for Symmachus to sympathise with Magnus Maximus who had {{defeated}} Gratian. When Maximus {{was threatening to}} invade Italy in 387, his cause was openly advocated by Symmachus, who upon the arrival of Theodosius I was impeached of treason, and forced to take refuge in a sanctuary. Having been pardoned through the intervention of numerous and powerful friends he expressed his contrition and gratitude in an apologetic address to Theodosius, by whom {{he was not only}} forgiven, but was received into favour and elevated to the consulship in 391, and during the remainder of his life he appears to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> active part in public affairs. The date of his death is unknown, but one of his letters was written as late as 402.|$|E
25|$|Statius' {{first three}} {{books of the}} Silvae seem to have {{received}} some criticism, and in response he composed a fourth book' at Naples, {{which was published in}} 95. During this period at Naples, Statius maintained his relations with the court and his patrons, earning himself another invitation to a palace banquet (Silv. 4.2). He seems to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> interest in the marriage and career of his stepdaughter and he also took a young slave boy under his wing, as he was childless, who died c. 95. In that same year Statius embarked on a new epic, the Achilleid, giving popular recitations of his work (Juv. 7.83) only to complete a book and a half before dying in 95, leaving the poem unfinished. His fifth book of Silvae were published after his death c. 96.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} put a {{priority}} on their schoolwork, ClariS have not released photos of themselves {{to the public and}} employ illustrators to draw their likenesses. When drawn, Clara is depicted wearing pastel pink items, and Alice is shown wearing blue items. Images of the crescent moon are used as a motif to represent Clara, and the sun is used to represent Alice, which comes from their personal preferences. Clara is shown with slightly wavy hair and no bangs, while Alice is drawn with straight hair with bangs. To further preserve their anonymity, Clara and Alice have not told anyone they know (aside from their families) that they debuted as music artists. Both admit that they are otaku, and <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> interest in anime and anime music. Clara says that she keeps her otaku interests a secret from others at school, and Alice has called herself a Disney otaku.|$|E
25|$|On 5 September 2006, Huntley {{was found}} {{unconscious}} in his prison cell and thought to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> overdose. He had previously taken {{an overdose of}} antidepressants in prison in June 2003 while awaiting his trial. He was under police guard in hospital for two days, before being returned to Wakefield prison, prompting much reaction from many present at the scene, as well as making {{the front pages of}} many of the UK newspapers the next morning. Following this attempted suicide, his cell was cleared and a tape was found which was marked with Queen on one side and Meat Loaf on the other. This tape is thought to contain confessions from Huntley on what he did and how he did it. It is believed that Huntley made the tape in return for antidepressants from a fellow prisoner, who hoped to obtain and later sell the confession to the media after his release. On 28 March 2007, The Sun began publishing transcripts of Huntley's taped confession.|$|E
25|$|The various IITs {{function}} autonomously, {{and their}} special status as Institutes of National Importance facilitates the smooth running of IITs, virtually free from both regional {{as well as}} student politics. Such autonomy means that IITs can create their own curricula and adapt rapidly to the changes in educational requirements, free from bureaucratic hurdles. The government has no direct control over internal policy decisions of IITs (like faculty recruitment and curricula) but has representation on the IIT Council. The medium of instruction in all IITs is English. The classes are usually held between 7:30am and 5:30pm, though there are some variations within each IIT. All the IITs have public libraries {{for the use of}} their students. In addition to a collection of prescribed books, the libraries have sections for fiction and other literary genres. The electronic libraries allow students to access on-line journals and periodicals. The IITs and IISc <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> initiative along with Ministry of Human Resource Development to provide free online videos of actual lectures of different disciplines under National Program on Technology Enhanced Learning. This initiative is undertaken to make quality education accessible to all students.|$|E

25|$|In {{mathematical}} terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes {{the notion}} of the dimension of a real vector space. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an n-dimensional inner product space equals n. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that irregular sets can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the Koch curve summarized earlier is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new equilateral triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4. That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original. Stated another way, we <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=SD. This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving—in the Koch and other fractal cases—non-integer dimensions for these objects.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July Hullett {{wrote out}} a cheque for Adams for £1,000 – {{to pay for}} an MG car her husband had promised to buy him. Adams paid the cheque into his account the next day, and on being told that it would clear by the 21st, asked for it to be {{specially}} cleared – to arrive in his account the next day. On 19 July Hullett is thought to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> overdose and was found the next morning in a coma. Adams was unavailable and a colleague, Dr Harris, attended her until Adams arrived later in the day. Not once during their discussion did Adams mention her depression or her barbiturate medication. They decided a cerebral haemorrhage was most likely. On 21 July Dr Shera, a pathologist, was called in to take a spinal fluid sample and immediately asked if her stomach contents should be examined in case of narcotic poisoning. Adams and Harris both opposed this. After Shera left, Adams visited a colleague at the Princess Alice Hospital in Eastbourne and asked about the treatment for barbiturate poisoning. He was told to give doses of 10cc of Megimide every five minutes, and was given 100cc to use. The recommended dose in the instructions was 100cc to 200cc. Dr Cook also told him to put Hullett on an intravenous drip. Adams did not.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals′ {{attempt to}} honor the Montreal-Washington franchise′s entire history in the Ring of Honor, {{as well as by}} {{tracking}} Montreal-Washington franchise records, is not without controversy. Although Nationals fans generally take little interest in the franchise′s Montreal years, some do appreciate acknowledging that the franchise has a history that predates its arrival in Washington, and former Expo Tim Raines received a warm round of applause from fans at Nationals Park at his induction ceremony on August 28, 2017, even though he had never even visited Washington, D.C., before, let alone played baseball there. Some Montreal Expos fans express appreciation that the Nationals are honoring the Expos, and Expos players inducted into the Ring of Honor have expressed gratitude that the Nationals chose to include them, especially with no MLB team in Montreal {{to honor the}}ir careers. However, few Nationals fans <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> interest in franchise records, preferring to compare Nationals records with those of previous Washington MLB teams instead, and a segment of Nationals fans actively opposes the inclusion of Expos history into that of the Nationals, taking the view that the Montreal years are irrelevant to Washington and that the team made a complete break with its past and started anew when it arrived in Washington, inheriting the history of the two Washington Senators teams rather than that of the Expos. Similarly, Montreal Expos fans have taken little or no interest in the achievements of Nationals players, and some Expos fans strongly oppose the inclusion of former Expos in the Ring, taking the position that to do so is to co-opt the history of the Expos, which they say belongs solely in Montreal.|$|E
