5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 179th Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system. Later in the 1980s, the station was renovated and modernized; {{as part of the}} renovation, the IND-style purple tile band was removed from the station walls, and a design with intertwining blue and orange stripes was added. During a further upgrade that occurred by about 2000, elevators were installed in the station to make it ADA-accessible. The elevators were opened around 2005. Starting in August 2007, the MTA began installing decorative ventilation <b>grates</b> along Hillside Avenue above the station, and sealing other <b>grates,</b> both in order to combat flooding. At the time, the Hillside Avenue subway was considered the most flood-prone area in the subway system.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the Upper East Side) would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation <b>grates</b> ubiquitous {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grated</b> {{cheese is}} a type of cheese that has gone through the process of being <b>grated.</b> Typically, aged hard cheeses are used for this purpose. A hand grater can be used to {{manually}} <b>grate</b> the cheese, or cheese can be bought already <b>grated.</b> Commercially produced <b>grated</b> cheeses are often blends of more than one variety of cheese, such as Pecorino and Parmesan. <b>Grated</b> cheese and shredded cheese are not the same thing. <b>Grated</b> cheese is much finer than shredded cheese and reacts differently in recipes or application to cooked foods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} {{the impact of the}} structure parameters for mechanical <b>grate</b> on MSW(Municipal Solid Waste) movement characteristics such as transportation speed, average stop time and mixed rate of waste, a new kind of mechanical <b>grate</b> cold experimental device has been designed which can realize the switch between push forward and backward. Many structure parameters can be adjusted including the height of <b>grate,</b> move distance of <b>grate,</b> bed angle, and move speed of the <b>grate.</b> Based on Mechanical <b>grate</b> cold experimental device, studying the impact of the mechanical <b>grate</b> structure parameters on the characteristics of waste movement is conducive to applying the results of test to the actual MSW <b>grate</b> incinerator. It provides a strong basis for the improvement and optimization of the mechanical <b>grate</b> furnace in terms of characteristics of Chinese MSW...|$|R

5|$|Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton) is the Colonial Marines' comedian and comtech expert. Arrogant and overconfident, he soon cracks {{under the}} stress of the failed {{incursion}} into the Alien hive. Hudson despairs and panics until Ripley and Newt reassure him, enabling him to regain his composure. He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where the survivors of the party make their final stand, and is pulled through a floor grate by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the <b>grates</b> and later died when a chestburster erupted from his chest.|$|E

40|$|To avoid extreme {{temperatures}} and reducing conditions along combustion <b>grate</b> surfaces {{reducing the risk}} of <b>grate</b> material deterioration-the configuration and out-placing of air passages through a <b>grate</b> have been investigated by mathematical modeling. In the two-dimensional CFD-simulations of wood-char combustion On top of the <b>grate,</b> the number and width of the air passages through the <b>grate</b> were varied. The different <b>grate</b> configurations were further investigated for different air flux rates and for the recirculation of flue gases to the combustion air. The results of the simulation; show that the maximal temperature in the <b>grate</b> is sensitive to the amount of air fed to the bed and,,at constant air flow rate, to the entering velocity of the combustion air to the fuel bed. The possibility of using the air flow, as a control parameter in modern <b>grate</b> :Furnaces is limited, due to a general wish to reduce the air flow through the <b>grate</b> to reduce nitric oxide emissions. Extreme temperatures in the <b>grate</b> should, therefore, according to the modelin;, be avoided by making sure that the entering velocity of the air to the Fuel bed is sufficiently high. Practically, this can be achieved by reducing the number of passages in the <b>grate,</b> or by introducing flue-gas recycling. However, to avoid areas of reducing conditio as along the <b>grate,</b> the number of passages should not be reduced further than resulting in a maximal distance of 4 - 5 cm between them, when working with pure air...|$|R

5|$|The {{player can}} use predatory tactics through stealthincluding silent takedowns, {{dropping}} from overhead perches and snatching enemies away, or using the explosive gel to knock foes off their feetto tilt the odds in their favor. Some areas feature sections {{that require the}} player to use these tactics to avoid alerting the Joker's henchmen and thus failing to meet an objective. Many areas feature stone gargoyles placed high above, helping Batman remain concealed. Batman can use his grapnel gun to reach the gargoyles, giving him a high vantage point over the area and the enemies. From the gargoyles, Batman can glide down to attack enemies or hang upside down from the gargoyles to grapple a nearby enemy and leave him tethered there. The player can use floor <b>grates</b> to attack from below, hide around corners, use batarangs to stun enemies from afar, and use the grapnel gun to pull enemies over ledges.|$|E
