5|$|There is {{evidence}} that those net-men wearing tunics, known as retiarii tunicati, formed a special sub-class, one even more demeaned than their loincloth-wearing colleagues. The Roman satirist Juvenal wrote that: So even the lanista's establishment is better ordered than yours, for he separates the vile from the <b>decent,</b> <b>and</b> sequesters even from their fellow-retiarii the wearers of the ill-famed tunic; in the training-school, and even in gaol, such creatures herd apart….|$|E

However, when the movie was titled Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he found the title mediocre, obscene, and vulgar and decided to quit the project. Akhtar later regretted leaving the film, as he found it <b>decent</b> <b>and</b> {{could see that the}} title has become quite a buzz-word, realizing that {{he was the only one}} who disliked the title.|$|E

25|$|Eric Finch is {{the chief}} of New Scotland Yard and Minister of Investigations, which {{has become known as}} the Nose. Finch is a pragmatist who sides with the {{government}} because he would rather serve in a world of order than one of chaos. He is nevertheless honourable and <b>decent,</b> <b>and</b> the Leader trusts him as reliable and lacking ambition. He eventually achieves his own anagnorisis and self-knowledge, expressing sorrow over his complicity with Norsefire's atrocities.|$|E
25|$|In the 12th century, Jurchen tribes {{began to}} violate the Goryeo-Jurchen borders, and {{eventually}} invaded Goryeo. After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general Yun Gwan realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain <b>decent</b> <b>and</b> well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo-Jurchen borders (동북 9성, 東北 九城).|$|E

He divided the main building into two, appointing one part for men oppressed by various kinds of infirmities and the other for women in a bad state of health. He also made arrangements for their clothing and daily food, appointing ministers and guardians to take all measures so that nothing should be lacking for them.|$|E
25|$|Depression era {{literature}} was blunt and direct in its social criticism. John Steinbeck (1902–1968) {{was born in}} Salinas, California, where he set many of his stories. His style was simple and evocative, winning him the favor of the readers but not of the critics. Steinbeck often wrote about poor, working-class people and their struggle to lead a <b>decent</b> <b>and</b> honest life. The Grapes of Wrath, considered his masterpiece, is a strong, socially-oriented novel that {{tells the story of}} the Joads, a poor family from Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a better life.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to broaden}} current {{reflections}} on definitions of <b>decent</b> work <b>and</b> poverty using a transdisciplinary interpretive lens comprising philosophical, juridical, economic, sociological, and psychological understandings. We (the authors) undertook an adapted systematic qualitative review {{to gather data}} on different perspectives on <b>decent</b> work <b>and</b> poverty. The article summarizes and compares reflections on the two constructs and proposes an enhancement of the current definition of decent work. The aim is to facilitate the identification and development of new research and intervention projects that can be implemented to promote fair and sustainable economic development, the provision of <b>decent</b> work, <b>and</b> the reduction of poverty globally. We believe that challenges should be dealt with pro-actively rather than reactively and that intervening {{at the level of}} primary prevention should {{lie at the heart of}} any strategy to promote <b>decent</b> work <b>and</b> alleviate poverty. Radical intervention is needed to ensure that future generations not only survive but develop, grow, and express themselves meaningfully through decent wor...|$|R
25|$|McNeill took offence at de Valera's {{response}} and against government advice, published his correspondence with de Valera. De Valera then formally advised King George V {{to dismiss the}} Governor General. The King arranged a special deal between both men, whereby McNeill would retire from his post {{a few weeks earlier}} than planned, with the resignation coinciding with the dates de Valera had suggested for the dismissal. On 25 April 1938, Aiken was too closely associated with the IRA to be allowed into the Anglo-Irish Agreement negotiations. Although the governor-generalship of the Irish Free State was controversial, the media and even anti-governor-generalship politicians in the opposition Labour Party publicly, and even members of de Valera's cabinet privately, criticised Aiken and O'Kelly for their treatment of McNeill, whom all sides saw as a <b>decent</b> <b>and</b> honourable man. Aiken refused to discuss the affair later in life. De Valera later made amends by appointing Mrs McNeill as an Irish ambassador.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Frederick Allen, a {{journalist}} and historian, published A <b>Decent</b> <b>and</b> Orderly Lynching:The Montana Vigilantes reviewed as an up-to-day balanced account of Montana's vigilante history (1864–1870). Allen's book reinforces the motivations and methods [...] of the earliest vigilantes in Alder Gulch while commenting on the growing disdain for vigilantism in the late 1860s. [...] More generalist works on Montana history such as Merrill G. Burlingame's The Montana Frontier (1942) and Michael P. Malone's Montana-A History of Two Centuries (1991) adequately summarize the vigilante period largely based on earlier accounts by Dimsdale, Langford and Biedler. [...] Additionally, many topical histories of Montana, such as novelist and Montana historian Dan Cushman's Montana: The Gold Frontier (1973) cover the vigilante period.|$|E

They proceeded eastwards to the Russian border, and reached St Petersburg at the end of October. They spent two months in the city; through influential contacts at the British Embassy they visited places generally inaccessible to the public, including Tsar Alexander's private quarters in the Winter Palace.
