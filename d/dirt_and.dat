5|$|When Bakshi was 18, {{his friend}} Cosmo Anzilotti {{was hired by}} the cartoon studio Terrytoons; Anzilotti {{recommended}} Bakshi to the studio's production manager, Frank Schudde. Bakshi was hired as a cel polisher and commuted four hours each day to the studio, based in suburban New Rochelle. His low-level position required Bakshi to carefully remove <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> dust from animation cels.|$|E
5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an irrigation ditch near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the ditch has failed numerous times, sending several tons of <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the ditch in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the ditch with pipes.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> oil and realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise {{hard to get}} at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
5|$|Cope's and Marsh's discoveries were {{accompanied}} by sensational accusations of spying, stealing workers and fossils, and bribery. The two men were so protective of their digging sites that they would destroy smaller or damaged fossils {{to prevent them from}} falling into their rival's hands, or fill in their excavations with <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> rock; while surveying his Como quarries in 1879, Marsh examined recent finds and marked several for destruction. On one occasion the scientists' rival teams fought each other by throwing stones.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, USAC split its National Championship into <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> {{pavement}} championships.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, the Parliamentary {{authorities}} undertook a three-week conservation project to repair and restore the statue. It consisted of removing accumulated <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> an old coating of black wax, repatinating the bronze surface to return it to its original colour and treating it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements. The bas reliefs on the pedestal were also cleaned and treated, as was the pedestal itself.|$|E
5|$|Many local-level American racetracks host {{their own}} season championships. In Wisconsin, {{numerous}} locations held <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started racing stock cars {{at the local}} level at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973, he won the rookie of the year award at Hales Corners Speedway in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin, and the next year started racing late models– the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced {{at the local level}}– at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo's Speedway in Oshkosh.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. In {{stark contrast to the}} industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through the building of a new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E

5|$|The 1973 Belmont Stakes was the 105th {{running of}} the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York held on June 9, 1973. Facing a field of five horses, Secretariat won by 31 lengths, the largest margin of victory in Belmont history, {{in front of a}} crowd of 69,138 spectators. His winning time of 2 minutes and 24 seconds was an American record for {{a mile and a half}} on <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> has not been broken.

5|$|This method {{worked well}} for digging soft <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> gravel near the street surface. However, {{tunnelling}} shields were required for deeper sections, such as the Harlem and East River tunnels, which used cast-iron tubes. Rock or concrete-lined tunnels were used on segments from 33rd to 42nd streets under Park Avenue; 116th to 120th Streets under Broadway; 145th to Dyckman Streets (Fort George) under Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue; and 96th Street and Broadway to Central Park North and Lenox Avenue.|$|E
5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful of}} canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E

5|$|At the {{election}} party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses {{her when he}} learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies {{in the arms of}} Martha and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, as well as the Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks up a handful of <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> sprinkles it into his father's grave.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1910s, a {{passable}} <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> {{gravel road}} connected Ukiah and Nevada City via the south side of Clear Lake and Marysville. The portion between Lower Lake and Wilbur Springs was impassable in wet weather, at which times the Bartlett Springs and Bear Valley Toll-road via Upper Lake and Bartlett Springs was available for $1.50 each way or $2.50 round trip. This route generally followed the present SR 20, except around Clear Lake and between Marysville and Rough and Ready (where it used Spenceville Road). Beyond Nevada City to Emigrant Gap, the old turnpike was not passable; instead the present SR 174 was available for eastward drivers. Between Williams and Colusa, the road was paved in concrete, as it had been added to the state highway system as part of the first (1910) bond issue, specifically as Route 15, connecting the west Sacramento Valley trunk (Route 7, now I-5) with the county seat of Colusa.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E
