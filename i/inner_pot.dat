50|$|A pot-in-pot refrigerator, clay pot cooler or zeer (زير) is an {{evaporative}} cooling refrigeration device {{which does not}} use electricity. It uses a porous outer earthenware pot, lined with wet sand, contains an <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> (which can be glazed to prevent penetration by the liquid) within which the food is placed - the evaporation of the outer liquid draws heat from the <b>inner</b> <b>pot.</b> The device {{can be used to}} cool any substance. This simple technology requires only a flow of relatively dry air and a source of water.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of evaporative cooling {{varies with the}} temperature, humidity and airflow. Given a constant flow of cool dry air the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> can achieve temperatures as low as 4.5 °C (40 °F), which is the temperature below which mesophilic ("middle temperature") bacteria such as food spoilage bacteria have significantly slowed growth.|$|E
50|$|Thermal cookers {{with two}} <b>inner</b> <b>pots</b> allow two items to be cooked {{at the same}} time, such as curry and rice. All thermal cookers are capable of cooking many dishes from soups to puddings. Cakes and bread can also be cooked by partly {{submerging}} the cake/bread tin in boiling water.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} uniform {{exposure of the}} roots to the salt, the pots (with holes in the base) were placed inside a second pot of greater diameter with no holes containing excess nutrient solution (to a depth of about 1  cm). This ensured that the nutrient solution kept the perlite moist {{up to the surface}} by capillary action. Before each application of nutrient solution, the outer pot was removed and the <b>inner</b> <b>pots</b> washed with 150  mL of nutrient solution, in order to avoid salt accumulation. The pots were allowed to drain for several hours, so as to avoid dilution of the subsequently added salt/nutrient solution.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the entomopathogenic activity of Fusarium avenaceum (strain 10 A) against adults of Sitophilus oryzae infesting wheat grain. Bioassays were carried out to determine the adult mortality of S. oryzae when the conidial suspension of the fungus strain was applied using three types of fungus treatment. Results obtained have indicated significant differences (P= 0. 05) in the mean percentage of adult mortality due to the treatment with the fungus compared to the control. The highest mean percentage of adult mortality was obtained by the direct spraying of S. oryzae adults with the fungus conidial suspension before introduction of the treated adults into pots containing wheat grain; the lowest mean percentage of adult mortality was obtained by spraying the <b>inner</b> surfaces of <b>pots</b> with the fungus conidial suspension before introducing the grain and insects. This study demonstrated the typical growth of F. avenaceum on the outer surfaces of the dead treated adults of S. oryzae. Presence of the external fungus growth on the dead insects indicated that the death of S. oryzae adults was attributed to the fungus infection. Results obtained in the present paper represent the first record of efficacy of F. avenaceum against a coleopteran stored-grain insect, mainly including S. oryzae...|$|R
50|$|Extended {{operation}} is possible if the pots {{are able to}} draw water from a storage container, such as an inverted airtight jar, or if the pots are placed in a shallow pool of water. A strap {{can be used to}} tie the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> down instead of using sand to prevent it from floating.|$|E
50|$|In rural {{northern}} Nigeria in the 1990s Mohamed Bah Abba {{developed the}} Pot-in-Pot Preservation Cooling System, {{consisting of a}} small earthenware pot placed inside a larger one, and {{the space between the}} two filled with moist sand. The <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> is filled with fruit, vegetables or soft drinks and covered with a wet cloth.|$|E
50|$|The smaller container, {{filled with}} the {{substance}} to be heated, fits inside the outer container {{filled with the}} working fluid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing {{the temperature of the}} materials in both containers to rise as needed. The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> from boiling or scorching.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to investigate any potential problems that may be encountered while using capillary wick irrigation system. Medium-fruited tomato plants were cultivated in spring up to the 10 th truss. In the first experiment, a 1 / 5, 000 a wagner pot was used, and small openings were made 5 mm or 50 mm {{from the bottom of}} the pots. Capillary wicks, 4 cm in width and 45 cm in length were inserted into the slits and aligned to the <b>pot’s</b> <b>inner</b> wall perpendicularly to the soil surface. The other end of the wick was dipped in half or full strength Ohtsuka-A nutrient solution. The wick was covered with water permeable root-barrier material to prevent root penetration into wick. This resulted in good growth and relatively high yield. Without covering, roots grew vigorously into the wicks and 1 month after transplanting extended to the reservoir solution. Removal of root overgrowth caused wilting in some of the plants. This symptom was more pronounced where the wick insertion points were 50 mm from the base. Root contexture was observed in non-covered and imperfectly covered wicks. These results indicate that it is important to make a wick with a perfect covering for stable plant growth and fruit yield. In the second experiment, the capacity of 2 cm or 4 cm wide with and single or double layers of capillary wicks to transport water to the plant root-zone was examined. Some of the plants wilted in the 2 cm single layer, while no differences were observed in other treatments. Furthermore, a high percentage of blossom-end rot was recorded in all treatments. In response to water uptake by the plants, the nutrient solution was supplied daily depending on the decrease of water in the reservoir, in order to maintain the water level fluctuation within a 3 cm range. This fluctuation may account for the blossom-end rot prevalence observed, probably due to water-stress imposed on the plants by unstable water level in the reservoir. 「毛管給水ひも」によるトマト栽培の可能性を探るため，中玉トマトの 10 段摘心栽培を試み，ひもの特性と栽培上の問題点を明らかにした． 1 / 5, 000 ａワグネルポットの底から 5 ㎜位と 50 ㎜位に小穴を開け，そこへ毛管ひも（幅 4 ㎝，長さ 45 ㎝）の一端を導入し，そのまま鉢中央を横切り対壁に沿って土壌表面まで配置した．他の一端は培養液に浸した．この毛管ひもを遮根透水シートで被覆し（接着あるいは機械織りによるチューブ状管にひもを挿入），その「被覆ひも」を「無被覆ひも」と比較したところ，被覆ひもでは根の侵入が強く抑制でき成育が旺盛で収量も高かった．被覆しないと 1 か月後には根が毛管ひも内に伸長して貯液槽にまで達した．この根を除去すると多くの個体は萎れの症状を呈した．この症状は 50 ㎜位の方が著しかった．被覆が不完全だと接着部あるいは織り込み部から根は毛管ひもに侵入する．従って，毛管ひもは完全被覆されることが重要であるといえる．また，遮根透水ひもを 2 ㎝幅， 4 ㎝幅としシングル状とダブル状で比較したところ，成育半ばでシングル 2 ㎝幅では萎れ症状が観察され枯死する個体も現れた．その 他では成育等に大きな差異は認められなかったが，いずれの処理区においても多くの尻腐れ果が発生した．トマトの吸水に伴って水位は低下するため本試験では毎日，培養液を手で補給した．しかし，水位変化は最大で 3 ㎝と大きかった．尻腐れ果発生はこの液槽の水位レベル管理に起因するところ大と推察され，今後の課題として残された...|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1990s steel thermal cookers were {{developed}} in Asia, consisting of two stainless steel pots, one within the other. The <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> is used to bring the food to the boil and the insulated outer pot is used as the container to retain heat and continue the cooking process. Some use insulation material between the outer pot walls, while others use a vacuum.|$|E
50|$|On a small scale, {{blackbutt}} can be regenerated {{from seed}} {{by the following}} method: When the valves of the gumnut open, shake and tap the gumnuts until enough of the tiny seeds fall into a container. Place the seeds in a pot of sand (or other substrate). Lightly cover the seeds with sand or other potting mixture. Place the pot in a larger water filled container, such as an ice-cream container. The water will fill the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> with the blackbutt seeds. The seeds will then be temporarily saturated. Place the larger container with the pot of seeds into the sun (or bright light). Blackbutt seedlings should appear within a week. As sand is infertile, extra fertilizer should be added after germination.|$|E
50|$|Mohamed Bah Abba (1964-2010) {{from rural}} area of {{northern}} Nigeria developed the pot-in-pot refrigerator i,e, Pot-in-Pot Preservation Cooling System in the 1990s, {{this is very}} simple its consisting of a small earthenware pot placed inside a larger one, and {{the space between the}} two filled with moist sand. The <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> is filled with fruit, vegetables or soft drinks and covered with a wet cloth. Abba, who hails from a family of potmakers, tapped into the large unemployed local workforce and hired skilled pot makers to mass-produce the first batch of 5,000 Pot-in-Pots. He received the Rolex Award for Enterprise in 2001 and used his $75,000 award to make the invention available throughout Nigeria. Abba devised an educational campaign tailored to village life and the illiterate population featuring a video-recorded play by local actors to dramatise the benefits of the desert refrigerator. The pots sell at 40 US cents a pair.|$|E
50|$|Proper pot size is an {{important}} factor to consider. A pot that is too large will cause root disease because of the excess moisture retained in the soil, while a pot that is too small will restrict a plant's growth. Generally, a plant can stay in the same pot for two or so years. Pots {{come in a variety of}} types as well, but usually can be broken down into two groups: porous and non-porous. Porous pots are usually clay and are highly recommended because they provide better aeration as air passes laterally through the sides of the pot. Non-porous pots such as glazed or plastic pots tend to hold moisture longer and restrict airflow. Another needed feature is drainage holes. Usually pots come with holes in the bottom to allow excess water to flow out of the soil which helps to prevent root rot. If a pot does not have drainage holes, it is best to double pot that plant so the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> can be lifted out and the excess water accumulated in the bottom of the outer pot can be removed. Soak old pots thoroughly in a solution of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water to kill any bacteria that may remain.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is centered on}} the design of a diesel fired heat-treatment furnace using locally sourced materials. The design philosophy is to eliminate the use of heating elements requiring electric power which is poorly supplied in the country. Design drawings were produced and mild steel was used for the fabrication of the furnace casing, while the other components needed for the design were selected based on functionality, durability, cost and local availability. The furnace was assembled by lining the inner wall of the casing with refractory blocks made from heated mixture of kaolin, clay, sawdust and water after which the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> and electro technical devices (temperature controller, light indicator etc) were positioned. Testing was subsequently performed to evaluate the performance of the furnace. It was observed that the furnace has a fast heating rate (61. 240 C/min to attain a pre-set temperature of 9000 C); and a fuel consumption rate less than 1. 41 litres/hr. It was also observed that the furnace has good heat retaining capacity; can be easily maintained and safe for use...|$|E
40|$|A {{new device}} {{consisting}} of a double-walled earthen pot called a ''jaltripti'' has been developed to help the establishment of trees in arid regions, where there are extremes of temperature, scanty and erratic rainfall and sandy soils which are low in moisture content and have poor water storage characteristics. The jaltripti is inexpensive (being made on a potter's wheel from locally-available materials). It is simple to use, and does not require energy. At {{the same time it}} uses every drop of water to the maximum. Small-scale and medium farmers in arid and semi-arid regions could benefit from this inexpensive technique. The jaltripti works on two simple principles: soil moisture tension and plant roots together create a suction force which draw moisture towards them from the neighbouring high moisture zones; and earthen pots have many micropores in their walls, which do not allow water to flow freely but allow its seepage in the direction where suction occurs. The base and the bottom of the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> are kept open, and the external side of the outer pot is rendered impervious. The pots are about 30 cm high. The pot is placed in a pit so that its brim is level with the soil surface, and the area around it is filled in with soil; a sapling is then transplanted into the <b>inner</b> <b>pot,</b> and the space between the two walls of the pot filled with water and covered with a polythene sheet to prevent evaporation. Comparative growth of six-month-old ber saplings planted in a jaltripti and an open pit showed that those in jaltripti pots had a height of 60 cm compared with 40 cm for those in pits, they had a collar diameter of 0. 66 cm (against 0. 37), a root length of 86 cm (against 25 cm) and' a fresh weight of 17. 9 g against 1. 5 g for those in open pits.

40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in neonatal care and monitoring, asphyxia globally accounts for 23 % of the 4 million annual deaths of newborns, and leads to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Occurring in five of 1000 live-born infants globally and even more in developing countries, HIE {{is a serious problem}} that causes death in 25 %– 50 % of affected neonates and neurological disability to at least 25 % of survivors. In order to prevent the damage caused by HIE, our invention provides an effective whole-body cooling of the neonates by utilizing evaporation and an endothermic reaction. Our device is composed of basic electronics, clay pots, sand, and urea-based instant cold pack powder. A larger clay pot, lined with nearly 5 cm of sand, contains a smaller pot, where the neonate will be placed for therapeutic treatment. When the sand is mixed with instant cold pack urea powder and wetted with water, the device can extract heat from inside to outside and maintain the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> at 17 °C for more than 24 hours with monitoring by LED lights and thermistors. Using a piglet model, we confirmed that our device fits the specific parameters of therapeutic hypothermia, lowering the body temperature to 33. 5 °C with a 1 °C margin of error. After the therapeutic hypothermia treatment, warming is regulated by adjusting the amount of water added and the location of baby inside the device. Our invention uniquely limits the amount of electricity required to power and operate the device compared with current expensive and high-tech devices available in the United States.

40|$|China has had {{an active}} program on energy {{efficiency}} standards for household appliances since the mid- 1990 s. Rice cooker is {{among the first to}} be subject to such mandatory regulation, since {{it is one of the}} most prevalent electric appliances in Chinese households. Since first introduced in 1989, the minimum energy efficiency standard for rice cookers has not been revised. Therefore, the potential for energy saving is considerable. Initial analysis from CNIS indicates that potential carbon savings is likely to reach 7. 6 million tons of CO 2 by the 10 th year of the standard implementation. Since September 2007, CNIS has been working with various groups to develop the new standard for rice cookers. With The Energy Foundation's support, LBNL has assisted CNIS in the revision of the minimum energy efficiency standard for rice cookers that is expected to be effective in 2009. Specifically, work has been in the following areas: assistance in developing consumer survey on usage pattern of rice cookers, review of international standards, review of international test procedures, comparison of the international standards and test procedures, and assessment of technical options of reducing energy use. This report particularly summarizes the findings of reviewing international standards and technical options of reducing energy consumption. The report consists of an overview of rice cooker standards and labeling programs and testing procedures in Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Thailand, and Japan's case study in developing energy efficiency rice cooker technologies and rice cooker efficiency programs. The results from the analysis can be summarized as the follows: Hong Kong has a Voluntary Energy Efficiency Labeling scheme for electric rice cookers initiated in 2001, with revision implemented in 2007; South Korea has both MEPS and Mandatory Energy Efficiency Label targeting the same category of rice cookers as Hong Kong; Thailand's voluntary endorsement labeling program is similar to Hong Kong in program design but has 5 efficiency grades; Japan's program is distinct in its adoption of the 'Top Runner' approach, in which, the future efficiency standards is set based on the efficiency levels of the most efficient product in the current domestic market. Although the standards are voluntary, penalties can still be evoked if the average efficiency target is not met. Both Hong Kong and South Korea's tests involve pouring water into the <b>inner</b> <b>pot</b> equal to 80 % of its rated volume; however, white rice is used as a load for its tests in Hong Kong whereas no rice is used for tests in South Korea. In Japan's case, water level specified by the manufactures is used and milled rice is used as a load only partially in the tests. Moreover, Japan does not conduct heat efficiency test but its energy consumption measurements tests are much more complex, with 4 different tests are conducted to determine the annual average energy consumption. Hong Kong and Thailand both set Minimum Allowable Heat Efficiency for different rated wattages. The energy efficiency requirements are identical except that the minimum heat efficiency in Thailand is 1 percentage point higher for all rated power categories. In South Korea, MEPS and label's energy efficiency grades are determined by the rice cooker's Rated Energy Efficiency for induction, non-induction, pressure, nonpressure rice cookers. Japan's target standard values are set for electromagnetic induction heating products and non-electromagnetic induction heating products by different size of rice cookers. Specific formulas are used by type and size depending on the mass of water evaporation of the rice cookers. Japan has been the leading country in technology development of various types of rice cookers, and developed concrete energy efficiency standards for rice cookers. However, as consumers in Japan emphasize the deliciousness of cooked rice over other factors, many types of models were developed to improve the taste of cooked rice. Nonetheless, the efficiency of electromagnetic induction heating (IH) rice cookers in warm mode has improved approximately 12 percent from 1993 to 2004 due to the 'low temperature warming method' developed by manufacturers. The Energy Conservation Center of Japan (IEEJ) releases energy saving products database on the web regularly, on which the energy saving performance of each product is listed and ranked. Energy saving in rice cookers mostly rest with insulation of the pot. Technology developed to improve the energy efficiency of the rice cookers includes providing vacuum layers on both side of the pot, using copper-plated materials, and double stainless layer lid that can be heated and steam can run in between the two layers to speed the heating process...|$|E
