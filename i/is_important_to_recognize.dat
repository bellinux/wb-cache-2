25|$|When {{modelling}} a bond option, {{or other}} interest rate derivative (IRD), it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that future {{interest rates are}} uncertain, and therefore, the discount rate(s) referred to above, under all three cases—i.e. whether for all coupons or for each individual coupon—is not adequately represented by a fixed (deterministic) number. In such cases, stochastic calculus is employed.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> {{early that}} these drugs are causing DIL like {{symptoms}} and discontinue {{use of the}} drug. Symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus generally disappear days to weeks after medication use is discontinued. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will quicken the healing process. Corticosteroids may be used if more severe symptoms of DIL are present.|$|E

30|$|Musculoskeletal {{injuries}} encompass both bony fractures {{and soft}} tissue injuries. Birth-related fractures in the newborn period, though overall rare, <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> due <b>to</b> non-specific signs or symptoms, increased likelihood of missing them due to unossified cartilage and necessity of differentiating these from abusive trauma. These include fractures of both flat and long bones [38].|$|R
40|$|Dermatoses unique <b>to</b> {{pregnancy}} <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> for {{the clinician}} as they carry considerable morbidity for pregnant mothers {{and in some}} instances constitute a risk to the fetus.

This review discusses the pathogenesis, clinical importance, and management of the dermatoses of pregnancy...|$|R
25|$|Chronic {{pulmonary}} reactions {{caused by}} nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting {{the drug and}} is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises {{as it can be}} reversible if the drug is stopped early.|$|E
25|$|In {{understanding}} Maya medicine, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> {{that the}} Maya equated sickness with the captivity of one’s soul by supernatural beings, angered by some perceived misbehavior. For this reason, curing a sickness involved elements of ritual, cleansing and herbal remedy. Research of Maya ethno-medicine shows that though supernatural causes {{are related to}} illness, {{a large percentage of}} Maya medical texts are devoted to the treatment of symptoms based upon objective observations of the effects of certain plants on the human system. Herbal remedies were ingested, smoked, snorted, rubbed on the skin, and even used in the form of enemas to force rapid absorption of a substance into the blood stream. Cleansing techniques included fasting, sweating and purging flushed substances out of the body.|$|E
25|$|In {{the media}} and popular science, quantum non-locality is often portrayed as being {{equivalent}} to entanglement. While {{it is true that}} a pure bipartite quantum state must be entangled in order for it to produce non-local correlations, there exist entangled states that do not produce such correlations, and there exist non-entangled (separable) quantum states that present some non-local behaviour. A well-known example of the first case is the Werner state that is entangled for certain values of , but can always be described using local hidden variables. In short, entanglement of a two-party state is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. Moreover, it was shown that, for arbitrary number of party, there exist states that are genuinely entangled but admits a fully local strategy. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a precedent to non-locality as well as to quantum teleportation and to superdense coding, whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the foundations and interpretations of quantum mechanics.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E

50|$|Awareness {{occurs when}} {{one or more}} of the {{participants}} recognized the differences in expectations for the conversation. In some cases, this may mean that one speaker recognizes that the other is speaking faster or slower, using act sequences that rely heavily on fast turn-taking or accepted interrupting, speaking in a more formal or informal register, etc. In the instance of gossip, it would <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> if one <b>is</b> not matching the speech pattern.|$|R

2500|$|One {{idea that}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> {{is that of}} contaminatio, which refers to the mixing of {{elements}} {{of two or more}} source plays. Plautus, it seems, is quite open to this method of adaptation, and quite a few of his plots seem stitched together from different stories. One excellent example is his Bacchides and its supposed Greek predecessor, Menander's Dis Exapaton.

[...] The Orthodox believe {{that the absence of}} an explicit mention of the double procession of the Holy Spirit is a strong indication that the filioque is a theologically erroneous doctrine.|$|E
2500|$|An adult may be {{expected}} to cope with the death of a parent in a less emotional way; however, the loss can still invoke extremely powerful emotions. This is especially true when the death occurs at an important or difficult period of life, such as when becoming a parent, at graduation, or at other times of emotional stress. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the effects that the loss of a parent can cause, and to address these effects. For an adult, the willingness to be open to grief is often diminished. A failure to accept and deal with loss will only result in further pain and suffering. “Mourning is the open expression of your thoughts and feelings about the death. It {{is an essential part of}} healing.” ...|$|E
40|$|Interpretation of radiologic studies {{requires}} vigilance on {{the part}} of the radiologist to identify findings and abnormalities outside the region of interest. In the case of routine lumbar spine MRI for low back pain, many extraspinal abnormalities can often be identified. Some of these findings may account for low back pain.

50|$|One {{might ask}} what {{the point is}} of {{classifying}} the parties into these categories {{when they do not}} fit. The answer would be that one should look at the broad picture, and use von Beyme’s tool to make sense of certain tendencies in European politics.However, it would also <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the fact that western European societies have changed tremendously in course of the last decades regarding a number of issues. Therefore, by identifying these factors one might also broaden the understanding of the generally changing patterns of party- ideology in Europe today, compared to the 1950s.|$|R
2500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> when grief {{has turned}} into {{something}} more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living. It recommends contacting a medical professional if [...] "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life." [...] Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: [...] "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have lost your sense of purpose in life, wish you had died along with your loved one." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{memorandum}} from LeMay, Chief of Staff, USAF, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, January 4, 1964, illustrates LeMay's {{reasons for}} keeping bomber forces alongside ballistic missiles: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize,</b> however, that ballistic missile forces represent both the U.S. and Soviet potential for strategic nuclear warfare at the highest, most indiscriminate level, {{and at a}} level least susceptible to control. The employment of these weapons in lower level conflict {{would be likely to}} escalate the situation, uncontrollably, to an intensity which could be vastly disproportionate to the original aggravation. The use of ICBMs and SLBMs is not, therefore, a rational or credible response to provocations which, although serious, are still less than an immediate threat to national survival. For this reason, among others, I consider that the national security will continue to require the flexibility, responsiveness, and discrimination of manned strategic weapon systems throughout the range of cold, limited, and general war".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{after the}} Jyllands-Posten Muhammad {{cartoons}} controversy, Harris wrote, [...] "The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' {{is a dangerous}} fantasy—and {{it is now a}} particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge. It {{is not at all clear}} how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer. [...] It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. [...] But it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> why this is so—it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms." [...] He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of Islam.|$|E
40|$|Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis (CACP) {{syndrome}} is an inherited disorder characterized by congenital or early-onset flexion camptodactyly, childhood-onset of non-inflammatory arthropathy, {{often associated with}} non-inflammatory pericarditis or pericardial effusion and progressive coxa vara. The causative gene is located on chromosome band 1 q 25 - 31. This gene encodes for "proteoglycan- 4 " (PRG- 4), which is a surface lubricant for joints and tendons. This syndrome has distinct radiological and histological features, which <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> since it may clinically mimic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and mutation studies may not be easily available.
