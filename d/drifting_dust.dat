60|$|But {{all this}} {{history has been}} hidden by a {{prejudice}} more general than the particular case of Saracens and Crusaders. The modern, or rather the Victorian prejudice against Crusaders is positive and not relative; and it would still desire to condemn Tancred if it could not acquit Saladin. Indeed it is a prejudice not so much against Crusaders as against Christians. It will not give to these heroes of religious war the fair measure it gives to the heroes of ordinary patriotic and imperial war. There never was a nobler hero than Nelson, or one more national or more normal. Yet Nelson quite certainly did do what Tancred almost certainly did not do; break his own word by giving up his own brave enemies to execution. If the cause of Nelson in other times comes {{to be treated as}} the creed of Tancred has often in recent times been treated, this incident alone will be held sufficient to prove not only that Nelson was a liar and a scoundrel, but that he did not love England at all, did not love Lady Hamilton at all, that he sailed in English ships only to pocket the prize money of French ships, and would as willingly have sailed in French ships for the prize money of English ships. That is the sort of dull dust of gold that has been shaken like the <b>drifting</b> <b>dust</b> of the desert over the swords and the relics, the crosses and the clasped hands of the men who marched to Jerusalem or died at Hattin. In these medieval pilgrims every inconsistency is a hypocrisy; while in the more modern patriots even an infamy is only an inconsistency. I have rounded off the story here with the ruin at Hattin because the whole reaction against the pilgrimage had its origin there; and because it was this at least that finally lost Jerusalem. Elsewhere in Palestine, to say nothing of Africa and Spain, splendid counter-strokes were still being delivered from the West, not the least being the splendid rescue by Richard of England. But I still think that with the mere name of that tiny town upon the hills the note of the whole human revolution had been struck, was changed and was silent. All the other names were only the names of Eastern towns; but that was nearer to a man than his neighbours; a village inside his village, a house inside his house.|$|E

He calmly examines the flip side of life with acute senses and keen insight, showing the detailed sights of life. His early poems, published in his first collection Horangi baljaguk (호랑이 발자국 A Tiger’s Footsteps) (2003), shows well the poet’s eyes that observe the lives around him, while approaching the deep places of life centered on his family, including himself. Such poetic tendencies are more concretely expanded in his second collection, Mokryeonjeoncha (목련전차 The Magnolia Streetcar) (2006). In this collection, with backgrounds such as the soil, the ocean, and the port, he projected his poverty ridden days of adolescence into a poetic imagery. Moreover, Son Taek-su has moved onto writing works that are of finding out about Buddhist concepts along with mystical stories from fables or legends, laying out a deeper poetic universe.

With accounting for the momentum transfer from the dust to the gas, the expansion time of the HII region is notably reduced (for our model of RCW 120, the time to reach the observed radius of the HII region is reduced by a factor of 1. 5). Under the common approximation of frozen dust, where there is no relative <b>drift</b> between the <b>dust</b> and gas, the radiation pressure from the ionizing star drives the formation of the very deep gas cavity near the star.

30|$|Refractory dust grains {{in orbit}} around a star spiral into the star by the Poynting-Robertson drag (hereafter P-R drag) and sublime in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the star. Because the particles lose their mass during sublimation, the ratio β of radiation pressure to gravity of the star acting on each particle ordinarily increases. As a result, their radial-drift rates decrease and the particles pile up at the outer edge of their sublimation zone (e.g., Mukai and Yamamoto, 1979; Burns et al., 1979). This is a mechanism to form a dust ring proposed by Belton (1966) as an accumulation of interplanetary dust grains at their sublimation zone. Ring formation of <b>drifting</b> <b>dust</b> particles is not limited to refractory grains around the sun but it also takes place for icy grains from the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt and for dust in debris disks (Kobayashi et al., 2008, 2010).

In these regions with an intensive human disturbance, vegetation has degraded into herb vegetation of annual plant complexes. On the margins of the alluvial-fluvial fans, the lakeshore, and the surrounding regions where the river mouths join the lake, different azonal vegetation-Phragmites communis marsh, Phragmites communis meadow, and Tamarix shrubs-have developed with a vegetation cover of some 80 %. On heavier, salinized land, succulent halophyte desert vegetation dominated by Halo-cnemum strobilaceum has formed with a fractional canopy cover of 10 - 15 %. Haloxylon persicum, Aristida pennata, and other species with a vegetation cover of 30 - 50 % grow in the sand desert zone on the periphery in the lake.

This <b>dust</b> <b>drift</b> risk is clearly linked with the seed coating quality. Seed coating quality is traditionally assessed with Heubach dustmeters and guidelines are established in terms of ‘Heubach value’. This technique may, however, not take all drift sensitive particles in to account. In this study, results of the Heubach test are compared to two alternative setups: mechanical sieving and individual sowing element.

However there remains a lack of consensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating it. One potential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of relatively dust-free gas increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc lifetime, photoevaporation dominates viscous accretion, creating a gradient in the depleted gas surface density near {{the location of the}} gap. This induces a local pressure maximum that collects <b>drifting</b> <b>dust</b> particles, which may then become susceptible to the streaming instability.

The discrepancies are primarily a consequence of the different photoevaporation profiles assumed.

40|$|The disk {{surrounding}} SAO 206462, an 8 Myr-old Herbig Ae star, {{has recently}} been reported to exhibit spiral arms, an asymmetric dust continuum, and a dust-depleted inner cavity. By carrying out two-dimensional, two-fluid hydrodynamic calculations, we find that a planetary-mass companion located at the outer disk could be responsible for these observed structures. In this model, the planet excites primary and secondary arms interior to its orbit. It also carves a gap and generates a local pressure bump at the inner gap edge where a vortex forms through Rossby wave instability. The vortex traps radially <b>drifting</b> <b>dust</b> particles, forming a dust-depleted cavity in the inner disk.

CONCLUSION: All particle sizing techniques have their (dis) advantages and none of them is able to perfectly describe the real size distribution of non-spherical particles. The particle size information gathered can be used in <b>dust</b> <b>drift</b> prediction models, risk assessment tools and will help to better understand the <b>dust</b> <b>drift</b> phenomenon. status: publishe...|$|R

In addition, samples of pollen and nectar from foragers and in the hives were taken for residue analysis. |$|R
40|$|The {{coagulation}} of {{dust particles}} immersed in plasmas is {{studied in the}} presence of a relative <b>drift</b> between <b>dust</b> and plasma species. The plasma environment is responsible for the deposition of a net charge on the dust particles; the relative drift causes an anisotropy of the species deposition on the dust surface and leads to a dipole moment. The charge and dipole moment affect the coagulation rate significantly. In particular, the dipole moment is responsible for a coagulation rate dependent upon the orientation of the coagulating particles with respect to the dipole moment. This effect may be responsible for the linear structures observed in agglomerates of dust particles formed by coagulation in experimental plasma reactors. status: publishe...|$|R
