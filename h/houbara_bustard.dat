2500|$|Captively bred hybrid falcons {{have been}} {{available}} since the late 1970s, and enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity in North America and the UK in the 1990s. Hybrids were initially [...] "created" [...] to combine the horizontal speed {{and size of the}} gyrfalcon with the good disposition and aerial ability of the peregrine. [...] Hybrid falcons first gained large popularity throughout the Arabian Peninsula, feeding a demand for particularly large and aggressive female falcons capable and willing to take on the very large <b>houbara</b> <b>bustard,</b> the classic falconry quarry in the deserts of the Middle East. [...] These falcons were also very popular with Arab falconers as they tended to withstand a respiratory disease (aspergillosis from the mold strain aspergillus) in stressful desert conditions better than other pure species from the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
2500|$|Falconry is {{currently}} practiced {{in many countries}} around the world. [...] The falconer's traditional choice of bird is the northern goshawk and peregrine falcon. In contemporary falconry in both North America and the UK they remain popular, although the Harris hawk and red-tailed hawk are likely more widely used. [...] The northern goshawk and the golden eagle are more commonly used in Eastern Europe than elsewhere. [...] In the Middle East, the saker falcon is the most traditional species flown against the <b>houbara</b> <b>bustard,</b> sandgrouse, stone-curlew, other birds and hares. Peregrines and other captively bred imported falcons are also commonplace. Falconry remains {{an important part of}} the Arab heritage and culture. [...] The UAE reportedly spends over 27 million dollars annually towards the protection and conservation of wild falcons, and has set up several state-of-the-art falcon hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest falcon hospital in the whole world. [...] There are two breeding farms in the Emirates, as well as those in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. [...] Every year, falcon beauty contests and demonstrations take place at the ADIHEX exhibition in Abu Dhabi.|$|E

40|$|A {{review was}} {{conducted}} of 236 postmortem examinations of six species of captive and imported bustards in the United Arab Emirates {{for the period}} 1979 - 94. The most common causes of death in adult imported <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) were euthanasia due to Newcastle disease, aspergillosis, and post-transportation-related deaths. Helminth parasites were a common finding in imported <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards,</b> and large parasite burdens occasionally caused intestinal obstruction and death. The most common causes of death in adult captive <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> were trauma- related deaths and euthanasia for or death following treatment for capture myopathy. Fatty liver change was an important postmortem finding of captive adult <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards.</b> The main {{cause of death in}} juvenile <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> was yolk-sac infection and septicemia. The most common causes of death in adult kori bustards (Ardeotis kori) were capture myopathy and handling injuries or euthanasia following these injuries. The most common causes of death in adult rufous-crested bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista) were post- transportation deaths in imported birds and trichomoniasis and trauma in captive birds. Juvenile rufous crested bustards appeared to be highly susceptible to gizzard impactions and foreign-body obstructions of the gastrointestinal tract. Nutritional hone disease is an important disease of all juvenile bustards, particularly kori and <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards.</b> Aspergillosis was also a common postmortem finding in captive and imported adult <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> and also caused mortality in juvenile kori and <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards...</b>|$|R
40|$|Desert birds often {{experience}} {{a scarcity of}} drinking water and food and must survive episodes of high ambient temperature (Ta). The physiological mechanisms that promote survival during extended periods of high Ta have received little attention. We investigated the physiological responses of wild-caught and captive-reared <b>Houbara</b> <b>bustards,</b> Chlamydotis macqueenii, to Ta values ranging from below 0 °C to 55 °C, well above those in most previous studies of birds. Captive-reared <b>Houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> (mass 1245 ± 242 g, N= 7, mean ± S. D.) in summer have a resting metabolic rate (RMR) of 261. 4 kJ day – 1, 26 % below allometric predictions, and a total evaporative water loss (TEWL) at 25 °C of 25. 8 g day – 1, 31 % below predictions. When Ta exceeded body temperature (Tb), the dry heat transfer coefficient decreased, a finding supporting the prediction that birds should minimize dry Summary heat gain from the environment at high Ta values. <b>Houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> withstand high Ta values without becoming hyperthermic; at 45 °C, Tb was on average 0. 9 °C higher than at 25 °C. RMR and TEWL of captivebred <b>Houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> were 23 % and 46 % higher in winter than in summer, respectively. Captive-reared <b>Houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> had a 17 % lower RMR and a 28 % lower TEWL than wild-born birds with similar genetic backgrounds.

50|$|Migratory and {{resident}} populations of <b>Houbara</b> <b>bustard</b> have long existed on the Arabian Peninsula, where for centuries they {{played an important}} role in the survival of the indigenous people who lived in the harsh desert climate. Owing to the practice of hunting with falcons, the Houbara served as an important source of sustenance for these desert-dwellers. Today, this ancient practice dates back some several thousand years, and has thus transformed the <b>Houbara</b> <b>bustard</b> into an important symbol of Arabian heritage and culture.|$|E
40|$|Captive {{breeding}} and restoration programs involve managed movements of animals between captive and free-living populations.

Captive breeding programs have been established by the governments of several countries in the Middle East {{with the objective of}} restoring populations of <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). Many of these organizations have integrated veterinary departments into their captive-breeding programs. Biomedical research has been developed to maximize the health of captive birds, monitor the diseases present in both captive and free-living populations, and minimize the potential threat of disease transfer.

The helminth parasites of captive <b>houbara</b> <b>bustards</b> (Chlamydotis undulata macqueeni), rufous-crested bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista), and kori bustards (Ardeotis kori) {{have been investigated}} at the National Avian Research Centre (NARC) and the International Institute of Parasitology. The cestode species recovered include Hispaniolepis falsata, Ascometra vestita, Ascometra choriotidis, Otiditaenia conoideis, Otiditaenia macqueeni, Raillietina neyrai, and Idiogenes sp. The acanthocephalans Mediorhynchus taeniatus and Centrorhynchus lancea were also recovered. A host-parasite list is presented here. Chlamydotis undulata macqueeni is a new host for A. choriotidis, C. lancea, and R. neyrai, and E. ruficrista is a new host for O. macqueeni.

Many of UAE's rulers were enthusiasts in falconry as the nation imports falcons from all across the globe. On November 20, 2001 and again in 2002, the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna imposed comprehensive wildlife trade sanctions (i.e. recommendations against trade) on the United Arab Emirates. Sanctions were instigated by industrial-scale falcon smuggling, financed and directed by the ruling sheikhs. Smuggling continues into 2009, {{to such an extent that}} saker falcons, altai gyrafalcons, and gyrfalcons have become regionally extinct across much of Central Asia.
