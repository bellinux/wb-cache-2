5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained <b>illness,</b> {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery <b>illness</b> was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the <b>illness</b> is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E

40|$|Outbreak {{data have}} been used to {{estimate}} the proportion of <b>illnesses</b> attributable to different foods. Applying outbreak-based attribution estimates to nonoutbreak foodborne <b>illnesses</b> requires an assumption of similar exposure pathways for outbreak and sporadic <b>illnesses.</b> This assumption cannot be tested, but other comparisons can assess its veracity. Our study compares demographic, clinical, temporal, and geographic characteristics of outbreak and sporadic <b>illnesses</b> from Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O 157, Listeria, and Salmonella bacteria ascertained by the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet). Differences among FoodNet sites in outbreak and sporadic <b>illnesses</b> might reflect differences in surveillance practices. For Campylobacter, Listeria, and Escherichia coli O 157, outbreak and sporadic <b>illnesses</b> are similar for severity, sex, and age. For Salmonella, outbreak and sporadic <b>illnesses</b> are similar for severity and sex. Nevertheless, the percentage of outbreak <b>illnesses</b> in the youngest age category was lower. Therefore, we do not reject the assumption that outbreak and sporadic <b>illnesses</b> are similar. 27314510 PMC 491814...|$|R

The lack of commitment whether it be by sin or a lack of attention to religious practices, the Lord would retract his protection over the individual; thus, making him susceptible to evil influences and ultimately <b>illnesses.</b> It is believed by multiple cultural groups.  Evil influences include supernatural forces as well as vengeful spirits - both ancestral and non-ancestral spirits.|$|R

40|$|Many {{psychiatric}} <b>illnesses</b> {{are associated}} with early mortality and with {{an increased risk of}} developing physical diseases that are more typically seen in the elderly. Moreover, certain psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> may be associated with accelerated cellular aging, evidenced by shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which could underlie this association. Shortened LTL reflects a cell's mitotic history and cumulative exposure to inflammation and oxidation as well as the availability of telomerase, a telomere-lengthening enzyme. Critically short telomeres can cause cells to undergo senescence, apoptosis or genomic instability, and shorter LTL correlates with poorer health and predicts mortality. Emerging data suggest that LTL may be reduced in certain psychiatric <b>illnesses,</b> perhaps in proportion to exposure to the psychiatric <b>illnesses,</b> although conflicting data exist. Telomerase has been less well characterized in psychiatric <b>illnesses,</b> but a role in depression and in antidepressant and neurotrophic effects has been suggested by preclinical and clinical studies. In this article, studies on LTL and telomerase activity in psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> are critically reviewed, potential mediators are discussed, and future directions are suggested. A deeper understanding of cellular aging in psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> could lead to re-conceptualizing them as systemic <b>illnesses</b> with manifestations inside and outside the brain and could identify new treatment targets...|$|R
