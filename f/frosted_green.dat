50|$|B. holstii is hairless {{evergreen}} shrub of 1-3 m high, with reddish or brownish young shoots, {{that later}} develop dark grey bark. At {{the base of}} the short side shoots, that carry leaves and flowers, are 1-4 cm long spines with three (to five) branches. The leaves appear simple, but there are two short hairlike leaflets at the base. The large top leaflet is stiff and leathery, and mostly measures 2-3 cm in length, is generally inverted egg-shaped and may have a few spiny teeth along the margin and one at the tip. The typical yellow barberry flowers are in few flowered panicles 2½-7½ cm long. The three inner sepals are 6-7 mm long and rounded at their tip. The six petals are 4½-6 mm long and inverted egg-shaped. Like the flowers in many other Berberis-species, they contain stamens that respond to touch by rapidly moving upwards and inwards, to promote delivering pollen on the body of a visiting insect. The flowers will develop into long oval berries which retain the stigma, and are initially <b>frosted</b> <b>green,</b> turn to a frosted deep purple when ripe, and contain one to four seeds. In Malawi, flowers are present in October and November, while the berries are ripe in May and June.|$|E
40|$|The {{blue glass}} {{is always the}} hardest to find. On the beach you catch the waves {{bringing}} back the glass from forgotten tossed bottles, <b>frosted</b> <b>green,</b> clear, or mottled pale brown. But the blue glass - that 2 ̆ 7 s the real thing. I search for days without finding any. Sometimes there are slivers; other days, small chunks. Like a beachcomber, I comb the sands for it. I take the glass home and make some into jewellery and touchstones for people to hang on to; pour essential oils on others so the scents waft heavenward and meld together with the glass to form a bond. Words are like that. They can fuse {{with each other and}} ignite, or just quietly combine, On sunny days, I take my books with me to the beach. I toss words back and forth in my mind, like churning waves. I cobble them together, A phrase here. A sentence there. The water. The sun. The sand. The glass. The words. The paper. The Connection. I find myself enveloped in it all. The glass is from bottles tossed into the surf by unthinking people - picnickers, vacationers, those who don 2 ̆ 7 t have to return here and live with the remnants of their actions. Over time, the broken glass is ground and moulded by the action of the waves; the sharp edges are softened and etched by the sand and water, The sea glass is washed up on shore and picked up by beachcombers. Some recycle it for other uses like me; others just keep it as a reminder of a day at the beach. The words I sift through as I sit on the sand are measured in the sea glass. I pick each word up and look through it to see how much light shines through. What use do 1 have for it? A poem? An essay? A fragment of a sentence, for something to be said in the future? I watch the sun rest uneasily on its bed of water and slide slowly, farther down. I know the hot summer is coming to a close and I am loath {{to let go of the}} closeness I feel with nature. I live to find the blue glass, and sometimes it just happens. My search for Indian migrant women was like my quest for the blue glass. It was not an easy task. It became a process of rummaging through other people 2 ̆ 7 s lives, searching for fragments and relics. Eventually I was able to fit pieces together to form a mosaic of their lives in that other time, that other place. And also in this present time, in this place they now call home, Australia...|$|E

It is well to remember the many personal sacrifices and the endless long hours work­ing like a human dynamo, striving to improve the living standards of the worker and his family; putting more bread and butter on their table and, needless to say, the betterment of our community as a whole can be attributed to his interest in civic activities. He gave of himself so completely he ruined his own health. W are all better off be­cause of the principles he stands for and lives by. Among his many achievements in labor and public life and the many worthwhile things he founded, the following serve as living proof of Gosser's untiring efforts. The Childrens Summer Camp, The Diagnostic Clinic, The Health and Retiree Center with the Pharmacies, the Optical Department, the Dental Department, the Hearing Aid Department, United Labor Committee, 60 Now, Council of Elders, Golden Age Summer and Winter Centers. As President of Local 12 U. A. W., as Regional Director of Region 2 -B, U. A. W., as. Vice-president of the International Union, UAW-AFL-CIO, during which time he was Director of the Competitive Shops Department, Director of Skilled Trades Department, Director of Wage and Hours Department, Director of Die Casting Department, Director of Auto-Lite Department, Director of Dana-Spicer Department, Director of Champion Spark Plug Department, Director of Doehler-Jarvis Council, Director of Foundry Department and Director of several other wage and hour councils too numerous to mention. In civic life he served as a Charter Member of the Labor-Management-Citizens Com­mittee and the Toledo Industrial Development Committee. Dick Gosser also was an in­tegral part of the Toledo Port Authority and other civic committees. He helped in various major fund raising drives like the Newsboy Goodfellows, The Community Chest, hospi­tals, churches, and others. Only last year, through his efforts, every needy child had an opportunity to attend free the Children's Wonderland at the Lucas County Recreational Center. These are just an example of the many'ways Toledo's most renowned labor leader has helped people in all walks of life throughout the United States an. dCanada.. It is fitting this evening that over 2, 000 of us. gather together to break bread with this great man and our best 'friend, Richard T. Gosser. It is ·our way of demonstrati. ng to him and to everyone that we honor and appreciate his complete dedication to labor and the community. What's more, we publicly ackqowledge and respect his honesty, his courage, his leadership, and his efforts to obtain a fuller measure of life for all•. We sincerely' hope that his retirement as an active officer in the labor movement is not a conclusion to 'an illustrious past, but instead with the Good Lord willing and his health permitting, Dick Gosser will continue to be an inspiration and a guiding tower of light to a better and brighter future. In these troubled tiines, now more than ever, we need his unequaled quality of under­standing tolerance, perseverance, desire and ability to help people gain dignity as be­comes the brotherhood of man. 'I am deeply touched by this turnout tonite. I don't believe anyone came out here because they want a job as an international representative. My influence with the UAW has diminished since my retirement so I take it that those who are here are my friends. And I {{want to thank you for}} giving up your favorite TV program or breaking a bowling date or some other engagement to come. If I seem to be overwhelmed by gratitude [...] forgive me. During my long years as a Labor Leader I have found gratitude isn't our chief virtue. I can think back to a long list of associates whom I have tried to help and who are no longer with meÿoing back to Toots Martinÿ [...] But I don't think this is the place or the time to review history [...] , or to talk of my deeds or my misdeeds. After all the words that have been spoken it would be like putting more icing on the frosting of the cake. Looking back 30 years I would say we have come a pretty long way in getting a better deal for the worker. Now if we can mobilize only a small part of that spirit when we first started this industrial union movement; if we can get just a small part of the effort and the sacrifice that those fellows gave, we can gain more in the next 30 months than has been accomplished in the last 30 years. I donlt plan to make a long speech [...] , that is, long for me. But last week I told some negro ministers who met with me that thereWs a difference when a worker in a factory retires and a fellow who has made his living using his brains and his wits. If the last couple of months in Florida proved anything to me it proved I wasnlt going to be happy spending the rest of my life sunning myself on a rocking chair. If I can't do all I could 5 or i 0 years ago I still can outthink [...] and figure out a few short cuts to help the workers [...] . or the retirees. And having been doing this so long, I may as well go on doing it. But nowadays itls not the worker that needs help so much as the fellows that have given up workingo [...] or the young fellows that want to work but can't [...] . and they canlt because there is no job to be found for too many of them. Yet there is one simple remedy that can help both these groups of people [...] . the young fellow looking for a job and the old-timer who has given his up. That is our Sixty Now program where we make it possible for the older worker to retire with a decent pay check so he can enjoy life and live in dignity. While we are helping him to a well-earned and long deserved rest we are helping create a job opening for the younger fellow just out of school. Let me just give you a few facts before I leave this point. The Social Security Department reports that the average monthly benefit to the 13 million people retired under this law is 76. 66. That is less than i, 000. 00 a year. If the President and the Congress really want to cure poverty herels a swell place to begin. LetWs raise Social Security [...] . and if we have to reduce anything, letts reduce the age [...] . NOT the Social Security benefit. The 1960 census report says there were nearly 3 and 3 / 4 million men and women between the ages of 60 and 64 working in this country. At the same time the United States Labor Department reported there were between 4 and 5 million persons unemployed. If we could make it possible and worthwhiled for these older persons to retire on a decent benefit it would nearly take care of all the unemployed. Now just let me make a final point. No one has to tell me that not all these young fellows have the skills or the aptitudes to take over all these jobs. So I would like to recommend to our school and university officials; to [...] 2 - our legislators in Congress, in the State, to the county commissioners and to the City Council that they find the money to make available the facilities needed for training. I think you would find the employers, the unions and the public willing to do their part and carry their share. It would mean that the present vocational facilities at Macomber and the University of Toledo would have to be expanded° I read that school officials in 5 counties in this area have gotten together to open a vocational school at the Rossford Erie Depot. What would be wrong with the employers forming a joint committee with the teachers and the labor unions and making up a flexible training program so these youngsters could be able to fill all the openings in the plants and elsewhere. And why not follow a program such as the UAW skilled trades which I directed combining training in the school with that on the job. I would recommend that once a fellow signs up for this training he has to finish the course and can't bid on some higher paid opening which might come up while hews learning. The youngsters today have to learn that it's not the quick or easy buck that counts but the ability and willingness to learn skills or trades that will stick with him a lifetime and give him the chance to get a job anytime, any place while the untrained worker is automated out of a livelihood. I could go on for a lot more but I think these points are important. I am willing to help in this in any way I can [...] . up to the limits of my resources. In closing I think I should say I deeply appreciate your coming and the sentiments that were expressed. I want to assure everyone that I shall continue to make any contribution I can to help people so long as I can draw a breath [...] - 3 -...|$|E

40|$|Since 2003, Children’s Services {{have sought}} to promote more {{consolidated}} work by professionals of different disciplinary backgrounds who might otherwise follow independent forms of practice. This is believed to enhance efficacy and reduce inequality in providing for vulnerable children (Boddy, Potts, & Statham, 2006; DCSF, 2003). Evidence that this improves child outcomes is mixed, however. Professionals may have difficulties working together effectively, for example Anning, Cottrell, <b>Frost,</b> <b>Green,</b> & Robinson (2006) and Sloper (2004). This research presents a qualitative study into the decision-making processes of a Children’s Services multi-disciplinary team (MDT) of educational, health and social care professionals. The study explores which aspects of the MDT strengthen and undermine collaborative work, and how this influences child assessment outcomes. The study was exploratory, using Constructivist Grounded Theory (CGT) analysis of the recorded discussions of professionals concerning six preschool child cases. All six children were referred with neurodevelopment difficulties. The transcripts revealed a fragmentary MDT with a singular, medical model approach to practice, which in this particular situation, averted collaborative working. The established context for the operation of decision-making was in the professionals’ referral system, whereby a Child Assessment ‘pathway’ functioned. Decision-making comprised System routines, Weighing-up significance, Expediency including Centralisation and Convenience, Continuation of Function, and Avoidance of Difficulty/Unpleasantness. Use of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) cut-off score to diagnose autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was an outcome of the decision-making process. Discussions revealed that once such decisions were made, they remained unchanged. Psychoanalytically informed concepts (Hollway, 2011) were used in analyses. This enabled a framework of understanding for professionals’ work, {{as well as for}} promoting organisational development and change...|$|R

It’s the same with a superficial and complete reversal of a ley. One strategy would be to till soil superficially (= 3 - 4 cm for example) with crow's feet or cultivator blades to dry vegetation, then moving a disc harrow plow, which, even without causing complete reversal would leave behind a "clean" field.

50|$|Poet Robert Frost was a {{sometimes}} resident of Amherst from 1917 {{until his death}} in 1963. He formed a friendship with Charles Green, the first director of the library: <b>Frost</b> said that <b>Green</b> was “the first person who thought he was worth collecting”. By the time he retired as curator of the Robert Frost collection in 1966, Green had collected over 60 manuscripts, more than 25 shelves of published material by or about Frost, and a large compilation of newspaper clippings, photographs and periodicals.|$|R
50|$|During his collegiate career, Green {{compiled}} 3,880 {{rushing yards}} and 42 touchdowns, both totals good {{for second place}} on the Cornhuskers' all-time list. He also posted 300 receiving {{yards and three touchdowns}} on 35 catches. Green's most memorable collegiate performance was on January 2, 1998 in the Orange Bowl. He rushed for an Orange Bowl record 206 yards and two touchdowns in Nebraska's 42-17 victory over third ranked Tennessee, breaking the previous 20-year-old record of 205 yards held by Arkansas running back Roland Sales. The tandem of Scott <b>Frost</b> and <b>Green</b> easily outperformed Tennessee's offensive stars: Peyton Manning, Jamal Lewis and Peerless Price. The exceedingly lopsided and decisive nature of this victory contrasted sharply with the also unbeaten Michigan Wolverines' close Rose Bowl victory over the Ryan Leaf's Washington State squad. The discrepancy between the bowl game performances of these two undefeated teams allowed Nebraska to rally from behind in the polls, where Nebraska had fallen behind Michigan after Nebraska's close overtime victory over Missouri, and claim a share of the national title. The performance marked the Cornhuskers' record-setting third national championship in four years.|$|R

[...] This autumnal coloring has been characterized as not simply a flame, but a conflagration. [...] Its reds and yellows compare {{to that of the}} maples (Acer), and in addition it has the dark purples and smoky browns of the ash (Fraxinus). [...] However, {{in the northern part of}} its range, and where planted in yet colder areas, the leaves are often killed by <b>frost</b> while still <b>green.</b> [...] On the other hand, in the extreme southern or tropical parts of its range, some trees are evergreen or semi-evergreen, with negligible fall color. The leaves are three to seven inches broad with glandular serrate teeth. [...] The base is truncate or slightly heart-shaped. [...] They come out of the bud plicate, downy, pale green, when full grown are bright green, smooth, shining above, paler beneath. They contain tannin and when bruised give a resinous fragrance.|$|R
5000|$|While the Custom is {{currently}} only available in ebony, {{it is often}} offered in Alpine White, Wine Red, Cherry Sunburst and Silverburst as well. The Custom model differs from the Les Paul Standard in many ways. The cosmetic differences include gold hardware (though silverburst Customs have chrome hardware); block inlays on the fretboard rather than the trapezoid inlays of the Standard (with an inlay at the 1st fret, whereas the Standard has none); a [...] "split-diamond" [...] pearl inlay on the headstock; and multi-ply binding around the body and headstock (the neck retains single-ply binding). The construction differences are a physically larger headstock; an ebony, maple or richlite fretboard, both of which tend to sound [...] "snappier" [...] (acoustically) than the rosewood fingerboard found on the Les Paul Standard; lower frets with more squared off tops (though lower than the frets on a Standard, today's production Custom does not have [...] "Fretless Wonder" [...] frets) and larger round [...] "speed" [...] style knobs (though other knob types can be seen depending on the year and model). Gibson also does limited color runs, such as Pelham Blue, <b>Frost</b> Blue, Kerry <b>Green,</b> transparent colors, metallic colors and sunbursts that are not typically offered on a normal Custom. The hardware for these models can be either gold or chrome, depending on the color/specs. Starting in 2011, Gibson began to reintroduce maple fingerboards to the Custom, offering limited runs in the traditional colors, as well as transparent colors with figured tops.|$|R
