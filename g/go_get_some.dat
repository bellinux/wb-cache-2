5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a {{cauldron}} large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to <b>go</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E
2500|$|George becomes {{engaged to}} Susan Biddle Ross, a wealthy {{executive}} at NBC who approved his and Jerry's show-within-a-show sitcom pilot. George and Susan date for a year, {{during which time}} commitment-phobic George is constantly {{trying to find ways}} to end their relationship without actually having to initiate the breakup with her. In [...] "The Engagement", he proposes to her in a short-lived bout of midlife crisis, after he and Jerry make a pact to move forward with their lives. When Jerry breaks up with his girlfriend almost immediately thereafter for eating [...] "her peas one at a time" [...] and declares the deal over, George panics and again tries repeatedly to weasel out of his engagement. He gets his wish about 2 weeks before the wedding in [...] "The Invitations", when he inadvertently kills her by selecting cheap envelopes for their wedding invitations, not knowing they contained toxic glue. When notified of her death at the hospital, George displays a combination of shock, apathy and relief (later described by the doctor in Part 2 of The Finale as [...] "restrained jubilation"). A few moments after being notified of Susan's death, he says to Jerry, Kramer and Elaine, [...] "Well, let's <b>go</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> coffee." [...] Susan's parents, recent divorcees, never knowing the specifics behind her poisoning but suspecting that George was somehow involved, never forgive him for this, and appoint him {{to the board of directors}} of the Susan Ross Foundation to keep him trapped under their influence and ensure that he'd never get any of Susan's inheritance.|$|E
