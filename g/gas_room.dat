50|$|The {{group made}} a number of {{appearances}} on the Toronto club scene throughout the early part of 1967, performing at notable venues like Boris', the Red <b>Gas</b> <b>Room</b> and the Gogue Inn and sharing the stage with local bands like Jon and Lee & The Checkmates and The Paupers. By June, Pendrith had moved on to play with Livingstone's Journey and the Catch continued without him for a while.|$|E
50|$|With {{its more}} {{experimental}} approach to performance, The Tripp began {{to perform at}} more colourful venues like Boris’ Red <b>Gas</b> <b>Room,</b> the Devil's Den, the Flick and the Syndicate Club. Pianist Richard Bell from Ritchie Knight & The Mid-Knights briefly augmented the group in early 1967 but soon moved on to Ronnie Hawkins & The Hawks (and years later, Janis Joplin’s backing group Full Tilt Boogie and later The Band).|$|E
5000|$|In late August, {{the group}} {{relocated}} to Toronto, playing Boris’ Red <b>Gas</b> <b>Room</b> in the city's Yorkville Village on September 2, 1967. They then performed regularly at the venue {{over the next}} two months before travelling to New York during November to record an album for ABC Records at Bell Studios with producer Dennis Minogue (aka Terry Cashman). Released in January 1968, the album included the mini-opera 'Mad Birds of Prey', which was [...] "more echoes of [...] Weill's [...] Threepenny Opera than of anything around in rock".|$|E

50|$|Brought {{together}} around May 1967 by musical entrepreneur Bernie Finkelstein, the Market debuted at the Night Owl on June 4 {{and performed}} initially in Toronto coffeehouses {{such as the}} Red <b>Gas</b> <b>Room,</b> and high schools. In mid-August, after the dissolution of Luke & The Apostles, the Market recruited Luke Gibson by which time they had already released two singles for Stone Records. These singles achieved minimal success but Finkelstein was able to sign them to Warner Brothers in New York City. In 1968, the Market did the soundtrack to the NFB film The Ernie Game. Later that year, they released the album Avenue Road, produced by Felix Pappalardi, followed by {{a tour of the}} United States. In 1969, keyboardist John Mills-Cockell joined, and their follow-up, Aardvark, was released, once again produced by Pappalardi, followed by their second US tour. However, this wasn't done in enough time to save the splintering band who split that same year.|$|E

40|$|In-situ {{observation}} {{is important to}} reveal real properties of materials. Especially, for catalysts, analysis during reaction is quite essential. Recently, “environmental-cell (E-cell) electron microscopy ” technique, which enables gas introduction around specimens, has been investigated actively[1]. The authors also have tried to develop the “closed-type ” E-cell transmission electron microscope (TEM), aiming for the real condition, i. e. atmosphere pressure. In addition, high-resolution is tried to be simultaneously achieved, since our target is nano-size gold particle catalysts[2]. In the paper, we demonstrate potentials of our developed E-cell TEM system to observe dynamics of catalytic gold nano-particles, and report that the shape change of gold nano-particle were {{for the first time}} observed during oxidation reaction. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of our E-cell TEM system. This consists of two developed apparatuses equipped with a conventional 200 kV-TEM (H- 8000, Hitachi). One is a closed-type E-cell specimen holder (see Fig. 2). This has a small <b>gas</b> <b>room,</b> called the E-cell, at its top and two pipes for the gas in/out. The gas in the E-cell is separated from vacuum with ultra-thin carbon films. The films are most important components of this system, because they have to both withstand the gas pressure and pass the electron beam easily for high-resolution. From thi...|$|E

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{describes how}} exhaust fan 6 (EF- 6) and exhaust fan 7 (EF- 7) are controlled and monitored. Since these two fans are a vital {{link in the}} ODH safety system, they will be monitored, controlled and periodically operated by the programmable logic controller (PLC). If {{there should be a}} fault in the ventilation system, the PLC will print a warning message to the cryo control room printer and flash a descriptive warning on the ODH/ventilation graphics page. This fault is also logged to the Xpresslink graphics alarm page and to an alarm history hard disk file. The ventilation failure is also an input to the auto dialer which will continue it's automatic sequence until acknowledged. EF- 6 delivers 13000 C. F. M. and is considered emergency ventilation. EF- 7 delivers 4500 C. F. M. and will run 24 hrs a day. Both ventilation fans are located in an enclosed closet in the TRD <b>gas</b> <b>room.</b> Their ductwork, both inlets and outlets run along side the pipe chase, but are separated by an airtight wall.

The surveys are, therefore, very specific in nature and the subjects covered diverse. The Data Archive holds 19 such surveys. Readers are asked to note that, {{with the exception of the}} surveys on the Telephone Service - 69004, 69016, respondents surveyed are self selected from subscribers to the Association's magazine Which? and so the surveys cannot singly be used in descriptive accounts of the British public. Surveys 69005 - 69012 cover various aspects of the housing experiences of Which? readers who moved house in 1967 and 1968. It is here particularly important to remember that the choice strategies and the resources of Which? readers are unlikely to be typical. Main Topics : A comprehensive study covering: a) solid fuel, gas or oil boilers that heat hot water radiators or convectors; b) electric, solid fuel, gas or oil heaters that supply warm air to more than one room through ducts(c) solid fuel or <b>gas</b> <b>room</b> heaters with high output back boilers that heat radiators; d) electric underfloor heating; and e) electric ceiling heating. Information includes: brand name; type; performance and capacity of heater; pump; time controls; pipes; radiators etc.; type and source of fuel (e. g. off-peak electricity, name of oil company etc.) together with any difficulties in obtaining fuels. Data is also included on installation of system (including finance).

40|$|In 2010, Rural Development, Inc. (RDI) {{completed}} {{construction of}} Wisdom Way Solar Village (WWSV), {{a community of}} ten duplexes (20 homes) in Greenfield, MA. RDI was committed to very low energy use {{from the beginning of}} the design process throughout construction. Key features include: 1. Careful site plan so that all homes have solar access (for active and passive); 2. Cellulose insulation providing R- 40 walls, R- 50 ceiling, and R- 40 floors; 3. Triple-pane windows; 4. Airtight construction (~ 0. 1 CFM 50 /ft 2 enclosure area); 5. Solar water heating systems with tankless, gas, auxiliary heaters; 6. PV systems (2. 8 or 3. 4 kWSTC); 7. 2 - 4 bedrooms, 1, 100 - 1, 700 ft 2. The design heating loads in the homes were so small that each home is heated with a single, sealed-combustion, natural <b>gas</b> <b>room</b> heater. The cost savings from the simple HVAC systems made possible the tremendous investments in the homes' envelopes. The Consortium for Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) monitored temperatures and comfort in several homes during the winter of 2009 - 2010. In the Spring of 2011, CARB obtained utility bill information from 13 occupied homes. Because of efficient lights, appliances, and conscientious home occupants, the energy generated by the solar electric systems exceeded the electric energy used in most homes. Most homes, in fact, had a net credit from the electric utility over the course of a year. On the natural gas side, total gas costs averaged $ 377 per year (for heating, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying). Total energy costs were even less - $ 337 per year, including all utility fees. The highest annual energy bill for any home evaluated was $ 458; the lowest was $ 171...|$|E
