5|$|There are two passive {{treatment}} {{systems in}} the Mahanoy Creek watershed by the Mahanoy Creek Watershed Association. Coal mining <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the watershed since the 19th century and continues to some extent in the 21st century.

5|$|During the {{development}} of these algorithms and tables, it was recognized that a successful algorithm could be used to replace the existing collection of incompatible tables for various air and Nitrox diving modes currently in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual with a set of mutually compatible decompression tables based on a single model, which was proposed by Gerth and Doolette in 2007. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> Revision 6 of the US Navy Diving Manual published in 2008, though some changes were made.|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> {{many parts}} of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.|$|E

5|$|North Mahanoy Creek {{starts in}} unpolluted springs on Locust Mountain and meets the main stem in Mahanoy City. There are strip mines in this tributary's {{watershed}}. Shenandoah Creek, whose tributaries include Kehley Run and Lost Creek, also begins on Locust Mountain and its watershed has {{an area of}} 11.6 square miles. Shenandoah Creek is contaminated by sewage and mine drainage. The tributary Little Mahanoy Creek starts in Frackville and its watershed has an area of 11.6 square miles. No mining <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> this watershed.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Nanticoke Creek {{is mainly}} forested, but urban land and mining land are also present. The city of Nanticoke is partially in the watershed and many unincorporated communities are there as well. The creek {{is named after}} the Nanticoke tribe, but was historically known as Muddy Run before appearing on maps with its present name by 1776. Extensive mining, both underground and on the surface, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the creek's watershed. Numerous passive and active treatment systems have been installed in the watershed in recent times.|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} of secular music, Josquin left {{numerous}} French chansons, for from three to six voices, {{as well as a}} handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.|$|E

5|$|Mining <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the Solomon Creek {{watershed}} in the past, causing considerable environmental damage. The mining {{began in}} the beginning of the 1800s and continued until the 1970s. However, there was one strip mining permit in the watershed in the late 1990s. Starting in 1967, the mine pools under the creek stopped having water pumped out of them. This led to them flooding and damaging buildings in the watershed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes. To remedy the problem of the flooding, the Buttonwood Tunnel and three boreholes known as the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes were created. The water quality of the creek was assessed in 1970 as part of Operation Scarlift. A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed, although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining. A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012.|$|E

25|$|The House of Freedoms' {{proposal}} of constitutional reform <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> a unilateral way - no {{agreement with the}} opposition, whereas the current Italian Constitution was written after World War II by all the national political forces (except the fascists), ranging from Liberals, to Christian Democrats, to Socialists, to Communists and others. According to the House of Freedom, this policy was adopted in order to correct the constitutional reform approved by the former centre-left majority in 2001 (Constitutional law 3/2001) with the same modus - no agreement with the opposition. However, the new reform deeply modifies constitutional system of Italy, while the 2001 reform just partially modified {{a section of the}} Constitution.|$|E
