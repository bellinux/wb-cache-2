After World War II, there was a large <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining industry. From 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek. One of these stations, which was in use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, which was in use from 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{economic}} shock created by Britain's decision to join the EEC in 1973, removing it as New Zealand's primary market for exports, unemployment in New Zealand was very low. The official number of people unemployed in 1959 was only 21. A year later it was 22. A recession and collapse in wool prices in 1966 led to unemployment rising by 131%, but was still only a 0.7% <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment.</b>|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} the {{economic}} effects of introducing minimum wage legislation in Germany in January 2015, recent developments {{have shown that the}} feared <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> has not materialized, however, in some economic sectors and regions of the country, it came to a decline in job opportunities particularly for temporary and part-time workers, and some low-wage jobs have disappeared entirely. Because of this overall positive development, the Deutsche Bundesbank revised its opinion, and ascertained that “the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on the total volume of work appears to be very limited in the present business cycle”.|$|E
25|$|The <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> {{was largely}} due to the government's {{economic}} policy which resulted in the closure of outdated factories and coal pits. Manufacturing in England and Wales declined from around 38% of jobs in 1961 to around 22% in 1981. This process continued for most of the 1980s, with newer industries and the service sector enjoying significant growth. Many jobs were also lost as manufacturing became more efficient and fewer people were required to work in the sector. Unemployment had fallen below 3million by the time of Thatcher's third successive election victory in June 1987 {{and by the end of}} 1989 it was down to 1.6million.|$|E

However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster. Nevertheless, the rate of <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> was slowing down by 1983 and was making some progress against national and regional trends.|$|E

A {{discussion of the}} relative importance of structural <b>unemployment</b> <b>in</b> total <b>unemployment</b> is done using NAIRU estimates for a panel of OECD countries.

The analysis focuses on the 1999 - 2008 period, characterized by relatively stable growth. Findings show that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates variability by occupation are associated with a decrease <b>in</b> NAIRU, while <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates variability by industry have the opposite effect. <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> institutional factors variables lead to higher NAIRU, while economic factors do not have a significant effect...|$|R

This debate emerged, in particular, {{from the}} {{observation}} that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> <b>in</b> most advanced markets {{were found to be}} larger than those expected under the Law. Some studies associated this fact with changes in productivity (Gordon 2010; Daly and Hobijn 2010) and others have put forward the argument of jobless recoveries (Jaimovich and Siu 2012; ILO 2014), acknowledging deviations from Okun’s Law.|$|R
25|$|Thatcher's {{modernisation}} of {{the economy}} was far from trouble-free; her battle with inflation, which in 1980 had risen to 21.9%, resulted in a substantial <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> from 5.3% in 1979 to over 10.4% by the start of 1982, peaking at nearly 11.9% in 1984 – a level not seen in Britain since the Great Depression. The rise in unemployment coincided with the early 1980s global recession, after which UK GDP did not reach its pre-recession rate until 1983. In spite of this, Thatcher was re-elected in June 1983 with a landslide majority. Inflation had fallen to 3.7%, while interest rates were relatively high at 9.56%.|$|E
25|$|These {{reforms were}} highly {{controversial}} at the time, {{and the government}} also {{had to deal with}} a rapid <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> as well as public deficits during 1991 and 1992. The period was marked by a severe economic crisis. These problems were reinforced by the economic crisis in other European countries and the crisis within the EU Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. As a result, Sweden in November 1992 was forced to abandon its policy of a fixed exchange rate and allow the Swedish crown to float freely. As part of the effort to handle the economic crisis, the government was able to conclude an agreement with the Social Democratic opposition on some of its expenditure-cutting measures.|$|E

In particular, while the unemployment rate of younger women declined substantially in the observation period, the estimated AME for older women implies an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>unemployment</b> rate by about 5  percentage points. Given the relatively low unemployment rate of older women in East Germany at the beginning of the observation period, these estimates imply that age differentials <b>in</b> female <b>unemployment</b> have been reduced in recent years, but remain substantial.|$|R
25|$|Although {{periphery}} {{nations are}} exploited by core countries, {{there is a}} purpose to the unequal exchanges of goods. For instance, the core countries {{have an incentive to}} gain a profit and this enables the world market to further grow. At times, there is a change in the balance of trade between the periphery and core countries. This occurs when the prices of exports from periphery countries decrease at a faster rate than the exports from core nations. In this case, the governments of the periphery nation are affected in several ways. For instance, there is an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment</b> as well as a decrease in state income. This type of interaction is unique because the core country involved is somewhat weaker than normal. An example of this occurring is the growth of the industrial capabilities of Italy and Russia {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. This has also occurred in other periphery nations such as Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.|$|E

In 1974 the IS was ambitious and optimistic expecting to double the number of its factory branches over the next year. In practice they declined swiftly from 38 in 1974 to only three or four by 1976. When the firefighters went on strike in 1977 against the Social Contract the IS was unable to deliver any significant solidarity. The national rank and file movement fell apart. In 1976 the SWP decided to stand in parliamentary by-elections but the results were very poor and the original idea of standing in 60 seats at the next election was dropped.|$|E
25|$|Brown et al. (1983) {{noted that}} time series studies {{to that point}} had found that for a 10 percent {{increase}} in the minimum wage, there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1–3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 {{percent increase in the}} minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate.

Among this macroeconomic situation, large changes have been occurring within the Japanese economy that has changed the role of the working woman in Japan. Radical changes in government policies and focus has resulted in increased social care and the creation of dual-sector employment, which have affected female employment and the working housewife. Challenges to the dominant male breadwinner model has led to changing social perspectives on the traditional role of the wife in providing familial care, although discrimination and stereotypes remain rampant.

2500|$|From {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s onward, {{classical}} revolutionary orthodox Marxists like Henryk Grossmann, Louis C.

This results in a crisis of overaccumulation (or a shortage of surplus value), and consequently a drop in new productive investment, causing an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>unemployment.</b> This, in turn, leads to a wave of takeovers and mergers to restore profitable production, plus a higher intensity of labor exploitation. In the end, however, {{after a lot of}} cycles, capitalism collapses. This contrasted with V.I. Lenin’s idea that in the crises of bourgeois society [...] "there {{is no such thing as}} an absolutely hopeless situation", since the bourgeoisie can – in principle – always find a way out. Lenin regarded the abolition of capitalism as a conscious political act, not as a spontaneous result of the breakdown of the economy. In 1931, two years after publishing his breakdown theory, Grossman qualified his idea more, emphasizing that he did not believe that capitalism had to collapse [...] "by itself" [...] or [...] "automatically"; the objective law of breakdown had to be combined with the subjective factor of the class struggle.|$|E
