5|$|One morning Josh {{witnesses}} Arthur Shaw, {{a wealthy}} Tower resident, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains that Shaw {{was attempting to}} flee the country and avoid arrest for embezzling $2 billion in a Ponzi scheme. Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts suicide by stepping {{in front of a}} train, but survives. After visiting Lester in the hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw expresses condolences, but is not sincere enough when <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> to ask if Lester is all right, and out of anger, Josh smashes the windows of the 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso displayed in Shaw's apartment. Josh's boss, Mr. Simon, fires him for his actions, as well as Charlie and Enrique.|$|E
5|$|After sending Meg out on {{an errand}} {{to pick up her}} grandfather, Lois {{continues}} to seduce Anthony, having been interested in him since Peter had begun insulting her about her advancing age. Quickly returning after forgetting the car keys, Meg discovers her mother making out with her new boyfriend on the couch. The bass jingle used extensively in the long-running NBC sitcom Seinfeld is then heard, with the scene pausing, before transitioning to the Jolly Farm studio. In a surprise visit to the Griffin family home, Julie unexpectedly appears when Stewie opens the front door. Expecting Julie to recognize him, <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> that he is not dressed as Karina, causing him to hurriedly change clothing, while pretending to have an argument with his fabricated persona. A similar scene is featured in the 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire, starring actor Robin Williams. Stewie and Jolly Farm make a reference to Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747–100 destroyed by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 occupants. Large portions of the plane fell onto Lockerbie, which killed 11 people, escalating the death toll to 270. A song features on Jolly Farm that explicitly describes debris from the newly disintegrated plane falling into Lockerbie, sung in the fashion of that of a nursery rhyme.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, John's {{father is}} so excited that the beast is dead that <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> {{to release the}} hound and rushes out to congratulate his son. John cannot bear to kill his father and so, after they meet, the hound is {{released}} and dutifully dispatched. But {{it is too late}} and nine generations of Lambtons are cursed so they shall not die peacefully in their beds. Thus, the story ends.|$|E

25|$|But Virgil {{is still}} furious, and {{continues}} to berate the Emperor about class snobbery which he sees as the reason Holenia tried to drown the pups. He is so angry that <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> Johanna is standing there listening and tells the Emperor he never should have agreed to give up Johanna to save her from a commoner's life with him. Johanna realises what Virgil has done and forgives him, and tells the Emperor that better she take one chance in a million of a happy life with Virgil, than no chance at all with someone she cannot love. The Emperor agrees to let Virgil and Johanna wed.|$|E
25|$|Darius Just had {{previously}} helped novice writer Giles Devore produce a breakthrough novel. Just credits himself with ruthlessly editing Devore's original drafts and forcing the young author to turn an incoherent mess into a masterwork. Having gained {{fame and fortune}} with his first book, a bestseller, Devore attends the ABA convention to promote his second book, which he wrote without Just's help. Just volunteers to run an errand for Devore – collecting a parcel for him and taking it to his hotel room – but <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> to do so until the next day. Entering Devore's hotel room, Just discovers Devore dead in the bathroom, apparently having slipped in the shower and hit {{his head on the}} faucets. Others take this to be a tragic accident and nothing more, but Just suspects murder, based on Devore's compulsive tidiness and the disarray in which Just found the room. He interviews Devore's ex-wife, who tells him that the parcel contained Devore's monogrammed pens.|$|E
25|$|Biologist Professor Nathan Garrett is {{the direct}} {{descendant}} of Sir Percy, and found Sir Percy's tomb and the Ebony Blade. Garrett's evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, {{and he is}} shunned by Sir Percy's ghost. An embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology and genetic engineers and creates a winged horse. Calling himself the Black Knight, Garrett embarks {{on a life of}} crime to spite his ancestor. After a battle with the hero Giant-Man Garrett joins the supervillain team the Masters of Evil at the request of master villain Baron Zemo and like the others spreads Adhesive X over the city, but is first defeated by Thor. After two unsuccessful battles with the Avengers, on the second time he was broken out of jail by the Enchantress, and a time when he battled Iron Man due to Doctor Doom's mind-control machine to make supervillains attack Mister Fantastic's and the Invisible Woman's wedding, (which <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> like the other villains due to a machine created by Mister Fantastic). Garrett is mortally wounded while trying to kill the superhero Iron Man when he falls off his winged horse. A dying Garrett summons his nephew, Dane Whitman, reveals his secret identity to Whitman, and repents for his life of crime. Whitman then adopts the identity of the Black Knight himself.|$|E

Buster Bear was busy too. He swept his long tongue this way, and he swept it that way, and each time he drew it back into his mouth, it was covered with ants. At last Old Mr. Toad couldn't hold another ant. Then he remembered Buster Bear and looked up a little fearfully. Buster was smacking his lips, and there was a twinkle in each eye.|$|R

500|$|Bush's music, {{at least}} from the mid-1930s, often carried {{political}} overtones. His obituarist Rupert Christiansen writes that, as a principled Marxist, Bush [...] "put the requirements of the revolutionary proletariat {{at the head of the}} composer's responsibilities", a choice which others, such as Tippett, chose not to make. [...] However, Vaughan Williams thought that, despite Bush's oft-declared theories of the purposes of art and music, [...] "when the inspiration comes over him <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> all about this and remembers only the one eternal rule for all artists, 'To thine own self be true'." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said that Jackson's {{skills as a}} {{musician}} are often forgotten, but noted that the album seemed too long compared to other Jackson albums. While Christgau felt some material was [...] "offensive", he described the album's first three tracks as being the [...] "Rodney Jerkins of the year" [...] adding {{that he did not}} [...] "believe the [...] hype matters". Nikki Tranter of PopMatters said that it is both innovative and meaningful because exceptional songs such as [...] "The Lost Children" [...] and [...] "Whatever Happens" [...] more than make up for overly sentimental songs like [...] "Heaven Can Wait" [...] and [...] "You Are My Life". Q magazine said that it is an aurally interesting, albeit inconsistent, album. In a negative review for The New York Times, Jon Pareles suggested that the album is somewhat impersonal and humorless, as Jackson rehashes ideas from his past songs and is [...] "so busy trying to dazzle listeners that <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> to have any fun." [...] In a retrospective review for The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Pareles said that Invincible showed Jackson had lost his suave quality to [...] "grim calculation".|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Homer discovers that all of his white shirts have turned pink because Bart put his red hat in with the laundry. [...] Homer {{has no choice but}} to wear a pink shirt to work and as a result, his co-workers poke fun at him. [...] Mr. Burns suspects him of being a [...] "free-thinking anarchist". [...] Homer is sent home with a 20-question psychiatric quiz that he has to fill in so that Dr. Marvin Monroe can assess his sanity. [...] Homer is too lazy to finish the quiz on his own and lets Bart fill it in. [...] When Dr. Monroe sees the results, he determines that Homer is insane. [...] Homer is sent to a mental institution, and is put in a cell with a large white man who seems to believe he is Michael Jackson (referred to as [...] "the big white guy who thinks he's the little black guy"), and who introduces himself as such. [...] Being unfamiliar with the real Michael Jackson, Homer believes and quickly befriends him.|$|E

When Karl makes a potentially dangerous mistake on a prescription form, Rhys covers for him, but makes it clear he wants something in return. Knowing Karl plays golf with Martin, Rhys asks to join their game so he can try and impress the surgeon. Despite being warned that Martin does not like to talk shop during his golf games, Rhys reveals that he has been following his career and Martin is impressed. Barber explained to a writer for Inside Soap [...] "And Karl {{has no choice but to}} agree that Rhys is a good doctor. It's a bit awkward, because Karl doesn't like the way Rhys operates— so to speak!" [...] Martin grants Rhys an interview for a place on the surgical program; however <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> everything he knows and makes a fool of himself due to being hungover. Rhys misses out on a place on the program and Barber told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he is feeling [...] "devastated and desperate."

500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Peter discovers that his past actions have had drastic effects on the world: he and Molly {{have been married for}} 20 years; Judd Nelson crashes at their house once or twice a week; Lois is married to Quagmire; Al Gore is now the President of the United States; Chris, Meg, and Stewie have Quagmire's chin, nose, and mannerisms; and Chevy Chase is the host of The Tonight Show. Brian {{explains}} to Peter that by missing out on his date with Lois and making out with Molly, he altered the time line. Despite Brian's objections about leaving the [...] "perfect" [...] world (in which there are flying cars that run on vegetable oil and Gore has killed Osama bin Laden by strangling him with his bare hands), Peter wants {{to go back to the}} past so he can undo his mistake. Brian says that this is impossible because Death can only be summoned if someone dies and thanks to Gore's universal health care, people are living much longer along with a strong, well-funded educational system and zero tolerance gun control that has eliminated street crime. However, when Jane Jetson suddenly falls on the sidewalk and dies, Death arrives and again grants Peter's wish to return to the past. Back in the past, Peter is determined to accept Lois' invitation but repeatedly blows his opportunity and ends up repeatedly asking Death for a do-over. When Peter finally gets it right, <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> a few hours later and parties with Cleveland instead of keeping the date. He asks Death for another chance but Death, fed up with Peter's continued blunders, tells him that he will have to fix the problem on his own.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore and {{his wife}} both {{appeared}} in supporting roles in the 1939 screwball comedy Midnight, her only film role. The New York Times thought the film was [...] "one of the liveliest, gayest, wittiest and naughtiest comedies of a long hard season" [...] and that Barrymore, [...] "the [...] Gehrig of eye-brow batting, rolls his phrases with his usual richly humorous effect". The film {{was inducted into the}} National Film Registry in 2013. Barrymore {{and his wife}} appeared together in the stage farce My Dear Children, which opened in March 1939 at Princeton University's McCarter Theatre. He played the lead role, Allan Manville, an ageing hammy Shakespearean has-been. Because of his failing memory, Barrymore ad-libbed constantly throughout the show. In some points the new additions were an improvement, but he also greeted friends in the audience, and used profanities freely. Nevertheless, the show was a success. Life magazine wrote that [...] "People flock to see , not for polished performance, but because he converts the theater into a rowdy histrionic madhouse. Sometimes he arrives late. Sometimes he is tight. Usually <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> his lines. But he always puts on a great show." [...] When the show reached Broadway, Life wrote that [...] "Barrymore's return to Times Square was a huge professional triumph". Brooks Atkinson, writing for The New York Times thought that Barrymore was [...] "still the most gifted actor in this country.... Although he has recklessly played the fool for a number of years, he is nobody's fool in My Dear Children but a superbly gifted actor on a tired holiday." [...] Barrymore and his wife continued to argue during the play's run, and she left the play part way through the tour. They attempted a reconciliation when the production reached New York, but the couple divorced in late 1940.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - {{and it is the}} old, old story. She takes her tiny daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as he reads the announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he comes out of it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day <b>he</b> <b>forgets</b> his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears the clatter of hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and his hand is stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!" ...|$|E
