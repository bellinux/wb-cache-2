40|$|I use {{data from}} the South African Social <b>Giving</b> Survey <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the role of social capital and motivations for <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> formal charities and beggars. Results suggest that both impure altruism and inequality aversion positively influence <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> formal charities {{but they have no}} influence on <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> beggars. The role of social capital is varied. Members of informal insurance groups are more likely <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> both charities and beggars, while members of formal community groups are more likely <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> charities only. Members of interest groups are actually less likely to donate to charities and prefer <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> beggars...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} effect, if any, of tax credit legislation for contributions to higher education in Indiana, Michigan, and North Dakota. Secondary purposes were twofold: 1) to discover differences in patterns of <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> public and private institutions of higher education, and 2) to compare existing tax credit laws and develop recommendations for model legislation. Data, collected from published journals and reports of private and governmental agencies, were subjected to analyses for consistency and compatibility in order to assure validity in interpretation. All dollar amounts were converted to 1967 Constant Dollar Values for analysis. Data for voluntary giving in areas of business and corporate giving, non-alumni giving, giving by other groups, and alumni giving for individual institutions were compared with composite national data for <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> higher education. Findings 1. Annual reports of voluntary <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> higher education have presented raw data reflecting a growth of 40 percent for 1970 - 1977, when converted to real dollar purchasing power, a loss in excess of 8 percent is documented. 2. Growth in voluntary <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> institutions studied exceeded growth on a national basis; growth in <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> public institutions far exceeding growth in <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> private institutions. 3. Voluntary <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> higher education by business and industry has declined during a period when growth would have been expected. 4. Tax credit legislation is possible in all states. Conclusions 1. Voluntary <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> higher education in Indiana, Michigan, and Forth Dakota, states having tax credits for gifts to higher education, increased at rates demonstrably greater than the rate of increase for the national composite. 2. Growth in voluntary <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> higher education was directly related to length of time the tax credit law has been in effect. Implications 1. Voluntary <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> higher education is directly related to fund raising campaign efforts causing wide fluctuations in year-to-year levels of giving. 2. Growth in voluntary <b>giving</b> <b>to</b> higher education using a tax credit is related to awareness, a component of fund raising campaigns. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the creek and its watershed.

Another Growing Greener grant, this one for $68,225, was <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Marple Township for a streambank stabilization project on the creek. Additionally, a $1000 grant from the Pennsylvania Watershed Restoration Assistance Program was <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Delco Anglers and Conservationists for riparian improvement of the creek and several other creeks. In 1997, a $60,000 grant was <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the Darby Creek Valley Association and DelCo Anglers and Conservationists for developing a conservation plan. The grant was provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Darby Creek Valley Association is an organization whose purpose is to preserve and improve the creek's watershed. It has approximately 100 members.|$|E
