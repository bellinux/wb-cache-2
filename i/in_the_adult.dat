5|$|A specific, {{recognizable}} {{feature of}} Purkinje neurons is {{the expression of}} calbindin. Calbindin staining of rat brain after unilateral chronic sciatic nerve injury suggests that Purkinje neurons may be newly generated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> brain, initiating the organization of new cerebellar lobules.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{originally}} believed that neurons could not regenerate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> brain, neurogenesis {{has been shown to}} occur in mammalian brains, including those of primates.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{generally recognized}} that the number of neurons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> brain (roughly 100 billion) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that memories were generally not the result of new neuron production. With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.|$|E

5|$|Vascular {{cells are}} known to play a {{prominent}} role in regulating proliferation of adult neural precursors. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> subgranular zone (SGZ), dense clusters of dividing cells were found to be anatomically close to the vasculature, especially capillaries. Contacts between adult SVZ neuronal precursors and blood vessels are unusually permeable and frequently devoid of astrocyte and pericyte interferences, suggesting that blood-derived cues are gaining direct access to adult neural precursors and their progeny. The vasculature also provides the substrate for new neuron migration after injury <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> striatum.|$|E

5|$|While mandibles or 'jaws' (chewing mouthparts) {{are only}} {{present in the}} {{caterpillar}} stage, the mouthparts of most adult Lepidoptera mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part {{is known as the}} proboscis or 'haustellum'.

5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E

5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|Browerian mimicry, {{named after}} Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower, is a {{postulated}} form of automimicry; where the model {{belongs to the}} same species as the mimic. This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the monarch and the queen from the Danainae subfamily, which feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> (imago) form. As levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage, some individuals are more toxic than others. Less palatable organisms, therefore, mimic more dangerous individuals, with their likeness already perfected.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult.</b> Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E

5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E

The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution.

5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish.

Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
