5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has <b>done</b> <b>things</b> so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{attracted}} ridicule. He {{was strongly}} criticised by “The Morning Post” (“a costly blunder for which Mr W. Churchill {{must be held}} responsible”) while Admiral Beatty wrote to his wife that Churchill had been “a darned fool” and “mad”. Asquith wrote to Venetia Stanley likening Churchill to a tiger which has “tasted blood” and who was hinting that he wanted other opportunities for a major field command, and that he preferred military glory to political success. By 13 October Asquith was writing of “the wicked folly of it all” and that Churchill had led “sheep to the shambles”. He faced criticism for his poor judgement from his wife Clementine (he missed {{the birth of his}} daughter Sarah), and in his later writing conceded that he might have <b>done</b> <b>things</b> differently.The Dunkirk force was also wound up after others, including Asquith, grew irritated about it.|$|E

500|$|The {{limitations}} of devising the album's musical direction {{on a tour}} bus forced Reznor to work differently from usual. Reznor said, [...] "I didn't have guitars around {{because it was too}} much hassle... It was another creative limitation... If I were in my studio, I would have <b>done</b> <b>things</b> the way I normally do them. But not having the ability to do that forced me into trying some things that were fun to do." ...|$|E

By the time the Senate finally voted on the Bricker Amendment on February 26, thirteen of the nineteen Democrats who had co-sponsored it had withdrawn their support, at the urging of Senators Johnson and George. [...] The original version of S.J. Res. 1 failed 42–50. By a 61-30 vote, the Senate agreed to substitute George's language for Bricker's— if only ninety-one senators voted, sixty-one was the necessary two-thirds vote for final approval.|$|E

During {{the last week}} of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key in the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United.

500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's <b>done</b> <b>things</b> that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{returned}} for the 1993 season enticed by {{the chance to}} play with a new coach (Dan Reeves), and determined not to end his career due to an injury. The Giants had a resurgent season in 1993. They finished 11–5, and competed for the top NFC playoff seed. Taylor finished with 6 sacks, and the Giants defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed. They defeated the Vikings 17–10 in the opening round of the playoffs. The next week on January 15, 1994 in what would be Taylor's final game, the Giants were beaten 44–3 by the 49ers. As the game came to a conclusion, television cameras drew in close on Taylor who was crying. He announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, [...] "I think it's time for me to retire. I've done everything I can do. I've been to Super Bowls. I've been to playoffs. I've <b>done</b> <b>things</b> that other people haven't been able to do in this game before. After 13 years, it's time for me to go." ...|$|E

500|$|Ed Logg, {{a former}} lead {{designer}} at Atari, who never programmed the VCS, considered the development a rushed, [...] "lousy" [...] effort. Frye did not express regret over {{his part in}} Pac-Mans port and felt he made the best decisions he could at the time. However, Frye stated {{that he would have}} <b>done</b> <b>things</b> differently with a larger capacity ROM. Video game industry researchers Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost attribute the poor reception to the technical differences between the 1977 Atari 2600 console and the 1980 arcade hardware used in Pac-Man cabinets. They further stated that the conversion is a lesson in maintaining the social and cultural context of the original source. Montfort and Bogost commented that players were disappointed with the flickering visual effect, which made the ghosts difficult to track and tired the players' eyes. The two further said that the effect diminishes the ghosts' personalities present in the arcade version. Chris Kohler of Wired commented that the game was poorly received upon its release and in contemporary times because of the poor quality. However, he further described the game as an impressive technical achievement given its console's limitations.|$|E

I think they're one of the greatest bands ever." [...] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, [...] "they really changed my life when I was 16 years oldI'd never heard anything that heavy". Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, [...] "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppetsand the staying powera timeless record like that". Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar. M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, [...] "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica". God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a [...] "rocker". Ill Niño drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are [...] "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'", and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.|$|E
500|$|In early {{planning}} stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith {{was to be}} one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have <b>done</b> <b>things</b> differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E

Pranab Mukherjee, as Defence Minister, was not formally involved but was roped in for his negotiation skills.

2500|$|According to Badu, the album's closing track, [...] "Out My Mind, Just in Time", is a three-{{movement}} song: [...] "The first {{movement is}} called 'Recovering Undercover Over-lover.'

It's typical of how you feel in relationships. The second movement is called ... 'Easier Said Than Done,' and it's about {{how hard it is to}} change after you've been in a relationship for so long.
