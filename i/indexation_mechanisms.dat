50|$|A 2009 {{study of}} the 1983-86 Denmark fiscal {{contraction}} applied structural VAR/event study methodology to test the EFC hypothesis. This study concluded that the Danish fiscal contraction had not hurt economic expansion, that the EFC hypothesis may work but only for large and credible fiscal consolidations, and that other reforms may have also played an important role. The authors warned that economic contraction, as predicted by traditional Keynesian Economics, would most likely result if government contraction was incremental rather than major and structural.An analysis of EFC using Neo-Keynesian modeling concluded that while there were situations in which consumption could be increased through fiscal contraction in all cases it was negative or neutral to employment so {{there must have been}} additional factors at work to explain the reduction in unemployment in Denmark and Ireland in the 1980s. The study concluded that Irish growth was actually lower than would have been expected without the fiscal contraction using the UK growth during the same period as a comparison. Above-average growth in Denmark was probably due to a supply-side shock {{in the form of the}} removal of wage <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and a temporary wage freeze which resulted in real wages contracting by 4% between 1982 and 1986.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, the {{government}} played a simultaneous {{role as a}} legislator, regulator, and entrepreneur, particularly {{in the provision of}} public utilities and in the exploitation of major natural resources, such as oil and coal. Colombia also used diverse trade-policy tools, such as tariffs and quotas, in order to promote import substitution, supplemented after 1967 by export promotion and economic diversification. To encourage exports, a competitive exchange rate became a centerpiece of macroeconomic policy, together with several export subsidies, including tax exemptions and subsidized credit. The initial export-promotion strategy did not include import liberalization as one of its components. A prominent feature of the export-promotion strategy was that the Bank of the Republic stood ready to vary the fixed but adjustable exchange rate to compensate for domestic inflation, {{in order to maintain the}} competitiveness of domestic producers. As a result, the exchange rate became indexed to the rate of inflation, and it did not take long for a vicious circle to develop, one in which inflation fed into the exchange rate and vice versa. Consequently, and notwithstanding a tradition of prudent fiscal policies, for a long period Colombia was characterized by a moderate, albeit stable, rate of inflation. Widespread <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> particularly for wages, public utilities, and mortgage-interest rates, blurred most income-redistribution effects generally associated with inflation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSimilarity {{search in}} metric spaces refers to searching {{elements}} in data repositories {{that are similar}} to an element supplied by the user (query example). Similarity functions are used to determine which elements in the data repositories are similar to the query example and indexing mechanisms are used to improve the efficiency in the search. Classic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as LSH, M-Index, and M-Tree behave different according to the dimensionality in the metric space, volume of data repositories, and query strategies. In this paper, we describe SimSearch, a modular and flexible framework for similarity search in metric spaces, which allows to use, analyse, compare, and add several <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> search approaches, and query strategies. SimSearch allows doing queries given one or more example elements to obtain the set of elements more similar to the query examples, using query composition and Skyline. We show the variability of performance of several <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> including LSH-ML (our proposed variant of LSH), with experimental study in the domain of images represented by a feature vector in a high dimensionality metric space and Web Services represented by a vector with the values of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters...|$|E

30|$|Before 1993, {{the wage}} {{inflation}} adjustment was practically automatic through an <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The abolition of this mechanism {{was found to}} be associated with a decline in downward real wage rigidities (Devicienti et al., 2007).|$|R
40|$|Automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{are often}} {{criticized for being}} a key source of inflexibility of actual real wages and thus {{responsible}} {{for a lack of}} adjustment to in the labour market and for a deterioration of cost-competiveness. The aim {{of this study is to}} empirically assess whether this point of view is well founded. Statistical The Statistical and econometric research relates to four countries: two with institutionalized indexation of wages to consumer prices (Luxembourg and Belgium) and two without institutionalized indexation (Germany and France). this comparative econometric study, applied to four countries with or without <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> shows that the presence of institutionalized indexation does not significantly alter the process through which hourly wages are set, by observingas revealed by the long-term relationships or dynamic reactions to an exogenous shock. In other words, whilst differences in wage flexibility exist, their causes may be found elsewhere and not necessarily in automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Beyond the perimeter of this study, factors for the adjustment or inflexibility of wages might rather be sought in other directions, such as wages upon recruitment, inter-sector flexibility, the variable portion of remuneration, or changes in the composition of the labour force by sector, for example...|$|E
30|$|All in all, access {{criteria}} {{are more often}} negatively adjusted {{than the other way}} round, especially if we focus on crisis measures. This (as well as the changes in gross benefits that skip indexation or adapt <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and equivalence scales) seems to be in line with the literature on retrenchment, that predicts that unpopular measures will generally be hidden behind rather technical measures, or distinguish between various small groups.|$|E
40|$|In the Governing Council’s view, {{the outlook}} for price {{developments}} remains subject to upside risks … It is therefore crucial that social partners continue to meet their responsibilities.

30|$|Even before 1993, {{when the}} <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> was in place, there was {{evidence}} {{of the existence of}} a compensating differential between the indexed and the non-indexed part of the wage (see Manacorda, 2004). For Scandinavian countries, Hibbs and Locking (1996) and Holden (1998) find that increases in nationally negotiated wage have little offsetting effect on wage drift.|$|R

40|$|This study explores {{two aspects}} of Colombian chronic but {{moderate}} inflation experience during the period 1970 1990. Based on time series analysis, the study suggests that the policy to increase relative price of energy products be complemented with expenditure reducing mechanisms to avoid the validation of higher price pressures stemming from other sectors.

30|$|Many of {{the nominal}} {{increases}} {{observed in the}} first crisis years translate in substantial real hikes in most countries. This is partially due to the lagged reaction of <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to in some cases quite substantial pre-crisis increases in consumer prices. Yet these automatic increases were further reinforced by additional increases of gross benefits in {{a substantial number of}} countries (see Table  2). Later on, the deceleration in nominal growth or the outright skipping of indexation led in some countries to a small loss in purchasing power. However, bar a few exceptions (most importantly Ireland and Portugal), this decrease does not appear exceptional when compared to pre-crisis trends.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the shortcomings of}} the Real Plan combining political science and economics, considering evidences on difficulties in implementing a complete plan of deindexation, namely: the distributional conflict, the corporatist relations between the State and society and the bureaucratic isolation of a highly specialized technocracy. The announcement of the plan triggered defensive reactions, fueling distributive tensions during the URV period, forcing the economic team to take measures that contradicted the overall guidelines followed.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} {{in this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the determinants of inflationary process in Turkish economy. For this purpose, based on some potential causes of inflation, an empirical model is contructed upon emphasizing the roles of various factors on inflationary process. The results obtained support the view of cost-push inflation led by exchange rate depreciations, wage <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> real interest structure and public sector pricing behaviour which is considered some part of wholesale prices, rather than the demand-pull monetary factors. Some other factors such as the course of real effective exchange rate have been found indicating a relieving effect on the cost pressure settled in domestic economy as well. Supporting these arguments, we find that the smaller the growth performance of the economy given the cost-pressure through exchange-rate pass-through effects, wage <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the real interest structure be imposed, the larger would be the inflation structure. These all might also be given as evidence to that the cost-push rather than demand-pull factors would affect the course of Turkish business cycles.

Using firm-level data from the Wage Dynamics Network (wdn) Project, Babecký et al. (2010) report that firm-level indexation in Spain is widespread and often automatic (around 55  % of firms apply some automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the second largest share after Belgium). Likewise, using the same survey, Druant et al. (2012) document that 84  % of firms in Spain change wages only once a year (the second largest share among the 15 European countries examined).|$|R
30|$|This {{pattern is}} more {{pronounced}} for {{some aspects of}} social citizenship than for others and especially outspoken for changes to the standard rates of minimum income benefits (MIP in Fig.  4). Whereas declines in standard rates are virtually absent in 2008 and 2009, nine countries issue increases in 2009. To some extent, this is in countries where an adequate <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is lacking, but also other countries chose to increase gross benefits over and above indexation. Later on, these additional increases become rare. In addition, from 2010 onwards, more and more countries take measures that {{have a negative impact}} on minimum income benefits.|$|R
40|$|Was there a textbook-like Phillips {{curve in}} post-WWII Italy?

We also estimate similar models for the UK and the US. We discuss the role of wage coordination and <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in generating what amounts to a significant departure of Italian data from what holds true for the US and UK. Likely, the rigid indexation mechanism that aimed at protecting wages from inflation ended up contributing to the persistent inflation bias that Italy experienced almost until its entry into EMU. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{long-term}} {{impact of these}} technical changes is hard to predict. For now, time series and standard simulations of changes in net disposable income packages show relatively modest impacts in the period 2009 – 2012. Yet some of the technical changes may carry the seeds for an incremental path departing process, such as new, less generous <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> or different equivalence scales. These changes may have far-reaching implications in the longer run, although their immediate impact is rather modest, {{not in the least}} because they may impact on the notion of what a social floor should actually entail. Nonetheless, in some countries, such as Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Romania, the combined effect of various retrenchment measures already now weighs heavily on minimum income beneficiaries.|$|E
40|$|High and {{persistent}} inflation {{has been one}} of the distinguishing macroeconomic characteristics of many developing countries - particularly in Latin America - since the end of World War II. Pazos (1972) coined the term "chronic inflation" to refer the this phenomenon. In his view, chronic inflation is quite a different creature from the much more spectacular hyperinflations studied by Cagan (1956). First, unlike hyperinflations whose duration is measured in terms of months, chronic inflation may last for decades. Second, countries learn how to live with high {{and persistent}} inflation by creating various <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which, in turn, tend to perpetuate the inflationary process. As a result, inflation does not have an inherent propensity to accelerate and, if it does, soon reaches a new plateau...|$|E
30|$|Wage {{bargaining}} in Slovenia in {{the private}} sector is highly structured and are negotiated at three levels 7.

30|$|All in all, bar {{a number}} of {{important}} exceptions at either side of the spectrum, in the brunt of countries minimum income protection beneficiaries only experienced rather limited real decreases. This is partially because of the time frame, that does not include some of the expansionary measures introduced at the start of 2009 and only covers two and a half years, partly because some measures (e.g. changing <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in Germany and the United Kingdom, different calculation methods in Romania) will only reveal their full impact in the longer run, partly because changes were not quite that pronounced in {{a number of}} countries (at least not for these particular family types) and partly because the average obfuscates the impact of some policy changes on a limited number of family types.|$|E

30|$|Automatic {{indexation}} {{of wages}} to prices is {{a proxy for}} centralisation. This method has survived only in Belgium and Luxembourg.

Against the specific recommendation under the EU’s new economic governance system, the Belgian government decided in 2012 to retain automatic wage indexation with some adjustments in the calculation. The latest central agreement for 2013 – 14 allows wages to rise {{only as much as}} the change in the cost-of-living index. In Luxembourg, which received a similar EU admonition, the government failed to gain union support for reform in 2010 and went ahead unilaterally with suspending indexation between 2012 and 2014.|$|E

We document that this mechanism triggered a strong redistribution within the firm.

30|$|Some {{important}} institutional {{features of}} the labour market affect individual wages in Belgium, such as indexation and sector-level collective bargaining agreements, which can possibly be supplemented with agreements concluded at the firm level. These features explain why Belgium is characterised as a country with high real wage rigidity (see Dickens et al. 2007 b or Du Caju et al. 2012). We briefly describe these characteristics of the Belgian labour market. Firstly, as in several countries, a minimum wage is legally binding. Also, practically all employees’ gross wages are linked to a consumer price index through an automatic <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> 2 This effectively limits the scope for real wage cuts.|$|R

30|$|Interestingly, {{most of the}} {{negative}} changes introduced in the period 2008 –start 2012 are technical in nature. This is most clearly seen in the changes to MIP standard rates from 2010 onwards. Whereas the positive changes in 2009 were increases of standard rates, actual nominal decreases are very rare. Rather, governments introduced measures such as the skipping of indexation for inflation, changing the <b>indexation</b> <b>mechanism</b> or {{the introduction of a}} benefit cap. When nominal benefit rates did decrease, this was generally in the context of broad reforms that introduced new equivalence rates with different consequences for particular family types.
