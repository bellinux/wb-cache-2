25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and <b>discharge</b> <b>control</b> by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E

50|$|The valves {{required}} {{for oil and}} gas separators are oil <b>discharge</b> <b>control</b> valve, water-discharge control valve (three-phase operation), drain valves, block valves, pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.|$|E
50|$|Borrow pits {{containing}} suitable material {{are accessible}} at an elevation {{such that the}} earth can be sluiced to the fill after being washed from the bank by high-pressure nozzles. Hydraulic fill {{is likely to be}} the most economic method of construction. Even when the source material lacks sufficient elevation, it can be elevated to the sluice by a dredge pump. In the construction of a hydraulic fill dam, the edges of the dam are defined by low embankments or dykes which are built upward as the fill progresses. The sluices are carried parallel to, and just inside of, these dykes. The sluices discharge their water-earth mixture at intervals, the water fanning out and flowing towards the central pool which is maintained at the desired level by <b>discharge</b> <b>control.</b> While flowing from the sluices, coarse material is deposited first and then finer material is deposited (fine material has a slower terminal velocity thus takes longer to settle, see Stoke's Law) as the flow velocity is reduced towards the center of the dam. This fine material forms an impervious core to the dam. The water flow must be well controlled at all times, otherwise the central section may be bridged by tongues of coarse material which would facilitate seepage through the dam later.|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} an {{ultracapacitor}} (UC) -based dc-dc power supply {{is crucial to}} provide reliable energy backup to critical loads {{in the case of}} momentary power main failures. In this regard, smooth and seamless transition between charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>controls</b> of UC stack is of paramount importance. For ride-through applications where charging and discharging times are critical, provision of different control structures for charging and discharging subsystems is crucial. The conventional control techniques, though ensure seamless mode transition, does not allow different control structures for both the subsystems. This paper proposes an independent switch control strategy, which ensures seamless transition between charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>control</b> modes. The proposed control is based on pulse-width modulation blocking and is shown to ensure the fastest mode transition between control modes. The proposed control also elucidates an accurate method for identification of control modes, which is important to independent switch control. The advantages of the proposed control compared with conventional controls is presented in this paper. The proposed control strategy has been verified in simulations and experimentation, and the mode identification algorithm is found to work well...|$|R

40|$|The {{building}} of large dams in the Upper Paraná River basin altered the discharge regime at the Porto São José River section. The discharge regime has been altered since 1972, but the changes intensified after the Porto Primavera damming, in late 1998. Considering that <b>discharge</b> <b>control</b> affects {{the relationship between}} channel and floodplain, this work aimed to evaluate {{the intensity of the}} <b>discharge</b> <b>control</b> that resulted from the operation of the Porto Primavera Dam. To achieve this objective, statistical analyses were carried out based on the Porto São José Fluviometric Station historical series of river level readings and discharge, between 1964 and 2007. Results showed that the average discharge increased from 1964 to 1981 and diminished after river damming. The increase of average discharge rates was followed by an increase of the duration of higher discharges at different levels of geomorphologic and limnological importance, and the reduction of average discharge during the last observed period was followed by a disproportionate decrease in the duration of the abovementioned discharges. Moreover, {{it is clear that the}} relationship between fluviometric level and fluvial discharge changed, which implies that a certain river level reading represents a higher discharge than necessary before river damming...|$|E

In addition, we evaluated the relationships of these ecological attributes with variations in the hydrologic regime, considering the possible effects of natural (climatic events) and artificial (<b>discharge</b> <b>control</b> by dams) disturbances. Annual variations in hydrometric attributes were calculated using PULSO software and daily water level data. We applied analysis of covariance to determine the relationships between ecological and hydromet-ric attributes, the latter summarized in axes of a principal component analysis. Lower values of the fish assemblage attributes (diversity and abundance) were registered in the Paraná River. Species richness, total CPUE and CPUE of long-distance migratory species were positively related to the duration of the floods and the connectivity of the area.
