Laboratory experiments were conducted using IntraCavity Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (ICLAS), a high-resolution, high sensitivity spectroscopic method that had been used primarily for static cell measurements in the Steinfeld Laboratory at MIT. Several modifications and improvements have been made to expand its versatility. Firstly, a discharge flow tube was coupled with the ICLA Spectrometer, and the formation kinetics of nitrosyl hydride, HNO, were measured as a means to test the system. Secondly, a novel edge-tuner was introduced as a means to expand the spectral range of the ICLA Spectrometer.
