He stated: [...] "I was really lucky because there's a real phonetic coherence of the episode that brought them all together on an emotional level. For me, it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> that they dovetailed and didn't feel random and you understood why these three stories were all in the same show." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} season a 7.9 out of 10, feeling it [...] "had its up and downs, mixing in {{elements}} that worked (Daisy getting her Quake on, the Fitz and Simmons drama), elements {{we could have}} used more of (Secret Warriors!) and elements that just never felt right (Lincoln and his relationship with Daisy)." [...] Goldman also felt that {{the first half of}} the season was [...] "the stronger, more cohesive of the two halves" [...] as it aired the episode [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] which Goldman called [...] "the best hour of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date." [...] He criticized the pacing of the season, saying [...] "some episodes felt a bit jumbled and could have benefited from slowing down a bit—or simply not trying to do so much at once. Sometimes it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of including too many characters or storylines in single episodes, causing some scenarios to not have time to breathe or get the proper build up they might have with more character-focused episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sooner or Later" [...] was {{composed}} as a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Rooksby described the track as [...] "conjuring {{the atmosphere of}} a smoky nightclub". Madonna sings in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. It opens with a [...] "lazy" [...] clarinet solo and portrays the singer {{as a kind of}} sexual magnate. [...] "I always get my man", she sings [...] "If you're on my list it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of when". The song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 75 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major with Madonna's voice spanning from F3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of B9–B6/F–B9–B6/F as its chord progression. In the film, [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] is the signature song of Breathless and was primarily performed during a montage just after Dick Tracy has placed a microphone in Alphonse [...] "Big Boy" [...] Caprice's boardroom and operator.|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|La Rivière {{argues that}} the use of the Tiger Moth as the star vehicle, and the pun on the Esso promotional banner of [...] "Put a Tiger in Your Tank", are more suited to an adult audience. Meanwhile, {{children}} [...] "had spent the entire 90 minutes eagerly waiting for the most fantastic piece of hardware to arrive. They got an old plane." [...] Thunderbirds historian John Marriott voices similar criticism of the Tiger Moth, writing that [...] "the big screen was an unsuitable place for the gentle irony of steam-age technology scoring triumphantly over an array of fantasy machines." [...] Science-fiction author John Peel is dismissive of the film in general and compares it pessimistically to the [...] "well-made fun" [...] of Thunderbirds Are Go. He summarises it as a [...] "big mistake" [...] and [...] "a feeble last fling for a brilliant series", with a long and illogical plot, poor jokes and little action during the final rescue sequences. Responding to claims that the tone of Thunderbird 6 differs significantly from that of its predecessor, Gerry Anderson maintains that the time that had elapsed since the airing of the final television episode meant that [...] "we were much more aware with the second one that it wasn't <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of making a longer episode, but it was, indeed, to make something special for the cinema." ...|$|E

2500|$|Geoffrey A. Landis of NASA's Glenn Research Center {{states that}} a laser-powered {{interstellar}} sail ship {{could possibly be}} launched within 50 years, using new methods of space travel. [...] "Ithink that ultimately we're going to do it, it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of when and who," [...] Landis said in an interview. Rockets are too slow to send humans on interstellar missions. Instead, he envisions interstellar craft with extensive sails, propelled by laser light to about one-tenth the speed of light. It would take such a ship about 43 years to reach Alpha Centauri, if it passed through the system. Slowing down to stop at Alpha Centauri could increase the trip to 100 years, whereas a journey without slowing down raises the issue of making sufficiently accurate and useful observations and measurements during a fly-by.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the end of World War I, Wegner also voiced his opposition, at great risk to his own life, against the anti-semitic policies of the Nazis. In 1933, he authored an impassioned plea to Adolf Hitler on behalf of the Jews of Germany. He suggested that the persecution of the Jews was not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of [...] "the fate of our Jewish brothers alone, [...] the fate of Germany." [...] Noting that he was writing the letter as a proud German who could himself trace his Prussian familial roots back to the time of the Crusades, Wegner asked Hitler what would become of Germany if it continued its persecution of Jews. Answering his own question, Wegner declared, [...] "There is no Fatherland without justice!" [...] He was persecuted by the Nazis and, for his efforts, is recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations.|$|E
2500|$|Improving the {{conditions}} of the streets of London is not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of how to prevent crime or to apprehend robbers, Moreton actually recognises how the architectonic structure of roads, lanes, and avenues might make a difference, otherwise [...] "all by-turnings, courts, alleys, lanes, , which may favour a street-robber's escape, and make our project ineffectual". London criminals had endless opportunities to escape from a pursuer, and as Henry Fielding wrote in 1751 in his essay An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers: Whoever indeed considers the Cities of London and Westminster, with the late vast Addition of their Suburbs; the great irregularity of their Buildings, the immense Number of Lanes, Alleys, Courts and Bye-places; must think, that, had they intended for the very purpose of Concealment, they could scarce have been contrived. Upon such a view, the whole appears as a vast Wood or Forest, in which a Thief may harbour with as great Security, as wild Beasts do in the Deserts of Africa or Arabia. And indeed, as we also learn from Defoe's fictions, if you knew where to look the city might offer unexpectedly comfortable corners.|$|E

Two years were devoted to finishing his dissertation, while another two were spent learning how to build modular synthesizers. Completed and submitted in 2014, the 338-page thesis [...] "Communication and Control" [...] discussed the influence of technology on control societies, and he was thereby awarded his PhD in political science from the University of Hawaii, where his thesis advisor was Michael J. Shapiro. He immediately started building the instruments that were ultimately used for the recording of his fourth album, Screen Memories (2017). Its release was accompanied by his first solo tour with a live band. [...] It will be available exclusively as a bonus vinyl disc on a career retrospective box set. In an October 2017 interview, he indicated a desire to record an album with Rosenberg: [...] "We’re both swamped right now ... but I've been talking about it for a long time, and he's been talking about it.
