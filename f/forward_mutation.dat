40|$|Background: To address {{evolution}} of HIV- 1 after transmission, we studied sequence dynamics {{in and outside}} predicted epitopes of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in subtype B HIV- 1 variants that were isolated from 5 therapy-naive horizontal HLA-disparate donor-recipient pairs from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV- 1 infection and AIDS. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the first weeks after transmission, the majority of donor-derived mutations in and outside donor-HLA-restricted epitopes in Gag, Env, and Nef, were preserved in the recipient. Reversion to the HIV- 1 subtype B consensus sequence of mutations in- and outside donor-HLA-restricted CTL epitopes, and new mutations away from the consensus B sequence mostly within recipient-HLA-restricted epitopes, contributed equally to the early sequence changes. In the subsequent period (1 – 2 years) after transmission, still only a low number of both reverting and <b>forward</b> <b>mutations</b> had occurred. During subsequent long-term follow-up, sequence dynamics were dominated by <b>forward</b> <b>mutations,</b> mostly (50 – 85 %) in recipient-HLA-restricted CTL epitopes. At the end of long-term follow-up, on average 43 % of the transmitted CTL escape mutations in donor-HLA-restricted epitopes had reverted to the subtype B consensus sequence. Conclusions/Significance: The relatively high proportion of long-term preserved mutations after transmission points {{to a lack of}} back selection {{even in the absence of}} CTL pressure, which may lead to an accumulating loss of critical CTL epitopes.

As might be expected, there was evidence for a component involving direct electrophilic attack on the cellular DNA, in a manner previously established as causative in the induction of mutations in Salmonella.

40|$|Mutagenic heterocyclic amines are {{generated}} in foods {{when they are}} cooked at temperatures over 1 50 °C. These compounds are present from 0. 1 to 50 ppb, depending on the food and cooking conditions. These heterocyclic amines are not only present in cooked red meat, fish, and chicken, but are also present at lower levels in baked and fried foods derived from grain. Mutagenicity of fried beef hamburgers cooked at 230 °C is 800 ± 37 TA 98 revertants per gram cooked weight. We measured 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -flquinoxaline (MelQx), 2 -amino- 3, 4, 8 -trimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (DiMelQx), and 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -flquinoline (IQ) formation at this temperature and found 3. 0 ± 2. 0, 1. 0 ± 0. 18, and 0. 06 ± 0. 03 ng/g, respectively. 2 -amino- 1 -methyl [...] phenylimidazo[4, 5 -blpyridine (PhIP) was found at a higher concentration of 9. 6 ng/g.

We have also been able to show a statistically significant increase in mutations in the pancreas of the "mutamouse " following PhIP exposure. The pancreas also shows relatively high DNA binding compared to other organs in the mouse. The number and type of mutations depend on the repair capacity of the cells for both Salmonella and CHO.

40|$|Over 20 {{years into}} the ever-worsening AIDS pandemic, genetic {{variation}} remains the greatest obstacle for treating and preventing HIV- 1 infection. Mutation rate assays for HIV- 1 have been reported; however, none measure directly the <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> rate during replication of the virus in cell culture while still retaining the ability to propagate and further study mutant proviruses. Therefore, {{the objective of the}} current study was to develop such a phenotypic cell-based assay for measuring the <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> rate of HIV- 1. Conventional recombinant DNA techniques and polymerase chain reaction were used to create a replication defective HIV- 1 vector, pNL 4 - 3 Δ+cass, which is based on the NL 4 - 3 strain and contains the thymidine kinase gene from human herpes virus type 1 as the mutational target. A series of transfection and infection steps were used to introduce the vector into 143 B cells, which are negative for thymidine kinase function, and produce vector virus for a single cycle of replication. Viral titers were measured by counting the number of drug resistant colonies on the assay plates, and <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> rates were calculated from the viral titers. Mutant proviruses were sequenced to determine the types of genetic alterations that occurred. The average <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> rate for HIV- 1 was 2. 2 × 10 − 5 mutations/base/cycle. The majority of mutations were base substitutions, including high frequencies of C → U and G → A transitions. Single adenosine insertions were also observed frequently. The new assay is economical and provides a direct measurement of the mutation rate during a single cycle of viral replication. Target cells containing mutant proviruses survive the drug selection process and may be propagated for further analysis. The new assay is novel and has many advantages over previous mutation rate assays and thus will be very useful in future studies on genetic variation of HIV- 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} described an Hsp 70 mutant (Ssa 1 - 21 p), altered in a conserved residue (L 483 W), that dominantly impairs yeast [PSI(+) ] prion propagation without affecting growth. We generated new SSA 1 mutations that impaired [PSI(+) ] propagation and second-site mutations in SSA 1 - 21 that restored normal propagation. Effects of mutations on growth did not correlate with [PSI(+) ] phenotype, revealing differences in Hsp 70 function required {{for growth and}} [PSI(+) ] propagation and suggesting that Hsp 70 interacts differently with [PSI(+) ] prion aggregates than with other cellular substrates. Complementary suppression of altered activity between <b>forward</b> and suppressing <b>mutations</b> suggests that mutations that impair [PSI(+) ] affect a similar Hsp 70 function and that suppressing mutations similarly overcome this effect. All new mutations that impaired [PSI(+) ] propagation were located in the ATPase domain. Locations and homology of several suppressing substitutions suggest that they weaken Hsp 70 's substrate-trapping conformation, implying that impairment of [PSI(+) ] by <b>forward</b> <b>mutations</b> is due to altered ability of the ATPase domain to regulate substrate binding. Other suppressing mutations are in residues important for interactions with Hsp 40 or TPR-containing cochaperones, suggesting that such interactions are necessary for the impairment of [PSI(+) ] propagation caused by mutant Ssa 1 p...|$|R

Among the coordinated set of inducible SOS responses in Escherichia coli is a mechanism by which normally lethal DNA damage is obviated, potentially at the expense of replicational accuracy (SOS mutagenesis). This mutagenic response requires a reaction by RecA to the structure of a lesion-arrested replication fork and the participation of re-sponse proteins encoded by the umuDC operon. Once activated, RecA stimulates cleavage of LexA, the repressor of the SOS regulon, and UmuD, which consequently com-plexes with UmuC (27, 29).

Maximum-likelihood analysis of spontaneous mutant distributions in wild-type cultures yielded maximal estimates of (2. 8 +/- 0. 7) x 10 (- 7) and (1. 5 +/- 0. 6) x 10 (- 7) mutational events per cell per division cycle for the pyrE and pyrF loci, respectively. To our knowledge, these results provide the first accurate measurement of the genetic fidelity maintained by archaea that populate geothermal environments. The measured rates of <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> at the pyrE and pyrF loci in S. acidocaldarius are close to corresponding rates reported for protein-encoding genes of Escherichia coli. The normal rate of spontaneous mutation in E. coli at 37 degrees C is known to require the functioning of several enzyme systems that repair spontaneous damage in DNA.

Based on this observation, the nonselective enrichment of yeast cultures for viable adenine mutants by using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter has been achieved. The advantages of this approach over conventional genetic analysis of mutation, recombination, and mitotic chromosomal stability include speed and accuracy in acquiring data for large numbers of clones.

We examined frameshift mutations in homonucleotide runs of deoxyadenosines ranging from 4 to 14 bases at the same position in the LYS 2 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the msh 2 mismatch repair mutant, runs of 9 to 14 deoxyadenosines are 1, 700 -fold to 51, 000 -fold, respectively, more mutable for single-nucleotide deletions than are runs of 4 deoxyadenosines.

Mutations in the mnt repressor gene or its operator on this plasmid, pPY 98, confer a tetracycline resistance phenotype, whereas the wild-type plasmid confers tetracycline sensitivity. Cells carrying pPY 98 were briefly exposed to MNNG to give 20 to 40 % survival and a 50 - to 100 -fold increase in tetracycline-resistant cells.

UV-induced mutagenesis of plasmid-free P. putida was easily detected in three different assays (two reversion assays and one <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> assay), whereas UV mutagenesis of P. aeruginosa without CAM-OCT was seen only in the <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> assay.

A number of P. putida mutants carrying chromosomal mutations affecting either survival or mutagenesis after UV irradiation were isolated, {{and the effect of}} CAM-OCT on these mutants was determined. All mutations producing a UV-sensitive phenotype in P. putida were fully suppressed by the plasmid, whereas the plasmid had a more variable effect on mutagenesis mutations, suppressing some and producing no suppression of others.

We have isolated pol delta from isotonic (pol delta(i)) and detergent (pol delta(d)) calf thymus extracts. Pol delta had a 20 -fold higher ratio of exonuclease to DNA polymerase than pol deltai. This was due to the physical association of the TREX 2 3 ' [...] > 5 ' exonuclease to pol delta(d), which was missing from pol delta(i). Pol delta(d) was fivefold more accurate than pol i under error-prone conditions (1 mM dGTP and 20 dATP, dCTP, and dTTP) in a M 13 mp 2 DNA <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> assay, and fourfold more accurate than pol delta(i) under error-prone conditions (1 mM dGTP and 20 microM dATP, dCTP, and dTTP) in a M 13 mp 2 DNA <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> assay, and fourfold more accurate in an M 13 mp 2 T 90 reversion assay.

Here we report that levels of Mtz that partially inhibit growth stimulate <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> to rifampin resistance in rdxA+ (Mtzs) and also in rdxA (Mtzr) H. pylori strains, and that expression of rdxA in Escherichia coli results in equivalent Mtz-induced mutation. A reversion test using defined lac tester strains of E. coli carrying rdxA+ indicated that CG-to-GC transversions and AT-to-GC transitions are induced more frequently than other base substitutions. Alkaline gel electrophoretic tests showed that Mtz concentrations near or higher than the MIC for growth also caused DNA breakage in H. pylori and in E. coli carrying rdxA+, suggesting that this damage may account {{for most of the}} bactericidal action of Mtz. Coculture of Mtzs H. pylori with E. coli (highly resistant to Mtz) in the presence of Mtz did not stimulate <b>forward</b> <b>mutation</b> in E. coli, indicating that the mutagenic and bactericidal products of Mtz metabolism do not diffuse significantly to neighboring (bystander) cells.

40|$|CD 8 +-T-cell {{responses}} play {{an important}} role in the containment and clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and an association between viral persistence and development of viral escape mutations has been postulated. While escape from CD 8 +-T-cell responses has been identified as a major driving force for the evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a broader characterization of this relationship is needed in HCV infection. To determine the extent, kinetics, and driving forces of HCV sequence evolution, we sequenced the entire HCV genome longitudinally in four subjects monitored for up to 30 months after acute infection. For two subjects the transmission sources were also available. Of 53 total nonenvelope amino acid substitutions detected, a majority represented <b>forward</b> <b>mutations</b> away from the consensus sequence. In contrast to studies in HIV and SIV, however, only 11 % of these were associated with detectable CD 8 + T-cell responses. Interestingly, 19 % of nonenvelope mutations represented changes toward the consensus sequence, suggesting reversion in the absence of immune pressure upon transmission. Notably, the rate of evolution of <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>mutations</b> correlated with the conservation of each residue, which is indicative of structural constraints influencing the kinetics of viral evolution. Finally, the rate of sequence evolution was observed to decline over the course of infection, possibly reflective of diminishing selection pressure by dysfunctional CD 8 + T cells. Taken together, these data provide insight into the extent to which HCV is capable of evading early CD 8 + T-cell responses and support the hypothesis that dysfunction of CD 8 + T cells may be associated with failure to resolve HCV infections...|$|R

However, as the dose increases, a strikingly different response is observed: in the selective reversion system a transition to higher order induction kinetics occurs near 9 ergs/mm 2 (25 % survival), whereas in the nonselective <b>forward</b> system the <b>mutation</b> frequency passes through a maximum near 14 ergs/mm 2 (4. 4 % survival) and then declines. This contrast in kinetics cannot be explained in any straightforward way by current models of induced mutagenesis, which have been developed primarily {{on the basis of}} bacterial data. The bacterial models are designed to accommodate the quadratic induction kinetics that are frequently observed in these systems. We have derived a mathematical expression for mutation frequency that enables us to fit both the forward and reversion data on the assumptions that mutagenesis is basically a "single event" Poisson process, and that mutation and killing are not necessarily independent of one another. In particular, the dose-response relations are consistent with the idea that the sensitivity of the revertants is about 25 % less than that of the original cell population, whereas the sensitivity of the forward mutants is about 29 % greater than the population average. We argue that this relatively small differential sensitivity of mutant and nonmutant cells is associated with events that take place during mutation expression and clonal growth...|$|R
