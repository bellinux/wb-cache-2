For the purpose of conducting the analysis thirteen EU countries were chosen, e. g.

In this paper two criteria used in standard procedures have been compared. The results of the comparison showed that the choice of procedures vary remarkably between the countries, and similarly the proportion of criteria used in the award process, where price and price with other non-price criteria are used.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to investigate what happens when artefacts mediate interaction. To do this we investigated nurse’s interaction during the bandaging process in order to understand better how an artefact enhances user’s experiences. To maintain research rigour we applied a triangulation approach that links observations of current procedures, talk-aloud protocol during interaction and retrospective interviews. Using software to aid our analysis of the videos we produced <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>maps</b> of their interaction. The maps allowed us to see that some nurses bandage more intuitively than others. Nurses who bandage intuitively assemble long sequences of bandaging actions while nurses who bandage less intuitively “focus-shift ” in between bandaging actions. We argue that nurses who bandage intuitively demonstrate greater expertise than nurses who do not. We discuss these differences and explore how different levels of expertise can influence how mediated interaction takes place. Finally, we introduced how knowledge generated from {{this research}} can be transferred to the design domain, interaction and interface design in particular, and contribute to the design process as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningJason BrodyEffective {{open space}} is {{critical}} to the urban quality of life because it fosters environmental, social, and economic vitality. However, some designers, planners, and developers have a tendency to focus on only one of these aspects and, thus, create spaces that are monofunctional and inefficient over time. To ensure effective open spaces in cities, landscape architects must think strategically and employ design tactics that are multifunctional and perform environmentally, socially, and economically. My objective was to provide landscape architects with a framework that ensured effective open spaces through the manipulation of the urban surface. In this report, I explored how the urban surface could be used to create multifunctional, flexible, and adaptive solutions that informed and directed (re) development so that urban spaces had lasting value. A thorough literature review that explored concepts from Jane Jacobs, Alex Wall, and Ying-Yu Hung was used to create a theoretical framework that consisted of various tactics. The tactics were aesthetic, programmatic, contextual, and/or performative in nature, and the aggregation of these tactics in the urban surface catalyzed environmental, social, and economic vitality in urban open spaces. My methodology was iterative, cycling periods of research, design, and analysis in both group and individual settings. The theoretical framework was used to evaluate and inform design decisions, and the design decisions refined and validated the theoretical framework itself. The theoretical framework was first applied to two precedent studies through a series of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>mapping</b> exercises. Then, the theoretical framework was applied to two collaborative, multidisciplinary redevelopment projects. The first project was the redevelopment of the Village Plaza shopping center in Manhattan, Kansas (MHK Project), and the second project was the revitalization of Downtown East in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the annual Gerald D. Hines Student Urban Design Competition, sponsored by the Urban Land Institute (ULI Competition). Both of these projects were evaluated and refined using the same <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>mapping</b> exercises. The effectiveness of using the theoretical framework as a guide for designing successful open spaces was validated with my team’s victory in the finalist round of the ULI Competition. The tactics in the theoretical framework offered pragmatic and multiscalar strategies that I incorporated into the open spaces that my team and I designed. Ultimately, I discovered that the role of surface was to accommodate, organize, structure, and facilitate the dynamic processes necessary for environmental, social, and economic vitality, which enhanced the urban quality of life and created an indisputable sense of place...|$|R
50|$|For most of {{the twentieth}} century, {{official}} maps of the New York City Subway were geographic {{in the sense that}} they represented the actual coastline and selected topographical features such as parks, zoos, and stadiums. There was often some distortion to fit things in - Manhattan was often broadened, and Brooklyn twisted around toward the northeast, but the maps preserved the broad facts of the geography. From 1958 to 1978, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) conducted a twenty-year experiment with <b>diagrammatic</b> subway <b>maps,</b> which showed the topology of the subway network but dispensed with {{most of the}} topographical detail, schematized the coastline, and abstracted the subway lines onto a grid.

40|$|Intermediacy is a {{condition}} of "coming between two things in time, place, character, etc. " The areas of intersecting border areas, intermediate areas, display characteristics of the adjacent areas. Intermediate areas were the last lands available {{to be a place}} of transitions to connect adjacent areas. The lands, undeniably deserted, are mostly filled with ordinary functions necessary for modern lives, such as convenient infrastructure, big box retail stores, and corporate offices, which only return indifferent and ordinary experiences. Are the intermediate areas in the faith of being indifferent? What {{does it mean to be}} vital in those areas? This thesis seeks an approach to extracting the disregarded vitality of an intermediate area,and to introduce proposals that generate their own ways to vitalize an area. The study of an intermediate area, Alewife in Cambridge, Massachusetts, through range of scales and means, from <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>mapping</b> to observation of the site, gives understanding of what makes Alewife as it is now. The conceptual vocabularies assigned to conditions of the site shed the light on the potential vitalities as well as turn into conditions of design. The proposals for the intermediate areas have multiple purposes as a space, function, and role, in order to break through singularity and mono-functioning spaces which dominate the area. The proposals attempt to suggest how the resources of Alewife, both inherited on the area and from adjacent areas, could be maximized to activate the area. The stretched range of specificity, scale, intervening degree, and formality of the proposals allows the area to have multiple characteristics, which is {{a condition}} of being intermediate, "somewhere belonging to one place but with a foot in another. by Midori Taki.
