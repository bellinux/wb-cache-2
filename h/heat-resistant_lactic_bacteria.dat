Methods and Results: <b>Lactic</b> acid <b>bacteria</b> in three traditional fermented products in southern Africa (amasi, mahewu and tshwala) and in three fresh samples (two flowers and a fruit) were enrichment cultured in media supplemented with 13 different carbohydrates. Diversity of <b>lactic</b> acid <b>bacteria</b> was determined by PCR-denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis.
