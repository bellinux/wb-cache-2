5|$|The Duchess of Lorraine's love <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> {{was strong}} and possessive. The letters she sent to him shortly before their {{marriage}} expressed her eagerness to see him; his letters, on the other hand, were stereotyped and formal. She was very jealous {{of her husband and}} his infidelity was the greatest problem of their marriage, with Maria Wilhelmina, Princess of Auersperg, as his best-known mistress.|$|E
5|$|After Ronald Reagan {{left the}} White House in 1989, the couple retired {{to their home}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.

5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Juan Perón decided to {{campaign}} for {{the presidency of the}} nation, which he won in a landslide. Eva campaigned heavily <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> during his 1946 presidential bid. Using her weekly radio show, she delivered powerful speeches with heavy populist rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with Perón's movement. Though she had become wealthy from her radio and modeling success, she highlighted her own humble upbringing as a way of showing solidarity with the impoverished classes.|$|E

5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E

She became Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen in 1914, only <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> to lose his title {{with the end of}} World War I in 1918. Charlotte died the following year {{of a heart attack in}} Baden-Baden. She had suffered from a lifetime of ill-health. Most historians now believe she had porphyria, a genetic disease that afflicted other members of the British Royal Family.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a new idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

To secure the defence of the principality, Baldwin tried to persuade her to remarry, but she did not accept his candidates.

She selected a grave site <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> in Section 7 of Arlington National Cemetery close to Marshall's grave. Mrs. Smith was buried next to him after her death in 1963. Smith's papers are in the Eisenhower Presidential Center in Abilene, Kansas.|$|E
5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards {{that there would be}} no recovery <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> from the advanced Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia so she brought him back to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E

5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} {{were few}} after the Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored {{by the lack of}} activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home.

5|$|As {{the trial}} against Ayala begins, his {{pregnant}} wife Helena (Zeta-Jones) learns of her husband's true profession from his associate, Arnie Metzger (Quaid). Facing the prospect of life imprisonment <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> and death threats against her only child, Helena decides to hire Francisco Flores to assassinate Eduardo Ruiz; she knows killing Ruiz will effectively end the trial nolle prosequi. Flores plants a car bomb on a DEA car in an assassination attempt against Ruiz. Shortly after planting the bomb, Flores is assassinated by a sniper in retaliation for his cooperation with General Salazar. The car bomb meant to kill Ruiz instead kills Agent Castro, but Gordon and Ruiz survive.|$|E
