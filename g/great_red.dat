5|$|Planetary atmospheres are {{affected}} by the varying insolation or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot), and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot but twice as large.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot, a {{prominent}} oval-shaped {{feature in the}} southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot in 1831.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{scars from}} the impacts {{could be seen}} on Jupiter for many months. They were {{extremely}} prominent, and observers described them as even more easily visible than the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot. A search of historical observations revealed that the spots were probably the most prominent transient features ever seen on the planet, and that although the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot is notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and darkness of those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an {{atmospheric}} feature {{formed in}} the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot, but smaller. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature—these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A large telescope will show Jupiter's <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot when it faces Earth.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter (5.2AU), at 318 Earth masses, is 2.5 {{times the}} mass {{of all the other}} planets put together. It is {{composed}} largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot. Jupiter has 69 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Other {{atmospheric}} observations {{included a}} swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, {{about the size}} of the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, but it was too distant to show any surface details.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{the understanding of}} the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{our understanding of}} the Galilean moons, and also discovered Jupiter's rings. They also took the first close-up images of the planet's atmosphere, revealing the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot as a complex storm moving in a counter-clockwise direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are called}} sedges by anglers. Individual species emerge en masse at {{different}} times, {{and are used}} one after the other, often {{for only a few}} days each year, as models for artificial fishing flies for fly fishing in trout streams. A mass emergence is known as a hatch. Each type has its own angling name, so for example Mystacides is the dancer; Sericostoma the caperer; Leptocerus the silverhorn; Phryganea the murragh or <b>great</b> <b>red</b> sedge; Brachycentrus subnubilis the grannom; Lepidostoma the silver sedge; Oecetis the longhorn sedge; Cheumatopsyche the little sister sedge; Helicopsyche the speckled Peter, an important fishing fly in North America; and Hydropsyche the specked sedge, perhaps the most important caddisfly genus for anglers with over 50 species of net-makers.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with {{a quarter of}} its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E

After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims and slides of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to explore Jupiter was Pioneer 10, which flew past {{the planet in}} December 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 twelve months later. Pioneer 10 obtained the first-ever close-up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons; the spacecraft studied the planet's atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. Pioneer 11 made its closest approach, within some 34,000km of Jupiter's cloud tops, on December 4, 1974. It obtained dramatic images of the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> Spot, made the first observation of Jupiter's immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon Callisto. The information gathered by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet.|$|E
