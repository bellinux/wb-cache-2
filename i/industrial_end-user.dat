A detailed sensitivity {{analysis of the}} novel CCHP cycle has been investigated in order to evaluate, in terms of energy performance indicators, its potentiality to serve typical trigenerative tertiary and industrial end-users with different fixed operating temperatures. In general, the novel CCHP cycle is characterized by higher energy performance indicators than a separated energy production system. The comparison between the novel CCHP cycle and several commercialized CCHP systems has been performed in the case studies related to tertiary and industrial end-users. The novel CCHP cycle shows a trigenerative capability in wide ranges of the end-users demands without surplus or deficit of the electric or thermal powers. Furthermore, the maximum allowable capital cost of the whole novel CCHP plant (BEPCC), that will assure the profitability of the investment, is calculated in the tertiary and industrial end-users case studies.

40|$|Electricity is {{essential}} for economic development and industrialisation processes. Balancing demand and supply is a recurrent problem in the Nigerian electricity market. The aim of this work is to assess the technical and economic potential of Demand Side Management (DSM) in Nigeria given different future levels of industrialisation.

It does so by designing industrialisation scenarios and consequently deriving different DSM penetration levels using a cost-optimisation model. Findings show that under the high industrialisation scenario by the year 2050 DSM could bring about 7 billion USD in cumulative savings thanks to deferred investment in new generation and full deployment of standby assets along with interruptible programmes for larger industrial users. The paper concludes by providing policy recommendations regarding financial mechanisms to increase DSM deployment in Nigeria.

Multifibres manufactures and distributes industrial cleaning rags to three channels or client categories, these being <b>industrial</b> resellers, <b>industrial</b> <b>end-users</b> and the walk-in customers.

An empirical study was conducted utilising in-depth interviews. The most prevalent, emergent themes that buyers attached the greatest weight to when purchasing cleaning rags were: price; quality; service; relationships; and, convenience.

40|$|Power {{factor is}} a way of {{measuring}} the percentage of reactive power in an electrical system. Reactive power represents wasted energy [...] electricity that does no useful work because the electrical current is out of phase with the voltage. Reactive power is used by inductive loads (such as, motors, transformers, fluorescent lights, arc welders and induction furnaces) to sustain their magnetic fields. Electric systems with many motors exhibit low power factors, increased conductor and transformer losses, and lower voltages. Utilities must supply both active and reactive power and compensate for these losses. Power factor can be improved by the addition of shunt capacitors. Capacitors act in opposition to inductive loads, thereby minimizing the reactive power required to serve them. In raising the power factor, shunt capacitors release energy to the system, reduce system losses, and ultimately decrease power costs. Improving system power factor can reduce reactive and active power losses for both industry and utilities through the addition of shunt capacitors. This Guide Book gives electric utility technical staff, <b>industrial</b> <b>end-users,</b> consultants and BPA employees a step-by-step method for evaluating the cost effectiveness of installing power factor correction capacitors in an industrial plant...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} few years {{particle}} image velocimetry (PIV) has been increasingly used for aerodynamic research and development. This is mainly due to the unique feature of the PIV technique, which allows the recording of a complete velocity field in a plane of the flow within a few microseconds. Thus, PIV provides information about unsteady flow fields, which is difficult to obtain with other experimental techniques. The short acquisition time and fast availability of data reduce the operational time, and hence cost, in large scale test facilities.

In the nonlinear context, domain decomposition methods are mainly used as a solver for the tangent problem solved at each iteration of a NewtonâRaphson algorithm. In case of strongly nonlinear and heterogeneous problems as those encountered in buckling and post-buckling, this procedure may lead to severe difficulties regarding convergence and efficiency. The problem of convergence is regarded as the most critical issue at the industrial level. Indeed if a method, which can show efficiency for some problems, is not robust with respect to convergence the method will not be implemented by <b>industrial</b> <b>end-users.</b> Therefore, two paths are explored to gain robustness when making use of domain decomposition methods: (1) a nonlinear localization strategy which may also improve the robustness by treating the nonlinearity at the subdomain level; and (2) a mixed framework allowing to circumvent the problem of local divergence (i. e. at the subdomain level). It is to be noted that those two ingredients may also be used to improve the numerical efficiency of the method {{but this is not the}} main focus of the paper.
