50|$|Pelvic floor {{dysfunctions}} {{may include}} {{any of a}} group of clinical conditions that includes urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, sensory and emptying abnormalities of the lower urinary tract, defecatory dysfunction, sexual dysfunction and several chronic pain syndromes, including vulvodynia. The three most common and definable conditions encountered clinically are urinary incontinence, anal incontinence and pelvic female <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pelvic organ {{prolapse}} (POP), {{also known}} as female <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse,</b> is characterized by descent of female genital organs beyond their normal anatomical confines. The condition usually occurs when the pelvic floor collapses {{as a result of}} childbirth or heavy lifting which can tear soft tissues, i.e. herniating fascia membranes so that the vaginal wall collapses, resulting in cystocele, rectocele or both. Remediation typically involves dietary and lifestyle changes, physical therapy, or surgery.|$|E
50|$|Vaginal {{gas that}} {{involves}} strong odor or fecal matter {{may be a}} result of colovaginal fistula, a serious condition involving a tear between the vagina and colon, which can result from surgery, child birth, diseases (such as Crohn's disease), and other causes. This condition can lead to urinary tract infection and other complications. Vaginal gas can also be a symptom of an internal female <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse,</b> a condition most often caused by childbirth.|$|E
40|$|Estrogen {{deficit in}} {{postmenopausal}} women causes urogenital atrophy, {{which is responsible}} {{for a wide range of}} urinary disorders (urinary incontinence, urge incontinence, recurrent urinary infections) and <b>genital</b> disorders (<b>prolapse,</b> dispareunya, vaginal dryness). The efficacy of estrogen therapy on urinary incontinence is not yet demonstrated, but it is widely recognized that the topical use of estrogens lowers the risk of recurrent urinary infections and improves urogenital atrophy...|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomic}} {{structures in}} the female that prevent incontinence and <b>genital</b> organ <b>prolapse</b> on increases in abdominal pressure during daily activities include sphincteric and supportive systems. In the urethra, {{the action of the}} vesical neck and urethral sphincteric mechanisms maintains urethral closure pressure above bladder pressure. Decreases in the number of striated muscle fibers of the sphincter occur with age and parity. A supportive hammock under the urethra and vesical neck provides a firm backstop against which the urethra is compressed during increases in abdominal pressure to maintain urethral closure pressures above the rapidly increasing bladder pressure. This supporting layer consists of the anterior vaginal wall and the connective tissue that attaches it to the pelvic bones through the pubovaginal portion of the levator ani muscle, and the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments comprising the tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia. At rest the levator ani maintains closure of the urogenital hiatus. They are additionally recruited to maintain hiatal closure in the face of inertial loads related to visceral accelerations as well as abdominal pressurization in daily activities involving recruitment of the abdominal wall musculature and diaphragm. Vaginal birth is associated with an increased risk of levator ani defects, as well as <b>genital</b> organ <b>prolapse</b> and urinary incontinence. Computer models indicate that vaginal birth places the levator ani under tissue stretch ratios of up to 3. 3 and the pudendal nerve under strains of up to 33 %, respectively. Research is needed to better identify the pathomechanics of these conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Arnold Henry Kegel [...] (born February 1894; death date {{variously}} {{reported as}} 1972; March 1, 1972; 1976; and 1981) was an American gynecologist {{who invented the}} Kegel perineometer (an instrument for measuring the strength of voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) and Kegel exercises (squeezing of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor) as non-surgical treatment of genital relaxation. Today pelvic floor exercises are widely held as first-line treatment for urinary stress incontinence and female <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse,</b> with evidence supporting its use from systematic reviews of randomized trials in the Cochrane Library amongst others. Kegel first published his ideas in 1948. He was Assistant Professor of Gynecology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.|$|E
5000|$|He {{promoted}} gynaecology in the Netherlands as {{a separate}} speciality, {{partly because of the}} new surgical possibilities following the discoveries of anaesthesia and antisepsis and in 1889 he started a private gynaecological clinic at the Sarphatistraat in Amsterdam. In his clinic he devoted himself to the surgery of ovarian tumours, uterus myomatosus and <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse,</b> but also to the diagnosis and treatment of supposed inflammations of the cervix and endometrium as cause of psychological disorders. In this he followed the opinions of contemporary English gynaecologists. As he was not aware of physiological histology, he nearly always found signs of inflammation. He treated this with curettage and drastic caustics, sometimes after using a dilation knife (hysterotome) for the cervix. At {{the turn of the twentieth}} century Dutch gynaecologists such as Treub and Nijhoff began to cast doubt on such theories of [...] "reflex neurosis", but Mendes de Leon persisted in his views.|$|E
5000|$|A Kegel perineometer or vaginal {{manometer}} is {{an instrument}} for measuring the strength of voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles. Arnold Kegel (1894-1981) was the gynecologist who invented the Kegel Perineometer (used for measuring vaginal air pressure) and Kegel exercises (squeezing of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor). This followed the observation that muscles of the pelvic floor inevitably weakened following the trauma of childbirth. [...] Ascertaining the air pressure inside the vagina by insertion of a perineometer, while requesting the woman to squeeze as hard as possible, indicates whether or not she would benefit from strengthening the vaginal muscles using the Kegel exercises. More modern electromyograph (EMG) perineometers, which measure electrical activity in the pelvic floor muscles, may be more effective in this purpose. [...] Assessment of pelvic floor strength during gynaecological examination may help to identify women with fascial defects of the pelvic floor, as well as those at risk of <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> or urinary incontinence. Both the Kegel perineometer and a digital examination are effective and concordant in their results in this assessment.|$|E

30|$|<b>Genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> and urinary {{incontinence}} {{might be seen}} concomitantly in the same patient. They might cause cystocele and micturition difficulties (Kızılkaya 2002). The present study revealed a significant correlation between UI and prolapses. In a previous study, {{it was determined that}} among women aged over 65  years, the risk of {{urinary incontinence}} was higher in women with a <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> compared to women without a <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> (Bilgili et al. 2008). It is thought that the damage to the nerves and muscles in the pelvic floor is the main causative factor regarding the development of the POP. Therefore, if the <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> is developed, urinary and anal incontinence might develop in the same patient (Meschia et al. 2002).|$|E
30|$|Clinical work-up of the {{patients}} included entry history taking and thorough examination with stress on patients’ complaints including type and duration of pelvic pain, coital-related pain, or abnormal vaginal discharge or backache. Infertile women were clearly informed that this study is not designed to help fertility. Patients with a clear potential cause of their complaints were excluded from this study, e.g., pelvic endometriosis, adenomyosis uteri, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, adnexal masses, pelvic inflammatory disease, or <b>genital</b> <b>prolapsed.</b> With the aid of transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS), uterine cysts appeared as a well defined hypoechogenic area not associated with uterine myomata or adenomyosis uterii. Uterine cysts more than 2  cm in diameter were included in this study. The relationship of the uterine cyst to the endometrial cavity or the cervical canal was meticulously defined. Comment on its size, fluid content, and borders were also reported. In case of suspicion, saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) was performed {{in the same manner}} as previously described [1]. The couple was counseled for interventional 2 D transvaginal sonographic aspiration of the cyst aiming at relief of the symptoms. Patients with corporeal cysts gave a written consent for laparoscopy in case of failed sonographic aspiration in the same operative setting. All procedures were done immediately postmenstrual. Under general anesthesia, TVS was performed. Sonographically guided aspiration of the cyst was done utilizing a 16 -gauge aspiration needle principally designed for egg retrieval for assisted reproductive technique but used under higher pressure of the ordinary operating room suction unit at maximal power (− 0.8 to − 1  bar) since the cyst content is usually different from the watery follicular fluid. The needle was loaded into an adaptor fitted to the vaginal probe. The procedure was considered completed once the cyst is seen entirely collapsed. The fluid content was subjected to cytologic examination after proper fixation with 95 % alcohol. Failed access or aspiration of the viscid thick fluid content of corporeal cysts despite increased pressure of the suction unit were indication for operative laparoscopy in the same setting guided by the preoperative sonographic localization. Using a fine monopolar microneedle, a small incision was made over the cyst followed by drainage of its contents. The edges of the incision were coagulated with spray coagulation. The cyst content was aspirated for cytologic examination. On the other hand, if a part of the corporeal or cervical cyst is seen bulging into the endometrial or endocervical cavity respectively, a decision of hysteroscopic drainage was made. If an endocervical cyst was diagnosed, a sharp microscissors loaded into the side channel of the 7 -mm operative hysteroscopy was used to puncture the cyst. If not accessible, a hook electrode of monopolar resectoscope was utilized for puncture and drainage. The same instrument was used to drain any cyst bulging into the endometrial cavity. Transabdominal sonographic monitoring may be required in some difficult cases.|$|R

40|$|Background. <b>Genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> is {{a common}} and handicapping form of pelvic floor dysfunction. To explain its genesis {{as a result of}} endopelvic {{connective}} tissue weakness, the collagen state was analyzed in women with and without <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse.</b> Methods. Punch biopsies from the paraurethral ligaments were obtained during the operation from 22 women undergoing surgery for <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse.</b> As controls, similar biopsies were taken from 13 women who underwent gynecologic surgery for other benign reasons. Collagen concentration as hydroxyproline and its extractability by pepsin digestion were studied in relation to age by multiple regression, two-way ANOVA, Levene's test, and Student's t-test. Histological examination was also performed. Results. Women, younger than 53 years, with <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> had a 30 % lower collagen concentration than age-matched controls, which reached significance, P = 0. 01. The extractability by pepsin digestion, an indicator of cross-links in the collagen molecule, did not significantly differ between groups. It did, however, decrease significantly with age in both prolapse patient and control groups. Morphology supported these findings with a less-dense extracellular matrix composition subepithelially in <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> compared to a healthy control. Conclusion. For the first time, we show that young women with <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> have a decreased collagen concentration, suggesting a different organization of the endopelvic connective tissue extracellular matrix. Furthermore, these alterations differ from those earlier found in younger women with stress urinary incontinence...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{incidence}} of <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> depends on numerous factors. The contribution of race, gender and genetic factors is significant. However, additional factors of initiation, promotion and decomposition are necessary {{if a person}} with the genetic predisposition to <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> begins to suffer from it. At least 50 % of parous women are believed to suffer from <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> of various degrees. Moreover, the prevalence of <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> increases with age. The prevalence of <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> {{is expected to be}} even higher in the future due to the extension of the lifespan of women worldwide. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the most common etiologic factors in the development of <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse</b> in the population of Serbia. Methods The study was conducted as prospective and included 50 women who underwent surgical treatment due to the problems caused by <b>genital</b> <b>prolapse.</b> Results Mean age of the women was 58. 74 years. Twenty percent of the women had the menstrual cycle, while 80 % were in menopause. Mean menopause period was 8. 88 years. None of the women used hormone replacement therapy. Mean BMI was 27. 395 kg/m 2. Twenty-eight percent of the women were of normal weight, while 72 % of the women were obese (42 % were obese and 30 % were severely obese). Ninety-eight percent of the women were parous, and mean parity was 2. 08. Mean birth weight of neonates was 3682. 77 g. Sixty-four percent of the women did physical labour and lifted heavy objects. Conclusion Vaginal childbirth is one of the most important initiating factors. The most significant promoting factor is obesity and heavy labour. Ageing and entering menopause are the most important factors of decomposition as well as the occurrence of clinical manifestations of the pelvic floor dysfunction. ...|$|E
