5000|$|The {{nature of}} <b>gift</b> <b>economies</b> forms {{the subject of}} a {{foundational}} debate in anthropology. Anthropological research into <b>gift</b> <b>economies</b> began with Bronisław Malinowski's description of the Kula ring in the Trobriand Islands during World War I. The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like since Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a return. Malinowski's debate with the French anthropologist Marcel Mauss quickly established the complexity of [...] "gift exchange" [...] and introduced a series of technical terms such as reciprocity, inalienable possessions, and prestation to distinguish between the different forms of exchange.|$|R

25|$|The use of barter-like methods may {{date back}} to at least 100,000 years ago, {{though there is no}} {{evidence}} of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter.

50|$|According to anthropologists Maurice Bloch and Jonathan Parry, {{it is the}} {{unsettled}} {{relationship between}} market and non-market exchange that attracts the most attention. <b>Gift</b> <b>economies</b> are said, by some, to build communities, and that the market serves as an acid on those relationships.|$|R
50|$|The commodification of {{information}} is about how information that was free is appropriated by the vectoral class.

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{community}} or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores {{is related to}} remix culture. She proposes a possible model of scholarly writing that collects and compiles work in illuminating ways.

She suggests that scholars use a Creative Commons license for scholarly work to facilitate the use and reuse of material for the collective benefit of the community.|$|E
25|$|Since every {{household}} {{was almost}} entirely self-sufficient, {{there was very}} little need for trade. Goods and services were exchanged, but a household's survival did not depend on it. In the course of bringing in various resources, it was natural that a given household would reap a windfall of a particular resource, be it a large harvest of apricots, wheat, or a large bison that was brought back by the hunters, etc. When a household found itself with a plentiful supply of a particular resource, it did not necessarily mean that the surplus would be traded in the modern sense of the word, but rather, the surplus would probably be given away to others in the community who could use whatever resource they had on hand, with no thought of reciprocation or direct realized return {{on the part of the}} gifters. This is the basis of a <b>gift</b> <b>economy,</b> which has been observed in many hunter-gatherer or subsistence farmer cultures, and that was most likely the same with the Cucuteni-Trypillia society, at least during the early period of the culture.|$|E
500|$|One {{approach}} to this dilemma has been the attempt to [...] "internalize" [...] these [...] "externalities" [...] by using market strategies like ecotaxes and incentives, tradeable permits for carbon, and the encouragement of payment for ecosystem services. Community currencies associated with Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS), a <b>gift</b> <b>economy</b> and Time Banking have also been promoted {{as a way of}} supporting local economies and the environment. Green economics is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment. The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world's carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years.|$|E

Scholars have noted that the term [...] "social" [...] cannot account for technological features of the social network platforms alone. Hence, the level of network sociability should determine by the actual performances of its users. According to the communication theory of uses and gratifications, an increasing number of individuals are looking to the Internet and social media to fulfill cognitive, affective, personal integrative, social integrative, and tension free needs. With Internet technology as a supplement to fulfill needs, it is in turn affecting every day life, including relationships, school, church, entertainment, and family. Companies are using social media as a way to learn about potential employees' personalities and behavior. In numerous situations a candidate who might otherwise have been hired has been rejected due to offensive or otherwise unseemly photos or comments posted to social networks or appearing on a newsfeed.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{collectivist}} anarchists do {{not oppose}} {{the use of}} currency. Some support workers being paid based {{on the amount of}} time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase commodities in a communal market. This contrasts with anarcho-communism where wages would be abolished, and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods [...] "to each according to his need." [...] Many modern-day collectivist anarchists hold their form of anarchism as a permanent society rather than a carryover to anarcho-communism or a <b>gift</b> <b>economy.</b> Some collectivist anarchists such as proponents of participatory economics believe in remuneration and a form of credit but do not believe in money or markets.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Unesco Courier, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the René Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne) explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the <b>gift</b> <b>economy,</b> as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: [...] "Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him {{to do the same for}} you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity." [...] Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—"economic rationality"—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by [...] "economic rationality." [...] This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are various}} social {{theories}} concerning <b>gift</b> <b>economies.</b> Some consider the gifts to {{be a form}} of reciprocal altruism.

Consider for example, the sharing of food in some hunter-gatherer societies, where food-sharing is a safeguard against the failure of any individual's daily foraging.

In place of a market, anarcho-communists, such as those who inhabited some Spanish villages in the 1930s, support a currency-less <b>gift</b> <b>economy</b> where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as payment for their production of goods and services.|$|E

25|$|Marcel Mauss is {{recognized}} as one of the first authors interested in the study of <b>gift</b> <b>economies.</b> His main concern centered on individuals' need to provide gifts and the obligations to reciprocate them. He identified human obligation to give, receive, and reciprocate as the most important factor in the creation and maintenance of social ties. Reciprocation was mainly produced by the insertion of the giver's identity in the object that was given. The object maintained this essence (referred to as hau or mana by Mauss) of the giver which needed to return to him/her through reciprocation in the form of a counter-gift (another object, services, person, agreements, etc.).|$|R
