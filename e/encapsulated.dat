40|$|A unified {{microfluidic}} {{approach is}} presented for flexible fabrication of oil-encapsulated calcium alginate microfibers. The oil <b>encapsulate</b> phase was directly {{injected into the}} gelling alginate fiber, thus allowing the adjustable tuning of the <b>encapsulate</b> geometry ranging from spherical to prolate ellipsoid, plug-like and tubular shapes. Phase maps were developed that show the conditions required to achieve desired fiber morphologies with intended <b>encapsulate</b> phase ratio. We also show for very first time how oil <b>encapsulates</b> can be selectively grouped across the microfibers. A force-balance model, validated against a non-gelling system, was introduced to predict the size of spherical <b>encapsulates...</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Sclerosing <b>encapsulating</b> {{peritonitis}} {{is a rare}} {{condition of}} unknown cause with reported high mortality and mobidity. It is treated surgically {{and it is difficult}} to diagnose preoperatively since it has no specific imaging findings. We present a case report of idiopathic sclerosing <b>encapsulating</b> peritonitis-mesenteritis with a literature review on this pathologic entity. Sclerosing <b>encapsulating</b> peritonitis-mesenteritis is an intestinal wall lesion which causes obstructive bowel symptoms. The idiopathic expression of the disease is a rare entity which is treated surgically as there are several operative options. The management of the sclerosing <b>encapsulating</b> peritonitis-mesenteritis is followed by a complication rate of 38 %- 90 % and a mortality rate of 60 %- 71 %. 1 Key words: Sclerosing peritonitis, mesenteritis, <b>encapsulating</b> peritoniti...|$|R
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 <b>encapsulated</b> eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing <b>encapsulated</b> eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E

40|$|Sclerosing <b>encapsulating</b> {{peritonitis}} is {{an uncommon}} but potentially lethal condition, {{which can lead}} to severe complications such as bowel obstruction, enterocutaneous fistualas and necrosis. The treatment is debated because of the high morbidity and mortality of the surgical approach. The aim {{of this study was to}} contribute to achieving a better approach to surgical treatment of sclerosing <b>encapsulating</b> peritonitis. This report describes an even rarer case of idiopathic sclerosing <b>encapsulating</b> peritonitis diagnosed intraoperatively, observed in the Insubria University Department of Surgery in Varese, Italy, where surgery was mandatory due to the sudden onset of the disease and lack of a definitive diagnosis. Temporary ileostomy and partial resection of the peritoneum were performed. At present (December 2002) the patient is alive and well. Management of sclerosing <b>encapsulating</b> peritonitis is controversial, but the surgical treatment should be as conservative as possible.

5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made in such places as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were <b>encapsulated</b> as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.|$|E
5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions <b>encapsulated</b> {{all that}} {{was wrong with the}} Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians {{highlight}} the affair {{as one of the most}} significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the <b>encapsulated</b> dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
