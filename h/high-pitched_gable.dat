You have then, observed, {{two great}} principles, {{as far as}} {{northern}} architecture is concerned; first, that the pointed arch {{is to be the}} means by which the weight of the wall or roof is to be sustained; secondly, that the steep gable is the form most proper for the roof itself. And now observe this most interesting fact, that all the loveliest Gothic architecture in the world is based on the group of lines composed of the pointed arch and the gable. If you look at the beautiful apse of Amiens Cathedral--a work justly celebrated over all Europe--you will find it formed merely of a series of windows surmounted by pure gables of open work. If you look at the transept porches of Rouen, or at the great and celebrated porch of the Cathedral of Rheims, or that of Strasbourg, Bayeux, Amiens, or Peterborough, still you will see that these lovely compositions are nothing more than richly decorated forms of gable over pointed arch. But more than this, you must be all well aware how fond our best architectural artists are of the street effects of foreign cities; and even those now present who have not personally visited any of the continental towns must remember, I should think, some of the many interesting drawings by Mr. Prout, Mr. Nash, and other excellent draughtsmen, which have for many years adorned our exhibitions. Now, the principal charm of all those continental street effects is dependent on the houses having <b>high-pitched</b> <b>gable</b> roofs. In the Netherlands, and Northern France, where the material for building is brick or stone, the fronts of the stone gables are raised above the roofs, and you have magnificent and grotesque ranges of steps or curves decorated with various ornaments, succeeding one another in endless perspective along the streets of Antwerp, Ghent, or Brussels. In Picardy and Normandy, again, and many towns of Germany, where the material for building is principally wood, the roof is made to project over the gables, fringed with a beautifully carved cornice, and casting a broad shadow down the house front. This is principally seen at Abbeville, Rouen, Lisieux, and others of the older towns of France. But, in all cases, the effect of the whole street depends on the prominence of the gables; not only of the fronts towards the streets, but of the sides also, set with small garret or dormer windows, each of the most fantastic and beautiful form, and crowned with a little spire or pinnacle. Wherever there is a little winding stair, or projecting bow window, or any other irregularity of form, the steep ridges shoot into turrets and small spires, as in fig. 8,[6] each in its turn crowned by a fantastic ornament, covered with curiously shaped slates or shingles, or crested with long fringes of rich ironwork, so that, seen from above and from a distance, the intricate grouping of the roofs of a French city is no less interesting than its actual streets; and in the streets themselves, the masses of broad shadow which the roofs form against the sky, are a most important background to the bright and sculptured surfaces of the walls.|$|E

The imposing two-storey station building has a strong Victorian character with their <b>high-pitched</b> <b>gables</b> and round-headed sash windows. The building is in a similar style to Lymington Town railway station which dates from the same period, a resemblance which {{may be explained by}} the fact that the construction of both the Lymington Branch Line and the S&SR was overseen by John Cass Birkinshaw who was replaced as engineer on the S&SR after the company's directors blamed him for the line's slow construction.|$|R

50|$|It {{was at the}} Little Theatre that Dillon met a then unknown {{aspiring}} actor 17-years {{her junior}} named W. C. Gable, while she {{was working as a}} stage director for the Red Lantern Players. Initially, she was Gable's acting coach but the two began a romantic relationship after Dillon took a special interest in Gable. Dillon became his patron, paying to have his teeth fixed and hair styled. She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture. She spent considerable time training his naturally <b>high-pitched</b> voice, which <b>Gable</b> slowly managed to lower, and to gain better resonance and tone. As his speech habits improved, Gable's facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After the long period of rigorous training, Dillon eventually considered him ready to attempt a film career in Los Angeles.|$|R
60|$|One {{feature of}} the Norman temple he could keep; for it was copied from the same nature which {{he was trying to}} copy--namely, the <b>high-pitched</b> roof and <b>gables.</b> Mr. Ruskin lays it down as a law, that the acute angle in roofs, gables, spires, is the {{distinguishing}} mark of northern Gothic. It was adopted, most probably, at first from domestic buildings. A northern house or barn must have a high-pitched roof: or the snow will not slip off it. But that fact was not discovered by man; it was copied by him from the rocks around. He saw the mountain peak jut black and bare above the snows of winter; he saw those snows slip down in sheets, rush down in torrents under the sun, from the steep slabs of rock which coped the hill-side; and he copied, in his roofs, the rocks above his town. But as the love for decoration arose, he would deck his roofs as nature had decked hers, till the grey sheets of the cathedral slates should stand out amid pinnacles and turrets rich with foliage, as the grey mountain sides stood out amid knolls of feathery birch and towering pine.|$|R

A post office opened in 1895 and a land office in 1899 in {{anticipation}} of the land rush which soon ensued. In 1899, Knox Presbyterian Church was founded with its building constructed in 1906 in the <b>high-pitched</b> <b>gable</b> roof and arches, standing as a testimony to the faith and optimism in the Weyburn area. Weyburn was legally constituted a village in 1900, a town in 1903 and finally as a city in 1913. From 1910 until 1931 the Weyburn Security Bank was headquartered in the city.|$|E
50|$|For its new {{building}} on South Michigan Avenue at 20th Street (now Cullerton), the congregation again turned to James Renwick.

The exterior is clad in limestone with sandstone trim. Sculpture on the exterior is limited; the Four Evangelists {{and the head of}} Jesus appear on the entry wall on Michigan and gargoyles loom from the bell tower. The interior was also thoroughly Gothic, with pointed arches leading to the side aisles, slender iron columns supporting the balcony, and extensive stenciling adorning the walls. The sanctuary in the {{new building}} was dedicated in 1874.|$|E
5000|$|St. Paul's Church {{follows a}} cross-shaped plan that {{measures}} 65 by 33 ft. [...] It is eclectic in style {{in that it}} combines the Shingle Style and Gothic Revival decorative elements that are expressed through different types of materials. The lowest level of the exterior is brick, above which are narrow clapboards up to the imposts of the lancet windows, and shingling above that to the eaves. Shingling is also found on the main facade. The structure is capped by a busy roofscape. The main roof is a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>gable</b> that features small triangular dormers. The transepts have hip roofs, and they too have small dormers. The narthex's gable roof sits at a right angle to the main roof. There is another hipped roof over the central bay of the narthex that houses the baptistery.|$|E
50|$|The {{portion of}} the house dating to 1830 is a -story stone house, {{measuring}} 20 by 40 feet.

The second story {{of the house is}} wood framed, and the center of the house has a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>gable,</b> both dating to the 1875 addition. The door placement and window placement on the first floor are original to the 1830 plans of the house. In 1890 and 1906, brick kitchen additions were made {{to the rear of the}} house. The first floor interior of the house has two nearly identical rooms, divided by a central corridor with a staircase. The north room opens into the kitchen at the rear. The second floor has two bedrooms, both nearly identical. In the back yard of the house stands a brick garage built in 1904, which is a contributing resource to the house listing.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is rectangular with a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>gable</b> roof. On {{the south is}} a small gabled bay and entry porch. It is a brick structure with a slate roof in a Tudor Revival style. The roofline is outlined by an ogee-shaped cornice with returns. The brickwork is a Flemish bond, with decorative coursing in the foundation area. The double chimney is corbelled on the east facade. The main entry is on the south next to the bay window. A small porch extends from the main roof over the door. East of the entry is a polygonal bay window, with five, large, leaded glass windows. Each window has a stained glass flower decoration. The brickwork is intricate limestone trim. The bay window is topped by a gable in a half-timbered design with quatrefoil decorative elements.The west façade was built with a Palladian style window grouping and a circular ventilator in the gable area. A later addition {{to provide access to}} the basement area has altered this façade. A 1969 addition on the north façade used concrete block.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, the Richard Henry Dana Branch {{and several}} other branch {{libraries}} in Los Angeles {{were added to the}} National Register of Historic Places as part of a thematic group submission. [...] The application noted that the branch libraries had been constructed in a variety of period revival styles to house the initial branch library system of the City of Los Angeles. With respect to the Dana Branch, the application described the building as a charming one-story New England Colonial Revival Style building. It is designed in an L-plan with a <b>high-pitched</b> <b>gable</b> roof. The portico features paired wood paneled doors with an arched canopy supported by paneled posts. [...] It was initially creamy green with a deep green roof. In 2001, ground was broken {{for the construction of a}} new branch library in Cypress Park. The new branch, with 35,000 books, several computer stations and a community meeting room, is three times larger than the schoolhouse-type library branch on Pepper Avenue that served Cypress Park since 1927. There were plans to use the old branch as a senior citizens center.|$|E
5000|$|The Spring Creek Meeting House-H Street Mission was an {{historic}} building in Oskaloosa, Iowa, United States. The frame building was built sometime after an 1878 fire destroyed the original meeting house. It was relocated {{from its original}} rural location to this site in 1895. The Spring Creek Meeting was organized in 1844 outside of town. It calls attention to {{the movement of the}} Quakers from a rural setting to a central location in town. After its relocation it became a mission of the Oskaloosa Monthly Meeting. This illustrates the evangelical nature of the Iowa Yearly Meeting after the Schism of 1877, and their willingness to proselytize in order to rectify the decline in membership on the frontier. Such a move was an anomaly among Eastern Quakers. The architecture itself shows a shift in Quaker meeting houses in Iowa from structures that were long and low to this one with its <b>high-pitched</b> <b>gable</b> roof. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The building has subsequently been torn down.|$|E
