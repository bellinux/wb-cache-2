25|$|A 2008 {{study of}} 227 {{undergraduate}} and graduate students enrolled in web-enabled courses at the Naval War College (NWC) and a public university found that social loafing not only exists, but may also be prevalent in the online learning classroom. Although only 2% of NWC and 8% of public university students self-reported social loafing, 8% of NWC and 77% of public university students indicated the perception of others engaging in social loafing. Additional findings generally verify face-to-face social loafing findings <b>from</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> The researchers conclude that injustice {{in the distribution of}} rewards increases social loafing, and suggest that self-perceived dominance negatively affects individual participation in group activities.|$|E

[...] Also, there are no discernible differences in the magnetic orientation recorded by any of the Cinder Cone lava flows, and so the flows had to be extruded during an interval of less than 50 years.|$|E

Abdominal aorta is {{a portion}} of the aorta vessel in the abdomen which many cardiovascular diseases often occur. Approach: Abdominal aortic wall was considered as 1 layers- 3 dimensional cylindrical geometry and homogeneous, incompressible and anisotropic material. Deformation of aortic wall was elastic deformation. Numerical method was used in our simulation. The abdominal aorta was under luminal loading of pressure in physiological pressure range of mice. Experimental parameters <b>from</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> were used as initial configuration of present study. To verify present simulation, the simulation results were compared with the experimental data <b>from</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study.</b> Results: <b>From</b> the simulation, the wall thickness decreased, whereas the diameter, lumen cross-sectional area increased with internal pressures. The magnitude of radial stress, longitudinal stress and circumferential stress increased with increasing internal pressure and values were largest at the inside surface. The radial stress was obviously compressive and varied from a value equal to the negative of the internal pressure at the inside to zero at the outside. Conclusion: Stress-strain analysis of abdominal aortic wall in a case of 3 D geometry simulation can be simulated using numerical model. This model had been verified with experimental data <b>from</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study.</b> Good agreement was obtained. Mathematical model which considering aortic wall by using finite element method could be beneficially used as addition data for medical diagnosis...|$|R
