5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as <b>having</b> <b>two</b> major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II lossy audio compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as multiplexing technology, allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E

The species formerly known as Thespesius edmontoni or Anatosaurus edmontoni represents immature individuals.|$|E

5|$|In December 2015, Miami-Dade Transit {{initiated}} a monthlong pilot program for express service between key stations during rush hours. During morning rush, many stations are skipped {{from the north}} and south en route to downtown, and in the afternoon, stations are skipped as the trains leave downtown. The service was well received, though it only saved a few minutes' time, partially due to the headway limitations with a system only <b>having</b> <b>two</b> tracks. The service continued past December.|$|E

Baker's work has also been published in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, Australia, Japan and Russia.|$|E

The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; <b>having</b> <b>two</b> alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E
