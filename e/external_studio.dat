25|$|Development on Sakura Wars {{lasted for}} {{approximately}} three years, double the original estimate. Hiroi acted {{as the general}} producer, while Ito acted as general director. The CGI segments were developed by Buildup Entertainment and Neverland; the anime sequences were handled by Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie. Sega initially outsourced programming to an unnamed external company, and by 1995 it had already developed one or two chapters of the game's combat-based content before Hiroi objected to the direction the game was taking, becoming a generic simulation game that deviated from his vision. Red Company refused to continue development of the prototype, and the <b>external</b> <b>studio</b> was removed from development. Eager to see the game completed, duties were transferred to Sega's internal studio Sega CS2 R, which would co-develop the game with Red Company. The conflicting gameplay elements needed to be divided between different teams within Sega CS2 R, only bringing the two parts together {{at the end of}} development. Due to this development technique, none of the elements could be effectively tested until the game was close to completion. Due to these various development difficulties, the Sega team found production difficult. Sega also commented in an interview that Sakura Wars was their most expensive video game production to date, although no exact budget was given.|$|E

Halo 4 is 343 Industries' first original title within the Halo series—previously, {{development of the}} main series was undertaken by Bungie, {{the creator of the}} franchise. In the developmental process, 343 Industries decided to explore the Forerunner fiction within the Halo universe, leading the team to design a new setting, enemies, and main antagonist. Existing characters and assets received visual overhauls and motion capture was used for animation within cutscenes. A goal for Halo 4s story was to incorporate more human elements; to achieve this, the developers chose to delve more deeply into {{the relationship between the two}} protagonists, Master Chief and Cortana.

50|$|Kingsglaive {{was made}} {{as part of}} a planned {{multimedia}} expansion of Final Fantasy XV to negate having to develop a series of games using the setting and characters. Beginning production in 2014 by the same team that created Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children (2005), Kingsglaive used discarded concepts from the original version of Final Fantasy XVs story, while creating a self-contained experience with a dedicated cast and relatable plot. Multiple <b>external</b> <b>studios</b> were brought in to help complete the project within the short development time. Its announcement was delayed to 2016 due to the early reveal of Final Fantasy XV.

50|$|TEN-10's {{broadcast}} {{facilities have}} been in the inner city suburb of Pyrmont since 1997. These studios feature a large open plan newsroom and news-set where all Ten's national and local Sydney news bulletins are produced. This facility is also the network's head office and broadcasts the network signal to other cities. When TEN-10 opened in 1965, it operated from newly built studio facilities at North Ryde, these were sold in the 1990s when the network underwent financial turmoil. The North Ryde complex, which was used by Global Television in recent years, was demolished in September 2007. Following the move from North Ryde in 1990, TEN relocated to a small warehouse in Ultimo, followed by their final move to the new studios in Pyrmont in May 1997. Most series are produced on location or at <b>external</b> <b>studios</b> by <b>external</b> companies, but a few programs are made in-house by TEN.|$|R
50|$|Yoshi's 4th studio LP is {{the largest}} and most ambitious project to date.

Consequently, 'Yes,' is also the first of Misdaq's albums to be recorded exclusively at an <b>external</b> recording <b>studio</b> (Cue Recording in Falls Church, Virginia). The album was made available as a digital pre-order on 1 February, and will be released on Valentines Day, 2013.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{preparation}} for Stella Deuss development {{began in the}} second half of 2002, when the project was first proposed to the developer and publisher. After initial approval, a twelve-person team was set up to create a test version in November of that year. By December, the test build was completed and the team was given permission to begin full development. The initial proposal was then fleshed out into an entire game, including the scenario and gameplay basics. Once these had been finalized, production began in earnest. The game's Beta version was completed in early 2004. Between then and the game's release, the team worked hard to finish and debug the game. The development was handled by Atlus and <b>external</b> <b>studio</b> Pinegrow, which included staff from earlier Japanese tactical RPG Hoshigami. Some programming work was outsourced to company Designer 7. Among the staff were Atlus director Akiyasu Yamamoto, and scenario supervisor Ryo Mizuno, author of the Record of Lodoss War fantasy novel series. The story Yamamoto's earlier work as a debugger for Atlus proved useful during the final stages of development. The gameplay was described by Pinegrow staff as an improved version of the battle system used in Hoshigami. The game's story revolved around religions conflict, focusing on the Aeque faith, Dignus' attempts to undermine it, and the main cast's position between the two factions. While described as a spiritual successor to Hoshigami, Atlus said that it was not a sequel to it, instead being its own game.|$|E
50|$|The {{story of}} Ziggy was always part of series creator Tetsuya Takahashi's {{plan for the}} Xenosaga project, but Monolith Soft had yet to decide in what form it should be presented. Takahashi later stated that Ziggy's story was {{originally}} part of the planned scenario for Xenosaga Episode II. The team were then contacted by the mobile development division of series publisher Namco, asking whether Monolith Soft could work with them on a mobile property. The team {{decided to use the}} mobile game to communicate Ziggy's story and agreed to the collaboration. Namco Mobile developed the game, while Monolith Soft handled the story development. <b>External</b> <b>studio</b> Tom Create helped develop the game. The creation of Pied Piper formed part of a move by the newly-established lead developers of Xenosaga to expand the series into other media following the release of Episode I. The game's script was co-written by series creators Tetsuya Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. Pied Piper was Saga's last contribution to the Xenosaga series prior to leaving the project in 2005. The game's title is a reference to the German fable of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. Pied Piper was first announced in July 2004. The game was originally published exclusively for Vodafone devices, a version was released on 5 July 2006 for NTT DoCoMo's i-mode service. The third video game release in the Xenosaga series, the game is one of two games to remain exclusive to Japan.|$|E
500|$|Kingsglaive was {{primarily}} developed by Visual Works, {{a division of}} Final Fantasy developer Square Enix dedicated {{to the creation of}} CGI cutscenes. The director was Takeshi Nozue. Nozue's previous notable experience with feature-length productions was [...] (2005). While he had been co-director of Advent Children, he was sole director of Kingsglaive. Hajime Tabata, the director of Final Fantasy XV, acted as producer. While compared upon reveal to Advent Children, it was stressed that the two served very different purposes: while Advent Children was designed for fans of its parent title Final Fantasy VII (1997), Kingsglaive was intended for both prospective players of Final Fantasy XV and people new to the Final Fantasy series, acting as an entry point into the narrative of Final Fantasy XV. The project was also much greater in scale than Advent Children, requiring help from multiple <b>external</b> <b>studios.</b> Nozue later commented that another aspect of Kingsglaive was to bolster sales of the game's platforms prior to release, with a movie offering a greater means of reaching potential buyers. Production work on Kingsglaive began three years prior to its release, with full development beginning in 2014 after an extended period of preparatory work. From this point, production lasted approximately two and a half years.|$|R

Due to a low budget, the developers offered Sonic Picnic royalties, which Sonic Picnic accepted due to being impressed by the prototype. Developers stated that this process kept them motivated to finish the game. The voice samples for the characters and units were created by recording the various developers and putting their voices in the game.|$|R

Early versions of Madden were created by <b>external</b> development <b>studios</b> such as Bethesda, Visual Concepts, and Stormfront Studios. John Madden Football 92 also featured the ambulance which would run over any players in its path. After Visual Concepts failed to deliver Madden NFL 96 for the new PlayStation in 1995, EA hired Tiburon Entertainment for Madden NFL 97 and later acquired the company, centralizing development in-house. It planned to release John Madden Football as its first sports-based arcade game, but the game was cancelled due to unenthusiastic reactions from play testers. EAs refusal to release Madden and other sports titles for the Dreamcast in 1999 contributed to the consoles lack of success and Segas exit from the hardware market.|$|R

50|$|A major {{update to}} the engine called MT Framework 2.0 began {{development}} in January 2008 and made its debut {{with the release of}} Lost Planet 2 in 2010. According to Capcom several parts of the engine were re-written from scratch and as a result the engine performs better on the PlayStation 3 compared to the previous version which was first built with the Xbox 360 in mind. Capcom highlighted the interactivity between characters and vegetation as a significant improvement but also noted because the game began development on the previous version of the engine it doesnt fully represent the capabilities of the new iteration. Capcom also said MT Framework 2.0 is able to hide the specifics of the hardware and the supported shader models from programmers, allowing them to write more platform agnostic code than before and reducing their burden. In Capcoms 2011 annual report, it was confirmed that 80% of MT Frameworks development process is common between the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC platforms which reduced development costs. Lastly, Capcom made possible for the first time, for <b>external</b> contract <b>studios</b> that would partner with them to use the engine.

As of April 17, 2015, the person that made that statement, was contacted and confirmed that he no way said it was a signal associated with WXTZ 87.9 Norwich. Therefore, the owner of that part 15 website falsely used that person's statement without first, obtaining that person's permission to do so and did not verify with that person, that they were in fact talking about the same radio station. That very same website also published and hosted copyrighted photos belonging to the radio station, without first obtaining prior written permission to use the photos. Clearly, if anyone is going stand behind one law, such as FCC part 15 rules and regulations, they should also stand by US Copyright laws. It is a US copyright violation to steal and use images from anyone else's Facebook accounts and to host on another person's website without proper consent.

It also broadcast 24 hours a day where most pirate radio stations try to hide their location and broadcast only a few hours late at night or weekends to avoid being caught. Therefore, the station itself did not operate in violation because it did not operate any transmitters at its studio location. Those that accused the station of violating any laws failed to include proof that the station only provided an audio stream on line and did not operate a transmitter of any type to feed the audio to the public. This was clearly posted on WXTZ 87.9 Norwich's Twitter account and Facebook pages as well as the IP address the stream was available on.
