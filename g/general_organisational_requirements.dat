40|$|Leaders In Need’ is a {{qualitative}} study contributing {{to an understanding}} of the mechanisms for exploring and identifying leadership development requirements and needs. It explores the views of senior leaders in local government as they reflect upon their individual leadership development needs and the <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements</b> expected of them. The research identifies four themes: becoming a leader, <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements,</b> individual needs and potential for improvements. Theme one explores the entry, experience and education of leaders as they prepare to make a transition from professional to leader. Theme two explores <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements,</b> <b>organisational</b> change, challenge and capability. Theme three explores how individual development needs are defined, identified and satisfied. Theme four explores whether improvements can be made to the mechanisms for investigating <b>organisational</b> development <b>requirements</b> and individual development needs. The research finds that leaders and their organisation do have development needs and requirements responsive to transformative modernisation. There are processes and mechanisms available to assist organisations and individuals explore and identify leadership development. When they are applied they are perceived to lack the rigour and effectiveness to adequately explore and identify leadership development requirements and needs. Perceived performance levels influence the mechanisms for exploring development requirements and needs. Leaders direct personal development activity when performance levels are perceived as acceptable. The organisation directs leadership development when performance levels are perceived as unacceptable. There is potential to improve a leadership development response by ensuring individual and organisational development activities overla...|$|R

Without careful consideration of all the factors that are involved in a software project, the successful integration of a system into the environment for which it is intended may fail. Communication has become a vital two-way link between software engineers and information systems in the design process. Software engineers should be aware of changing <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements</b> in current day environments. On the other hand organisations are continually evolving to adapt to changing working environments and technology, and need to be kept informed of the technology that will be more effective for their business in terms of cost and productivity. In order to adapt to evolving <b>organisational</b> <b>requirements</b> software engineers need to extend the research methods used to inform the design process and need to evaluate the efficacy of software tools and methods to capture both qualitative and quantitative data.

40|$|Ever-increasing pace of {{technological}} advancements {{coupled with the}} evolution in organisational procedures and objectives significantly reduces the effectiveness of information systems implemented to fulfil strategic <b>organisational</b> information <b>requirements.</b> Effects of obsolescence are further aggravated by the declining manufacturer support and skill base required for modifying system components to meet evolving user requirements. These factors generally force organisations to replace their legacy information systems or to re-engineer them to effectively fulfil <b>organisational</b> information <b>requirements.</b> However, re-engineering and replacement are both not only costly activities but also have substantial associated risks. This paper discusses costeffective and low-risk techniques to enhance the capabilities of legacy IT systems by introducing high performance intelligent terminal equipment and middleware servers that collaborate with the legacy systems in fulfilling <b>organisational</b> information <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationships between aspects of organisational communication and dimensions of job satisfaction and <b>general</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment. Participants were 358 staff members from 35 government primary schools in the state of Western Australia, who completed a survey comprising the Organisational Communication in Primary Schools Questionnaire, the Teacher Job Satisfaction Questionnaire and a five item <b>general</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment scale. Factor analyses established 13 aspects of job satisfaction and 9 dimensions of job satisfaction. Multiple regression analyses were used to investigate interrelationships. The findings suggest several aspects of organisational communication were related to job satisfaction and organisational commitment. This article concludes with implications for future research with regard to communication and for the maintenance of optimal levels of job satisfaction and commitment in schools. 19 page(s...|$|R
