5|$|Her frugal {{lifestyle}} {{at first}} {{was due to}} being denied pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> salary to bequeath to her nephew, Gottfried E. Noether.|$|E
5|$|In 1240, {{she married}} Raoul of Nesle {{who was about}} <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> age at the time. The High Court of Jerusalem proclaimed Alice and her husband regents for Conrad in 1243, but their power was only nominal. Raoul of Nesle left the kingdom, and Alice, {{before the end of}} the year. Alice {{retained}} the title of regent until her death in 1246.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{became an}} {{important}} political adviser {{as well as the}} Queen's companion, replacing Lord Melbourne as the dominant, influential figure in the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life. Victoria's mother was evicted from the palace, to Ingestre House in Belgrave Square. After the death of Princess Augusta in 1840, Victoria's mother was given both Clarence and Frogmore Houses. Through Albert's mediation, relations between mother and daughter slowly improved.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} she {{departed}} westwards across the Atlantic she was carrying 892crew members and 1,320passengers. This was only about <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> full passenger capacity of 2,435, {{as it was the}} low season and shipping from the UK had been disrupted by a coal miners' strike. Her passengers were a cross-section of Edwardian society, from millionaires such as John Jacob Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim, to poor emigrants from countries as disparate as Armenia, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Syria and Russia seeking a new life in America.|$|E
5|$|In 1875 no one {{living outside}} {{of two or}} three back streets of Lynn had heard of Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early days the leader and teacher paid out <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ten dollars a week to hire a hall, {{patching}} out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an instructor in mental healing; now, {{she is one of the}} richest women in the United States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American woman.|$|E
5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate {{with one or}} several drones. On average, a queen shares <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, {{it is in the}} queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E

As the convoy, which consisted of 60 ships and 26 escorts, sailed near Iceland, a wolf pack of Kriegsmarine U-Boats attacked the convoy repeatedly over a four-day period. Some 20 U-boats participated, sinking 12 Allied ships, including , a troop transport that went down with 272 men—more than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> passengers and crew; three U-boats were lost. Samuel Huntington departed the convoy and arrived at Clyde on 11 February.|$|E
5|$|The Tripurarahasya, a south Indian Shakta text, retells the story, {{giving more}} {{importance}} to the Goddess. When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu's Mohini form again, Vishnu fears {{that he may be}} burned to ashes like Kamadeva by the ascetic Shiva. So, Vishnu prays to goddess Tripura, who grants <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form. As Shiva touches Mohini, his seed spills, indicating a loss of the merit gained through of all his austerities.|$|E
5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E

5|$|Another refit {{followed}} on 12 December 1925– 11 July 1927. The {{elevation of}} the main battery guns was again increased, the bow section of the belt armor was removed, and <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> boilers were converted to oil-firing models. A third and final modernization began on 20 September 1931 and lasted until 20 August 1934. The rest of the coal-fired boilers were replaced with six Indret oil-fired boilers, new turbines and main battery guns were installed, along with eight new 75mm anti-aircraft guns. After emerging from the refit, Provence and Bretagne {{were assigned to the}} 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{the worker}} shares <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> genes with her sons {{and only a}} quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a {{conflict}} where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned in mid-1942, Musashi was {{modified}} {{to serve as}} the flagship of the Combined Fleet, and {{spent the rest of the}} year working up. The ship was transferred to Truk in early 1943 and sortied several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces. She was used to transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944. Torpedoed in early 1944 by an American submarine, Musashi was forced to return to Japan for repairs, during which the navy greatly augmented her anti-aircraft armament. She was present during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June, but did not come in contact with American surface forces. Musashi was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American carrier-based aircraft on 24 October 1944 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Over <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew was rescued. Her wreck was located in March 2015 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and his team of researchers.|$|E

5|$|Hepburn {{challenged}} {{herself in}} the latter <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life, as she regularly appeared in Shakespearean stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in The African Queen (1951), a persona the public embraced. Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which {{became the focus of}} her career in later life. She remained active into old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E
5|$|Lombardia {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} her career. She was initially assigned as a scout for the main Italian fleet before a stint abroad in South America, where an outbreak of yellow fever killed <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew. Another period in the main fleet followed in the late 1890s, and in 1901, the ship was deployed to the China station. In late 1903, she cruised off Italian Somaliland, and in 1906 she was converted to a depot ship for submarines. She served in this role for the remainder of her career, including during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112 and World War I in 1915-18. Lombardia was eventually sold for scrap in July 1920.|$|E

50|$|Over the {{remaining}} four years <b>of</b> <b>her</b> active career, Wantuck made two more cruises to the Far East, one in 1954—during which she operated out of Hong Kong—and another in 1955.

6000|$|She had a “lively aspect”, says Tom, on the {{authority}} of Cibber, and [...] “such a glow of health and cheerfulness in her countenance, as [...] inspired everybody with desire”. “Scarce an audience saw her that [...] were not <b>half</b> <b>of</b> them <b>her</b> lovers.” ...|$|R
5|$|Miyuki is {{considered}} one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed the Yotsuba. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic allows her to freeze a person's consciousness. In addition, <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> magic casting abilities is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to how the other Yotsuba clan members did. She begins to warm up to him and when Tatsuya saves her life, devotes her existence to him. It evolves to the point she disdains the touch of other males and expresses jealousy towards females around Tatsuya. Genetically different from Tatsuya, despite being born from the same parents, Miyuki professes her love to him following their engagement under Maya's orders. She is voiced by Saori Hayami.|$|E
5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E
5|$|Rossia {{suffered}} only 44 {{dead and}} 156 wounded; {{far less than}} Gromobois 87 dead and 170 wounded. This was attributable to Rossias captain's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick-firing guns on the engaged side to lay down and those on the unengaged side to go below, {{in contrast to the}} other ship keeping her light guns manned at all times. Rossia had been hit nineteen times on the starboard side of her hull and nine on her port side, plus other hits in her funnels, boats and decks. She had <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> guns knocked out and a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges. Despite this number of hits, she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated by any hit. She was repaired within two months by the rudimentary facilities available at Vladivostok. Rossia made no further effort to interfere with Japanese shipping during the war.|$|E
25|$|Sharia grants {{women the}} right to inherit {{property}} from other family members, and these rights are detailed in the Quran.
