2500|$|In this period, men's fashion plates {{show the}} lowered {{waistline}} {{taking on a}} decided point at the <b>front</b> <b>waist,</b> which {{was accompanied by a}} full rounded chest. Prince Albert (husband of Queen Victoria) had a high influence on male fashion, primarily because of his young age {{at the time of his}} wife's coronation, and his great attention to his appearance. [...] Therefore, the clothing, particularly of upper class gentleman, continued to follow the trend of earlier decades with full shoulders and chest, and a tightly-cinched waist.|$|E

2500|$|The fashionable {{feminine}} figure, {{with its}} sloping shoulders, rounded bust, narrow waist and full hips, was emphasized {{in various ways}} with the cut and trim of gowns. [...] To about 1835, the small waist was accentuated with a wide belt (a fashion continuing from the 1820s). [...] Later the waist and midriff were unbelted but cut close to the body, and the bodice began to taper to a small point at the <b>front</b> <b>waist.</b> [...] The fashionable corset now had gores to individually cup the breasts, and the bodice was styled to emphasize this shape.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1820, coats {{began to}} be made in an entirely new way. The tails and lapels were cut {{separately}} and subsequently attached to the coat. This ensured a better fit, a greater following of the body's contours, and more consistent positioning, even when the coat was unbuttoned. The tails themselves were narrow, pointed, and fell just below the knee. The shoulders were broad and the coat stood of the chest, yet was snug at the waist. Coats also were padded at the chest and waist. The collars and lapels were also padded in order to stiffen them. [...] The collars were high and shawl-like in order to frame the face. Coats were cut straight across the waist. Waistcoats were buttoned high on the chest. [...] Cutaway coats were worn as in the previous period for formal daywear, but the skirts might almost meet at the <b>front</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By the 1770s, coats {{exhibited}} a tighter, narrower cut than seen in earlier periods, and were occasionally double-breasted. [...] Toward the 1780s, the skirts of the coat {{began to be}} cutaway in a curve from the <b>front</b> <b>waist.</b> [...] Waistcoats gradually shortened until they were waist-length and cut straight across. [...] Waistcoats could be made with or without sleeves. As in the previous period, a loose, T-shaped silk, cotton or linen gown called a banyan was worn at home {{as a sort of}} dressing gown over the shirt, waistcoat, and breeches. [...] Men of an intellectual or philosophical bent were painted wearing banyans, with their own hair or a soft cap rather than a wig. This aesthetic overlapped slightly with the female fashion of the skirt and proves the way in which male and female fashions reflected one another as styles became less rigid and more suitable for movement and leisure.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} optimal sensor {{positioning}} for monitoring {{activities of daily}} living and investigates different combinations of features and models on different sensor positions, i. e., the side of the <b>waist,</b> <b>front</b> of the <b>waist,</b> chest, thigh, head, upper arm, wrist, and ankle. Nineteen features are extracted, and the feature importance is measured by using the Relief-F feature selection algorithm. Eight classification algorithms are evaluated on a dataset collected from young subjects and a dataset collected from elderly subjects, with two different experimental settings. To deal with different sampling rates, signals with a high data rate are down-sampled and a transformation matrix is used for aligning signals to the same coordinate system. The thigh, chest, side of the <b>waist,</b> and <b>front</b> of the <b>waist</b> are the best four sensor positions for the first dataset (young subjects), with average accuracy values greater than 96 %. The best model obtained from the first dataset for the side of the waist is validated on the second dataset (elderly subjects). The most appropriate number of features for each sensor position is reported. The results provide a reference for building activity recognition models for different sensor positions, as well as for data acquired from different hardware platforms and subject groups...|$|R
