50|$|An <b>interdigital</b> <b>transducer</b> (IDT) is {{a device}} that {{consists}} of two interlocking comb-shaped arrays of metallic electrodes (in the fashion of a zipper).

50|$|Surface {{acoustic}} waves can be {{used for}} flow measurement also. SAW relies on the propagation of a wave front, which appears similar to seismic activities. The waves are generated at the excitation centre and spread out along the surface of a solid material. An electric pulse induces them to generate SAWs that propagate like the shock waves of an earthquake. <b>Interdigital</b> <b>transducer</b> acts as sender and as receiver. When one is in sender mode, the two most distant ones act as receivers. The SAWs travel along the surface of the measuring tube, but a portion will couple out to the liquid. The decoupling angle depends on the liquid respectively the propagation velocity of the wave which is specific to the liquid. On {{the other side of the}} measuring tube, portions of the wave will couple into the tube and continue their way along its surface to the next <b>interdigital</b> <b>transducer.</b> Another portion will be coupled out again and travels back to the other side of the measuring tube where the effect repeats itself and the transducer on this side detects the wave. That means excitation of any one transducer here will lead to a sequence of input signals on two other transducers in the distance. Two of the transducers send their signals in the direction of flow, two in the other direction.|$|E
