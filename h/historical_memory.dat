40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to study the role that lived and <b>historical</b> <b>memories</b> havein the {{conformation}} of collective memory through the participant’s appraisals {{in the recent past}} of Argentina. These memories operate as sources that nurture collective memory. Lived memories are related to live experiences, while <b>historical</b> <b>memories</b> are related to indirect sources that inform about the past. 60 participants, divided in two groups (above and below 46 years of age) appraised the present and recent past, based on lived and <b>historical</b> <b>memories.</b> Results show that lived or autobiographical and <b>historical</b> <b>memories</b> contribute differently to collective memory...|$|R

25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{assert that}} there was no Liber (other than a god of wine) within <b>historical</b> <b>memory.</b> O. de Cazanove argues that the domain of the sovereign god Jupiter was that of sacred, sacrificial wine (vinum inferium), while that of Liber and Libera was confined to secular wine (vinum spurcum); these two types were obtained through differing fermentation processes. The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the mustum (grape juice) stored in amphoras sacrima.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, citing safety reasons, the Zapatero {{government}} {{closed down}} the Basilica for Mass. Mass was {{celebrated in the}} open for several weeks.

25|$|That Freyr had a cult at Uppsala is well {{confirmed}} {{from other}} sources. The {{reference to the}} change in sacrificial ritual may also reflect some <b>historical</b> <b>memory.</b> There is archaeological evidence {{for an increase in}} human sacrifices in the late Viking Age though among the Norse gods human sacrifice is most often linked to Odin. Another reference to Frø and sacrifices is found earlier in the work, where the beginning of an annual blót to him is related. King Hadingus is cursed after killing a divine being and atones for his crime with a sacrifice.|$|E
40|$|Among the {{challenges}} faced by L 2 instructors is the inclusion of <b>historical</b> <b>memories.</b> Although they are foundational to a culture’s identity, sometimes they are so far removed from students’ present reality {{that they have no}} familiarity with them. Meeting this challenge requires the development of activities that contextualize these narratives while bridging {{the past and the present}} by engaging withlearners’ own values and experiences. This article presents a model didactic unit drawn from a particular aspect of the Italian culture, namely, the medieval Florentine narratives. At the same time,the strategies and tools that are proposed can be implemented to explore virtually any <b>historical</b> <b>memories</b> in other L 2 courses...|$|R
5000|$|A nation, meanwhile, is [...] "a named {{population}} {{sharing a}} historic territory, common myths and <b>historical</b> <b>memories,</b> a mass public culture, a common economy and common legal {{rights and duties}} for its members". Ethnies are, in turn, defined as [...] "named units of population with common ancestry myths and <b>historical</b> <b>memories,</b> elements of shared culture, some link with a historic territory and some measure of solidarity, at least among their elites". The boundaries of an ethnie can be quite recognisable even when not all of its characteristics appear at the same time. It is, in other words, {{not a question of}} a smallest common denominator.|$|R
40|$|Nostalgia {{evoked by}} brands {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of contemporary marketing theory and practice.

Moreover, prior research has focused on personal nostalgia even though brands are likely to evoke both personal and <b>historical</b> <b>memories.</b> This article outlines a research project designed to conceptualize, develop, and validate a new 14 -item scale to measure brand nostalgia. Results from our studies show that this construct comprises three inter-related dimensions: personal memories and feelings, perceived brand oldness and <b>historical</b> <b>memories.</b> Results indicate that our multi-dimensional scale is valid and shows a high degree of reliability and validity...|$|R
25|$|The {{complex is}} owned and {{operated}} by the Patrimonio Nacional, the Spanish governmental heritage agency, and ranked as the third most visited monument of the Patrimonio Nacional in 2009. The Spanish social democrat government closed the complex to visitors at the end of 2009, citing safety reasons connected to restoration on the facade. The decision was controversial, as the closure was attributed by some people to the <b>Historical</b> <b>Memory</b> Law enacted during José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's premiership, and there were claims that the Benedictine community was being persecuted. The works include the Pietà sculpture prominently featured at the entrance of the crypt, using hammers and heavy machinery.|$|E
25|$|The {{human rights}} {{situation}} remained difficult during Arzú's tenure, although some initial steps {{were taken to}} reduce {{the influence of the}} military in national affairs.

It was prepared by the Recovery of <b>Historical</b> <b>Memory</b> project, known by the acronym of REMHI. In 2001 three Army officers were convicted in civil court and sentenced to lengthy prison terms for his murder.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{study by}} Colombia's National Centre for <b>Historical</b> <b>Memory,</b> 220,000 people have died in the {{conflict}} between 1958 and 2013, most of them civilians (177,307 civilians and 40,787 fighters) and more than five million civilians were forced from their homes between 1985 – 2012, generating the world's second largest population of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The report shows that the humanitarian crisis in Colombia is extremely serious in terms of both lethal and nonlethal violence. The report examines the widespread use of sexual violence against women and girls as a weapon of war, as well as the invisibility of this phenomenon. 16.9% of the population in Colombia has been a direct victim of the war.|$|E
25|$|After 1991, <b>historical</b> <b>memory</b> was a {{powerful}} tool in the political mobilization and legitimation of the post-Soviet Ukrainian state, {{as well as the}} division of selectively used memory {{along the lines of the}} political division of Ukrainian society. Ukraine did not experience the restorationist paradigm typical of some other post-Soviet nations, including the Baltic states, although the multifaceted history of independence, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, Soviet-era repressions, mass famine, and World War II collaboration were used to provide a different constitutive frame for the new Ukrainian nation. The politics of identity (which includes the production of history textbooks and the authorization of commemorative practices) has remained fragmented and tailored to reflect the ideological anxieties and concerns of individual regions of Ukraine.|$|E

In total, one in three of the 7.6 million registered victims of the conflict are children, and since 1985, 8,000 minors have disappeared. A Special Jurisdiction for Peace will be created to investigate, clarify, prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law which occurred during the armed conflict. Its purpose would be to satisfy victims' right to justice. A Special Unit was created to search for persons deemed as missing within the context of and due to the armed conflict.|$|E
