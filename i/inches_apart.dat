5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven stones {{remaining}} in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the stones perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded stones had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty stones, of which three had fallen and twenty-seven remained standing. Originally it may have included around a hundred stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 <b>inches)</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{manufacturers}} {{such as the}} Ives Manufacturing Company, American Flyer, and Lionel Corporation used O gauge {{for their}} budget line, marketing either Gauge 1 or 'Wide gauge' (also known as 'standard gauge') as their premium trains. One of the Lionel Corporation's most popular trains, the 203 Armoured Locomotive, was O gauge and ran on tracks with rails spaced 1.25 <b>inches</b> <b>apart.</b> The Great Depression wiped out demand for the expensive larger trains, and by 1932, O gauge was the standard, almost by default.|$|E

25|$|The submandibular glands are a pair {{of major}} salivary glands located beneath the lower jaws, {{superior}} to the digastric muscles. The secretion produced {{is a mixture of}} both serous fluid and mucus, and enters the oral cavity via the submandibular duct or Wharton duct. Approximately 65-70% of saliva in the oral cavity is produced by the submandibular glands, even though they are much smaller than the parotid glands.You can usually feel this gland, {{as it is in the}} superficial cervical region and feels like a rounded ball. It is located about two fingers above the Adam's apple (laryngeal prominence) and about two <b>inches</b> <b>apart</b> under the chin.|$|E
25|$|When a young Roman {{inadvertently}} {{fell through}} a cleft in the Esquiline hillside {{at the end}} of the 15th century, he found himself in a strange cave or grotta filled with painted figures. Soon the young artists of Rome were having themselves let down on boards knotted to ropes to see for themselves. The fourth style frescoes that were uncovered then have faded to pale gray stains on the plaster now, but the effect of these freshly rediscovered grottesche decorations was electrifying in the early Renaissance, which was just arriving in Rome. When Pinturicchio, Raphael and Michelangelo crawled underground and were let down shafts to study them, carving their names on the walls to let the world know they had been there, the paintings were a revelation of the true world of antiquity. Beside the graffiti signatures of later tourists, like Casanova and the Marquis de Sade scratched into a fresco <b>inches</b> <b>apart</b> (British Archaeology June 1999), are the autographs of Domenico Ghirlandaio, Martin van Heemskerck, and Filippino Lippi.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Scally {{stated that}} {{he was sitting in}} Alley Pond Park on Winchester Boulevard, in the borough of Queens, at dusk with a female friend when a yellow Volkswagen Beetle {{approached}} his car door to door and only three <b>inches</b> <b>apart</b> from his vehicle, which did not have its engine running. Scally kept an air gun under his seat and, as the VW approached his car, the VW driver was met with the gun pointed straight at him. At first, he appeared to be a light-skinned black male, but he also appeared to be wearing a stocking over his face. The driver of the VW quickly started his car and gunned it in reverse out of the parking lot. Scally chased the car to a point in Glen Oaks, Queens, where the driver jumped out and ran. He did not want to leave his female passenger to give chase, so he telephoned the Son of Sam Hot Line. Detective Richard Carroll from the Son of Sam Task Force (and Scally's former baseball coach) later told Scally that he had indeed seen the Son of Sam. Glen Oaks was later revealed to be the home of Berkowitz's sister and was close {{to the site of the}} Donna DiMaise and Joanne LoMino shootings.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{performed}} about 80 shots per exhibition. He {{had a large}} {{repertoire of}} practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as [...] "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, [...] "among his difficult feats":Two quart wine bottles are placed at {{the short end of}} the table, three feet apart; a ball is placed on the top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three <b>inches</b> <b>apart.</b> On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand {{at the head of the}} table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} hulls, {{additional}} details for {{the machinery of}} the six New York-built ships are available; the machinery of the others was similar if not identical. The New York-built ships had two boilers each, of the Martin's vertical tubular type, placed side by side and spaced six <b>inches</b> <b>apart.</b> The boilers, [...] "made of the best quality American charcoal iron", were 12ft 3 in long, 8ft 3 in wide and 9ft 3 in high, with two furnaces each. The boilers were safety tested to a pressure of 60 psi before installation. The engines were fitted with Sewell's patent surface condensers. The ships' propellers were four-bladed, and nine feet in diameter with a mean blade pitch of 12 feet 6inches.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the games}} {{played with the}} hoops—besides simply trundling them, which {{is a matter of}} driving them forward while keeping them upright—are hoop races, as well as games of dexterity. Among these are [...] "toll," [...] in which the player has to drive his hoop between two stones placed two to three <b>inches</b> <b>apart</b> without {{touching}} either one. Another such game is [...] "turnpike", in which one player drives the hoop between pairs of objects, such as bricks, at first placed so that the opening is about a foot wide, with each gate kept by a different player. After running all the gates, the openings are made smaller by one inch, and the player trundling the hoop runs the course again. The process repeats until he strikes the side of a gate, then he and the turnpike keeper switch places.|$|E

2500|$|King & Winge was {{originally}} a powered halibut schooner {{built by the}} King and Winge shipyard in West Seattle in 1914. [...] She was designed by Albert M. Winge, co-owner of the shipyard. [...] Her dimensions were 143 tons, 97' length on the deck (110' overall), 19.6' beam and 9.7 depth of hold. [...] As built she was fitted with a [...] Corliss gasoline engine and an electric lighting system. [...] She had two 60' high masts, and carried nine halibut dories. [...] The construction was very strong, with 4x4 ½ inch oak frames, each set six <b>inches</b> <b>apart,</b> and sheathed with planking three inches (76mm) [...] thick, covered with another layer of ironbark sheathing. [...] The schooner was divided into four watertight compartments, her hull was heavily braced, and her bow was nosed with steel plates for ice work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} tail vise uses {{one large}} screw, either wooden or metal. It {{is made in}} the form of a frame, with the back part of the frame fitting under the bench, and the movement of that frame located and restrained by a [...] complex system of sliding tongues and grooves, and runners, such that smooth left and right movements of the frame are possible, but forward and backward movements, or rotative movements of the frame are impossible. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and it has one or more dog holes on the top—often 3 to 4, each spaced 5 inches apart—that are in line with the dog holes located on the front face (apron) of the bench—numerous holes, each also spaced 5 <b>inches</b> <b>apart.</b> This is the least expensive option for a tail vise, but it is by far the most complex to design, construct and maintain. Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.|$|E

60|$|When the lobes, {{which are}} rather thick, close, {{no trace of}} {{wrinkling}} {{can be seen on}} any part of their upper [page 317] surfaces, It appears therefore that the cells must contract. The chief seat of the movement is evidently in the thick mass of cells which overlies the central bundle of vessels in the midrib. To ascertain whether this part contracts, a leaf was fastened on the stage of the microscope in such a manner that the two lobes could not become quite shut, and having made two minute black dots on the midrib, in a transverse line and a little towards one side, they were found by the micrometer to be 17/1000 of an <b>inch</b> <b>apart.</b> One of the filaments was then touched and the lobes closed; but as they were prevented from meeting, I could still see the two dots, which now were 15/1000 of an <b>inch</b> <b>apart,</b> so that {{a small portion of the}} upper surface of the midrib had contracted in a transverse line 2/1000 of an inch (.0508 mm.).|$|R

2500|$|Liston in {{his studies}} {{concluded}} to much lower estimates. Documentation of historical finds and the excavation of [...] "Ariston", {{the most complete}} specimen ever from the Star Pit near Whittlesey, Peterborough, support Woodward's figures of between 9 and 10 metres (29.5 and 33 feet). With [...] "Ariston" [...] the pectoral fins are 1005 millimetres (39.6 <b>inches)</b> <b>apart,</b> indicating a narrow body of no excessive size, {{even though it was}} initially thought to have been 22 metres (72 feet) long. In 2007 Liston stated that most specimens indicated lengths between 7 and 12 metres (23 and 39 feet). A linear extrapolation from the gill basket would be flawed because the gills grow disproportionally in size, having to increase their surface allometrically to ensure the oxygen supply of a body increasing in volume to the third power. The growth ring structures within the remains of Leedsichthys have indicated that it would have taken 21 to 25 years to reach these lengths, and isolated elements from other specimens showed that a maximum size of just over [...] is not unreasonable.
