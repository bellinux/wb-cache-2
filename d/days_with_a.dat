5|$|The initial study {{into the}} system {{suggests}} that a second planet in the inner system is unlikely. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b, however, noted the signal of a secondary body of an unknown nature that most likely orbits GJ 3634 every 200 <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mass that is at most double that of Neptune.|$|E

5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} with the busy preceding season, this season had much lower activity than usual, with only 36days {{in which there was}} a tropical storm or cyclone active; this was 17 less than normal. However, the number of <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone was slightly above normal at 15. In general, the southern hemisphere as a whole had the least active season since 1954. There were only five named storms, only the fifth such time {{since the beginning of the}} satellite era in 1967. As most storms formed toward the eastern periphery of the basin, damage was much less than the preceding year.|$|E
5|$|Massaro was a {{contestant}} on CBS's , {{which was}} the fifteenth season of the show, in 2007. Massaro approached the WWE {{with the idea of}} doing the show, and after going through the casting process, she found out she made the show ten days before she had to leave for China to film. Prior to the experience, Massaro had never been camping before, so to train for the show she had to get used to being outside. She was assigned to the Zhan Hu tribe in the first episode and quickly began quarreling with fellow contestant Dave Cruser. In the second episode, Massaro was voted off after six <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 6–1 vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from May through July, during the cold, rainy season, {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 <b>days</b> (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the mating season, parturition is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.|$|E

5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they got started.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several <b>days,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or {{members of the royal}} family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de cour, a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E
5|$|Mark Pennant, aged 15, {{was arrested}} on 9 October 1985 and charged with murder two days later, the first person charged in {{connection}} with the killing. Born in England to West Indian parents, Pennant had been raised in the West Indies until he was nine, after which he returned to the UK; he was diagnosed with learning difficulties and was attending a special school. He was arrested and handcuffed at school, taken to Wood Green Police Station, and interviewed six times over the course of two <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> teacher in attendance. He told the police that he had cut Blakelock and kicked him twice, and named Winston Silcott as the ringleader and several others, including another juvenile, Mark Lambie.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 <b>days,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} {{was found}} in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise xeric (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the ostrich, emu, and black-breasted buzzard, which brood for more than 40 <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> limited supply of sustenance. Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to heat stress. The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it {{may be related to the}} presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping.|$|E
