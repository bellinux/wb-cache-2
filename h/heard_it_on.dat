5|$|Several of the {{statements}} originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, without access to his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.) Hill had not been told that his statement {{was going to be}} read out in court during the detectives' trial; he first learned that it had been used when he <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> television. Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried.|$|E
25|$|Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police (1992) HL was a 'test' {{case in the}} {{aftermath}} of the Hillsborough disaster, where 95 spectators were crushed to death and 400 injured in a stadium. The event was televised and broadcast on radio. In Alcock, claims for damages for psychiatric illness were brought by fifteen relatives of the victims of the tragedy; some of them had been present at the match - but not in the area where the disaster occurred - and others had seen it on television or <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the radio. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police denied that he owed the claimants a duty of care. On the basis of the three principles mentioned above, all claims were ruled out.|$|E
25|$|In August 2002, the Cherokee Nation {{conducted}} a survey of 115,026 Cherokee citizens who live within the 14 counties of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Their aim was to evaluate {{the status of the}} language. Of those surveyed, 91% reported that they at least heard the language being used in the public domain; 18% heard the language used in hospitals, 14% reported hearing it at church, 12% used/heard the language at home, 9% heard it in stores, 8% heard it at work, 7% heard it at school, 7% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> grounds, 6% heard it in courts, and 8% heard it in other settings. In the home, Cherokee was only used by 17% of survey respondents; the overwhelming majority spoke only English in the home setting. 18% of the surveyed persons spoke Cherokee as a first language, and 5% had learned Cherokee and English jointly as primary languages. At the beginning of the 20th century, 75% of Cherokee citizens are believed to have been raised bilingually in Cherokee and English. Today, only about 5% or less are raised in Cherokee-speaking homes. Many speakers, perhaps the majority, are over fifty years of age. Another 2002 survey indicated that the Cherokee language was very close to extinction, as few people younger than the grandparental generation were found who were fluent in the language. Usually, older adults are the final speakers of a language. If they do not pass it along to their descendants, the language will be lost. Thus, the 2002 estimate for the lifespan of the language was only about 30–40 years. The Cherokee language in North Carolina was found to be particularly imperiled, with perhaps fewer than 1,000 remaining speakers and elderly speakers dying off far more quickly than new speakers were emerging. From such surveys the Cherokee Nation also learned that most of its members believed preservation of Cherokee culture and language for future generations is essential.|$|E

500|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} over a 12-day period on Granada's sets and on location around Manchester, following {{a week of}} rehearsals. It was shot entirely on film stock. For the climax involving the rose, Nesbitt was required to be nearly naked on an open set, save for a small pouch that was not visible on screen. There was a risk that production could be shut down if residents of the street they were filming on complained to the police, so the production manager ensured that Nesbitt was covered up {{when he was not}} being filmed. Filming the five-minute scene took about two hours. The song [...] "Female of the Species" [...] by Space was used throughout the programme; the instrumental version plays over the opening credits and the full lyrical version is heard during a first-act montage. The track was chosen by Langan after she <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> The Chart Show. The rest of the incidental music and the main end credits theme was composed by The Other Two. Adam's song was originally scripted to be Nilsson's [...] "Without You" [...] but the rights to the song were too expensive. The song was substituted with [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted [...] "Inside Out" [...] {{is one of}} the [...] "ten remaining tracks [...] continue the trend [...] ", considering the song's lyrics as [...] "blatantly slutty" [...] and praising [...] "the much-welcomed piano breakdown". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound also agreed that [...] "the [...] singles are extraordinarily infectious, as is [...] "Inside Out", which slows the tempo, simultaneously sending Spears back to basics vocally, and into 2011 sonically." [...] On her review of Femme Fatale, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club commented that [...] "songs like the dark, slinky [...] "Inside Out", the hyper-Euro chant-along [...] "Till The World Ends", and the strange, flute-assisted digression [...] "Criminal" [...] add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." [...] The Guardians Alexis Petridis commented that the song [...] "lurches along on 's patent half-speed rhythm." [...] While Keith Caufield of Billboard considered [...] "Inside Out" [...] "easily a natural pick for 'Femme's' third single", Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said that [...] "in general the song failed to hold my attention. If I <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the radio, I probably would change the station." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the song a negative review, considering it a [...] "weak mid-tempo fare", along with [...] "Criminal". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "Inside Out" [...] reached number fifty-nine on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, after selling 7,222 digital units of the song alone.|$|E
500|$|Issued {{to radio}} on August 27, 1991, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was {{released}} {{two weeks later}} on September 10 as the lead single from Nevermind, the band's major label debut on DGC Records. The song did not initially chart, and it sold well only in regions of the United States with an established fanbase for the group. [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was {{not expected to be}} a hit, for it was merely intended to be the base-building alternative rock cut from the album. It was anticipated that the follow-up single [...] "Come as You Are" [...] would be the song that could cross over to mainstream formats. However, campus radio and modern rock radio stations picked up on the track, and placed it on heavy rotation. Danny Goldberg of Nirvana's management firm Gold Mountain later admitted that [...] "none of us heard it as a crossover song, but the public heard it and it was instantaneous [...] They <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> alternative radio, and then they rushed out like lemmings to buy it." [...] The video received its world premiere on MTV's late-night alternative rock program 120 Minutes, and proved so popular that the channel began to air it during its regular daytime rotation. MTV added the video to its [...] "Buzz Bin" [...] selection in October, where it stayed until mid-December. By the end of the year, the song, its accompanying video, and the Nevermind album had become hits. Both the song and Nevermind became a rare cross-format phenomenon, reaching all the major rock radio formats including modern rock, hard rock, album rock, and college radio.|$|E

2500|$|Annie Zaleski of Las Vegas Weekly praised Night Visions {{for being}} [...] "well-crafted and wildly creative, and boasts solid songwriting—three {{things that are}} sorely missing on albums by so many younger bands."

[...] Johan Wippsson from Melodic magazine called Night Visions [...] "somewhat shattered, but as a whole {{this is a very}} charming and well-crafted album."

2500|$|In June 1995, {{the group}} flew to Sweden to record some songs with Max Martin and Denniz PoP, {{including}} [...] "We've Got It Goin' On", which {{ended up being}} their very first single. [...] "We've Got It Goin' On" [...] was sent to radio in August 1995 and released as a physical single on September 5, 1995. In North America, Mix 96 in Montreal broke the group after the programmers <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the radio in Europe. The song was a minor success in the U.S., peaking at only No. 69 by December 1995, but it entered the top 5 in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, and the Netherlands. European success sent them there on a summer tour and shifted their promotion being mostly done in Europe. They finished recording their first album Backstreet Boys in April 1996 and it was released internationally on May 6, 1996, excluding U.S. and Canada; however, it was later released in Canada in October 1996.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{decided on}} two leading promotional songs for Sakanaction: [...] "Aoi" [...] and [...] "Inori", the two songs {{they saw as}} being the most outward-facing and inner-facing songs on the album. Of the two, they chose [...] "Aoi" [...] to be the song sent to radio stations, as they felt [...] "Inori" [...] would not be {{effectively}} surprising if people had already <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the radio. Instead, the band chose to create a music video for [...] "Inori". During the production stage of Sakanaction, they had discussed releasing the album as an LP record, but scrapped plans when they realized that the sound quality would degrade for the release. Instead, the band decided to release an abbreviated version of the album with a single song on each side, the Inori EP; with [...] "Inori" [...] as the release's A-side, and [...] "Structure" [...] as its B-side. Inori EP was the band's first vinyl record release, prior to their albums being re-released on vinyl later in 2015.|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Word" [...] was {{inspired}} by the pressure the band's A team and musical director.
