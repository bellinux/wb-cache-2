5|$|The Citadel, {{located on}} the Avenue Pierre Coubertin, was built between 1560 and 1571 {{on the site of}} a former medieval castle which was built in 1229 by Philippe de Hureprel. Its purpose of its {{construction}} was to fend off would-be invaders, but it wasn't long until the city was successfully invaded by Archduke Albert of Austria on 24 April 1596. Both Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu at one time considered expanding the citadel and Calais <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> walled city for military harbour purposes but the proposals came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, {{following}} Prussia's victories, the German {{states were}} united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent {{to the new}} German monarchy. Although William thought {{the day when he}} became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's liberals in their opposition to the expansion of the empire's army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to think about suicide.|$|E

5|$|The king's reign {{was marked}} by a drought lasting seven years that caused a famine in much of Imerina. According to oral history, the king {{attempted}} to purchase rice from his fief at Ambohipiainana. The town had a surplus but the local leader refused to sell rice to Andriamasinavalona, claiming none was available. The king then sent porters to purchase rice from Antsahatovoka, where the residents declared that while the land was his and it was thus unnecessary for the king to purchase what already belonged to him, there was no rice available to share. Finally Andriamasinavalona sought to purchase rice in Andraisisa. His money was refused by the local leader, Andriandrivotra, who willingly gave the king large shares of food and a tribute of silver. To reward {{the leader of the}} fief, Andriamasinavalona promised to give him anything he liked. Andriandrivotra declared that all he desired was the love of his sovereign. To show his appreciation, Andriamasinavalona declared that he would make Andriasisa <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> fief, and gave Andriandrivotra a large piece of land {{to the west of the}} territory. He then undertook a major expansion of the Betsimitatatra rice fields around Antananarivo, significantly increasing their rice production to feed the populace.|$|E

25|$|Getting rid of Sandworms is possible, but tricky. First, {{they can}} only be fought from rocks. The Sandworm lures the attacking units <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> desert, and then turns against them, so chasing them down is futile. Apart from that, Sandworms are {{extremely}} resilient for most types of weapons, and immune to Deviator and spice mounds. It requires a combined fire of several heavy vehicles to make a Sandworm go away. Units and base defensive turrets will automatically fire at the Sandworm when it moves within range (except the Atreides in the early version of Dune II). Eventually, after the Sandworm has eaten enough vehicles, or its energy is drained to yellow, it will disappear and never emerge again. The radar marks them as a pulsating white dot.|$|E

Givens was awarded his wings on February 4, 1953, {{as one of the top}} students. As a top student, he was given the choice of branch of the air force he wanted to fly with. He chose fighter training at Williams Air Force Base in Chandler, AZ. The group commander was known to be tough on his students, and Givens chose this location so he could be formed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> fighter pilot.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a lengthy}} debate {{among the members}} of Politburo over the course of {{economic}} development, by 1928–1929, upon gaining control of the country, Joseph Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation. Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization, which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s. Preparation for war {{was one of the main}} driving forces behind industrialization, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world. As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II. During the war, the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|In one Greek vase painting, Helios appears riding {{across the}} sea in the cup of the Delphic tripod {{which appears to be}} a solar reference.

While Heracles traveled to Erytheia to retrieve the cattle of Geryon, he crossed the Libyan desert and was so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios, the Sun. Almost immediately, Heracles realized his mistake and apologized profusely, in turn and equally courteous, Helios granted Heracles the golden cup which he used to sail {{across the sea}} every night, from the west to the east because he found Heracles' actions immensely bold. Heracles used this golden cup to reach Erytheia.|$|E
25|$|Because icons in Orthodoxy {{must follow}} {{traditional}} standards and are essentially copies, Orthodoxy never developed {{the reputation of}} the individual artist as Western Christianity did, and the names of even the finest icon painters are seldom recognized except by some Eastern Orthodox or art historians. Icon painting was and is a conservative art, in many cases considered a craft, in which the painter is essentially merely a tool for replication. The painter did not seek individual glory but considered himself a humble servant of God. That is why in the 19th and early 20th centuries, icon painting in Russia went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> decline with the arrival of machine lithography on paper and tin, which could produce icons in great quantity and much more cheaply than the workshops of painters. Even today large numbers of paper icons are purchased by Orthodox rather than more expensive painted panels.|$|E
