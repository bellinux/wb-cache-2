This system uses contextual information through a Markovian model for the classes, besides a statistical model for the data. It is developed with the user in mind and, therefore, it is solely based on graphic user interfaces. The user is prompted with the correct sequence of steps whenever an <b>invalid</b> <b>option</b> is invoked. The functionality {{of the system is}} checked classifying a SIR-C/X-SAR image, where mainly crops are observed...|$|E

If we wanted to use objective testimony of photograph as a valid argument against Holocaust denial, we would have to declare the authenticity of photograph is <b>invalid.</b> The <b>options</b> of its manipulation, both content and meaning, are examined through semiotics of Peirce, mainly through trichotomy icon, index and symbol. In today's pluralistic time, the historical consciousness is proposed as a possible starting point of examination of historical sources, including photograph. Key words Photograph, authenticity, manipulation, Peirce, historical consciousness, Holocaust...|$|R

Journal of Financial Economics 18, March: 7 - 27) and Dixit and Pindyck (1994. Investment under uncertainty. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press), when considering the sequential investment decision. It is shown that specific results presented in these two sources are based on invalid solutions to the relevant partial differential equation. The problem stems from the possibility that economically feasible parameter values and apparently acceptable step sizes for the explicit finite difference approach used can combine to generate non-convergent, <b>invalid</b> solutions. real <b>options,</b> sequential investment, time to build, stability and convergence, explicit finite difference, sensitivity analysis,...|$|R

Two formations, the St Bees Sandstone and Kirklinton Sandstone, have been mapped in the past. However, previous workers have found considerable difficulty in consistently identifying, defining and mapping the Kirklinton Sandstone Formation. Moreover, previous accounts of the sandstones in the Carlisle area appear to suggest that the succession there differs in several key aspects from its correlatives in other parts of Cumbria and, in particular, the adjacent offshore area. As a result of a short period of field work in the area, it is concluded that the principal lithological change is between mainly fine-grained sandstones, that are generally or commonly micaceous and contain common or numerous mudstone interbeds, in the lower and middle parts of the group, and fine- to coarsegrained sandstones with rare or no mica and mudstone partings at the top of the group. This change occurs within the Kirklinton Sandstone Formation as previously mapped, and it is suggested that this unit is now <b>invalid.</b> Several <b>options</b> are considered as to how the group should be subdivided and the nomenclature to be adopted. All options presently have some associated problems, but the adoption of the same terminology as in the continuous offshore is suggested, i. e. St Bees Sandstone Formation below (subdivided where possible into Rottington Sandstone and Calder Sandstone Members) and Ormskirk Sandstone Formation above...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a system for the {{analysis}} and classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. This system, unlike most of its competitors, allows a careful modeling of the statistical properties of the data beyond the usual Gaussian hypothesis. The modeling tools include basic descriptive measures and the choice of suited distributions, through goodness-of-fit tests, to model the data. The classification tools offer the choice between pointwise and contextual (Markovian) techniques, and the quantitative assessment of the quality of the results. The system is goal-driven, and its interfaces are solely based on pull-down menus; the user is prompted with the correct sequence of operations, whenever an <b>invalid</b> <b>option</b> is invoked. An example of the use of this system for the classification of a SAR image is presented. Keywords: classification, image, interface, radar, SAR, speckle, system. 1 Introduction Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Building fast {{software}} in an HPC environment raises great challenges as software used for simulation and modelling is generally complex and has many dependencies. Current approaches involve manual tuning of compilation parameters {{in order to}} minimize the run time, based on a set of predefined defaults, but such an approach involves expert knowledge, is not scalable and can be very expensive in person-hours. In this paper we propose and develop a modular framework called POHPC that uses the Simulated Annealing meta-heuristic algorithm to automatically search for the optimal set of library options and compilation flags that can give the best execution time for a library-application pair on a selected hardware architecture. The framework can be used in modern HPC clusters using a variety of batch scheduling systems as execution backends for the optimization runs, and will discover optimal combinations as well as <b>invalid</b> sets of <b>options</b> and flags that result in failed builds or application crashes. We demonstrate the optimization of the FFTW library working in conjunction with the high- profile community codes GROMACS and QuantumESPRESSO, whereby the suitability of the technique is validated...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{software}} framework {{that supports the}} specification of userdefinable configuration options in HPC applications independently of the application code itself. Such options include model parameter values, the selection of numerical algorithm, target platform etc. and additional constraints that prevent <b>invalid</b> combinations of <b>options</b> from being made. Such constraints, which are capable of describing complex cross-domain dependencies, are often crucial to the correct functioning of the application and are typically either completely absent from the code or a hard to recover from it. The framework uses a combination of functional workflows and constraint solvers. Application workflows are built {{from a combination of}} functional components: higher-order co-ordination forms and first-order data processing components which can be either concrete or abstract, i. e. without a specified implementation at the outset. A repository provides alternative implementations for these abstract components. A constraint solver, written in Prolog, guides a user in making valid choices of parameters, implementations, machines etc. for any given context. Partial designs can be stored and shared providing a systematic means of handling application use and maintenance. We describe our methodology and illustrate its application in two classes of application: a data intensive commercial video transcoding example and a numerically intensive incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes solver...|$|R
