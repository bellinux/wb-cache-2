5|$|Alan Grant {{returned}} for a second outing to write Curse, about a grave digger who unleashed a 150-year-old curse onto Smallville, and Clark's attempt to put <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> the way it was. In Temptation, Clark used red kryptonite to try and impress Lana and Chloe after they become infatuated with a new, French foreign exchange student. Aspect released their final novel on March 1, 2004; written by Devin K. Grayson, City chronicled Clark and Lex's trip to Metropolis. While in the city, the pair got caught between the Japanese mafia and a secret agent who believed he has found an alien. In Little, Brown Young Readers' final novel, written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld, Sparks featured Clark trying to save Chloe after she was exposed to a kryptonite fireworks display that makes her the desire of every man. For one of the men, when the desire wears off he decides that he really does want Chloe and kidnaps her.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E
5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E

25|$|Māori unease mounted as the {{surveying}} progressed, {{with little}} {{sign of the}} promised reserves. In February 1879 surveyors began cutting lines through cultivations and fences and trampling cash crops and also ran a road into Titokowaru's own settlement. Māori retaliated by uprooting kilometres of survey pegs. Sheehan rode to Parihaka to justify the government's actions, but left after being verbally abused by Te Whiti. The next day, 24 March 1879, Te Whiti ordered his men to remove all the surveyors from the Waimate Plains. Though the surveyors would not leave of their own accord, the Māori quietly packed up each survey camp, loaded horses and drays and carted <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> across the Waingongoro River, between Manaia and Hawera.|$|E
25|$|Penske {{picked up}} the team cars and {{equipment}} from the El Segundo offices and shipped <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> to his shop in Pennsylvania. Through the fall of 1969 and into the winter, Penske used the no. 3 Jerry Grant car for developmental purposes. When he acquired the 1969 cars, Penske found that Ron Kaplan had already done considerable work with suspension, but {{he felt that the}} front suspension could still be further developed. With Mark Donohue doing the testing, Penske’s team lowered {{the front of the car}} and replaced the rubber bushings in the radius rods with heim joints. New roll bars were also developed. After several months of development, Donohue felt that the team now had car that drove like it was on rails.|$|E

500|$|Parker and Stone {{had trouble}} {{deciding}} how to end [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] {{in a way that}} would bring <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> to normal in South Park. Originally, the episode ended with Ms. Ellen being taken away by the Iraqi soldiers, leaving the impression that she was in fact an Iraqi fugitive. They ultimately decided this was a poor way to end the show, so they recast the ending to make Ms. Ellen an innocent woman who was framed by Wendy. Parker and Stone also struggled with how to make Mr. Garrison decide he wanted his old nose back. It was only a few days before the episode aired that these final decisions about the ending were made.|$|E
500|$|When the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame {{opened in}} 1990, his family lent it the {{spacesuit}} worn by Grissom during Mercury 4 {{along with other}} personal artifacts belonging to the astronaut. In 2002, the museum went into bankruptcy and {{was taken over by}} a NASA contractor, whereupon the family asked for <b>everything</b> <b>back.</b> All the artifacts were returned to them except the spacesuit, which NASA claimed was government property. NASA insisted Grissom got authorization to use the spacesuit for a show and tell at his son's school and never returned it, but some Grissom family members claimed the astronaut rescued the spacesuit from a scrap heap. [...] the space suit remains in the Hall of Fame's Heroes and Legends exhibit.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of Jumanji, Marge, worried {{about the effects of}} {{excessively}} violent video games, encourages Bart and Milhouse to try playing some of the classic board games in the attic. After rejecting the [...] "lame" [...] ones, they discover an old board game called [...] "Satan's Path". Upon playing it, all the rejected games come to life turning the town into a giant game board. Lisa reads the instructions, which are in Latin, and says the two must beat all the games to finish Satan's Path and restore everything to normal. Milhouse dies during the game of Scrabble, but Bart manages to finish it, returning <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> to normal (even bringing Milhouse back to life). Bart and Milhouse state that they will just play hangman but the game brings the hangman to life. With only one more letter remaining (WHEEL _F F_RTUNE), Milhouse guesses the number 3, which results in Bart and Milhouse being hanged.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the finale}} with a B+; he praised the writers [...] "for once again {{introducing}} {{a new world}} that feels fully formed, with its own rich backstory that they could choose to explore {{if they have the}} time and the inclination." [...] Murray concluded his review, [...] "It may be that Fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here, and the storytelling is about to get hopelessly convoluted, as it often does once time-travel enters the picture. But for now, I’m going to enjoy living with and thinking over what I’ve seen so far. And I’m going to trust that no matter how crazy Fringes fourth season gets, the writers are going to keep bringing <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> to less mind-bending questions". Some reviewers questioned the logic of Peter having never existed, though others expressed their trust in the writers' ability to make it work.|$|E

Natasha of HipHopCanada {{in a review}} of the concert in Toronto, wrote that during the set she [...] "let out her softer side" [...] and that her vocals were [...] "exceptionally clear and strong". Reviewing the concert in Los Angeles, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote, [...] "Scaling <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> momentarily, she emerged {{from the center of the}} stage in a stunning red dress for soaring renditions of 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', 'Take a Bow', and 'Cold Case Love' flowing within a perfect melody of hits." [...] In a review of the Ottawa concert on May 2, 2013, Aedan Helmer of Ottawa Sun wrote that [...] "diva RiRi" [...] was [...] "crooning" [...] during the set consisted of songs such as [...] "Loveeeeeee Song", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] and [...] "Cold Case Love"; according to Helmer those were the tracks describing her [...] "tumultuous" [...] relationship with Brown.|$|E

When Finn wishes for an alternate reality [...] in which the Lich never existed during {{the events of the}} fifth season premiere [...] "Finn the Human", a universe is created in which the Mushroom War was prevented by Simon Petrikov and Marceline never became a vampire. She appears in the episode as an extremely frail and aged half-demon, who was killed when a [...] "mutagenic bomb" [...] that was frozen in ice by Simon Petrikov detonates. Jake manages to undo this reality with his wish and sets <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> to the way it was. In [...] "Sky Witch", Marceline enlists the help of Princess Bubblegum, and the two are able to track down Maja, the titular Sky Witch. It is revealed that Ash sold Hambo to Maja. Only when Bubblegum trades her beloved rock shirt—which was given to her by Marceline—is Hambo able to be reunited with Marceline. After the events of [...] "Sky Witch", Bubblegum and Marceline are on much friendlier ground, and their friendship is completely reaffirmed in the episodes [...] "Varmints" [...] and [...] "Broke His Crown", from the seventh and eighth season respectively. In [...] "Betty", Marceline sacrifices Hambo so that Ice King—who lost his powers and became Simon Petrikov again—can open a portal into time so that Simon can reconcile with his estranged fiancee Betty. Although the two are reunited in [...] "Betty", due to the rush of events, Marceline and Simon are unable to fully catch up before Simon reverts back to the Ice King. With that being said, in the eighth season episode [...] "Broke His Crown", the two manage to more fully reunite, and as such, manage to affirm how much they care for one another.|$|E

2500|$|Mothership Zeta has {{received}} mixed reactions from critics, averaging a 70 for the PC and a 65 for the Xbox 360. [...] Edge comments that [...] "Mothership Zetas greatest asset is its looks" [...] and that [...] "whoever designed such beauty should be pretty peeved {{at the game}} around it." [...] Edge also noted that they [...] "encountered a script bug so catastrophic that we couldn't finish the game – we actually had to clip through a doorway and use console commands to bring <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> on track" [...] and criticize the DLC for locking off most of the ship after completion. [...] Eurogamer states that [...] "the most disappointing factor about Mothership Zeta is how little subtlety is afforded to the details" [...] and sums up the DLC as [...] "repetitive, largely uninspired corridor combat, and boring, linear and samey mission design." [...] Gamedaily praises Mothership Zeta for [...] "keep Fallouts trademark humor intact", its improved graphics, and for the new enemies and weapons introduced.|$|E
2500|$|The Natural Stone Council (NSC) has {{commissioned}} some life-cycle inventory {{data for}} use in life cycle assessments.

2500|$|Following the {{production}} overhaul and the studio's attempts for more cost-efficient animated features, Mark Dindal urged for [...] "a simpler approach that emphasized the characters rather than overwhelming special effects or cinematic techniques". Because {{of the subsequent}} departure of Deja, animator Dale Baer inherited the character of Yzma. Using Eartha Kitt's gestures during recording sessions, Baer commented that [...] "She has a natural voice for animation and really got into the role. She would gesture wildly and it was fun just to watch her. She would come into each session almost serious and very professional and suddenly she would go wild and break up laughing." [...] Ranieri was later asked {{to serve as the}} supervising animator of Kuzco (as a human and a llama), though he would admit being reluctant at first until he discovered that Kuzco [...] "had a side to him, {{there was a lot of}} comedy potential and as a character he went through an arc". Pudleiner was also reassigned to work as an animator of the human version of Kuzco. In addition to drawing inspiration from David Spade during recording sessions, the Kuzco animation team studied llamas at the zoo, visited a llama farm, watched nature documentaries, and even observed the animals up close when they came for a visit to the studio. For the rewritten version of Pacha, animator Bruce W. Smith observed that [...] "Pacha is probably the most human of all the characters," [...] and further added that he [...] "has more human mannerisms and realistic traits, which serve as a contrast to the cartoony llama he hangs out with. He is the earthy guy who brings <b>everything</b> <b>back</b> into focus. Being a big fellow about six-foot-five and weighing about 250 pounds we had to work hard to give him a sense of weight and believability in his movement." ...|$|E
