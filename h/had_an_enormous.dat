She spoke of heating water electrically to house tropical fish {{at home in the}} early 1920s, and of having given talks on radio 2FC about tropical fish in the days when she was doing electrical contracting work. In January 1933 the American journal Aquariana published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{declined}} the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it {{his duty to}} serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals {{throughout the country and}} also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being hired}} after the {{completion}} of nearly all the principal photography, Trumbull <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> amount of creative input on the film. The Spock spacewalk sequence, for example, was radically changed from the Abel version. The original plan was for Kirk to follow Spock in a spacesuit and come under attack from a mass of sensor-type organisms. Spock would save his friend, and the two would proceed through V'ger. Wise, Kline and Abel had been unable to agree on how to photograph the sequence, and the result was a poorly designed and ungainly effect that Trumbull was convinced was disruptive to the plot and would have cost millions to fix. Instead, he recommended a stripped-down sequence that omitted Kirk entirely and would be simple and easy to shoot; Robert McCall, known for designing the original posters to 2001: A Space Odyssey, provided Trumbull with concept art to inform the new event.|$|E

5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> impact on PedroII: on a {{personal}} level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E

25|$|Although the Yongzheng Emperor's reign {{was much}} shorter {{than that of}} both his father (the Kangxi Emperor) and his son (the Qianlong Emperor), the Yongzheng era {{was a period of}} peace and prosperity.
