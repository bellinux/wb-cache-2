50|$|Research ethics {{involves}} {{the application of}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> {{to a variety of}} topics involving research, including scientific research. These include the design and implementation of research involving human experimentation, animal experimentation, various aspects of academic scandal, including scientific misconduct (such as fraud, fabrication of data and plagiarism), whistleblowing; regulation of research, etc. Research ethics is most developed as a concept in medical research. The key agreement here is the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. The Nuremberg Code is a former agreement, but with many still important notes. Research in the social sciences presents a different set of issues than those in medical research.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a medical}} context, respect for a patient's {{personal}} autonomy {{is considered one}} of many <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in medicine. Autonomy can be defined as the ability of the person to make his or her own decisions. This faith in autonomy is the central premise of the concept of informed consent and shared decision making. This idea, while considered essential to today's practice of medicine, was developed in the last 50 years. According to Tom Beauchamp and John Childress (in Principles of Biomedical Ethics), the Nuremberg trials detailed accounts of horrifyingly exploitative medical [...] "experiments" [...] which violated the subjects' physical integrity and personal autonomy. These incidences prompted calls for safeguards in medical research.|$|E

5000|$|But though Hutcheson usually {{describes}} the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately, he does not, like Butler, conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard.

He thus anticipates the utilitarianism of Bentham—and not only in principle, {{but even in the}} use of the phrase [...] "the greatest happiness for the greatest number" [...] (Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil, sect. 3). Hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principle.</b> Intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results, and Hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption.

50|$|One of {{the most}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in human {{experimentation}} is that the experimenter should not subject {{the participants in the}} experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves. This idea was first codified in the Nuremberg Code in 1947, which was a result of the trials of Nazi doctors at the Nuremberg trials accused of murdering and torturing victims in valueless experiments. Several of these doctors were hanged. Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part. The Nuremberg Code has influenced medical experiment codes of practice around the world, as has the exposure of experiments that have since failed to follow it such as the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment.|$|E

His theoretical activities, however, were not forgotten: in 1984 he published his monumental Ética y derechos humanos, dedicated to Alfonsín, where he provided a comprehensive exposition of his moral thought; divided in three parts, it dealt with normative and applied ethics, {{as well as with}} meta-ethics. This last field he expanded in a separate volume, where he adopted a constructivist approach that attempted to derive his <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> from the presuppositions of moral discourse, in a manner that put him, as he said, [...] "between Rawls and Habermas". These substantive principles, comprising the nucleus of a theory that aspired to capture the essential components of political liberalism, were the principle of autonomy, the principle of inviolability, and the principle of dignity. The first expressed Nino's conception of the good: those things, and those things only, that were valued by the individual in question. The second imposed deontological restrictions to the pursuit of that good, prohibiting the sacrifice of some to achieve the benefit of others. The third principle allowed for individual consent, thus permitting persons to waive the rights recognized by the second one.|$|E

40|$|Although patient {{confidentiality}} {{has been}} a <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> since the Hippocratic Oath, it is under increasing threat. The main area of confidentiality is patient records. Physicians {{must be able to}} store and dispose of medical records securely. Patients should be asked whether some information should be kept out of the record or withheld if information is released. Patient identity should be kept secret during peer review of medical records. Provincial legislation outlines circumstances in which confidential information must be divulged. Because of the "team approach" to care, hospital records may be seen by many health care and administrative personnel. All hospital workers must respect confidentiality, especially when giving out information about patients by telephone or to the media. Research based on medical-record review also creates challenges for confidentiality. Electronic technology and communications are potential major sources of breaches of confidentiality. Computer records must be carefully protected from casual browsing or from unauthorized access. Fax machines and cordless and cellular telephones can allow unauthorized people to see or overhear confidential information. Confidentiality is also a concern in clinical settings, including physicians' offices and hospitals. Conversations among hospital personnel in elevators or public cafeterias can result in breaches of confidentiality. Patient confidentiality is a right that must be safeguarded by all health care personnel...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is the {{foundation}} of ethics. The question is whether there exists a universal core to ethics consisting of a <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> across cultures. This principle could for example be the so-called Golden Rule, which goes as follows: ‘You should do to others what you want them to do to you’. The Golden Rule {{is to be found in}} many of the world’s religions and is also reflected in secular society. The rule can for example be found in a political version in legal declarations e. g. the Humans Rights Declaration of 1948. There are philosophersand scientists who interpret the Golden Rule secularly. If one looks at the Golden Rule from a non-religious point of view, it can be understood for instance in the following ways: 1) As a rule which is followed to fulfil self-interest and 2) As a rule concerning role reversal. In this thesis we will go into detail on these two interpretations of the Golden Rule, because as we will see, they can be seen as two very different views of human nature. We will discuss which of the two interpretations of the Golden Rule is most adequate in connection with the description of human beings as moral agents having reason, motives, freedom and responsibility. Furthermore we will focus on the Golden Rule in a Nordic context, in this connection we will look at whether the Golden Rule corresponds to the four bioethical principles presented by the two American philosophers Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress. These principles are the principle of respect for autonomy, the principle of nonmaleficence, the principle of beneficence and the principle of justice. According to the Danish physician Henrik R. Wulff one cannot use Beauchamp and Childress’ bioethical principles as a tool for solving ethical problems in the North, because they do not correspond to the Golden Rule. Wulff argues that the Golden Rule is a moral ideal within the health services in the Nordic countries. The purpose of the thesis is, among others, to analyse and discuss whether the four bioethical principles are implicitly contained within the Golden Rule and whether Beauchamp and Childress’ method can be used to analyse bioethical problems in a Nordic context. Finally, we will set forth an ethical assessment of a treatment within biomedicine. As an example of the application of the four bioethical principles, we will look at whether human somatic gene therapy is an ethical acceptable treatment. Thus my thesis is that the Golden Rule can be viewed as a <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> across cultures and that Beauchamp and Childress’ four bioethical principles correspond to the Golden Rule. That is, I think there is a reason to maintain, that the bioethical principles can be of use for solving bioethical problems across cultures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Even {{though we}} are now well into the 21 st century and {{notwithstanding}} all the abuse to individuals involved in clinical studies that has been documented throughout History, <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> continue to be violated {{in one way or}} another. Discussion Here are some of the main factors that contribute to the abuse of subjects participating in clinical trials: paternalism, improper use of informed consent, lack of strict ethical supervision, pressure exerted by health institutions to increase the production of scientific material, and the absence of legislation regarding ethics in terms of health care and research. Are researchers ready to respect <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in light of the ample window of information provided by individual genomes, while defending the rights of the subjects participating in clinical studies as a major priority? Summary As one of the possible solutions to this problem, education regarding <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> is suggested for participants in research studies as an initial method of cognitive training in ethics, together with the promotion of ethical behavior in order to encourage the adoption of reasonable policies in the field of values, attitudes and behavior. </p...|$|E

40|$|What I {{have called}} the Ideal of Cultivation is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> of civilisation, {{originated}} by aristocratic warriors in Greek antiquity who held that the true purpose of humanity is to perfect nature It was then professed that individuals and even entire peoples could consciously develop and improve themselves {{in a way that}} was thought to obey the original lawful impulses of nature, a process which was likened to those of agriculture and animal husbandry. Subsequently the cognate idea of a politics of cultivation arose which deemed that society should be organised specifically to produce more virtuous or perfect human types. Given their fundamental association with Hellenism both ideas have been revisited constantly in the intellectual history of the west, and most notably during the great secular periods, the Renaissance and Enlightenment when active attempts were made to retrieve the ideals of antiquity. Both ideas were particularly pervasive in the German enlightenment, the Aufklärung, and were assimilated by the succeeding Romantic generation. In nineteenth century Germany, when interest in these ideas was quickly waning, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche acquired an unswerving attachment to them and made the service of them his life 2 ̆ 7 s work. The intention of this essay is to trace methodically the appearance of the Ideal of Cultivation in Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy and politics, and to outline his responses to a world which was abandoning the principles in which he deeply believed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{would like to}} show the {{importance}} of the concept of responsibility as the foundation of ethics in times of crisis in particular in the fields of politics and economics in the modern civilisation marked by globalization and technological progres. I consider the concept of responsibility as the key notion {{in order to understand the}} ethical duty in a modern technological civilisation. We can indeed observe a moralization of the concept of responsibility going beyond a strict legal definition in terms of imputability. The paper begins by discussing the humanistic foundations of such a concept of responsibility. It treats the historical origins of responsibility and it relates this concept to the concept of accountability. On the basis of this historical determination of the concept I would like to present the definition of the concept of responsibility as <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> that has increasing importance as the foundation of the principles of governance in modern welfare states. In this context the paper discusses the extension of the concept of responsibility towards institutional or corporate responsibility where responsibility does not only concerns the responsibility of individuals but also deals with the responsibility of institutional collectivities. In this way the paper is based on the following structure : 1) The ethical foundation of the concept of responsibility 2) Responsibility in technological civilisation 3) Political responsibility for good governance in the welfare state 4) Social responsibility of business corporations in times of globalization 5) Conclusion and discussion : changed conditions of responsibility in modern times...|$|R

This security overhead has dominant impact on the energy dissipation which is strongly related to the lifetime of the sensor, a critical aspect in wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. Strict definition of the security functionality, complete hardware model (microprocessor and radio), WBAN topology and the structure of the medium access control (MAC) frame are required for an accurate estimation of the energy that security introduces into the WBAN.

Due to the development of many new technologies, means of diagnostics and therapeutic procedures, there is a great focus on the quality of professional expertise considering radiology assistants. However, this profession requires extraordinary abilities such as a delicate approach towards the patient, basic knowledge from the branch of ethics, nursing and communication skills. In the theoretical part, I tried to briefly define concepts of morality, conscience, ethics and ethical theory. Another part of my thesis is focused on <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principles,</b> the relationship between ethics and law, deals with ethical codes among health care professions and defines the branch of Radiology Assistance.

40|$|ABSTRACT This thesis {{presents}} {{case studies}} of five projects that use the visual arts to effect social change in post-apartheid South Africa. Artist Proof Studio, Paper Prayers, Phumani Paper, Community Engagement at the University of Johannesburg and the AIDS Action Intervention exemplify a range of approaches to social activism through the arts that parallels the political transformation to democracy. The first case study traces {{the history of the}} community printmaking studio, Artist Proof Studio, from 1991 to 2008 in three phases: redress, reconciliation and rebuilding. Artist Proof Studio was founded in 1992 to provide visual arts training to highly creative, but previously disadvantaged individuals. The Paper Prayers for AIDS Awareness initiative was implemented as a program of the studio in 1998. Originally funded by government, the campaign reached thousands of people nationwide. Phumani Paper, a national hand papermaking programme for job creation, was founded in response to a state directive to higher education institutions to implement technology transfer and poverty alleviation initiatives. The Papermaking Research and Development Unit was established at the University of Johannesburg in 1996. The principles and approaches established through these programs are analysed in the fifth case study, the AIDS Action Intervention. This three-year intervention brings all the initiatives together in a multi-disciplinary program that applies participatory action research as well as visual arts methodologies that help catalyse meaningful social action. There are common elements running through each of the case studies that derive from the fact that each intervention was based on the democratic values of human rights and equity. Further, the methodology throughout is dialogical, consultative, and designed to facilitate participants recognizing their own voices. The idea is that practice leads to understanding and stems from a <b>fundamental</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> or ideal that all human beings have the capacity to realize their potential in their own way. The central argument of these case studies is that the projects continue to survive, against significant odds, because of the power of imagination, aspiration and dreaming. I interrogate the projects’ foundational premise that participants are empowered by the creative process, which promotes a sense of pride, and generates leadership as well as income. In addition, I argue that grass-roots visual arts projects, which ordinarily go un-analysed in any systematic way, can offer a model for transforming knowledge-creation through their non-hierarchical and participatory methodologies. In sum, this thesis documents and analyses eighteen years of arts activism; it assesses the actual outcomes of the interventions against the idealistic aims on which the projects were founded, and provides a resource guide for cultural activism in South Africa. It demonstrates the dynamic possibilities that exist in the domain of development and arts education...|$|R

He also applies both theories of responsibility to mining activities, showing that they may illuminate the current mining public politics, most of all dictated by the interests of mining enterprises themselves, without respecting citizen rights that cannot make themselves sufficiently represented by the traditional representative democratic institutions...|$|R
