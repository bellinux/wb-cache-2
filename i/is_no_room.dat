More than 800 fans' ashes have been buried at Goodison Park and since 2004 the club have had to reject further {{requests}} because there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for any more. Tommy Lawton wanted his ashes to be scattered at Goodison but his son chose to donate them to the national football museum because of Goodison's uncertain future.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they are}} all assembled, the Simpson family sit down to Thanksgiving dinner. When Lisa places the {{centerpiece}} on the table, she argues with Bart about where it should go since there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> left for the turkey. In the ensuing fight, Bart accidentally throws the centerpiece into the fireplace and it burns up. Devastated, Lisa runs to her room crying, while Bart is sent to his room by his parents for causing the incident.|$|E

5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

25|$|Switzerland adopts the country's Latin {{short name}} Helvetia on coins and stamps, since there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> {{to use all}} of the nation's four {{official}} languages.

25|$|The {{admissibility}} {{of forensic}} evidence is {{left up to}} the judgement of the court. To provide a strong basis of admissibility for the evidence, accurate documentation is essential so that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for speculation as to {{the authenticity of the}} evidence. Given that admissibility is granted, expert witnesses may be called to a courtroom to either support or refute the conclusions that are derived from the evidence submitted.|$|E
25|$|The superior–subordinate {{relationship}} {{is an important}} relational factor. Employees who perceive they have a higher-quality relationship with their supervisors are more often to use articulated dissent. They feel their supervisors respect their opinions {{and that they have}} mutual influence and persuasion over the outcome of organizational decisions. Conversely, employees that perceive their relationship with their supervisor as low-quality will resort to latent dissent. They feel that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> to voice their opinions (Kassing, 2000).|$|E
25|$|Though {{women are}} {{considered}} to be members of the Katipunan, information regarding the women's section were scarce and sometimes conflicting. Teodoro Agoncillo, for example, disregarded Marina Dizon and concluded that Josefa Rizal was the only president of the said section. Gregorio Zaide, on the other hand, mentioned Dizon's presidency in his 1939 publication History of the Katipunan but changed his mind when he adopted Dr. Pío Valenzuela's notion that women-members did not elect officers, hence there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for president.|$|E

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|While {{the loss}} of skilled labor {{represents}} a potential cost for countries of origin, it can also at times be beneficial. For instance, if there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> in {{the economy of the}} home country to use the skilled labor, then it is better for the workers to migrate and send back remittances. When these remittances are greater than what the migrant would have made in the home country, it is also beneficial. Another example is when the migrants return with new skills, knowledge, and capacities. Lastly, the movement of skilled labor is beneficial for the country of origin when migrants forge strong economic connections between the home and host country.|$|E
25|$|At the Joppa Gate in Jerusalem, Mary and Joseph {{pass through}} {{on their way}} from Nazareth to Bethlehem. They stop at the inn at the {{entrance}} to the city, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room.</b> Mary is pregnant and, as labor begins, they head to a cave on a nearby hillside, where Jesus is born. In the pastures outside the city, a group of seven shepherds watch their flocks. Angels announce the Christ's birth. The shepherds hurry towards the city and enter the cave on the hillside to worship the Christ. They spread the news of the Christ's birth and many come to see him.|$|E

Worsaae's earlier and later became Lubbock's palaeo- and neo- in 1865, but {{alternatively}} English speakers used Earlier and Later Stone Age, as did Lyell's 1883 edition of Principles of Geology, with older and younger as synonyms. As there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for a middle between the comparative adjectives, they were later modified to early and late. The scheme created a problem for further bipartite subdivisions, which {{would have resulted in}} such terms as early early stone age, but that terminology was avoided by adoption of Geikie's upper and lower Paleolithic.|$|E

Petőfi felt that the country would not be saved through moderation, but {{through the use of}} the most extreme means available. He detested even the thought of cowardice… Petőfi's vision was correct. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for prudence in revolutions whose fate and eventual success is always decided by boldness and raw courage… this is why Petőfi condemned his compatriots for the sin of opportunism and hesitation when faced with the great problems of their age… Petőfi's works must be regarded as the law of the Hungarian soul… and of the… love of the country".|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} current {{westbound}} off ramp, existing ramps linking the bridge traffic to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island are inadequate to handle traffic for future expected residential development. In particular, the eastbound off ramp has always been extremely hazardous, while added westbound on ramp traffic would interfere with bridge traffic flow. Between the tunnel's western portal and the existing western suspension span, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>room</b> for modern ramp configurations. The developments are expected to add some three thousand residents to the island, as well as business and office space. To support this traffic, a system of new ramps (currently only partially completed) will be built {{on the eastern side}} of the islands to link to the YBITS, where there will be adequate room for proper traffic merges and departures. The east-side ramps are expected to cost about $95,670,000 while they began construction on late-2013 for a June 2016 opening. New westbound on- and off-ramps opened on October 22, 2016.|$|E
