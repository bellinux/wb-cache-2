40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} <b>free</b> <b>space</b> <b>coupling</b> to high-Q whispering gallery modes both in circular and deformed microcavities are presented. In {{the case of}} a circular cavity, both analytical solutions and asymptotic formulas are derived. The coupling efficiencies at different coupling regimes for cylinder incoming wave are discussed, and the maximum efficiency is estimated for the practical Gaussian beam excitation. In {{the case of a}} deformed cavity, the coupling efficiency can be higher if the excitation beam can match the intrinsic emission well and the radiation loss can be tuned by adjusting the degree of deformation. Employing an abstract model of slightly deformed cavity, we found that the asymmetric and peak like line shapes instead of the Lorentz-shape dip are universal in transmission spectra due to multi-mode interference, and the coupling efficiency can not be estimated from the absolute depth of the dip. Our results provide guidelines for <b>free</b> <b>space</b> <b>coupling</b> in experiments, suggesting that the high-Q ARCs can be efficiently excited through free space which will stimulate further experiments and applications of WGMs based on <b>free</b> <b>space</b> <b>coupling.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Due to the strong field gradients in the plasmonic near field the optomechanical coupling constant G can exceed 1 THz/nm, which is well beyond that of other existing mechanical transduction geometries. We show that plasmonic nanostructures can be used to transduce thermally driven nanomechanical motion to optical signals.

40|$|Published online: 12 May 2016 Whispering gallery modes (WGMs) {{have been}} widely studied over the past 20 years for various applications, {{including}} biological sensing. While the WGM-based sensing approaches {{reported in the literature}} have shown tremendous performance down to single molecule detection, at present such sensing technologies are not yet mature and still have significant practical constraints that limit their use in real-world applications. Our work has focused on developing a practical, yet effective, WGM-based sensing platform capable of being used as a dip sensor for in-vivo biosensing by combining WGM fluorescent microresonators with silica Microstructured Optical Fibers (MOFs). We recently demonstrated that a suspended core MOF with a dye-doped polymer microresonator supporting WGMs positioned onto the tip of the fiber, {{can be used as a}} dip sensor. In this architecture the resonator is anchored to one of the MOF air holes, in contact with the fiber core, enabling a significant portion of the evanescent field from the fiber to overlap with the sphere and hence excite the fluorescent WGMs. This architecture allows for remote excitation and collection of the WGMs. The fiber also permits easy manipulation of the microresonator for dip sensing applications, and hence alleviates the need for a complex microfluidic interface. More importantly, it allows for an increase in both the excitation and collection efficiency compared to <b>free</b> <b>space</b> <b>coupling,</b> and also improves the Q factor.
