25|$|This is {{an older}} method of water-saving {{automatic}} flushing, which only operates when the room has been used. A push-button switch is {{mounted in the}} door frame of the restroom, and triggers the flush valve for all restroom urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the restroom is not being used. This method requires a spring-operated automatic <b>door</b> <b>closer,</b> since the flush mechanism only operates when the restroom door opens.|$|E
2500|$|Gravity feed saws {{fall under}} their own weight. [...] Most such saws have a method to allow the cutting force to be adjusted, such as a movable {{counterbalancing}} weight, a coil spring with a screw-thread adjustment, or a hydraulic or pneumatic damper (speed control valve). The latter does not force the blade downwards, but rather simply limits {{the speed at which}} the saw can fall, preventing excessive feed on thin or soft parts. This is analogous to <b>door</b> <b>closer</b> hardware whose dampering action keeps the door from slamming. Gravity feed designs are common in small saws.|$|E
5000|$|Electro-{{hydraulic}} - {{the motor}} drives a hydraulic pump, which pressurizes {{the oil in}} a <b>door</b> <b>closer,</b> which in turn turns the <b>door</b> <b>closer</b> and opens the door. This is the preferred type in Europe. (In the US it has a reputation of being prone to oil leaks.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the <b>door</b> <b>closes.</b> The {{operation of}} the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working door open and <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, {{the door open and}} <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are used to manually open or <b>close</b> the <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons immediately <b>closing</b> the <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so the <b>door</b> cannot be <b>closed</b> until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button has no effect. However, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> will immediately <b>close</b> the <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> in the US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

50|$|A dashpot is {{a common}} {{component}} in a <b>door</b> <b>closer</b> {{to prevent it from}} slamming shut.
