Chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia patients are heterogeneous in their risk of adverse outcomes. Management strategies are tailored according to level of risk. Many emerging predictors for risk stratification remain controversial being based on single studies only. A {{systematic review}} was conducted to determine the strength of association of all identified predictors. Studies were obtained from electronic databases, <b>grey</b> <b>literatures</b> and reference lists. Methodological quality of studies was assessed for internal validity and representativeness. Seven studies (four prospective and three retrospective cohorts) investigating 22 factors were reported. Fixed effects meta-analysis showed: hypotension and thrombocytopenia were significant predictors for high-risk. Additional predictors that might enhance performance of current models include: tachypnoea, presence of central venous catheter, duration and severity of neutropenia.

40|$|Understanding the {{economic}} impact of psychological and social forms of workplace aggression to society could yield important insights into the magnitude of this occupational phenomenon. The objective of this systematic review was to collate, summarise, review and critique, and synthesise the cost of psychosocial workplace aggression at the individual- and societal-level. A peerreviewed research protocol detailing the search strategy, study selection procedures and data extraction process was developed a priori. Both the academic and <b>grey</b> <b>literatures</b> were examined. To allow for basic comparison, all costs were converted and adjusted to reflect 2014 US dollars. Twelve studies, from 5 national contexts, met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed: Australia (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), Spain (n = 1), the United Kingdom (n = 3) and the United States (n = 5). The annual cost of psychosocial workplace aggression varied substantially, ranging between 114. 64 million and 35. 9 billion. Heterogeneity across studies was found, with noted variations in stated study aims, utilised prevalence statistics and included costs. The review concludes that existing evidence attests to the substantial cost of psychosocial workplace aggression to both the individual and society, albeit such derived estimates are likely gross underestimates. The findings highlight the importance of interpreting such figures within their conceptual and methodological contexts...|$|R
40|$|UrbanSim is an {{integrated}} transportation land-use model {{that has been}} under development since the late 1990 s. It has received a fair bit of attention in the integrated modeling community. Its notoriety comes primarily from its disaggregated approach. A number of papers describing the application of UrbanSim {{have appeared in the}} formal and <b>grey</b> <b>literatures.</b> Some of these papers report on successful applications of UrbanSim with little description of the amount of effort required to develop an operational model. Those that do report on the effort and challenges of using UrbanSim suggest that substantial data and human resources are required. One recent report quantifies the human resource requirements as an interdisciplinary team of four for four years. This reputation makes many potential users think twice before developing an UrbanSim model. We believe the only way to evaluate the potential of UrbanSim is by having a good understanding of what it can do, and how much effort is required. Understanding UrbanSim, however, does not require having a fully operational model. This paper is aimed at researchers and institutions that would like to evaluate UrbanSim, but are concerned about the effort required. Based on two UrbanSim applications (Brussels in Belgium and Lausanne in Switzerland), this paper describes a procedure to develop a prototype UrbanSim model and how to use it to evaluate UrbanSim for application to a new region...|$|R

This paper is {{intended}} to provide compressive and up to date evidence on the prevalence and investigate the associated factors of Hypertension in Ethiopia from January, 2000 to April, 2015. Methods: A quantitative epidemiological systematic literature review was conducted by searching different published articles in different data bases which is written in English including MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Google scholar, Cochrane and <b>grey</b> <b>literatures.</b> The search was restricted to population based studies on hypertension in Ethiopia published between January 2000 and April 2015. All data were extracted independently by a single reviewer using a standardized protocol and data collection form. Nine publications met the inclusion criteria. The total pooled data were nine surveys involving over 13, 327 participants. Results: The reported rate of hypertension is varied widely, with the highest rate of 31. 5 % in male and the lowest rate of 0. 8 % in female, partly because of the differences in participants mean ages, source population and study settings. This review found a high prevalence of hypertension in urban residents and different associated factors including overweight, family history of hypertension, age, sex, sleeping for less than 5 hours, Oral contraceptive use, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, eating vegetable three or fewer days per week, salt use, obesity, higher education and vigorous recreational activities were identified.

This study aimed to assess the different patterns of irrational use {{of medicines}} and its influential factors in China and Vietnam. A systematic review was performed on both published and <b>grey</b> <b>literatures</b> in English, Chinese and Vietnamese languages between 1993 and 2013 based on the WHO framework. Quality assessment was conducted on the basis of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Key indicators were analyzed to compare the irrational use of medicines in two countries. A total of 67 published works about China and 29 about Vietnam were included, the majority of which were cross-sectional prescription studies in both China and Vietnam. Irrational use of medicines was found in both the countries but issues with polypharmacy as well as overuse of antibiotics were more severe in Vietnam while overuse of injections was unique to China. Various patterns of irrational use were also indicated between urban and rural areas, and among different levels of hospitals. Rarely does literature focus on the analysis of influential factors of irrational use of medicines. While lack of proper knowledge from both providers and patients were the most recognized influential factors in both countries, economic incentives from pharmaceutical companies in China, and weak control and regulation over prescriptions in Vietnam were the main factors attributed to this issue. Severe irrational use of medicines has been abundantly evidenced in both China and Vietnam, highlighting the importance of policy interventions on the issue. However, limited evidence on the appropriateness or its compliance (conformity) to guidelines of prescription has been found. In addition, convincing evidence on the underlying explanation of this issue is lacking, although economic incentives, health insurance coverage, and knowledge of service providers and users have been implied to be factors influencing irrational drug use...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Pain {{can affect}} people {{regardless}} of age, gender or ethnicity. Chronic central neuropathic pain (CCNP) is a debilitating condition that affects populations such as stroke survivors, amputees, {{spinal cord injury}} patients and patients with multiple sclerosis, with prevalence rates between 30 % and 80 %. This condition {{can be caused by}} a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. CCNP is notoriously drug resistant, and few effective CCNP treatment or management strategies exist. The emergence of non-invasive brain stimulation and neuromodulation techniques provide novel avenues for managing chronic central neuropathic pain. This scoping review aims to systematically identify the methods and effectiveness of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques for treating and managing chronic central neuropathic pain. Methods and analysis The following databases will be searched systematically: PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), Association of Computing Machinary (ACM) and Scopus. Additional literature will be identified by searching the reference lists of identified studies. Studies will include reviews and original research in both published and <b>grey</b> <b>literatures.</b> Two reviewers will independently screen identified studies for final inclusion. A quantitative analysis on the intervention type, application and efficacy will be synthesised along with a qualitative analysis to describe the effectiveness of each intervention. Ethics and dissemination No primary data will be collected and hence formal ethics review is not required. The results of the scoping review will be presented at relevant national and international conferences, published in a peer-reviewed journal and provided to the stakeholders with plain language to be posted on their websites. This scoping review will provide a foundation to guide the development of future primary research on non-invasive brain stimulation and CCNP.
