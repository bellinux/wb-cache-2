40|$|The shoes {{manufacturing}} {{implies the}} use of various types of leathers, leather substitutes and fabric. The sewing plays {{a very important role}} in shoe making, having an impact both in terms of functionality and outlook. One of the most important indicators of the sewed products quality is seam strength, which is influenced by a series of technological parameters such as: the shape of the needle’s top, the needle’s diameter, the seam thickness, the number of seams, the gauge of the thread, the type of seam and the material type. This paper studies the stitching strength of the full grain leather and full grain leather shiny surface used for <b>footwear</b> <b>uppers,</b> in order to improve productivity and seam quality. The experimental researches obtained for the stitching strength allow calculating the weakening coefficient of the material in the process of sewing (a= 0. 33 - 0. 48). The “a” coefficient is dependent on the stitch density, the shape of the needle’s top and the joined materials. In terms of stitching strength, the results indicate that the full grain leather obtains higher values than the full grain leather shiny surface. ...|$|E
50|$|By {{the reign}} of James I boots had {{replaced}} shoes as the most popular <b>footwear</b> among the <b>upper</b> classes who often wore them indoors, even with spurs. By the 1620s they resembled the boots worn by the Three Musketeers, with a flared bucket-shaped top and high wooden heels similar to those on cowboy boots.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} differences in foot strike pattern comparing habitually shod runners who ran barefoot and with running shoes. Barefoot running {{results in a}} ﬂatter foot landing and in a decreased vertical ground reaction force compared to shod running. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate one possible parameter inﬂuencing running pattern: the midsole thickness. Fifteen participants ran overground at 3. 3 m s À 1 barefoot and with ﬁve shoes of different midsole thickness (0 mm, 2 mm, 4 mm, 8 mm, 16 mm) with no difference of height between rearfoot and forefoot. Impact magnitude was evaluated using transient peak of vertical ground reaction force, loading rate, tibial acceleration peak and rate. Hip, knee and ankle ﬂexion angles were computed at touch-down and during stance phase (range of motion and maximum values). External net joint moments and stiffness for hip, knee and ankle joints were also observed as well as global leg stiffness. No signiﬁcant effect of midsole thickness was observed on ground reaction force and tibial acceleration. However, the contact time increased with midsole thickness. Barefoot running compared to shod running induced ankle in plantar ﬂexion at touch-down, higher ankle dorsiﬂexion and lower knee ﬂexion during stance phase. These adjustments are suspected to explain the absence of difference on ground reaction force and tibial acceleration. This study showed that the presence of very thin <b>footwear</b> <b>upper</b> and sole was sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the running pattern...|$|R
40|$|The study {{concerns}} the filling and plasticizing {{processes in the}} final stages of forming multifunctional leathers from various raw materials on the basis of using new composite systems. The structure of a tannin-containing composition was found to affect the process of its diffusion throughout the structure of the topographic areas of the semifinished chrome-tanned product. In particular, we have determined that the depth of diffusion of the filling composition in loose areas was close to 100 % with a 5 % use of the mass of the intermediate product; in dense areas even with a bigger use of the mass, it was only 80 % of the thickness of the intermediate product. The structure of the filling and plasticizing composition was developed to form various leathers from hides of cattle and sheep. A protein hydrolysate and a highly dispersive modified aluminosilicate have proved to influence the process of forming and the physicochemical properties of semifinished leathers. If the filling and plasticizing composition contains optimal amounts of montmorillonite and protein hydrolysate at 4 - 2 % of the semifinished leather mass, the obtained leather materials have respective tensile strengths of sheepskin and bovine hides of 15 - 16 MPa and 20 - 22 MPa, and their stiffness is 15 - 16 and 21 - 22 SN. The use of montmorillonite in the filling and plasticizing compositions in processing semifinished chrome-tanned products proved to ensure stability of the dispersed structure in further processing and its mobility in the cyclic deformation of the products. The complex study of the process of filling and plasticizing semifinished chrome-tanned products was the basis for developing effective technologies to produce elastic materials for <b>footwear</b> leather <b>uppers</b> and apparel and haberdashery articles with the necessary physical and mechanical properties as well as bigger volume and area outputs by 270 - 310 сm 3 / 100 g of protein substance and by 5 - 6 %, respectively, in comparison with the outputs of the industrial technology.
