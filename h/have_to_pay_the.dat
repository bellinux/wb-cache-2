5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|The end {{of silent}} {{film in the}} West and in Japan was imposed by the {{industry}} and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn't lack anything, least in Japan, where {{there was always the}} human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2. Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> full congestion charge. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016.|$|E

5|$|Harith {{advocated}} various reforms, {{the most}} prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (mawali) with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, in conformity with the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous mawali would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> poll tax) {{put an end to}} this, leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif. Many of the groups and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement. Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the ʿajam (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd. Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups. This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20,000 Iraqi troops into the province {{in the aftermath of the}} Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.|$|E

25|$|The Second Estate feared {{they would}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> tax {{replacing}} the suppressed Corvée. The nobles saw this tax as especially humiliating and below them, {{as they took}} great pride in their titles and their lineage, {{many of whom had}} died in defense of France.

25|$|The {{transport}} system uses the proof-of-payment approach for fare collection for the metro, local trains, trams and ferries. In the buses the driver checks the tickets as passenger step in. Ticket controllers check tickets on randomly selected vehicles and a penalty fee of 80 EUR and {{a price of}} a single ticket is charged from any passenger without a valid ticket. If a passenger has forgotten his/her Travel Card with valid travel period, the passenger may later visit a service point of the transport company and will not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> penalty fee.|$|E

25|$|So, in 2015, {{his first}} year as President, Utz Claassen and GM Miguel Ángel Nadal brought Albert Ferrer in to coach an {{overhauled}} roster, complete with some 15 new players, allowing youth and new players alike to compete for minutes.

Nonetheless, the new team failed to gel and {{made it to the}} winter break in the drop zone. Albert Ferrer was ousted, and Pepe Galvez was brought in.|$|E
25|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2006–2007, the NWSC tariff for {{domestic}} use was US$0.64 per cubic metre. Taken {{from a public}} standpipe, the tariff was US$0.42 per cubic metre or less than US$0.01 per jerrycan. The average commercial tariff was US$1.00 per cubic metre. For commercial users, a rising block tariff structure was used. A customer who {{was connected to the}} sewerage system would pay an additional charge of 75-100 percent. Although water is cheapest at standpipes, UN-Water reports that in this case users usually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> costs of operating a stand tap and thus in the end pay more. A cross subsidy arrangement enables NWSC to keep in operation systems that do not cover operation and maintenance costs.|$|E

Minnesota lost in the divisional round to the St. Louis Rams 49–37, despite Moss catching nine passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns. Moss was fined $40,000, which was later reduced to $25,000, during that game due to squirting an NFL referee with a water bottle.

25|$|Coast Air {{started its}} first head-on {{competition}} with Scandinavian Airlines on 2 June 2003. Using the ATR 42, it introduced two daily services from Haugesund to Oslo. By September this had increased to three, and tickets were selling {{as low as}} NOK500. SAS responded with a 22-percent cut in ticket prices. Coast Air lost NOK11 million on the price war during 2003, and was ultimately forced {{to withdraw from the}} route in May 2004. The case was investigated by the Norwegian Competition Authority based on accusations of SAS carrying out illegal price dumping on the route. They issued a fine of NOK20 million, but the case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was acquitted. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had broken the law, but that since it took place immediately the act came into power, they would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> fine.|$|E
25|$|The Judges {{themselves}} are not exempt from the law; in fact {{they are expected to}} obey it more strictly than any other. A violation that would earn a citizen a few months in an Iso-Cube would get a Judge a twenty-year sentence, served as hard labor on Saturn's moon, Titan, after surgical modification to enable the convict to survive outside there without needing an expensive space suit. (Titan is a moon of Saturn in reality, but was located over Jupiter in an early Dredd strip.) When Judges do make a minor mistake (anything were the citizen is alive or not in an intensive care ward) such as wrongful arrest or search they do <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> citizen a compensation fee if there is no crimes to be charged with. On that basis, if they can't find any evidence for the main charge, then they will look for any minor crime or misdemeanours to charge to citizen with to get themselves off the hook.|$|E

On 17 December 2008, LTV confirmed that they had requested to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organisers of Eurovision, their withdrawal from the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, due solely to the budget cuts that hindered the Latvian broadcaster from paying the participation fee for Eurovision. After their intent {{was given to the}} EBU, talks between the two parties began for a way that LTV could participate in the contest. However, their withdrawal request occurred 3 days after the deadline for participation, and it was rumoured that LTV would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> participation because the deadline had passed. On 20 December 2008, LTV confirmed their withdrawal from the contest, having no penalty for withdrawing past the deadline. However, on 12 January 2009 the final participants list for the 2009 contest was released, that confirmed Latvia will participate.|$|E
