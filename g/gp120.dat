5|$|The {{first step}} in fusion {{involves}} the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of <b>gp120</b> to CD4. Once <b>gp120</b> is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine receptor binding domains of <b>gp120</b> and allowing them {{to interact with the}} target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.|$|E
5|$|The term {{viral tropism}} {{refers to the}} cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4+ T cells is {{mediated}} through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (<b>gp120)</b> with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with chemokine coreceptors.|$|E
5|$|Entry to {{the cell}} begins through {{interaction}} of the trimeric envelope complex (gp160 spike) and both CD4 and a chemokine receptor (generally either CCR5 or CXCR4, but others are known to interact) on the cell surface. <b>gp120</b> binds to integrin α4β7 activating LFA-1 the central integrin involved {{in the establishment of}} virological synapses, which facilitate efficient cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1. The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, <b>gp120,</b> can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, <b>gp120,</b> specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
5|$|The RNA genome {{consists}} {{of at least}} seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (gag, pol, and env, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and sometimes a tenth tev, which is a fusion of tat env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain information {{needed to make the}} structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, env codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form <b>gp120</b> and gp41. The six remaining genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu (or vpx in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.|$|E
25|$|Since CD4 {{receptor}} binding {{is the most}} obvious step in HIV infection, <b>gp120</b> {{was among the first}} targets of HIV vaccine research. Efforts to develop HIV vaccines targeting <b>gp120,</b> however, have been hampered by the chemical and structural properties of <b>gp120,</b> which make it difficult for antibodies to bind to it. <b>gp120</b> can also easily be shed {{from the surface of the}} virus and captured by T cells due to its loose binding with gp41. A conserved region in the <b>gp120</b> glycoprotein that is involved in the metastable attachment of <b>gp120</b> to CD4 has been identified and targeting of invariant region has been achieved with a broadly neutralising antibody, IgG1-b12.|$|E
25|$|The protein <b>gp120</b> is {{necessary}} {{during the initial}} binding of HIV to its target cell. Consequently, anything which binds to <b>gp120</b> or its targets can physically block <b>gp120</b> from binding to a cell. Only one such agent, Maraviroc, which binds the co-receptor CCR5 is currently licensed and in clinical use. No agent targeting gp120's main first cellular interaction partner, CD4, is currently licensed since interfering with such a central molecule {{of the immune system}} can cause toxic side effects, such as the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT4. Targeting <b>gp120</b> itself has proven extremely difficult due to its high degree of variability and shielding. Fostemsavir (BMS-663068) is a methyl phosphate prodrug of the small molecule inhibitor BMS-626529, which prevents viral entry by binding to the viral envelope <b>gp120</b> and interfering with virus attachment to the host CD4 receptor.|$|E
25|$|The HIV {{viral protein}} <b>gp120</b> induces {{apoptosis}} of neuronal cells by inhibiting levels of furin and tissue plasminogen activator, enzymes responsible for converting pBDNF to mBDNF. <b>gp120</b> induces mitochondrial-death proteins like caspases which {{may influence the}} upregulation of the death receptor Fas leading to apoptosis of neuronal cells, <b>gp120</b> induces oxidative stress in the neuronal cells, {{and it is also}} known to activate STAT1 and induce interleukins IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in neuronal cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gp120</b> is coded by the HIV env gene, {{which is}} around 2.5 kb long and codes for around 850 amino acids. The primary env product is the protein gp160, which gets cleaved to <b>gp120</b> (~480 amino acids) and gp41 (~345 amino acids) in the endoplasmatic {{reticulum}} by the cellular protease furin. The crystal structure of core <b>gp120</b> shows an organization with an outer domain, an inner domain {{with respect to}} its termini and a bridging sheet. <b>Gp120</b> is anchored to the viral membrane, or envelope, via non-covalent bonds with the transmembrane glycoprotein, gp41. Three gp120s and gp41s combine in a trimer of heterodimers to form the envelope spike, which mediates attachment to and entry into the host cell.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide shows {{involvement}} in HIV-1 infection. gp120-gp41 are {{specific types of}} envelope glycoprotein complexes that are found on HIV-1. These glycoprotein complexes can interact with CD4, a viral receptor molecule, which induces {{a change in the}} conformation of <b>gp120.</b> This change in conformation allows the <b>gp120</b> complex to interact with the chemokine co-receptor and the insertion of the fusion peptide, gp41, into the membrane of the host cell. This allows the HIV-1 virus to enter into the cell. <b>Gp120</b> can also bind to glycolipids like sulfatide and galactocerebroside (GalCer). Sulfatide binds strongly to the V3 loop of <b>gp120,</b> which does not interact with CD4. Consequently, sulfatide acts as an alternate virus receptor in CD4- cells, and it participates in transmembrane signaling. However, sulfatide has little function in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ cells.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} {{isolated and}} characterized the first HIV bnabs {{seen in a}} decade. The two broadest neutralizers were PGT151 and PGT152. They could block about two-thirds of a large panel of HIV strains. These antibodies did not bind to known epitopes, on Env, <b>gp120</b> or gp41 (Env's protein subunits) unlike most other bNAbs. Instead they attach to parts of both. <b>Gp120</b> and gp41 assemble as a trimer. The bNAbs binding site occurs only on the trimer structure, the form of Evn that invades host cells.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-1 {{has been}} shown to enhance HIV {{infection}} due to its galactose binding specificity. HIV preferentially infects CD4+ T cells and other cells of the immune system, immobilising the adaptive immune system. HIV is a virus that infects CD4+ cells via binding of its viral envelope glycoprotein complex, which consists of <b>gp120</b> and gp41. The <b>gp120</b> glycoprotein contains two types of N-glycan, high mannose oligomers and N-acetyllactosamine chains on a trimannose core. The high mannose oligomers are pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) and are recognised by the C-type lectin DC-SIGN found on dendritic cells. The N-acetyllactosamine chains are ligands for galectin-1. Galectin-1 is expressed in the thymus. In particular it is secreted in abundance by Th1 cells. In its normal function, galectin-1 binds to glycans on the CD4 co-receptor of T cells to prevent auto reactivity. When HIV is present, the galectin bridges between the CD4 co-receptor and <b>gp120</b> ligands, thus facilitating HIV infection of the T cell. Galectin-1 is not essential for HIV infection but assists it by accelerating the binding kinetics between <b>gp120</b> and CD4. Knowledge of the mechanism between galectin and HIV may provide important therapeutic opportunities. A galectin-1 inhibitor can be used in conjunction with antiretroviral drugs to decrease the infectivity of the HIV and increase the efficacy of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Most bNAb {{sites are}} on HIV’s only exposed surface antigen, the flower-like {{envelope}} (Env) protein (<b>gp120</b> and gp41) that sprouts from the viral membrane {{and is designed}} to grab and penetrate host cells.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} notable {{examples}} of this mimicry or acquisition of the same carbohydrate sequences implicated in this protective system by pathogens and aggressive tumor cells. The major carbohydrate sequence linked to glycodelin-A also profusely coats the surface of schistosomes. The profile of the major oligosaccharides linked to CA125 and the major surface glycoprotein of HIV-1 (<b>gp120)</b> almost perfectly overlap. More persistent pathogens linked to the eu-FEDS model may be identified as mass spectrometry methods for sequencing oligosaccharides become more sensitive.|$|E
25|$|The single-strand RNA is {{tightly bound}} to p7 nucleocapsid proteins, late {{assembly}} protein p6, and enzymes {{essential to the}} development of the virion, such as reverse transcriptase and integrase. Lysine tRNA is the primer of the magnesium-dependent reverse transcriptase. The nucleocapsid associates with the genomic RNA (one molecule per hexamer) and protects the RNA from digestion by nucleases. Also enclosed within the virion particle are Vif, Vpr, Nef, and viral protease. A matrix composed of an association of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid, ensuring the integrity of the virion particle. This is in turn surrounded by an envelope of host-cell origin. The envelope is formed when the capsid buds from the host cell, taking some of the host-cell membrane with it. The envelope includes the glycoproteins <b>gp120</b> and gp41, which are responsible for binding to and entering the host cell.|$|E
25|$|As {{the only}} {{proteins}} {{on the surface}} of the virus, the envelope glycoproteins (<b>gp120</b> and gp41) are the major targets for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric envelope spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E
500|$|The {{final step}} of the viral cycle, {{assembly}} of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved by furin resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, gp41 and <b>gp120.</b> [...] These are transported to the plasma membrane of the host cell where gp41 anchors <b>gp120</b> to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the gag polyproteins {{still need to be}} cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the packaged viral protease and can be inhibited by antiretroviral drugs of the protease inhibitor class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion. Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.|$|E
500|$|The {{molecular}} {{structure of the}} viral spike has now been determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. These advances in structural biology [...] were made possible due {{to the development of}} stable recombinant forms of the viral spike by the introduction of an intersubunit disulphide bond and an isoleucine to proline mutation in gp41. The so-called SOSIP trimers not only reproduce the antigenic properties of the native viral spike but also display the same degree of immature glycans as presented on the native virus. Recombinant trimeric viral spikes are promising vaccine candidates as they display less non-neutralising epitopes than recombinant monomeric <b>gp120</b> which act to suppress the immune response to target epitopes.|$|E
2500|$|The binding of <b>gp120</b> to GalCer has {{the ability}} to start the fusion of HIV-1, but the binding of <b>gp120</b> to {{sulfatide}} does not. Sulfatide is not a functional receptor. However, experiments have shown that sulfatide and GalCer compete for the ability to bind to <b>gp120,</b> and sulfatide has been shown to have the strongest binding affinity for recombinant <b>gp120</b> of all the glycolipids tested. [...] Therefore, this suggests that when sulfatide is attached to HIV-1, it cannot interact with the chemokine co-receptor because of the instability of the complex between <b>gp120</b> and sulfatide, which therefore prevents the initiation of the fusion process. This indicates that sulfatide can prevent HIV-1 infection by mediating <b>gp120</b> binding, which, in turn, prevents the fusion process; consequently, it has been demonstrated that sulfatide treatments may lead to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication.|$|E
2500|$|Since <b>gp120</b> plays a {{vital role}} in the ability of HIV-1 to enter CD4+ cells, its {{evolution}} is of particular interest. [...] Many neutralizing antibodies bind to sites located in variable regions of <b>gp120,</b> so mutations in these regions will be selected for strongly. [...] The diversity of env has been shown to increase by 1-2% per year in HIV-1 group M and the variable units are notable for rapid changes in amino acid sequence length. [...] Increases in <b>gp120</b> variability result in significantly elevated levels of viral replication, indicating an increase in viral fitness in individuals infected by diverse HIV-1 variants. [...] Further studies have shown that variability in potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) also result in increased viral fitness. [...] PNGSs allow for the binding of long-chain carbohydrates to the high variability regions of <b>gp120,</b> so the authors hypothesize that the number of PNGSs in env might affect the fitness of the virus by providing more or less sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. The presence of large carbohydrate chains extending from <b>gp120</b> might obscure possible antibody binding sites.|$|E
2500|$|Envelope {{glycoprotein}} <b>GP120</b> (or <b>gp120)</b> is a glycoprotein exposed on {{the surface}} of the HIV envelope. It was discovered by Professors Tun-Hou Lee and Myron [...] "Max" [...] Essex of the Harvard School of Public Health in 1988. The 120 in its name comes from its molecular weight of 120 kDa. <b>Gp120</b> is essential for virus entry into cells as it plays a vital role in attachment to specific cell surface receptors. These receptors are DC-SIGN, Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan and a specific interaction with the CD4 receptor, particularly on helper T-cells. Binding to CD4 induces the start of a cascade of conformational changes in <b>gp120</b> and gp41 that lead to the fusion of the viral with the host cell membrane. Binding to CD4 is mainly electrostatic although there are van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{boundaries}} of the potential to add and eliminate PNGSs are naively explored by growing viral populations following each new infection. While the transmitting host has developed a neutralizing antibody response to <b>gp120,</b> the newly infected host lacks immune recognition of the virus. Sequence data shows that initial viral variants in an immunologically naïve host have few glycosylation sites and shorter exposed variable loops. This may facilitate viral ability to bind host cell receptors. As the host immune system develops antibodies against <b>gp120,</b> immune pressures seem to select for increased glycosylation, particularly on the exposed variable loops of <b>gp120.</b> [...] Consequently, insertions in env, which confer more PNGSs on <b>gp120</b> may be more tolerated by the virus as higher glycan density promotes the viral ability to evade antibodies and thus promotes higher viral fitness. [...] In considering how much PNGS density could theoretically change, {{there may be an}} upper bound to PNGS number due to its inhibition of <b>gp120</b> folding, but if the PNGS number decreases substantially, then the virus is too easily detected by neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, a stabilizing selection balance between low and high glycan densities is likely established. A lower number of bulky glycans improves viral replication efficiency and higher number on the exposed loops aids host immune evasion via disguise.|$|E
2500|$|NIH {{research}} {{published in}} Science reports {{the isolation of}} 3 antibodies that neutralize 90% of HIV-1 strains at the CD4bs region of <b>gp120,</b> potentially offering a therapeutic and vaccine strategy. [...] However, most antibodies that bind the CDbs region of <b>gp120</b> do not neutralize HIV, and rare ones that do such as IgG1-b12 have unusual properties such as asymmetry of the Fab arms or in their positioning. [...] Unless a gp120-based vaccine can be designed to elicit antibodies with strongly neutralizing antiviral properties, there is concern that breakthrough infection leading to humoral production of high levels of non-neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site of <b>gp120</b> is associated with faster disease progression to AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, a Malawi man {{joined a}} study {{within weeks of}} {{becoming}} infected. He repeatedly donated blood {{over the course of}} a [...] year, which researches used to create a timeline of changes in his virus' <b>gp120,</b> his antibody response and the ultimate emergence of a bNAb. Researchers want to direct this evolution in other subjects to achieve similar results. A screen of massive <b>gp120</b> libraries led to one that strongly bound both an original antibody and the mature bNAb that evolved from it. Giving patients a modified <b>gp120</b> that contains little more than the epitope that both antibodies target could act to [...] "prime" [...] the immune system, followed by a booster that contains trimer spikes in the most natural configuration possible. However, bNAbs have not been shown to prevent an infection.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, {{researchers}} {{identified the}} first HIV bNAb, far more powerful that any antibody seen before. They described the exact viral component, or epitope that triggered the antibody. Six amino acids {{at the tip}} of HIV's surface protein, <b>gp120,</b> were responsible. The first bNAb turned out to be clinically irrelevant, but in 1994 another team isolated a bNAb that worked on cells taken from patients.

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>gp120</b> and neutralizing antibodies {{is an example}} of Red Queen evolutionary dynamics.
