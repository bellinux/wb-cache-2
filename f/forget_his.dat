5|$|With only 30 minutes {{remaining}} {{before the}} ship is destroyed, Kirk considers transporting the entire crew to Caliban so they can survive. Scotty discovers Sulu's original transporter pattern, from when the warbird was destroyed. He theorizes that he could re-integrate it into the older version, resetting his memories {{so that he could}} remember the Romulan information and allowing him to pilot the Enterprise to safety but causing him to <b>forget</b> <b>his</b> 30 years on Caliban. Alana reassures him that she'll remind him of the man he became, but McCoy and Spock agree that leaving the rift will cause the death of Alana. Sulu draws his sword and is prepared to fight to save his daughter, but she talks him down. He strides onto the transporter pad and demands they reintegrate his pattern. As he is merged once again, Alana quotes The Tempest. The younger version of Sulu is taken to the bridge and pilots the Enterprise from the anomaly with seconds to spare, with Alana ceasing to exist as he does so. Back on the Excelsior, Captain Sulu meets with the shuttle passengers in his ready room; his daughter Demora (Mimi Chong) and is introduced to his baby granddaughter, Alana.|$|E

25|$|I {{will never}} <b>forget</b> <b>his</b> arrival {{running across the}} back of the stage, and his catlike way of holding himself {{opposite}} the ramp. He wore a white sash over an ultramarine costume, had large wild eyes and hollow cheeks under a turban topped with a spray of feathers, bulging thighs, immaculate tights. This was already Nijinsky in Firebird.|$|E

25|$|Dr W C Brownless {{became his}} {{principal}} coadjutor, and the Protestant Vindicator succeeded to the Protestant, which maintained the controversy {{for some years}} longer.

Thereafter his attention was divided between the two foes of the Republic and of a pure Christianity.|$|E

25|$|An {{experienced}} businessman, van Leeuwenhoek {{believed that}} if his simple method for creating the critically important lens was revealed, the scientific community of his time would likely disregard or even <b>forget</b> <b>his</b> role in microscopy.

He made about 200 microscopes with a different magnification.|$|E
25|$|Thor's father Odin decides his son {{needed to}} be taught humility and {{consequently}} places Thor (without memories of godhood) into the body and memories of an existing, partially disabled human medical student, Donald Blake. After becoming a doctor and on vacation in Norway, Blake witnesses the arrival of an alien scouting party. Blake flees from the aliens into a cave. After discovering Thor's hammer Mjolnir (disguised as a walking stick) and striking it against a rock, he transforms into the thunder god. Later, in Thor #159, Blake is revealed to have always been Thor, Odin's enchantment having caused him to <b>forget</b> <b>his</b> history as The Thunder God and believe himself mortal.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, Peter II soon drifted away. Having made poor {{financial}} investments, he {{lost the}} little money he had left. Unable {{to adapt to the}} daily life of a normal citizen, he gradually turned to alcoholism and trying to <b>forget</b> <b>his</b> problems with several affairs with younger women. For her part, Alexandra's love for her husband turned to obsession. Probably prone to anorexia for years, she developed a body dysmorphic disorder, which led her to undergo removal of the breasts because she was convinced that Peter II didn't like her chest. Increasingly unstable, she made her first suicide attempt during a visit to her mother in Venice during the summer of 1950.|$|E

25|$|When he {{returned}} to the US, he turned to drinking to <b>forget</b> <b>his</b> problems. His wife enlisted the help of his cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who ordered the FBI to track him down, and he was brought back to his family. In late April 1942, his brother Archibald sought to have him committed to a sanitarium for a year; at month's end, he agreed to a four-month stay at an institution in Hartford. To extricate him from his current situation, the President gave him a commission as a major in the United States Army, and had him transferred and posted to Fort Richardson, Alaska, where he worked as an intelligence officer and helped establish a territorial militia of Eskimos and Aleuts.|$|E
25|$|The Master {{later called}} Guru Dev by Maharishi {{and in the}} TM movement, {{was born into a}} Mishra Brahmin (priest caste) {{community}} in the village of Gana, near Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, India. He was called Rajaram in his younger days and was also known as Maha Yogiraj. At the age of nine Rajaram left his home unannounced to follow a spiritual path of renunciation but was soon returned to his parents by a policeman. On returning home, he asked his parents for permission to leave home and begin the life of a recluse. His parents wanted him to marry and live the life of a householder and asked their family guru to convince Rajaram to <b>forget</b> <b>his</b> dream of a reclusive life. The family guru, however, was so impressed with Rajaram's advanced state of wisdom and spiritual evolution that he gave up any attempt to change the boy's mind. The parents then also acquiesced and gave their permission for Rajaram to leave. Two days later Rajaram formally renounced his family life and left his boyhood home in search of solitude in the Himalayas. Rajaram traveled by foot to the town of Haridwar and then on to Rishikesh, the gateway to the Himalayas. Here he began the search for a suitable guru or spiritual master. Rajaram met many wise sages, but none of them met his requirements of lifelong celibacy and an intimate knowledge and experience of the Vedas.|$|E
25|$|In 1883 Dewey became {{librarian}} of Columbia College, and in {{the following}} year founded there the School of Library Economy, the first institution for the instruction of librarians ever organized. The proposal to establish the school was approved by the college's Board of Trustees on 5 May 1884. After a period of preparation, the school was officially opened on 5 January 1887, with an enrollment of 20 students—three men and 17 women. Women were admitted to the program at Dewey's insistence and against the wishes of the college's Regents. Although the school had a promising start, Dewey's conflicts with the university officials, in particular over the issue of the presence of women, led to its future being cast in doubt, and by 1888 it was apparent that Columbia intended to close it. However, at that point, Dewey, upon accepting a position with the New York State Library in Albany, successfully secured the agreement of its Regents to have the school transferred there. The formal transfer was accomplished in 1889, and the school, which was ultimately very successful, was re-established in Albany as the New York State Library School under Dewey's direction. (The school returned to Columbia's Manhattan campus in 1926.) Dewey did not <b>forget</b> <b>his</b> Columbia students. He petitioned the University of the State of New York, which granted degrees to those students who agreed to submit to examinations and produce a bibliography and thesis. Two students participated, including future ALA registrar and college archivist Nina Browne.|$|E
