Phillipsburg served as the western terminus of the Morris Canal for approximately 100 years from the 1820s to 1920s, which connected the city by water to the industrial and consumer centers of the New York City area, with connections westward via the Lehigh Canal and Delaware Canal across the Delaware.

500|$|All Hope Is <b>Gone</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fourth studio album by American metal band Slipknot. Released on August 20, 2008 by Roadrunner Records, {{the album}} was {{published}} in two versions: the standard album in a CD case and a special edition packaged in a six-fold digipak containing three bonus tracks, a 40page booklet, and a bonus DVD with a documentary of the album's recording. Preparation for the album began in 2007, while recording started in February 2008 in the band's home state of Iowa. Before the album's launch, Slipknot released a series of promotional images and audio samples from the album through various websites. All Hope Is Gone is considered the band's most eclectic-sounding album, incorporating elements from their previous three. The album shows Slipknot completely abandoning the nu metal genre, moving to a groove metal style. Songs such as the opening track [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] and the title track espouse the band's more brutal, death metal-influenced edge, reminiscent of songs such as [...] "(sic)" [...] from their debut self-titled album; slow burning, [...] "trippy" [...] elements such as [...] "Gehenna", reminiscent of [...] "Skin Ticket" [...] from their second album Iowa; and more tragic, sentimental tracks such as [...] "Dead Memories" [...] and [...] "Snuff".|$|E

500|$|Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly said that, unlike Black's {{previous}} song, [...] "My Moment" [...] {{was not so}} bad it's good, and Michelle Woo of OC Weekly described [...] "My Moment" [...] as [...] "a {{lot less}} terrible" [...] than [...] "Friday", making it [...] "less awesome". Many compared the production to that of [...] "Friday". Mike Hale of The New York Times criticized Black's vocals for being [...] "as heavily processed" [...] as they were previously, but said that the tuning had [...] "been done much more artfully", meaning Black sounded [...] "more like a human being." [...] A reviewer for The Huffington Post said, [...] "if you were hoping for [...] "Friday" [...] part two, this certainly isn't it. <b>Gone</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> weird nasal, overly auto-tuned voice that made 'Friday' sound like she was saying 'fried egg.'" [...] Black herself was called [...] "sweet but very self empowered" [...] by Stransky, and Adrian Chen of Gawker called the track [...] "a 'look-at-me-now' love letter" [...] to all [...] haters". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard saw the song in a similar light; for him, Black [...] "does offer a bit of vitriol to those who wrote her off as a one-hit Internet wonder." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparation for All Hope Is Gone {{began in}} 2007. Drummer Joey Jordison explained, [...] "I've {{told them to}} demo {{whatever}} they can so we've got as much material to choose from as possible." [...] In February 2008, Slipknot entered the Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa with producer Dave Fortman. All Hope Is <b>Gone</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> band's first album written and recorded in their home state of Iowa. Bassist Paul Gray explained that the band decided to record in Iowa because {{there were too many}} distractions in Los Angeles, where production of their previous albums had taken place. The band also stated that being close to home was good for their mindset; vocalist Corey Taylor drove home every night to see his son. Unlike Slipknot's previous releases, the album's writing process involved all nine band members, who wrote over 30songs. Jordison commented, [...] "I {{have to say that the}} band is at its peak; everyone—I mean everyone—is now completely involved in the writing process, and it's a beautiful thing." [...] Taylor felt the writing process had some problems, but also noted that the creation of every Slipknot album has had conflict and that the band has come to embrace it after realizing that the conflict helps to bring out their creativity. Taylor and guitarist Jim Root paired up with Sid Wilson, performing on keyboards, and percussionist Shawn Crahan to work on [...] "oblique, arty pieces". Taylor also experimented with tracking in an old well, stating, [...] "There was this natural reverb to it that was just intense." [...] According to Crahan none of the experimental tracks made it onto the album. However, one of them, [...] "Til We Die", appears as a bonus track on the album's special edition along with [...] "Child Of Burning Time" [...] and the similarly experimental Bloodstone Mix of [...] "Vermillion Pt. 2". The track [...] "Sulfur" [...] was the first combined effort of Jordison and Root, who wrote the song in one evening.|$|E

2500|$|As Vice President, Gore {{promoted}} {{the development of}} what he {{referred to as the}} Information Superhighway. This was discussed in detail a few days after winning the election in November 1992 in The New York Times article [...] "Clinton to Promote High Technology, With Gore in Charge." [...] They planned to finance research [...] "that will flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry." [...] Specifically, they were aiming to fund the development of [...] "robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications, and national computer networks. Also earmarked are a raft of basic technologies like digital imaging and data storage." [...] These initiatives were met with some skepticism from critics who claimed that [...] "the initiative is likely to backfire, bloating Congressional pork, and creating whole new categories of Federal waste." [...] These initiatives were outlined in the report Technology for America's Economic Growth. In September 1993, they released a report calling {{for the creation of a}} [...] "nationwide information superhighway," [...] which would primarily be built by private industry. Gary Stix commented on these initiatives a few months prior in his May 1993 article for Scientific American, [...] "Gigabit Gestalt: Clinton and Gore embrace an activist technology policy." [...] Stix described them as a [...] "distinct statement about where the new administration stands on the matter of technology [...] <b>Gone</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ambivalence or outright hostility toward government involvement in little beyond basic science.
