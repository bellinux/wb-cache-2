5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable whimsical elements. A downspout {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so {{it is unclear what}} interest <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E

5|$|On 23 April, a heavy storm {{swept the}} Eastern Atlantic, {{striking}} Warren's squadron and their prizes. Marengo was seriously damaged, losing all three masts and {{taking on a}} large quantity of water {{that had to be}} pumped overboard by the understrength crew working in shifts. Five men were drowned. Ramilles also suffered in the high winds, losing almost all her masts and rolling for some hours, completely out of control. It was only when the storm had abated that jury masts could be raised and the scattered ships could rejoin the squadron for its journey back to Britain, arriving at Spithead. Willaumez eventually returned to the North Atlantic in the early summer, passing through the Caribbean before being dispersed in a hurricane, his ships scattered across the Western Atlantic. Most eventually reached France, but the campaign had been another disaster for the French Navy, with {{less than half of the}} ships sent out returning to Brest. The loss of Marengo and Belle Poule formed a footnote to the campaign, but the defeat of Linois was widely celebrated in Britain, where both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy under their French names. Linois was praised for his defence of his ship in the face of overwhelming British force, and historian William James, writing in 1827, considered that had Linois faced London alone <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the advantage. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from London and Amazon still living in 1847.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 and 1969, Joe Simon was {{involved}} in litigation with Marvel Comics over the ownership of Captain America, initiated by Marvel after Simon registered the copyright renewal for Captain America in his own name.

25|$|Mengu-Timur was {{succeeded in}} 1281 {{by his brother}} Töde Möngke, who was a Muslim. He made peace with Kublai, {{returned}} his sons to him, and acknowledged his supremacy. Nogai and Köchü, Khan of the White Horde and son of Orda Khan, also made peace with the Yuan dynasty and the Ilkhanate. According to Mamluk historians, Töde Möngke sent the Mamluks a letter proposing to fight against their common enemy, the unbelieving Ilkhanate. This indicates that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an interest in Azerbaijan and Georgia, which were both ruled by the Ilkhans.|$|E

25|$|Domestically in Zimbabwe, he {{did well}} in the Logan Cup, captaining the Midlands team and scoring two centuries to average 55. However, this was down the order, as he decided his {{technique}} was not tight {{enough for him to}} open the innings. Despite his domestic success, he failed to keep his place against Bangladesh, and decided to take up a club appointment in England rather than stay at home and hope for selection against India and West Indies. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a match or two, in fact, as Zimbabwe suffered from injuries, and had he been available he might have played in the final Test against the West Indies instead of Hamilton Masakadza, who hit a century on debut.|$|E
25|$|After the {{attempted}} Dutch invasion, the Portuguese authorities in Goa realized {{the importance of}} having a permanent paramount figure of authority in Macau, and began sending a proper governor to Macau in 1623. Before, this small town was administered by the Captain-Major of the Japan Voyage, a position that was auctioned off in the Lisbon court to the highest bidder annually and not expected to govern Macau after he had left for Japan. With the new arrangement, the Captain-Major's authority was limited to the merchant fleet to Japan, and lost all privileges <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> in Macau to the Governor of Macau. The first governor Francisco Mascarenhas, under orders from Goa, enhanced the fortifications to defend from a repetition of the Dutch attack, having bribed the Guangdong provincial authorities to {{turn a blind eye to}} the constructions.|$|E
25|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that Paulo Portas personally embezzled any funds from the submarines' purchase, and, since Portugal's 10-year statute of limitations for white collar crimes expired in 2014, he (or anyone else) can no longer be prosecuted even if incriminating evidence were to emerge some day. Still, the suspicions against Paulo Portas are unlikely to ever go away given the established facts that (i) he was the Minister in-charge at the time, which makes him the main figure in a controversial deal that, even if not tainted by his corruption, was disastrous for Portugal's finances; (ii) in contrast with his usual incisiveness on all other affairs of state, Paulo Portas has consistently been evasive about his role and any details of the submarines purchase; (iii) his CDS-PP party was shown to have been in close contact with one of the submarines' intermediaries (ESCOM) and to have received sizeable donations from fabricated sources shortly after (see Portucale case above); and (iv) Portas himself is on record saying he could not talk about the submarines deal on a cell phone for fear of being wiretapped, which suggests <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> something to hide.|$|E

Michael Quinn for BBC Music was complimentary of The Pussycat Dolls cover, writing that their version managed to be [...] "sultry and raucous" [...] at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Báthory's health {{had been}} declining for several years. He died on 12 December 1586.

None of these rumours {{have been confirmed}} by modern historians. His death was followed by an interregnum of one year.

[...] Allmusic editor Bill Janovitz writes of the song's affecting narrative, stating [...] "The genius, the pathos, and the soul that is Charles oozes into this recording [...] No {{matter how many times}} one hears the song, it still induces chills down the spine after the narrator blows any chance <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> and is left alone at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Everton manager David Moyes and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard {{analysed}} {{the match}} on Sky Sports, and both agreed Ferdinand {{was fortunate to}} remain on the pitch. Although Moyes believed there was minimal contact between Rooney and Campbell in the lead-up to United's penalty award, he sympathised with the referee's decision as Campbell stuck his leg out. He added: [...] "If the referee hadn't given the penalty <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to book Wayne. He chose to give the penalty." [...] Alan Hansen suggested Arsenal's defeat was a great result for their rivals, but felt they were strong favourites to win the league. He praised Ferguson for getting his tactics right, and lauded the performances of defenders Ferdinand and Campbell. On Match of the Day 2, Hansen was critical of Van Nistelrooy's tackle on Cole, calling it [...] "nasty and cynical." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{optimism}} was short-lived. In {{the course}} of the summer of 1942, Quisling lost any ability <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to sway public opinion by attempting to force children into the Nasjonal Samlings Ungdomsfylking youth organisation, which was modelled on the Hitler Youth. This move prompted a mass resignation of teachers from their professional body and churchmen from their posts, along with large-scale civil unrest. His attempted indictment of Bishop Eivind Berggrav proved similarly controversial, even amongst his German allies. Quisling now toughened his stance, telling Norwegians that they would have the new regime forced upon them [...] "whether they like it or not." [...] On 1 May, the German High Command noted that [...] "organised resistance to Quisling has started" [...] and Norway's peace talks with Germany stalled as a result. On 11 August, Hitler postponed any further peace negotiations until the war ended. Quisling was admonished and learned that Norway would not get the independence he so greatly yearned for. As an added insult, {{for the first time he}} was forbidden to write letters directly to Hitler.|$|E

500|$|Nixon {{then called}} for Stevenson {{to give a}} full {{accounting}} of his own fund, and a full list of the donors. He also called for Senator Sparkman, who, as Nixon repeated, had put his wife on the payroll, to state fully any outside income <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> [...] "Because, folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a man that's to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that's why I suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing." [...] As the senator made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, slammed his pencil down, realizing {{that he would not}} be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny. Eisenhower had benefited from a favorable Act of Congress, allowing the income from his bestselling memoirs to be considered capital gains.|$|E
500|$|When Liszt {{started writing}} symphonic poems, [...] "he {{had very little}} {{experience}} in handling an orchestra ... {{his knowledge of the}} technique of instrumentation was defective and he had as yet composed hardly anything for the orchestra." [...] For these reasons he relied first on his assistants August Conradi and Joachim Raff to fill the gaps in his knowledge and find his [...] "orchestral voice". Raff, [...] "a gifted composer with an imaginative grasp of the orchestra", offered close assistance to Liszt. Also helpful were the virtuosi present at that time in the Weimarian Court orchestra, such as trombonist Moritz Nabich, harpist Jeanne Pohl, concertmaster Joseph Joachim and violinist Edmund Singer. [...] " [...] mixed daily with these musicians, and their discussions must have been filled with 'shop talk.'" [...] Both Singer and cellist Bernhard Cossmann were widely experienced orchestral players who probably knew the different instrumental effects a string section could produceknowledge that Liszt would have found invaluable, and about which <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> many discussions with the two men. With such a range of talent from which to learn, Liszt may have actually mastered orchestration reasonably quickly. By 1853, he felt he no longer needed Raff's assistance and their professional association ended in 1856. Also, in 1854 Liszt received a specially designed instrument called a [...] "piano-organ" [...] from the firm of Alexandre and fils in Paris. This huge instrument, a combination of piano and organ, was basically a one-piece orchestra that contained three keyboards, eight registers, a pedal board and a set of pipes that reproduced the sounds of all the wind instruments. With it, Liszt could try out various instrumental combinations at his leisure as a further aid for his orchestration.|$|E
2500|$|This ontological {{argument}} {{originated in}} the work of St. Anselm, the medieval Scholastic philosopher and theologian.
