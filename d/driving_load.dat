40|$|Battery powered {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) {{have emerged as}} a promising solution for reducing the consumption of fossil fu-els in modern transportation systems. Unfortunately the bat-tery pack has a low energy storage capacity, which causes the driving range of the EV to become very limited. It is there-fore essential to properly characterize the different driving situations of the vehicle {{in order to better}} predict the <b>driving</b> <b>load</b> along the road ahead and to better estimate the remain-ing driving range (RDR). However, this prediction cannot be achieved straightforward due to sources of uncertainty intro-duced by the randomness of the driving environment. In this paper a novel approach for characterizing driving situations and for predicting the <b>driving</b> <b>load</b> of an EV is presented. The prediction of the <b>driving</b> <b>load</b> occurs in a model-based fash-ion, where the model input variables are modeled as discrete-time Markov processes. An approach for estimating the tran-sition probabilities between Markov states in the presence of sparse driving data is introduced. Furthermore, to capture the changes in the driving environment a Bayes-based methodol-ogy for recursively updating the established transition proba-bilities is presented.

40|$|Although {{there are}} {{different}} HEV configurations, they are all based on same kinds of components. After introducing the main components HEVs use, we build up a model which can illustrate the basic idea of HEVs. The analysis of the model helps us to reveal the essential problem of HEV power control. The performance of a HEV depends {{not only on the}} individual components but also on how the components are coordinated. The power control system must determine operating points for the components during driving to save energy. The proposed power control approach is based on model predictive control and trying to solve the nature problem of HEV power control by an optimization concept, which makes the approach applicable for all kinds of HEVs. A number of different simulations have been executed to prove the feasibility of the approach. By changing some operational weights, the power control system can achieve different performances. Another key concept adopted in the power control system is {{based on the premise that}} future <b>driving</b> <b>load</b> would affect fuel consumption, as well as the operating modes of the vehicle and the driver behavior do. The proposed power control approach incorporates a <b>driving</b> <b>load</b> forecasting algorithm whose role is to assess the driving environment, the driving style of the driver, and the trend of the vehicle using long and short term statistical features of the past drive cycle. This future <b>driving</b> <b>load</b> information is subsequently used to change the operational weights of the power control approach, such as engine efficiency, battery State of Charge (SOC), engine speed, etc. By this way, the power control approach leads to improved the vehicle's overall performance. One of the major crises that the world is facing today is the problems of energy. With the beneficial effect on the environment and high energy transformation efficiency in hybrid electric vehicle technology, automobile manufacturers have begun to look more seriously into vehicles with alternative power sources. Aimed at solving the more and more serious problems of energy, HEV has been one of the best practical applications for transportation with high fuel economy. This dissertation proposes a new power control approach for all kinds of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). To obtain better performance, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find optimal weights for different drive loads. Then, by integrating MPC controller and load forecasting algorithm, a realtime HEV power control system, model predictive power control with load forecasting system (MPC-LF), is developed. Experimental results prove the feasibility of the control system. Wang, Zhancheng. Adviser: Xu Yangsheng. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 70 - 06, Section: B, page: 3631.

40|$|This paper explores sizing and {{topology}} reconfiguration {{strategies for}} charging and discharging multiple supercapacitors as energy storage in subwatt-scale energy harvesters. To maximize energy efficiency for storage (hEstorage), total leakage power is kept low by selecting the supercapacitors to charge sequentially, alternatingly, or in series {{based on their}} voltages. To maximize energy efficiency for <b>driving</b> <b>load</b> (hEdriving), residual energy is minimized by switching to series composition of the supercapacitors {{in order to raise}} the voltage above the minimum input voltage of the load-side dc-dc converter. Due to the nonlinear, stateful, load-dependent behavior of such harvesters, parameter sweeping is used for system-level optimization. A topology-reconfigurable structure consisting of two larger, symmetric “reservoir ” supercapacitors and one voltage-raising “bootcap ” prove to be efficient and practical for considering combinations of symmetric and asymmetric capacitance values. Experimental results on an actual implementation show that for charging, series topology is best when input power is high due to lower leakage, individual topology is best when input power is low due to lower voltage; for discharging, series topology is effective in reducing residual energy while individual topology with alternating discharging effectively minimizes leakage.

However, lateral undulation, also known as serpentine locomotion, is ill-suited for narrow spaces, as the body of the snake must assume a certain amount of curvature to propel forward.

40|$|Abstract: The Earth {{today is}} facing a major problem of energy crisis and use of new {{reliable}} renewable energy sources is the need of the hour. Micro-organisms use soil and other organic materials in the soil to produce free ions by their metabolic activity which are left uncollected. These free ions are collected using metal electrodes with soil acting as an electrolyte or medium of transfer of ions. Each electrode produces a certain potential voltage and few tens of mill amperes of current. Thus a pair {{of positive and negative}} electrodes inserted in soil kept in an insulating container is a ‘soil cell’. The voltage can be increased by connecting multiple electrodes in series and current by connecting soil cells in parallel. Series and parallel combination of soil cells becomes a ‘soil battery’. The energy from the soil can be used as an uninterruptable power source to light a small cabinet along with a solar panel. The energy from Soil Battery can be used for lighting purpose when the solar panel is not functional or when its efficiency is low. The maximum power point tracking controller ensures optimum power output from both the soil battery and the solar panel, whatever be the battery voltage or the <b>driving</b> <b>load.</b> Thus a small grid comprising of soil battery, solar panel and a secondary battery can be used as an uninterruptable power supply with the optimum source in terms of power driving the load...|$|E

The design of ACC controller often involves {{the design of a}} switching logic that decides where and when to switch between the two modes in order to ameliorate driving comfort, mitigate the chance of a potential collision with the preceding vehicle while reduce long-distance <b>driving</b> <b>load</b> from the driver. ^ In this thesis, a new strategy for designing ACC controller is proposed. The proposed control strategy utilizes Range vs. Range-rate chart to illustrate the relationship between headway distance and velocity difference, and then find out a constant deceleration trajectory on the chart, which the following vehicle is controlled to follow. This control strategy has a shorter elapsed time than existing ones while still maintaining a relatively safe distance during transient process. String stability issue has been addressed by many researchers after the adaptive cruise control (ACC) concept was developed. The main problem is when many vehicles with ACC controller forming a vehicle platoon end to end, how the control algorithm is designed to ensure that the spacing error, which is the deviation of the actual range from the desired headway distance, would not amplify as the number of following vehicles increases downstream along the platoon. In this thesis, string stability issues have been taken into consideration and constraints of parameters of an ACC controller are derived to mitigate steady state error propagation. ...|$|E
