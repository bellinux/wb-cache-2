25|$|The {{reason for}} having Tajikistan <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} {{because the government}} of the country itself, is - or is seen to be - the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In actual fact, the government - with the apparent approval of the people - is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they perceive as problems in other surrounding countries.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{scientific}} {{studies have found}} lateralization of emotions. FMRI and lesion studies have shown asymmetrical activation of brain regions while thinking of emotions, responding to extreme emotional stimuli, and viewing emotional situations. Processing and production of facial expressions also appear to be asymmetric in nature. Many theories of lateralization have been proposed {{and some of those}} specific to emotions. Please keep in mind that most of the information <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> theoretical and scientists are still trying to understand emotion and emotional lateralization. Also, some of the evidence is contradictory. Many brain regions are interconnected and the input and output of any given region may come from and go to many different regions.|$|E

"Advances {{over the}} past three decades in our {{understanding}} of nervous systems are impressive and come from a multifaceted approach to the study of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. An almost unexpected by-product of the parallel investigation of vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems that is explored <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> the emergent view of an intricate web of evolutionary homology and convergence exhibited in the structure and function of the nervous systems of these two large, paraphyletic groups of animals." ...|$|E

500|$|The popular {{periodic}} table layout, {{also known as}} the common or standard form (as shown at various other points <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article),</b> <b>is</b> attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short (...) and medium (...) form {{periodic table}}s. Merck and Company prepared a handout form of Deming's 18-column medium table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools. By the 1930s Deming's table was appearing in handbooks and encyclopaedias of chemistry. It was also distributed for many years by the Sargent-Welch Scientific Company.|$|E
500|$|While {{the meaning}} of {{mechanical}} filter <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> one that is used in an electromechanical role, {{it is possible to}} use a mechanical design to filter mechanical vibrations or sound waves (which are also essentially mechanical) directly. For example, filtering of audio frequency response in the design of loudspeaker cabinets can be achieved with mechanical components. [...] In the electrical application, in addition to mechanical components which correspond to their electrical counterparts, transducers are needed to convert between the mechanical and electrical domains. [...] A representative selection of the wide variety of component forms and topologies for mechanical filters are presented in this article.|$|E
500|$|Protection {{with respect}} to {{conviction}} for offences is guaranteed in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. According to Article 20, no one can be awarded punishment which is more than what {{the law of the land}} prescribes at that time. This legal axiom is based on the principle that no criminal law can be made retrospective, that is, for an act to become an offence, the essential condition is that it should have been an offence legally at the time of committing it. Moreover, no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. [...] "Compulsion" [...] in this article refers to what in law is called [...] "Duress" [...] (injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment to make a person do something that he does not want to do). This article is known as a safeguard against self incrimination. The other principle enshrined <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>is</b> known as the principle of double jeopardy, that is, no person can be convicted twice for the same offence, which has been derived from Anglo Saxon law. This principle was first established in the Magna Carta.|$|E
