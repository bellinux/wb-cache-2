40|$|Tourism and the {{environment}} are two interdependent entities, for tourism to thrive {{the environment}} needs to be sustained, conversely for the environment to be sustained tourism needs to attain to the goals of responsible tourism. Second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> {{research has shown that}} scenic natural environments influence the location and development of second homes, however, little {{attention has been paid to}} the potential impact degraded environments can have on second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> and more specifically their owners. Second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> studies have also found that there are environmental concerns which arise through the development and continued use of a second home. The majority of these studies, however, have been conducted in the Global North, and no research of this kind has yet been conducted in South Africa. This study aims to fill these gaps in the South African understanding of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> by looking at the relationship that exists between the environment and second homes using Hartbeespoort in the North West Province of South Africa as the case study. The impacts associated with the degraded environment of Hartbeespoort on second homes include the decline in property values of second homes, their recreational place utility and consequently the place attachment value of the owners. Potential knock-on effects include the undermining of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism,</b> which directly affects the local economy of Hartbeespoort. Knowing the implications of a degraded environment for second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> may incite more responsible behaviour by tourists themselves in addition to an improved tourism policy by government and the acknowledgement of the importance of the natural environment across municipal and provincial boundaries. In terms of the environmental impacts of second homes, special attention was paid to the perceptions held by second home owners. The perception held by the majority of Hartbeespoort second home owner respondents is that neither they, nor their households, impact upon the environment. This perception brings the environmental sustainability of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> in South Africa into question. However, the case is not so, as second homes in Hartbeespoort do impact upon the environment, through their initial development and continued use. These impacts need to be acknowledged in order for successful mitigation strategies to be put in place. Understanding these impacts, therefore, is essential for policy, planning and mitigation in order to attain to the goal of responsible tourism so sought after by the South African government...|$|E

The second circuit shows the experiences of the Global South where working class residents migrate between first and second homes through circular migration as a consequence of labour migration...|$|R

Maintaining urban and rural settlements throughout the country has been an important aim of Norwegian regional politics. This paper assesses the impact of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> on local economic development in rural municipalities in Norway. The study is based on data collected as part of an ongoing research project initiated in 2002. Having developed and tested a model consisting of socioeconomic factors and factors associated with the second home as such, the authors examine how and to what extent these factors explain the impact of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> on local economic growth. They find that the size and standard of the recreational home are important factors in explaining variations in annual consumption by second home owners, and more so in rural communities with a broad and well-structured trading activity than in areas with a weaker trading structure. It appears that urban recreational tourism based on second homes of high standard offers the best potential for sustainable local rural economic growth. Based on their findings, the authors also discuss possible local government strategies to achieve economic growth through second <b>home</b> <b>tourism...</b>|$|E

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -Introduction Quality {{of life as}} {{a multidimensional}} concept and important aspect of living in human communities has been penetrated in many scientific fields including tourism. The relationship between tourism and local communities’ quality of life is generally considered and the subject is classified in relation to economic, social - cultural and environmental aspects. areas is considered as one of the patterns of tourism whose growth and development could have profound changes in many objective Tourism as a major area of activity can improve quality of life for local residents. The pattern of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> in rural and subjective parameters and characteristics of macro-economic, social, cultural and environmental aspects of destination communities. Quality of life in rural areas not only is affected by the factors, activities and events that exist in rural areas but also by external factors that affect the village and its inhabitants. The analysis of this type of tourism was necessary and important in the process of planning of rural development and rural tourism development. Thus, the main goal of the study is to investigate second home tourism’s effects on improving life quality of local residents in rural areas of Rudbar Qasran (Shemiranat County of Tehran province). Second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> has historically been promoted in the area since 1981, is suffused with life and consequently has {{had a profound impact on}} the lives of local residents. Therefore, recognizing the effects of this model of tourism on the rural residents’ quality of life can provide the appropriate tourism development and promotion of quality of life for residents of the area. 2 - Theoretical basesThe formation and development of second homes caused from the development of tourism, is one of the important phenomena of the twentieth century and current century. A large part of second homes are built in rural areas. Second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> is emerged as an activity of the complex relationships between stakeholders in different locations due to various other activities. Therefore, its activities create the desired, undesired or complex effects on environmental, economic and social - cultural aspects of the host communities. When an area becomes a tourist destination second home, it affects lives of local residents. Local residents’ quality of life is improved by the development of second homes; hence, they are more likely to develop the activity. Thus, second homes tourism creates the change of economic, social, and environmental characteristics that can lead to an improvement in the quality of life. Quality of life is a concept that defines human life. This is a reflection of several factors and features that is usually synonymous with prosperity, opportunity, life satisfaction and prosperity, meeting demands, life power, capacity building, poverty, human poverty, living standards and development. When quality of life was introduced, its measurement was considered and a number of research and studies were performed in this field. Measuring indicators of quality of life (at any level) can be mainly classified in two categories: objective indicators and subjective indicators. Thus, to measure the quality of life, different areas have been provided by researchers. But the review, understanding and combining these areas, with emphasis on the researcher's goal, is important. Thus the role of second homes tourism in the quality of life is clarified through environmental, economic and social data that can be calculated by the host community and based on objective and subjective approaches. Here, in this article the objective approach has been applied. 3 - DiscussionSecond <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> areas would improve environmental quality, housing, health and welfare, participation and solidarity, work and employment, income and wealth has been exemplary in all villages. The results of this attempt show that second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> has influences in rural areas of Rudbar Qasran local residents’ quality of life. So, in seven realms of nine studied realms including environmental quality, activity and employment, housing, health and welfare, income and wealth, participation and solidarity and the individual security and welfare have improved the local residents’ quality of life but in two realms of education-culture and recreation-leisure, there was no improvement. 4 - ConclusionSecond <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> is one of the effective phenomena in rural areas that made an improvement or a decline in the quality of life of rural residents. The results show that second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> has played an effective role in the quality of life of local residents in the rural areas. In seven of the nine territorial scope of the study, including the quality of the environment, activities and employment, housing, health and welfare, income and wealth, participation and solidarity, and security and personal well-being, there was an improvement in the quality of life of local residents but in the realm of education, culture, recreation and leisure there was no improvement. The results also show that the impact of tourism on the quality of life of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> realm, there is a significant difference among the villages in all realms, except in the housing. 5 - SuggestionsThe following suggestions are offered as the effective role of second homes tourism in quality of life of local residents:- Managing growth and expansion of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> and preventing its unplanned promotion;- Coordinating local agencies and executive agencies in the development of second homes tourism;- Participation of people and local communities in the development of second homes tourism;- Management of the tourism impacts; and- Monitoring the tourism impacts.

40|$|When {{analyzing}} {{the globalization of}} rural spaces, second <b>home</b> <b>tourism,</b> lifestyle migration, and tourism in general commonly merge. However, {{there is evidence that}} their social, economic, and environmental impacts are markedly distinct. Based on a case study conducted in Tafí del Valle, a village in the North West Argentine Andes, this study asserts the need for interdisciplinary approaches to the study of contemporary modes of tourism, second <b>home</b> <b>tourism,</b> and lifestyle migration. With the aim to contribute to the literature concerning the globalization of the countryside and the new mobilities paradigm, this study focuses on three aspects of the current dynamics in Tafí del Valle: changes in land use related to leisure purposes, the relationship between leisure-induced mobilities, {{and the way in which}} actors conduct policies and respond to these dynamics. We gathered empirical data using ethnographic approaches such as semistructured interviews and participant observation during various field stays between 2009 and 2013. This approach emphasizes “the voice of the subjects” in order to show how different actors engage, live, and respond to the globalization of leisure. Findings show that in some cases a sense of migrism (migration + tourism) has replaced the exigence of a deeper analysis of the relation between leisure-oriented types of mobility. Our fieldwork indicates that there is a strong need for academic investigation and for government institutions to consider an analytical step that differentiates between the different types of mobilities that characterize the globalization of leisure destinations in rural areas...|$|E

Tourism has become a way to survive when the traditional production system has changed and an another way of earn one's living is needed. When discussing tourism and the way it can develop a region, the impacts of second homes are important to take into consideration. This study concentrates on second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> in the area around Ljungdalen (Ljungdalen, Skärkdalen and Storsjö kapell) in the Swedish mountain range. The aim is to analyse the importance of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> and the influence that second homes have on the local economy and environment in Ljungdalen. This study is mainly based on questionnaire that has been sent to 275 randomly selected second home owners in the area around Ljungdalen. The outcome of the questionnaire shows {{that the majority of the}} second home owners are retired and have owned their houses for a long time. The standard of the houses is varying, but most of the housing conditions are adequate. The respondents visit their second homes mainly during the summer, spring and autumn period and the most popular activities are hiking, skiing and recreation. The second home owners contribute to the local economy by making most of their purchases of local goods and services in the area during the visit in Ljungdalen. Impact on the environment is mostly caused by the second home owners activities (e. g. littering) and by the houses standards (e. g. sewerage). The opinions about how the environment has changed during the 1990 s are both positive and negative. The same goes for thoughts about an possible expand of the second homes in the area. Nearly all of the respondents consider that a further tourism development is necessary for the areas survival, but that a development also can lead to an environmental deterioration.

Travel Writing and Tourism in Britain and Ireland brings together leading international historians and travel writing experts in a series of timely essays that examine this phenomenon. Chronologically arranged, the contributions chart the formation of British and Irish tourism with reference to a broad range of writings, including diaries, guidebooks, works in translation, and fictional accounts, as well as more traditional travel narratives. Evaluating the perspectives of travellers from the British Isles, as well as visitors from America and Continental Europe, the collection emphasizes the role of peripheries, borders, and regionalism in the construction of gender, class, and national identity. With its broad regional and historical coverage, this book should appeal to students and scholars of travel writing and tourism across the humanities and social sciences. ...|$|E

In fact, leisure is understood as a sample of practices and activities with underlying social and cultural factors. These practices are allocated in time and space, having an impact on space. The study is devoted to the use of leisure, its position and importance in the general time framework of a day. There is also a discussion of the trends and shifts in society associated with broader cultural and institutional processes (transformation of the labour market, globalisation, individualisation, differentiation, post-communist transformation, and the gender question). In addition, the study empirically examines the importance and potential of leisure activities for the formation of place attachment and associated processes of the creation of social capital, contact networks and knowledge transfer. Through these effects, leisure can contribute to the endogenous development of distinct types of area. In fact, attention is focused on two ways of leisure time activities with a considerable local tie and potential for the creation of social capital.

40|$|Malaysia My Second Home’ is an {{international}} retirement migration (IRM) programme aimed at attracting the lucrative retiree market to choose Malaysia as their residence. Despite the widely researched IRM studies in the Western context, limited knowledge {{is available on the}} participants’ motivation, satisfaction, and post-satisfaction intentions (i. e. exit, voice, loyalty, neglect). Relationships among variables have also not been empirically established. Using the Interdependence theory as theoretical underpinning, the study combines the push-pull motivation theory, perceived performance theory, transnationalism, and exit, voice, loyalty and neglect theory. The conceptualised model - Second Home Retirement (SHR) – is developed through a two-phase sequential mixed-method: qualitative through individual in-depth interviews and quantitative with questionnaire data collection. Four stages of new scale development as proposed by Ashill and Jobber (2010), Churchill (1979), DeVellis (2003), Hinkin (1995), Malhotra (2007) and Nunnally and Bernstein (1994) were performed. The research findings provide theoretical contribution which simultaneously extend the IRM and second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> knowledge, and propose the application of the SHR model in extending the interpretation of the existing retirement migration framework introduced by Haas and Serow (1993). The scale development for several constructs concurrently (i. e. push and pull motivations, transnational behaviours), and the use of data triangulation are the key methodological contributions of the study. Several analytical techniques adopted, including descriptive analysis, reliability test, EFA, CFA and SEM. The qualitative findings reveal several new indicators for both push and pull motivations, which then went through a stringent new scale development process. The second stage of quantitative approach uncovers two most important push motivation dimensions which influence the retirees’ overall satisfaction: ‘Unfavourable political and security’ and `Escapism’. The most important pull motivation dimensions are ‘amenities and facilities’, ‘socialisation’, and ‘people and communication’. Both push and pull motivations positively influence the retirees’ overall satisfaction. However, the destination attributes are vulnerable with the inclusion of transnational activities, performed by the international retirees in Malaysia. When the retirees are satisfied, {{they are likely to be}} loyal to the retirement destination, and unlikely to provide much feedback to the practitioners. On the contrary, when they are dissatisfied, they are likely to leave the retirement destination, by exiting the retirement program or simply act ignorantly and spend less time in the retirement destination. Second home retirement destination managers may utilise the attributes of motivations, retirees transnational behaviours, and their challenges experienced to better understand the retirees’ needs and requirements. In all, the agility of second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> policy makers and destination marketers to manage the conditions of the surrounding environment and to satisfy the retirees’ requirements is essential to ensure the attractiveness and success of its second home retirement programme...|$|E
40|$|Tourism and {{demographic}} changes are linked as important regional determinants {{in relation to}} urban and regional planning systems. Second <b>home</b> <b>tourism</b> in Spanish Mediterranean coastal areas has created a great real estate market demands in which local communities and authorities are both involved. Based on tourist area life cycle theory (TALC) current conditions of some tourists Mediterranean coastal areas in Spain falling to a degree of degradation or even stagnation among their practical life cycle, which demonstrated as last phases of TALC theory. Many second home projects were built within Spanish costal zones during a rapid growth and the boob construction period in Spain, started from 1970 s. This circumstance means facing {{with a variety of}} economic challenges in local and national scale, such as seasonal labor markets in coastal areas. Accordingly the aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate European demographic changes in general, and in particular its potential effect on urban and housing planning in Spanish coastal zones. Throughout investigations on European mobility statics {{and demographic}} changes, this study tries to provide a prospect on the real estate challenges caused by second <b>home</b> <b>tourism.</b> Considering two phenomena provides this issue: ‘second home tourism’ and ‘international retirement migration’. Correspondingly, the initial focus of this study is on the challenges generating by rapid growth of second home development in Spanish Mediterranean towns. Then, the both mentioned phenomena and their positive and negative impacts on real estate market are demonstrated. Considering demographic and social characteristics would be a strong factor in order to make specific strategies towards improvement of related regional plans. This study evaluates the growing number of senior tourists and retired migrants, who are creating new market demand among the residential tourism market. This elderly population in each given touristic area needs specific services and accommodation, which may create a variety of local jobs as complementary activities. It has been universally agreed that by this initiative approach in urban and housing projects, the local economic condition, especially in the field of real estate and labor market may significantly be improved; however the effect is not limited to the local economy. Documentary data collection and example study evaluation are taken as the main methodological approach to this study. As conclusive remarks of this study, some suggestions are presented in order to initiate a concentrated field of studies in area of regional planning systems responsive to such areas. This study advocates considering the influence of international retirement migration in the residential tourism market and its effective role, in which concludes with new strategies and housing policies that leading to the restoration and regeneration of Mediterranean coastal areas.
