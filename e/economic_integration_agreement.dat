40|$|In {{the context}} of an <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> <b>agreement</b> (EIA), the issuing and {{verification}} of certificates of origin are carried out in accordance with procedures which ensure compliance with the rules of origin. Each EIA has its own system of rules of origin with their corresponding procedures. The purpose of the rules is to define clearly the geographical provenance of a good which may benefit from preferential tariffs in the importing country. The main purpose of the rules of origin is to avoid the diversion of trade, so that preferential tariff treatment is applied only to those products negotiated between the parties. The rules of origin of an EIA are more important than the actual process of tariff reduction, as that process is concluded at some point in time, whereas the rules of origin remain applicable indefinitely...|$|E

Moreover, we show that previous (typically cross-section) ex post empirical evaluations of the effects of EIAs on trade have seriously over- or underestimated the effects, partly due to ignoring the (endogenous) self-selection bias of country pairs into EIAs. Accounting for this bias, we find that <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> in the Americas have had much larger impacts on trade over the period 1960 - 2000 than previously found and the ex post estimates are less fragile than those in earlier cross-section analyses.

The Asian reality is characterized by developmental asymmetries across countries {{on the one hand and}} a lack of comprehensive pan-Asian formal regional <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> on the other. The need for such regional agreements is of paramount importance given the phenomenal economic performance of Asia. Against this backdrop this paper tries to describe the nature and extent of developmental and growth asymmetries in Asia. Some conceptual aspects of growth asymmetries are summarized before undertaking an econometric exploration of growth convergence in the Asian region in comparison to some other prominent regions of the world. The paper finds some evidence of growth divergence among East Asia Summit (EAS) countries though it is statistically not significant. This divergence, combined with a strong logic for evelopingdeveloping and developed-developing inter-country cooperation in the EAS region help the paper to make some policy suggestions, especially regarding enabling the less developed countries of EAS to achieve global market access in order to assist development and growth convergence in the region...|$|R

40|$|Using a novel common econometric specification, {{we examine}} the {{measurement}} of three important effects in international trade that historically have been addressed largely separately: the (partial) effects on trade of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> <b>agreements,</b> national borders, and bilateral distance. First, recent studies focusing on precise and unbiased estimates of effects of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> (EIAs) on members' trade may be biased upward owing to inadequate control for exogenous unobservable country-pair-specific technological innovations (decreasing the costs of international relative to intranational trade); we find evidence of this bias using a properly specified gravity equation. Second, our novel methodology yields economically plausible and statistically significant estimates of the declining effect of national borders on world trade, now accounting for endogenous EIA formations and unobserved country-pair heterogeneity in initial levels. Third, we confirm recent evidence providing {{a solution to the}} distance-elasticity puzzle, but show that these estimates of the declining effect of distance on international trade are biased upward by not accounting for endogenous EIA formations and unobserved country-pair heterogeneity. We show that these results are robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses allowing for phase-ins of agreements, lagged terms-of-trade effects, reverse causality, various estimation techniques, disaggregation, inclusion of intranational trade, and accounting for firm-heterogeneity and country-selection bias...|$|R

Rules of origin for trade in services are especially important in <b>Economic</b> <b>Integration</b> <b>Agreements,</b> which are proliferating in response to the changes in global trade and production. The Southern African Development Community commenced the Protocol on Trade in Services negotiations in April 2012 with the objective of creating an integrated regional market for services.

Second, the criteria used to define substantial business operations in the Mainland-Hong Kong, China CEPA provides a basis which SADC can consider as a key determinant of origin, in order to prevent free-riders from benefiting from the trade preferences under the SADC Protocol on Trade in Services. Lastly, the effectiveness of rules of origin will depend on domestic regulation and regional monitoring, evaluation and enforcement mechanisms to support and regulate investments in the services sectors...|$|R

40|$|WTO Members {{have more}} leeway under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to elude the WTO's basic most favoured nation (MFN) {{obligation}} than in merchandise trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In particular, under the Annex on Article II Exemptions, each Member had the one-off opportunity [...] at the GATS' {{entry into force}} in 1995 or, if later, the date of WTO accession [...] to seek cover for the retention of whatever departures from MFN treatment. Such MFN exemptions are subject to relatively soft disciplines only. The relevant Annex provides that their duration should not exceed 10 years in principle, and that they be subject to negotiation in any subsequent trade round. In addition, the GATS allows for departures from MFN treatment, which {{are not subject to}} time constraints, including for <b>Economic</b> <b>Integration</b> <b>Agreements</b> and recognition measures related to standards, certificates and the like. Over 90 WTO Members (counting EC 12 as one) have listed MFN exemptions for close to 500 measures in total.

The authors submit that the non-availability of new exemptions, including for measures that had escaped Members' attention at the relevant point in time, could have added to the popularity of potential substitutes (including in the context of <b>Economic</b> <b>Integration</b> <b>Agreements),</b> promoted an excessively broad interpretation of existing exemptions and discouraged governments from rescinding those that had served their initial purpose.

40|$|The present paper aims to {{determine}} the effects of different levels of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> on the intensive and the extensive margins of trade. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the case of Latin America. It is of great importance for development policies in the region since the extensive margin can be defined as those exports that provide new market entrants, while the intensive margin is due to continued growth in sales of old exporters to the same destinations. Therefore, obtained results have important policy implications related to diversification strategies. The long-term period considered will allow us {{to determine}} whether different effects on trade margins might arise in the following two sub-periods: 1962 ~ 1989 and from 1990 onwards, i. e. before and after the spread of regional <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> and the deepening of the liberalization process in the region.

Furthermore, the coveted markets of highly central trade blocs afford them a degree of economic leverage that increases the effectiveness of non-violent conflict resolution mechanisms. Ultimately, these dynamics suggest highly central agreements will tend to engage in conflict with other central agreements due to the mutual isolation of said agreements. Relations between central and marginalized agreements, however, will be more peaceful given the latter’s dependence on access to central agreement markets. Using eigenvector centrality scores as my primary measure of agreement centrality, I test my theory using a large-N statistical analysis.
