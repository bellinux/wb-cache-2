5|$|In late June, the Aćimović {{administration}} {{issued an}} ordinance regarding {{the administration of}} the Banat which essentially made the region a separate civil administrative unit {{under the control of the}} local Volksdeutsche under the leadership of Sepp Janko. While the Banat was formally under the jurisdiction of the Aćimović administration, <b>in</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms</b> it was largely autonomous of Belgrade and under the direction of the military government through the military area command in Pančevo.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food {{steadily}} throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture. Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, {{it is important to remember}} the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the {{language}} of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E

5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. <b>In</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>practical</b> <b>term</b> any result {{obtained}} {{using an}} ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator heavily {{depends upon the}} method to determine the weighting vector. Several approaches for obtaining the associated weights have been suggested in the literature, in which none of them took into account the preference of alternatives. This paper presents a method for determining the OWA weights when the preferences of alternatives across all the criteria are considered. An example is given to illustrate this method and an application in internet search engine shows {{the use of this}} new OWA operator...|$|R

50|$|During {{the medieval}} period, ethnobotanical studies were {{commonly}} found connected with monasticism. Notable {{at this time}} was Hildegard von Bingen. However, most botanical knowledge was kept in gardens such as physic gardens attached to hospitals and religious buildings. It was thought of <b>in</b> <b>practical</b> use <b>terms</b> for culinary and medical purposes and the ethnographic element was not studied as a modern anthropologist might approach ethnobotany today.|$|R
25|$|For {{a living}} trust, the grantor may retain {{some level of}} control to the trust, such by {{appointment}} as protector under the trust instrument. Living trusts also, <b>in</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations. If a living trust fails, the property will usually be held for the grantor/settlor on resulting trusts, which in some notable cases, has had catastrophic tax consequences.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{sanitation}} {{refers to}} the absence of sanitation. <b>In</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms</b> it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually open defecation (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues. It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still lacked improved sanitation facilities as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|Research into moose {{predation}} {{suggests that}} {{their response to}} perceived threats is learned rather than instinctual. <b>In</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms</b> this means moose are more vulnerable in areas where wolf or bear populations were decimated {{in the past but}} are now rebounding. These same studies suggest, however, that moose learn quickly and adapt, fleeing an area if they hear or smell wolves, bears, or scavenger birds such as ravens.|$|E

In addition to gentleman's canes, guns have been concealed in umbrellas, parasols and walking staffs.|$|R

25|$|The {{evidence}} for monument reuse {{in the early}} Anglo-Saxon period reveals {{a number of significant}} aspects of the practice. Ancient monuments were {{one of the most important}} factors determining the placing of the dead in the early Anglo-Saxon landscape. Anglo-Saxon secondary activity on prehistoric and Roman sites was traditionally explained <b>in</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms.</b> These explanations, in the view of Howard Williams, failed to account for the numbers and types of monuments and graves (from villas to barrows) reused.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>practical</b> <b>terms,</b> {{the priesthood}} office of seventy is one which has varied widely {{over the course}} of history. As {{originally}} envisioned by Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith in the 1830s, the seventy were to be a body composed of several separate quorums of up to 70 seventies each, all of which would be led by seven presidents. These presidents, chosen from the first quorum, would appoint and direct the other quorums of seventy.|$|E

Organization can make social construction of realty in their official statement.
