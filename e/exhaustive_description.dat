500|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, attachment means [...] "a biological instinct {{in which}} proximity to an attachment figure is sought {{when the child}} senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort". Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds {{are based on the}} child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. John Bowlby begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like [...] "fixed action patterns" [...] to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be [...] "goal-corrected" [...] with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but—depending on the organism—can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies for the purpose of survival, and, ultimately, genetic replication. Attachment theory is not an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>description</b> of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: An {{important}} tool in Systems Biology is the stoichiometric modeling of metabolic networks, where the stationary {{states of the}} network are described by a high-dimensional polyhedral cone, the so-called flux cone. <b>Exhaustive</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the metabolism {{can be obtained by}} computing the elementary vectors of this cone but, owing to a combinatorial explosion of the number of elementary vectors, this approach becomes computationally intractable for genome scale networks. Result: Hence, we propose to instead focus on the conversion cone, a projection of the flux cone, which describes the interaction of the metabolism with its external chemical environment. We present a direct method for calculating the elementary vectors of this cone and, by studying the metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that such an analysis is computationally feasible even for genome scale networks.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of parallel}} cable-driven mechanisms calls for {{a better understanding of}} their behavior and highly efficient algorithms to attenuate their drawbacks at the design stage. One of these drawbacks is the high probability of mechanical interferences between the moving parts of the mechanism. In this paper, the phenomenon is described under the assumption that a cable is a line segment in space. When a mechanical contact occurs between two cables or between a cable and an edge of the end effector, these entities necessarily lie in the same plane, and then the three-dimensional problem becomes two-dimensional. This fact is used to simplify the equations, and leads to <b>exhaustive</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the associated interference loci in the constant-orientation workspace of a cable-driven mechanism. These results provide a fast method to graphically represent all interference regions in the manipulator workspace, given its geometry and the orientation of its end effector...|$|R

40|$|International audienceForaminifera are {{commonly}} defined as marine testate protists, and their diversity is mainly assessed {{on the basis}} of the morphology of their agglutinated or mineralized tests. Diversity surveys based on environmental DNA (eDNA) have dramatically changed this view by revealing an unexpected diversity of naked and organic-walled lineages as well as detecting foraminiferal lineages in soil and freshwater environments. Moreover, single-cell analyses have allowed discrimination among genetically distinctive types within almost every described morphospecies. In view of these studies, the foraminiferal diversity appeared to be largely underestimated, but its accurate estimation was impeded by the low speed and coverage of a cloning-based eDNA approach. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, these limitations disappeared in favor of <b>exhaustive</b> <b>descriptions</b> of foraminiferal diversity in numerous samples. Yet, the biases and errors identified in early HTS studies raised some questions about the accuracy of HTS data and their biological interpretation. Among the most controversial issues affecting the reliability of HTS diversity estimates are (1) the impact of technical and biological biases, (2) the sensitivity and specificity of taxonomic sequence assignment, (3) the ability to distinguish rare species, and (4) the quantitative interpretation of HTS data. Here, we document the lessons learned from previous HTS surveys and present the current advances and applications focusing on foraminiferal eDNA. We discuss the problems associated with HTS approaches and predict the future trends and avenues that hold promises for surveying foraminiferal diversity accurately and efficiently...|$|R

Moreover, in highly social animals there is a total lack of data on the reactions of other members of the group towards the mother and the newborn.

Three observers followed the group: one of them collected data on the mother via focal animal sampling, the second one recorded the identities and behaviours of group members that were in proximity to the mother, and the third video-recorded the whole event, which lasted about a hour. The mother performed the characteristic squatting posture during contractions, touched her vaginal area and moved her hands from the vagina to the mouth and licked her fingers. Two adult, one ju venile, and one infant female were extremely interested in the mother and the newborn: they followed and frequently touched her. Males and the other pregnant female never approached the mother before the birth took place. We also observed the consumption of the placenta and its sharing among group members.

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that matter has a discrete nature, but this aspect is usually considered {{only at the}} nano and microscale, {{on the other hand}} at the meso and macroscale levels compact matter is represented with a continuous model. At the macroscopic scales can be usefully adopted a discrete model of solids, without losing accuracy in the description of the main mechanical involved phenomena; when a multiscale study of solids is necessary the discrete approach, tailored to the scale of observation of interest, allows complete and <b>exhaustive</b> <b>descriptions</b> of many phenomena. This PhD thesis presents a general computational particle method suitable for analyzing the dynamic behaviour of compact solids as well as granular matters. The particle interaction is modelled through proper force functionals related {{to the nature of the}} material being analyzed (solid, granular or their interaction); such an approach is also adopted for the boundary and for the particle-particle contacts, so a unified mechanical model can be simply adopted for the simulation of a very wide class of mechanical problems under static or dynamic conditions. In particular the failure of brittle solids under dynamic dynamic impact can be easily predicted, avoiding the necessity of complex remeshing operations, stress field enrichment or the introduction of discontinuous displacement field, as typically required by numerical continuous approaches such as the finite element method. Moreover the discrete approach allows to simply model mechanical problems involving large displacements, friction or frictionless interactions with elastic boundaries, fragmentation and clustering of the failed material as well as cohesion in particle-like matters. Some examples aimed at demonstrating the versatility of the developed approach are finally presented: in particular the problems involving the failure of continuous solid elements under impact loading, confined particle flows and solid-granular materials interaction are simulated through the proposed approach and the related results are critically discussed and, when available, compared with literature data...|$|R
