B. pseudomallei {{is known to}} secrete various extracellular products related to its pathogenesis, such as lethal exotoxin, protease and hemolysin. We have attempted to purify the exotoxin {{as studies have shown}} it to exhibit necrotic and cytotoxic activities and inhibit cellular protein synthesis. Purification was performed by antibody mediated affinity chromatography using previously generated single chain variable fragments (scFv) towards partially purified B. pseudomallei exotoxin coupled to a <b>diaminodipropylamine</b> column. B. pseudomallei was grown in BHIB + 2 % glycerol under static conditions at 37 Â°C for 7 days and crude extract was subjected to the scFv-linked column to capture the exotoxin. SDS-PAGE analysis exhibited a purified protein migrating as a single band bearing a size of approximately 37 kDa. N-terminal protein sequencing and further bioinformatics analysis showed that the peptide shared some similarity with a putative decapeptide of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A and is present in both chromosomes 1 and 2 of B. pseudomallei. This suggests that the protein obtained could be the 37 kDa subunit of the B. pseudomallei exotoxin. Selected assays demonstrated that the purified product had no hemolytic, proteolytic or tyrosine phosphatase activity. The purified protein can aid i...|$|E
