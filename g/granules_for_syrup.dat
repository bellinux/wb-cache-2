40|$|Shoots of Picea abies (Norwegian spruce) are {{traditional}} material <b>for</b> <b>syrup</b> {{production in the}} small and medium sized food industry in Northern Finland. The shoot products {{are believed to be}} beneficial to one’s health because of their purity and nutritional value, e. g. high mineral, ascorbic acid and flavonoid content. They are also valued for their essential oil content and the forest aroma. In this study, young shoots of Picea abies were used <b>for</b> <b>syrup</b> production in a pilot scale, in a local juice plant. The study was initiated with dual objectives: to improve the quality and the yield of the syrup; and {{to improve the quality of}} the by-product and find new utilization for it. This article takes a resource use optimisation view of shoot syrup processing in small and medium sized juice plants. The whole chain from raw material collection to consumption is considered. The traditional syrup process is based on cooking and evaporating. Its limiting factor is the high operating temperature, which spoils the nutrient value and the flavour of shoots. The gentle method of cold extracting of shoots with sugar combined with pressing has now emerged as a promising alternative <b>for</b> shoot <b>syrup</b> processing. The by-products were earlier composted, however, it is recommended here that they are dried and ground, and used as aromatic powder...|$|R
