40|$|To enable <b>failure</b> mode <b>avoidance</b> it is {{necessary}} to understand when and why potential failure modes are created. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand when and why potential failure modes are created, to create a better base for <b>failure</b> mode <b>avoidance.</b> Methodology/Approach This paper is based on a study of ten customer related reliability problems in an automotive company. The interviews were all based on open-ended questions that facilitated the interviewees to give narrative descriptions of their views and experiences. In total 13 interviews, each between one and two hours, have been performed and secondary data has been used as a complement. Findings The cases analysed are all customer related problems; meaning that the failures were detected when the product had been introduced in the market. However, a majority of the failure modes were created in early development phases. Many of the failure modes that eventually occurred in customer use had their cause in the concept development and selection phase. A costly time gap seems to exist between failure mode creation and failure mode detection. The research in this study indicates that this gap could probably be minimized and faults avoided through a more proactive <b>failure</b> mode <b>avoidance</b> work. Research Implication This paper calls for a change of mindset in the work to improve reliability; a change from a focus on failure mode detection to <b>failure</b> mode <b>avoidance.</b> This implicates a need to frontload the product development process in terms of reliability enhancing efforts. Originality/Value of paper For researchers as well as practitioners in the field of reliability this paper offers an insight into current industrial practice in this area, revealing areas in which further research and development is needed. The findings of the paper will hopefully facilitate a shift in reliability practice from work on failure mode detection to work on <b>failure</b> mode <b>avoidance...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> {{capability}} is a desired feature for telecommunication networks, {{such as the}} Internet. However, not all failures can be promptly bypassed on the Internet because routing systems {{that are responsible for}} detecting and avoiding failures cannot detect all failures.

This paper proposes a novel routing architecture called Drouting that enables flexible <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance.</b> In Drouting, routers calculate multipaths from a source to a destination by constructing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that include all links in the intra-domain network graph.

With this changing market, a more efficient approach to Noise Vibration and Harshness (NVH) development is needed to foster better decisions and support the compressed product development timing required by the market.

Based on the <b>failure</b> mode <b>avoidance</b> approach, the process and model allow the engineering teams to uncover and avoid potential tire/wheel and driveline NVH failure modes. Therefore, early in the product development process, development teams can identify control and noise factor limits and system level effects, avoid potential NVH failure modes, and develop appropriate countermeasures. Using insights from innovation diffusion theory, the process and tool were deployed systematically to NVH community, with user insights used to adapt and improve the process and tools.

40|$|Given {{the high}} levels of {{attrition}} in the teaching profession {{there is a need for}} research to better understand factors that lead to greater teacher well-being and engagement. The present study explores the roles of coping and buoyancy in predicting teacher well-being and engagement.

Amongst a sample of 515 teachers from 18 schools, results generally supported this model with particularly strong direct effects for buoyancy and strong direct and indirect effects for mastery orientation. <b>Failure</b> <b>avoidance,</b> self-handicapping, and planning also produced significant direct and/or indirect effects via buoyancy on teacher well-being and engagement.

30|$|Distribution-based control {{should be}} {{applicable}} to any utility-based network control problem. As the Hellinger distance, or any other distance measure used, allows the current state distribution to be quantitatively compared to some target, {{the utility of the}} system in relation to this distance can be measured at any time. Within this work, we focus solely on a <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> type of problem, in which the control system attempts to keep the distance between the target state and measured state below some threshold value for as long as possible. A well known example of this problem from the domain of reinforcement learning is the pole-balancing problem, but more recently, the work of [9] and [3] has applied a <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> approach to the problem of consensus avoidance in networks. In addition to consensus avoidance, {{there are a number of}} interesting <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> problems that could be considered within social systems. For example, we may want to prevent the overall opinion or state in a system from changing too quickly 1, which may lead to panic (this is also applicable in economic systems). From an advertising perspective, we may want to avoid having the interest in a product or idea (as measured by mentions per unit time, for example) drop below some threshold. We may also want to prevent the disparity in some state value from growing too large between members of a system or group to minimize resentment, jealousy, spitefulness or general conflict.|$|E

However, in the longer term, both approaches have comparable merit with a marginal advantage for preventive checkpointing. We also develop an analytical model of the performance for fault tolerance based on periodic check-pointing and compare this approach to both <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> techniques. We find that this comparison is sensitive {{to the nature of the}} stochastic distribution of the time between failures, and that <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> is likely inferior to fault tolerance in the long term. Regardless, our result show that each approach is likely to achieve poor utilization for large-scale platforms (e. g., 220 nodes) unless the mean time between failures is large.

40|$|Software {{reliability}} is {{an increasingly}} pressing concern as the multicore revolution forces parallel programming upon the average programmer. Many existing approaches to software failure are ad hoc, based on best-practice heuristics. Often these approaches impose onerous burdens on developers, entail high runtime performance overheads, or offer no help for unmodified legacy code. We demonstrate that discrete control theory {{can be applied}} to software <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> problems. Discrete control theory is a branch of control engineering that addresses the control of systems with discrete state spaces and event-driven dynamics. Typical modeling formalisms used in discrete control theory include automata and Petri nets, which are well suited for modeling software systems. In order to use discrete control theory for software <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> problems, formal models of computer programs must first be constructed. Next, control logic must be synthesized from the model and given behavioral specifications. Finally, the control logic must be embedded into the execution engine or the program itself. At runtime, the provably correct control logic guarantees that the given failure-avoidance specifications are enforced. This thesis employs the above methodology in two different application domains: <b>failure</b> <b>avoidance</b> in information technology automation workflows and deadlock avoidance in multithreaded C programs. In the first application, we model workflows using finite-state automata and synthesize controllers for safety and nonblocking specifications expressed as regular languages using an automata-based discrete control technique, called Supervisory Control. The second application addresses the problem of deadlock avoidance in multithreaded C programs that use lock primitives. We exploit compiler technology to model programs as Petri nets and establish a correspondence between deadlock avoidance in the program and the absence of reachable empty siphons in its Petri net model. The technique of Supervision Based on Place Invariants is then used to synthesize the desired control logic, which is implemented using source-to-source translation. Empirical evidence confirms that the algorithmic techniques of Discrete Control Theory employed scale to programs of practical size in both application domains. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments in the deadlock avoidance problem demonstrate tolerable runtime overhead, no more than 18 %, for a benchmark and several real-world C programs...|$|E
