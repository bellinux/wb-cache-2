40|$|Abstract Background Levels of {{pesticides}} and other compounds in carpet dust {{can be useful}} indicators of exposure in epidemiologic studies, particularly for young children who are in frequent contact with carpets. The high-volume surface sampler (HVS 3) {{is often used to}} collect dust samples in the room in which the child had spent the most time. This method can be expensive and cumbersome, and {{it has been suggested that}} an easier method would be to remove dust that had already been collected with the <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> However, the household vacuum integrates exposures over multiple rooms, some of which are not relevant to the child's exposure, and differences in vacuuming equipment and practices could affect the chemical concentration data. Here, we compare levels {{of pesticides}} and other compounds in dust from household vacuums to that collected using the HVS 3. Methods Both methods were used in 45 homes in California. HVS 3 samples were collected in one room, while the household vacuum had typically been used throughout the home. The samples were analyzed for 64 organic compounds, including pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), using GC/MS in multiple ion monitoring mode; and for nine metals using conventional microwave-assisted acid digestion combined with ICP/MS. Results The methods agreed in detecting the presence of the compounds 77 % to 100 % of the time (median 95 %). For compounds with less than 100 % agreement, neither method was consistently more sensitive than the other. Median concentrations were similar for most analytes, and Spearman correlation coefficients were 0. 60 or higher except for allethrin (0. 15) and malathion (0. 24), which were detected infrequently, and benzo(k) fluoranthene (0. 55), benzo(a) pyrene (0. 55), PCB 105 (0. 54), PCB 118 (0. 54), and PCB 138 (0. 58). Assuming that the HVS 3 method is the "gold standard," the extent to which the <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> method yields relative risk estimates closer to unity by increasing random measurement error varies by compound and depends on the method used to calculate relative risk. Conclusion The <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> method appears to be a reasonable alternative to the HVS 3 for detecting, ranking, and quantifying the concentrations of pesticides and other compounds in carpet dust. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the state of the science in retention and removal of house dust contaminants in carpet. A brief review of the literature on carpet contaminants, its health concerns, sources and pathways, mechanics of soiling, and cleaning will be presented. The importance of lead, dust mite and cat allergen, both as serious indoor pollutants and as divergent exposure pathways, is emphasized. Data is presented on the importance of fluorocarbon coatings, surface area, and wear retention and removal of allergens and lead. Although high-suction, high-flow rate <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> appear to have an important role in cleaning dust contaminants, many <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> clean with only marginal difference. Carpet cleaning systems that remove dry particulate, lead and dust mite allergen appear to be superior or equivalent to wet removal methods in new studies. The interaction of carpet types with <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> and with dust loading, however, suggests that a systems approach be used for addressing the removal of house dust contaminants from carpet. If carpet is to remain a staple of the indoor environment, then an understanding of the source of dust-borne contaminants and of how they are retained, released, and removed may inform the debate on how to maintain a healthy indoor environment...|$|R

While RL has been used to learn mobile robot control in many simulated domains, applications involving learning on real robots are still relatively rare. In this paper, the Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) reinforcement learning algorithm and a new model-based algorithm Least-Squares Policy Iteration with Prioritized Sweeping (LSPI+), are implemented on a mobile robot to acquire new skills quickly and efficiently. LSPI+ combines the benefits of LSPI and prioritized sweeping, which uses all previous experience to focus the computational effort on the most “interesting” or dynamic parts of the state space. The proposed algorithms are tested on a <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> robot for learning a docking task using vision as the only sensor modality. In experiments these algorithms are compared to other model-based and model-free RL algorithms.

40|$|Estimation {{of human}} {{exposures}} to {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) is often desired for the epidemiological studies of cancer. One way to obtain information about indoor levels of PAHs is to measure these chemicals in house dust. In this study, we evaluated the predictive value of self-reported and geographic data for estimating measured levels of nine PAHs in house dust from 583 households in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS). Using multivariable linear regression models, we evaluated the effects on house-dust PAH concentrations from the following covariates: residential heating sources, smoking habits, house characteristics, and outdoor emission sources. House dust was collected from 2001 to 2007, usingboth high-volume surface samplers and <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> and was analyzed for nine PAHs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. All nine PAHs were detected in more than 93 % of dust samples, with median concentrations ranging from 14 to 94 ng/g dust. Statistically significant effects on PAH concentrations in house dust were found for gas heating, outdoor PAH concentrations, and residence age. Yet, the optimal regression model only explained 15 % {{of the variation in}} PAH levels in house dust. As self-reported data and outdoor PAH sources were only marginally predictive of observe...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} is inconsistent regarding associations between parental smoking and childhood leukemia, possibly because previous studies used self-reported smoking habits as surrogates for children’s true exposures to cigarette smoke. Here, the authors investigated {{the use of}} nicotine concentrations in house dust as measures of children’s exposure to cigarette smoke in 469 households from the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (1999 – 2007). House dust was collected by using high-volume surface samplers and <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> and was analyzed for nicotine via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Using multivariable linear regression, the authors evaluated the effects of self-reported parental smoking, parental demographics, house characteristics, and other covariates on house-dust nicotine concentrations. They observed that nicotine concentrations in house dust were associated with self-reported smoking for periods of months and years before dust collection. Furthermore, the authors found that the relation between nicotine dust levels and self-reported smoking varied by parental age and socioeconomic status. These findings suggest that house-dust nicotine concentrations reflect long-term exposures to cigarette smoke {{in the home and}} that they may be less biased surrogates for children’s exposures to cigarette smoke than self-reported smoking habits. child; dust; environmental exposure; infant; leukemia; linear models; nicotine; smoking Abbreviations: HVS 3, high-volume surface sampler; KW ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance; NCCLS, Norther...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cronobacter spp. (formerly Enterobacter sakazakii), are a {{group of}} Gram-negative {{pathogens}} that have been implicated as causative agents of meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants. The pathogens are linked to infant formula; however, they have also been isolated {{from a wide range}} of foods and environmental samples. Results In this study, 233 samples of food, infant formula and environment were screened for the presence of Cronobacter spp. in an attempt to find its source. Twenty nine strains were isolated from samples of spices, herbs, infant foods, and dust obtained from <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Among the 76 samples of infant food, infant formula, milk powder and non-milk dairy products tested, only one sample of infant food contained Cronobacter spp. (1. 4 %). The other Cronobacter spp. isolates recovered include two from <b>household</b> <b>vacuum</b> dust, and 26 from 67 samples of herbs and spices. Among the food categories analyzed, herbs and spices harbored the highest number of isolates, indicating plants as a possible reservoir of this pathogen. Initial screening with API 20 E test strips yielded 42 presumptive isolates. Further characterization using 3 chromogenic media (α-MUG, DFI and EsPM) and 8 sets of PCR primers detecting ITS (internal transcribed spacer sequences), 16 S rRNA, zpx, gluA, gluB, OmpA genes followed by nucleotide sequencing of some PCR amplicons did not confirm the identity of all the isolates as none of the methods proved to be free of both false positives or false negatives. The final confirmation step was done by 16 S rRNA sequence analysis identifying only 29 of the 42 isolates as Cronobacter spp. Conclusion Our studies showed that Cronobacter spp. are highly diverse and share many phenotypic traits with other Enterobacteriaceae members highlighting the need to use several methods to confirm the identity of this pathogen. None of the biochemical, chromogenic or PCR primers proved to be a reliable method for confirmation of the identity of the isolates as all of them gave either false positives or false negatives or both. It is therefore concluded that 16 S rRNA sequencing is pivotal to confirm the identity of the isolates. </p...|$|R
