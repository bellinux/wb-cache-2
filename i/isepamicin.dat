40|$|Background: Enterobacteriaceae, common {{pathogens}} {{responsible for}} urinary tract infections {{are known to}} be susceptible to aminoglycosides. The emergence of resistant pathogens complicates antimicrobial regimen and becomes a challenge for clinicians. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the susceptibility of clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae to <b>isepamicin</b> and amikacin using disc diffusion method. Materials and Methods: A total of 234 Enterobacteriaceae isolates was collected and examined. Antimicrobial susceptibilities to gentamicin, amikacin, and <b>isepamicin</b> were assessed using disc diffusion method. The production of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC β-lactamase was also tested. The susceptibilities of the pathogens to <b>isepamicin</b> and amikacin were evaluated. Results: Two hundred and thirty-four Enterobacteriaceae isolates were found to be more susceptible to amikacin and <b>isepamicin</b> than to gentamicin. Of the isolates, 39 (16. 7 %) produced ESBL and 41 (17. 5 %) harbored AmpC β-lactamase. The results revealed that amikacin and <b>isepamicin</b> exerted excellent antibacterial activity (94 % vs. 93. 6 %) against all tested isolates. <b>Isepamicin</b> was effective against 89. 7 % ESBL-producing isolates and 92. 7 % of AmpC-producing isolates. The susceptibility to amikacin and <b>isepamicin</b> established by the disc diffusion method was mostly consistent with the overall agreement estimated 99. 6 %. Conclusions: <b>Isepamicin</b> showed excellent activities against infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae, including strains harboring ESBL or AmpC beta-lactamase. The susceptibility of tested isolated to <b>isepamicin</b> measured by disc diffusion method is comparable to that of amikacin...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposition}} of <b>isepamicin,</b> an investigational aminoglycoside antibiotic, was evaluated in 30 subjects with {{various degrees of}} renal function. The subjects were divided into five groups: those with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CLCR], greater than 80 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2), those with mild renal insufficiency (CLCR, 50 to 80 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2), those with moderate renal insufficiency (CLCR, 30 to 49 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2), those with severe renal insufficiency (CLCR, 5 to 29 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2), and those maintained on hemodialysis (CLCR, less than 5 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2). Subjects on hemodialysis were studied both during hemodialysis and during an interdialytic period. The volumes of distribution of <b>isepamicin</b> {{were not significantly different}} among the five groups of patients. The total body clearance (CLP) and renal clearance (CLR) of <b>isepamicin</b> significantly decreased as CLCR decreased. The CLP of <b>isepamicin</b> and CLCR were significantly related [(COP = 0. 391. [CLCR] + 1. 83; r 2 = 0. 878) ]. Nonrenal clearance of <b>isepamicin</b> did not differ between groups. Hemodialysis augmented the CLP of <b>isepamicin</b> by approximately 25 -fold. The amount of <b>isepamicin</b> recovered in the dialysate was 60. 6 +/- 15. 8 % of the dose administered. The maximal rebound of the <b>isepamicin</b> concentration in plasma after cessation of hemodialysis was observed at 0. 78 +/- 0. 7 h. Concentrations in plasma increased 32. 7 +/- 22. 9 % over that measured at the end of hemodialysis. These data indicate that dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with decreased renal function...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{variation in the}} nephrotoxicity of low doses of <b>isepamicin</b> was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single daily intraperitoneal injection of saline (NaCl, 0. 9 %) or <b>isepamicin</b> (80 mg/kg of body weight) at either 0800, 1400, 2000, or 0200 h for 4 and 10 days. On day 10, the cellular regeneration (incorporation of [3 H] thymidine into DNA of renal cortex) and cortical accumulation of <b>isepamicin</b> were significantly higher in animals treated at 1400 h than at 0200 h (P < 0. 01). Immunogold labeling studies showed that <b>isepamicin</b> was essentially localized in the lysosomes of proximal tubular cells in all treated groups, but {{the density of the}} gold particles over the lysosomes was higher in animals treated at 1400 than at 0200 h. The {{results of the present study}} show that the renal toxicity of <b>isepamicin</b> was maximal at 1400 h (midlight period) and minimal at 0200 h (middark period) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>isepamicin,</b> a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic, {{were studied}} in men after intravenous administration. Three groups of six volunteers received <b>isepamicin</b> for 10 consecutive days by 0. 5 -h intravenous infusions at respective dosages of 7. 5 mg/kg {{of body weight}} once daily, 7. 5 mg/kg twice daily, and 15 mg/kg once daily. Levels of <b>isepamicin</b> in plasma and urine were determined by a specific high-performance liquid chromatography method. For all three groups, steady-state concentrations of the drug in plasma were attained with the first dose. The area under the concentration-time curve for plasma and urinary drug excretion were dose proportional. A half-life ranging from 2. 0 to 2. 5 h was independent of the dosage regimen. <b>Isepamicin</b> excreted in urine over 24 h accounted for about 100 % of the dose. The {{results show that the}} pharmacokinetics of <b>isepamicin</b> are linear with these dosage regimens. The drug does not accumulate upon multiple dosing, undergoes no detectable biotransformation, and is cleared solely by urinary excretion...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, tobramycin and <b>isepamicin</b> was done. A total of 200 clinical isolates of Gram negative organisms from various clinical sources were tested. E. Coli was the most frequently isolated organism followed by Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Of the 5 aminoglycosides tested, <b>isepamicin</b> showed the highest numbers of susceptible isolates followed by amikacin, netilmicin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

40|$|Twelve healthy {{adult male}} volunteers {{received}} 1 g (base equivalent) of 14 C-isepamicin (131 mCi) as an intravenous bolus over 5 min. The areas under the plasma concentration-time curves at infinity for <b>isepamicin</b> (196 mg z h/ml) and total radioactivity (164 mg z h/ml) were similar, indicating no biotransformation of isepa-micin. The disappearance of <b>isepamicin</b> from plasma followed a triexponential decline, with half-lives of 0. 17, 2. 12, and 34 h for the a, b, and g phases, respectively. However, {{the contribution of}} the g phase to the total area under the concentration-time curve was only 2. 6 %. There were no detectable metabolites in plasma and urine, confirming that <b>isepamicin</b> was not biotransformed. The cumulative levels of <b>isepamicin</b> and total radioactivity excretion in urine from 0 to 120 h were 97. 3 and 92. 1 % of the dose, respectively, indicating that the drug was excreted mainly as unchanged <b>isepamicin</b> in urine. <b>Isepamicin</b> is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic that {{has been shown to be}} active against bacteria that have developed resis-tance to other aminoglycosides (1, 7, 8, 17).

40|$|<b>Isepamicin</b> {{is a new}} {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic {{which has}} a superior stability to aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes compared with other available aminoglycosides. In this multicentre, randomised, open study, the safety and efficacy of <b>isepamicin</b> plus ceftazidime was {{compared with that of}} amikacin plus ceftazidime in adults with acute lower respiratory tract infection. Patients with severe infections received intravenous administration of <b>isepamicin</b> 15 mg/kg once daily + ceftazidime 2 g twice daily (n= 121) or amikacin 7. 5 mg/kg twice daily + ceftazidime 2 g twice daily (n= 61). Those with less severe infection received intramuscular or intravenous administration of <b>isepamicin</b> 8 mg/kg once daily + ceftazidime 1 g twice daily (n= 56) or amikacin 7. 5 mg/kg twice daily + ceftazidime Ig twice daily (n= 28). In the efficacy population, the proportion of patients clinically cured in the <b>isepamicin</b> group (87 / 100; 87 %) was similar to that in the amikacin group (36 / 47; 77 %). Significantly more patients in the <b>isepamicin</b> group were cured or improved compared with the amikacin group (97 % vs 89 %; p = 0. 042). The difference between treatment groups was also significant in patients with pneumonia (p = 0. 05). The most commonly isolated target organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of patients in the efficacy population whose pretreatment valid target organisms were eliminated was similar in each treatment group (90 % <b>isepamicin</b> vs 89 % amikacin). A retrospective analysis showed there were slightly fewer clinical successes and a higher death rate in patients with nosocomial rather than community acquired pneumonia. Both treatments were well tolerated. Fourteen per cent of <b>isepamicin</b> and 11 % of amikacin patients experienced adverse events. The incidence of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity was low...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the pharmacokinetics of <b>isepamicin</b> during continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Six patients received 15 mg of <b>isepamicin</b> per kg of body weight. The mean <b>isepamicin</b> concentration peak in serum was 62. 88 ± 18. 20 mg/liter 0. 5 h after the infusion. The elimination half-life was 7. 91 ± 0. 83 h. The mean total body clearance was 1. 75 ± 0. 28 liters/h, and dialysate outlet (DO) clearance was 2. 76 ± 0. 59 liters/h. The mean volume of distribution was 19. 83 ± 2. 95 liters. The elimination half-life, DO clearance, and volume of distribution were almost constant.

40|$|Intra-abdominal infections due to {{penetrating}} wound {{through the}} abdominal wall or rupture of the gastrointestinal tract are acute conditions requiring prompt surgical intervention {{and the use}} of appropriate antimicrobial agents. <b>Isepamicin</b> is an effective aminoglycoside against various Gram-negative pathogens causing intra-abdominal infections. The objective of the present study is to compare the efficacy and safety of <b>isepamicin</b> (15 mg/kgBW IV o. d.) with amikacin (7. 5 mg/kgBB b. i. d.), in conjunction with metronidazole for both drugs. An open, randomized, parallel design was applied in this trial. The subject allocation ratio for isepamicin: amikacin is 2 : 1. Out of 50 patients enrolled in this study, 27 fuffilled the criteria for safety and efficacy population, and 46  for intent-to-treat population. In the safety and efficacy population, the clinical success rare for <b>isepamicin</b> and amikacin group did not differ significantly (i. e., 95 % and 100 %, respectively). In the intent-to-treat population, the clinical success rates for <b>isepamicin</b> and amikacin group were also insignifficantly different (i. e., 97 % and 100 %, respectively). The rates of bacteriological elimination for isepamicin and amikacin, were 95 % and 100 %, respectively in the efficacy and safety population, and 90 % and 93 %, respectively in the intent-to-treat population. Streptococci and staphylococci were the most frequent (40 %) pathogens isolated from pus, and  Acinetobacter anitratus (55 %) was the most common one isolated from blood. In the efficacy and safety population, the mean (± SD)  length of hospital stay in the <b>isepamicin</b> and amikacin groups was 10. 7 ±  3. 9 and 11. 1 ±  3. 8 days, respectively, while in the intent-to-treat population, the mean (± SD) length of hospital stay in the <b>isepamicin</b> and amikacin groups was 10. 1 ±  3. 4 and 10. 5 ±  3 days, respectively.

The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for 1087 non-duplicate, consecutive aerobic Gram-negative isolates, including 798 Enterobacteriaceae and 289 non-fermenters, were determined by E-test for each antibiotic. Overall, <b>isepamicin</b> was active against 91 % of all isolates and was found more active than ciprofloxacin (84 % susceptibility), gentamicin (88 % susceptibility), cefepime and amikacin (89 % susceptibility each), but less active than meropenem (94 % susceptibility). Enterobacter aerogenes isolates exhibited the highest resistance rate to ciprofloxacin (72 %) while P. aeruginosa appeared the most resistant (frequently multi-resistant) pathogen. Compared to amikacin, MIC values for <b>isepamicin</b> were usually two- to fourfold lower for most inducible Enterobacteriacieae species and for Klebsiella spp., while they were identical for P. aeruginosa and other non-fermenters. Complete cross-susceptibility or cross-resistance between amikacin and <b>isepamicin</b> was observed in more than 95 % of all tested isolates. On the other hand, 122 % of all E. aerogenes isolates appeared resistant to amikacin and susceptible to <b>isepamicin,</b> while 6 % of the P aeruginosa were found to be resistant (or intermediate) to <b>isepamicin</b> and intermediate (or susceptible) to amikacin.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of Escherichia coli to several aminoglycoside antibiotics was examined with E. coli DR 112 {{transformed by the}} gene for polyamine-induced protein (oligopeptide-binding [OppA] protein) or polyamine transport proteins. The results clearly showed that sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, <b>isepamicin,</b> kanamycin, neomycin, paromomycin, and streptomycin) increased due to the highly expressed OppA protein. When the gene for OppA protein was deleted, sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics was greatly decreased. It was also shown that <b>isepamicin</b> could bind to OppA protein with a binding affinity constant of 8. 5 x 10 (3) M- 1 under the ionic conditions of 50 mM K+ and 1 mM Mg 2 + at pH 7. 5, and <b>isepamicin</b> uptake into cells was greatly stimulated by the OppA protein. These results, taken together, show that the OppA protein increases the uptake of aminoglycoside antibiotics. In addition, the OppA protein increased the transport of spermidine and an oligopeptide (Gly-Leu-Tyr). The uptake of <b>isepamicin</b> into cells was partially inhibited by spermidine, suggesting that the binding site for <b>isepamicin</b> overlaps that for spermidine on the OppA protein. Spermidine uptake activity by the OppA protein was less than 1 % of that of the ordinary spermidine uptake system. Aminoglycoside antibiotics neither stimulated the synthesis of OppA protein nor increased spermidine uptake...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>isepamicin</b> following {{administration of}} a 1 -g dose were evaluated for 18 healthy male volunteers {{between the ages}} of 26 and 38. In a randomized crossover fashion, each volunteer received doses of <b>isepamicin</b> by a 30 -min intravenous infusion and as an intramuscular injection. Blood samples were collected at specified times after dosing and assayed for <b>isepamicin</b> by a validated radioimmunoassay method. The individual plasma concentration-time curves were analyzed by noncompartmental methods. In general, the pharmacokinetics after intravenous infusion and intramuscular injection were similar. As expected, the maximum concentration of <b>isepamicin</b> in serum following intramuscular injection (37. 2 microg/ml) was lower than the observed concentration at the end of infusion (66. 7 microg/ml). The areas under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity following intramuscular and intravenous administration were 164. 8 and 154. 5 microg x hr/ml, respectively, indicating complete absorption following intramuscular administration. The respective mean terminal-phase half-life (t 1 / 2) values were 2. 6 and 3. 6 h. Although t 1 / 2 was slightly longer following intravenous infusion, the small difference in the observed t 1 / 2 values was not considered to be clinically significant. Total body clearances following intramuscular injection and intravenous infusion were 1. 3 and 1. 4 ml/min/kg, respectively, which were similar to renal serum creatinine clearances in healthy volunteers (> 1. 14 ml/min/kg). The drug was safe and well tolerated. The {{results of the present study}} clearly show complete absorption of <b>isepamicin</b> following intramuscular administration. The similarity in the pharmacokinetics after intravenous infusion and intramuscular dosing would permit interchangeable administration of <b>isepamicin</b> by either route without compromising clinical efficacy...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) of <b>isepamicin</b> {{were studied}} in 8 febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy and in 20 young women with acute {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (PID). <b>Isepamicin</b> was given as a slow intravenous infusion over 30 min at a dose of 15 mg/kg once daily (OD). Serum levels of <b>isepamicin</b> were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay, and PK analyses were obtained based on a one-compartment open model after 24 hours (steady state) and after 7 days. On day 1, the volume of distribution (Vd) of <b>isepamicin,</b> for both populations, appeared about 30 % higher than classically reported in healthy individuals: 0. 31 and 0. 36 L/kg for neutropenic and PID patients respectively. However on day 7, Vd displayed significant reduction (0. 28 and 0. 27 L/kg, respectively for neutropenic and PID patients). A reduction of <b>isepamicin</b> clearance was also observed between day 1 and day 7 (137 vs 120 mL/min and 130 vs 101 mL/min for neutropenic and PID populations, respectively). Such changes are consistent with {{a significant increase in}} the Cmax concentrations (45 vs 50 mg/L, and 38 vs 49 mg/L) and in the AUC (136 vs 158 and 137 vs 162 mg/L. h) observed after a week of treatment in neutropenic and PID patients, respectively. In conclusion, taking into account the importance of reaching early active concentrations, we recommend the use of higher loading dose of <b>isepamicin</b> (> 15 mg/kg) in neutropenic cancer patients and in women with PID, particularly in case of a combination with a possibly ineffective antibacterial agent, in case of infection with bacteria at upper limit of susceptibility, in the presence of high infectious inoculum or in the presence of sequestered sites of infection...|$|E

Isogenic high-level (Hi) and low-level (Lo) AAC(6 ') -Ib-producing transconjugants (T) were constructed from clinical isolates with plasmid-borne resistance determinants. The MICs of amikacin and <b>isepamicin,</b> their bactericidal effects, and AAC(6 ') -Ib production appeared to be well correlated among the clinical isolates and the transconjugants. The susceptibility data determined in vitro, with MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of amikacin and <b>isepamicin</b> for LoT and HiT of 4 and 0. 5 and 32 and 8, respectively, were, however, not predictive of the in vivo efficacies of the drugs. While amikacin and <b>isepamicin</b> caused reductions in bacterial densities (log 10 CFU per gram of cardiac vegetation) of 5. 1 and 4. 8 of the fully susceptible recipient strain (MICs of amikacin and <b>isepamicin,</b> 0. 5 and 0. 25, respectively), the reductions in density of both LoT and HiT caused by the two drugs (2. 7 and 2. 4 and 2. 9 and 2. 2, respectively) were only marginally significant, if at all. There was no significant difference (P > 0. 05) when the reductions in density of LoT and HiT by either drug were compared or when the efficacies of the two drugs in reducing the density of any strain [non-AAC(6 ') -producing, LoT, or HiT] were compared (P > 0. 5).

The pharmacokinetics of <b>isepamicin</b> were not significantly altered during combination treatment with piperacillin. The total body clearance (3. 79 +/- 0. 71 versus 3. 94 +/- 1. 05 ml/min), the steady-state volume of distribution (0. 19 +/- 0. 04 versus 0. 18 +/- 0. 03 liter/kg), and the terminal elimination half-life (47. 91 +/- 7. 20 versus 45. 08 +/- 10. 34 h) were not significantly altered {{in the presence of}} piperacillin. In contrast, the terminal elimination half-life (47. 68 +/- 20. 58 versus 35. 67 +/- 11. 18 h) of gentamicin was significantly reduced when gentamicin was given with piperacillin. The total body clearance (4. 26 +/- 3. 07 versus 4. 89 +/- 1. 94 ml/min) and the steady-state volume of distribution (0. 19 +/- 0. 04 versus 0. 20 +/- 0. 04 liter/kg) of gentamicin were not significantly altered during combination therapy; however, the nonrenal clearance of gentamicin administered in combination with piperacillin (3. 56 +/- 0. 38 ml/min) increased significantly compared with that of gentamicin (2. 03 +/- 0. 50 ml/min) given alone. The {{results of this study suggest}} that no additional dosage adjustment of <b>isepamicin</b> during concomitant therapy with piperacillin in hemodialysis patients is necessary. However, this does not preclude the need for appropriately ex vivo-handled specimens for monitoring <b>isepamicin</b> concentrations in plasma to ensure therapeutic efficacy and prevent toxicity.

Aminoglycoside concentrations were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPI) after 0, 8, and 48 h of incubation and by radial diffusion bioassay after 48 h of incubation. Each of the three aminoglycosides was also added to whole blood containing either heparin (100 U/ml) or 0. 5 % EDTA as a control and assayed after 6 h by FPI. The degree of inactivation of <b>isepamicin</b> by the beta-lactams was significantly less than that by amikacin (P less than 0. 003) and gentamicin (P less than 0. 0002) when determined by bioassay. Piperacillin, carbenicillin, and azlocillin produced {{the greatest amount of}} inactivation, and cilastatin and oxacillin produced the least.

We study the in vitro susceptibility of A. baumannii complex and other nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) to aminoglycosides. MethodsA total of 378 NFGNB blood isolates causing healthcare-associated bloodstream infections during 2008 and 2013 at four medical centers in Taiwan were tested for their susceptibilities to four aminoglycosides using the agar dilution method (gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, and <b>isepamicin)</b> and disc diffusion method (<b>isepamicin).</b> ResultsA. baumannii was highly resistant to all four aminoglycosides (range of susceptibility, 0 – 4 %), whereas > 80 % of Acinetobacter nosocomialis and Acinetobacter pittii blood isolates were susceptible to amikacin (susceptibility: 96 % and 91 %, respectively), tobramycin (susceptibility: 92 % and 80 %, respectively), and <b>isepamicin</b> (susceptibility: 96 % and 80 %, respectively). All aminoglycosides except gentamicin possessed good in vitro activity (> 94 %) against P. aeruginosa. Amikacin has the best in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa (susceptibility, 98 %), followed by A. nosocomialis (96 %), and A. pittii (91 %), whereas tobramycin and <b>isepamicin</b> were less potent against A. pittii (both 80 %). Aminoglycoside resistances were prevalent in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia complex blood isolates in Taiwan. ConclusionGenospecies among the A. baumannii complex had heterogeneous susceptibility profiles to aminoglycosides.

Hearing levels before and after treatment were assessed by means of frequency-specific auditory brain stem responses (ABR). The creatinine level in serum was determined {{on the last day of}} the administration. None of the animals in either group showed signs of renal insufficiency or of hearing impairment. The median <b>isepamicin</b> concentration in the cochlear duct was 2. 40 micrograms/mg of protein after continuous administration and 2. 50 micrograms/mg of protein after once-daily administration, compared with the concentration in the cochlear nerve, where it was 1. 93 micrograms/mg of protein after continuous administration and 2. 59 micrograms/mg of protein after once-daily administration. These differences are statistically insignificant. The results give evidence for linear uptake kinetics of <b>isepamicin</b> in the inner ear tissue and may be directly relevant to the clinical dosing of the drug...|$|E

Only <b>isepamicin</b> and gentamicin, alone or combined with ceftriaxone, were effective as determined by titration of viable bacteria in vegetations. Variants highly resistant to ceftriaxone without change in MICs of aminoglycosides were isolated {{at the end of each}} therapeutic regimen except with the most effective one (ceftriaxone plus gentamicin). Examination of the bacterial outer membrane pro-teins as well as the 50 % inhibition of the p-Iactamase activity in intact and sonified cells sug-gested a permeability defect as being responsible for the increased MICs of ceftriaxone. The activity of <b>isepamicin</b> was superior to that of amikacin against the TEM- 3 -AAC(6 ') -IV-produc-ing strain. The combination of gentamicin plus ceftriaxone was the most effective regimen in terms of efficacy and prevention of emergence of resistant strains. Suboptimal aminoglycoside monotherapy might be responsible for selection of permeability mutants to p-Iactams.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) of <b>isepamicin,</b> a new aminoglycoside, {{were studied}} in 85 {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) patients and were compared with those observed in 10 healthy volunteers. A parametric method based on a nonlinear mixed-effect model {{was used to assess}} population PK. <b>Isepamicin</b> was given intravenously over 0. 5 h at dosages of 15 mg/kg once daily or 7. 5 mg/kg twice daily. The data were fitted to a bicompartmental open model. Compared with healthy volunteers, the mean values of the PK parameters were profoundly modified in ICU patients: elimination clearance was reduced by 48 %, the volume of distribution in the central compartment (Vc) was increased by 50 %, the peripheral volume of distribution was 70 % higher, the distribution clearance was 146 % lower, and the elimination half-life was ca. 3. 4 times higher. The interindividual variability in PK parameters was about 50 % in ICU patients. Five covariates (body weight [BW], simplified acute physiology score [SAPS], temperature, serum creatinine level, and creatinine clearance [CLCR]) were tentatively correlated with PK parameters by multivariate linear regression analysis with stepwise addition and deletion. The variability of <b>isepamicin</b> clearance was explained by three covariates (BW, SAPS, and CLCR), that of Vc was explained by BW and SAPS, and that of the elimination half-life was explained by CLCR and SAPS. Simulation of the concentration-versus-time profile for 500 individuals showed that the mean peak (0. 75 h) concentration was 18 % lower in ICU patients than in healthy volunteers and that the range in ICU patients was very broad (28. 4 to 95. 4 mg/liter).

40|$|Kidney cortex {{apoptosis}} was {{studied with}} female Wistar rats treated for 10 days with gentamicin and netilmicin at daily doses of 10 or 20 mg/kg {{of body weight}} and amikacin or <b>isepamicin</b> at daily doses of 40 mg/kg. Apoptosis was detected and quantitated using cytological (methyl green-pyronine) and immunohistochemical (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) staining, in parallel with a measurement of drug-induced phospholipidosis (cortical phospholipids and phospholipiduria), cortical proliferative response ((3) H incorporation in DNA and histoautoradiography after in vivo pulse-labeling with [(3) H]thymidine), and kidney dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine). Gentamicin induced in proximal tubules a marked apoptotic reaction which (i) was detectable after 4 days of treatment but was most conspicuous after 10 days, (ii) was dose dependent, (iii) occurred {{in the absence of}} necrosis, and (iv) was nonlinearly correlated with the proliferative response (tubular and peritubular cells). Comparative studies revealed a parallelism among the extents of phospholipidosis, apoptosis, and proliferative response for three aminoglycosides (gentamicin >> amikacin congruent with <b>isepamicin).</b> By contrast, netilmicin induced a marked phospholipidosis but a moderate apoptosis and proliferative response. We conclude that rats treated with gentamicin develop an apoptotic process as part of the various cortical alterations induced by this antibiotic at low doses. Netilmicin, and still more amikacin and <b>isepamicin,</b> appears safer in this respect. Whereas a relation between aminoglycoside-induced tubular apoptosis and cortical proliferative response seems to be established, no simple correlation with phospholipidosis can be drawn...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{study the}} {{bactericidal}} activity of β-lactam antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, cefpirome) {{alone or in}} combination with a β-lactamase inhibitor (sulbactam) in {{the presence or absence}} of aminoglycoside (amikacin or <b>isepamicin)</b> against Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). MethodsWe characterized 10 strains by means of analytic isoelectric focusing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The ESBLs produced by these strains were derived from either TEM (TEM- 1, TEM- 2) or SHV- 1. The killing-curve method was used for this bacterial investigation. Bacteria (final inoculum 5 × 105 CFU/mL) were incubated with antibiotics at clinical concentrations obtained in vivo. ResultsAll the combinations with cefepime or cefpirome + sulbactam were bactericidal, with a 4 log 10 decrease being obtained within 6 h without regrowth at 24 h, whereas imipenem alone, and combinations, gave a bactericidal effect within 6 h. The two cephalosporins alone decreased the inoculum of 4 log 10 at 6 h but regrowth was observed at 24 h. When the aminoglycoside was added, this bactericidal effect was obtained within 3 h with amikacin and within 1 h with <b>isepamicin.</b> ConclusionsCefepime + sulbactam or cefpirome + sulbactam may be an alternative to imipenem for the treatment of patients with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Aminoglycosides are often associated in nosocomial infections due to ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae: <b>isepamicin</b> acted faster than amikacin, but both worked well. To conclude, it may be prudent to avoid extended-spectrum cephalosporins as single agent when treating serious infections due to ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Addition of a β-lactamase inhibitor such as sulbactam ± aminoglycoside is advisable to avoid failure of treatment...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{the amount}} of {{oligopeptide}} binding protein (OppA) in spontaneous kanamycin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli were investigated. Among 20 colonies obtained from 108 cells cultured in the presence of 20 μg of kanamycin/ml, 1 colony had no detectable OppA and 7 colonies were mutants with reduced amounts of OppA. Sensitivity of wild-type cells to kanamycin increased slightly by transformation of the oppA gene, but the sensitivity of the mutants increased greatly by the transformation. A mutant with no OppA was found to be a nonsense mutant of the oppA gene at amino acid position 166. In a mutant having a reduced level of OppA, the reduction was due to the decrease in OppA synthesis at the translational level. These mutants were also resistant to other aminoglycoside antibiotics, including streptomycin, neomycin, and <b>isepamicin.</b> <b>Isepamicin</b> uptake activities decreased greatly in these two kinds of mutants. The results support the proposition that aminoglycoside antibiotics are transported into cells by the oligopeptide transport system, and that transport is an important factor for spontaneous resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Aminoglycoside {{antibiotics}} cause aggregation but not {{fusion of}} negatively-charged liposomes at an extent proportional to {{their capacity to}} interact with acidic phospholipids (Van Bambeke et al., 1995, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 289, 321 - 333). To understand why aggregation is not followed by fusion, we have examined here the influence of two aminoglycosides with markedly different toxic potential (gentamicin > <b>isepamicin)</b> on lipid phase transition in negatively-charged liposomes using 31 P-NMR spectroscopy, in comparison with spermine (an aggregating agent) and bis(beta-diethylaminoethylether) hexestrol or DEH (a fusogenic cationic amphiphile). Gentamicin, spermine, and, to a lesser extent, <b>isepamicin</b> inhibit {{the appearance of the}} isotropic signal seen upon warming of control liposomes and denoting the presence of mobile structures. This non-bilayer signal appeared most prominently when liposomes were incubated with DEH, a strong fusogenic agent. We conclude that aminoglycosides, like spermine, have the potential to prevent membrane fusion, by inhibiting the development of a critical change in membrane organization, which is associated with fusion. We suggest that this capacity could be a determinant in aminoglycoside toxicity. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{bactericidal}} {{efficacy of}} amikacin, <b>isepamicin</b> and netilmicin was studied against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens over a treatment period of 30 h using two one-compartment in-vitro models with differently designed culture compartments. High bacterial inocula {{were exposed to}} fluctuating drug concentrations, simulating human serum concentrations (t½ = 2 h) during clinical treatment. The same daily dose was administered as 1 h infusions given every 8 h or every 24 h, resulting in peak concentrations of 8 and 24 mg/l for netilmicin, and 24 and 72 mg/l for amikacin and <b>isepamicin,</b> respectively. Once-daily dosing was more bactericidal during initial treatment in the in-vitro models (P 99 · 9 % reduction of cfu) after 24 h treatment against S. marcescens compared with P. aeruginosa (P < 0 · 01). All nine regimens providing peaks of {{at least four times}} the MIC were bactericidal against S. marcescens after 24 h exposure. In contrast, a bactericidal effect against P. aeruginosa occurred only during two of six experiments with peaks of four to nine times the MIC. Similar results were obtained in both in-vitro models of infection. These data suggest insufficient intrinsic activity of the aminoglycosides studied for single drug treatment of P. aeruginosa in the absence of host-defence mechanism...|$|E

To achieve parity with agar dilution tests, cation-adjusted broth should contain 20 to 25 mg of calcium and 10 to 12. 5 mg of magnesium per liter rather than the 50 - and 25 -mg/liter supplements recommended previously. For quality control of tests with contemporary media, MIC control limits should be adjusted by lowering the current MIC limits by at least 1 doubling-dilution interval...|$|E
40|$|Butirosin {{is unique}} among the {{naturally}} occurring aminoglycosides, having a substituted amino group at position 1 (N 1) of the 2 -deoxystreptamine ring with an (S) - 4 -amino- 2 -hydroxybutyrate (AHB) group. While bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides can be ascribed chiefly to drug inactivation by plasmid-encoded aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, {{the presence of}} an AHB group protects the aminoglycoside from binding to many resistance enzymes, and hence, the antibiotic retains its bactericidal properties. Consequently, several semisynthetic N 1 -substituted aminoglycosides, such as amikacin, <b>isepamicin,</b> and netilmicin, were developed. Unfortunately, butirosin, amikacin, and <b>isepamicin</b> are not resistant to inactivation by 3 ′-aminoglycoside O-phosphotransferase type IIIa [APH(3 ′) -IIIa]. We report here the crystal structure of APH(3 ′) -IIIa in complex with an ATP analog, AMPPNP [adenosine 5 ′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate], and butirosin A to 2. 4 -Å resolution. The structure shows that butirosin A binds to the enzyme in a manner analogous to other 4, 5 -disubstituted aminoglycosides, and the flexible antibiotic-binding loop is key to the accommodation of structurally diverse substrates. Based on the crystal structure, we have also constructed a model of APH(3 ′) -IIIa in complex with amikacin, a commonly used semisynthetic N 1 -substituted 4, 6 -disubstituted aminoglycoside. Together, these results suggest a strategy to further derivatize the AHB group in order to generate new aminoglycoside derivatives that can elude inactivation by resistance enzymes while maintaining their ability to bind to the ribosomal A site...|$|E

40|$|Three {{clinical}} isolates, Enterobacter cloacae EC 1562 and EC 1563 and Citrobacter freundii CFr 564, displayed an aminoglycoside resistance profile {{evocative of}} low-level 6 ′-N acetyltransferase type II [AAC(6 ′) -II] production, which conferred reduced susceptibility to gentamicin {{but not to}} amikacin or <b>isepamicin.</b> Aminoglycoside acetyltransferase assays suggested the synthesis in the three strains of an AAC(6 ′) which acetylated amikacin practically {{as well as it}} acetylated gentamicin in vitro. Both compounds, however, as well as <b>isepamicin,</b> retained good bactericidal activity against the three strains. The aac genes were borne by conjugative plasmids (pLMM 562 and pLMM 564 of ca. 100 kb and pLMM 563 of ca. 20 kb). By PCR mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis, an aac(6 ′) -Ib gene was found in each strain upstream of an ant(3 ") -I gene in a sulI-type integron. The size of the AAC(6 ′) -Ib variant encoded by pLMM 562 and pLMM 564, AAC(6 ′) -Ib 7, was deduced to be 184 (or 177) amino acids long, whereas in pLMM 563 a 21 -bp duplication allowing the recruitment of a start codon resulted in the translation of a variant, AAC(6 ′) -Ib 8, of 196 amino acids, in agreement with size estimates obtained by Western blot analysis. Both variants had at position 119 a serine instead of the leucine typical for the AAC(6 ′) -Ib variants conferring resistance to amikacin. By using methods that predict the secondary structure, these two amino acids appear to condition an α-helical structure within a putative aminoglycoside binding domain of AAC(6 ′) -Ib variants...|$|E
