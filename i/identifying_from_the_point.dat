40|$|Abstract—One {{approach}} to robotic grasping is to compute hand configurations, including contact locations, which would maximize {{a variety of}} measures of grasp quality. There is evi-dence that human-guided robotic grasps exhibit orthogonality of the wrist as a key feature. Orthogonality of the hand to the object frame or surfaces is often included in state-of-the art grasp synthesis algorithms, but here we present a systematic study of the efficacy of orthogonality alone. The orthogonality-alone planner works with a surprisingly good success rate {{on a variety of}} physical objects using only a single exposure from a depth camera and no object models whatsoever. Principal axes of an object are <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> cloud, <b>the</b> approach angle is determined <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second principal axis, and the orientation of the hand is vertical <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first axis.

This condition can cause high morbidity and hinder quality of life. Its treatment is complex and often unsatisfactory, and prevention strategies may have limited effectiveness, if any. Thus, managing patients treated with BP may result in exposure of the practitioner to legal liability or malpractice claims: legal actions pursuant to BRONJ are reported to be underway on three continents. Nonetheless, the attribution of liability, if any, is a complex process requiring, {{on the basis of}} current knowledge, a robust and pragmatic approach to the facts, which must be <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of the time, place and individuals involved.

40|$|The {{adequacy}} of Stribeck curves for {{the characterization of}} the lubricity of biodiesels, B 20 blends and diesel fuel is demonstrated. Ball-on-disk tests in the speed range 2 - 1570 mm/s were performed to obtain the Stribeck plots {{and the results are}} compared to those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> conventional HFRR (high frequency reciprocating rig) ball-on-disk method (ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D 6079). Contrarily to the HFRR method, in the Stribeck tests very clear ball wear marks are seen without significant wear of the flat counterbody. These characteristics provide more confidence in the lubricity assessment of fuels. Moreover, in the Stribeck method higher lubricity at 60 degrees C is revealed for all biodiesels and the respective blends, related to the formation of protective oxide tribolayers. When evaluated by the HFRR test method, such temperature effect on the lubricity performance is not <b>identified.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of the energy loss of the system, or friction response, lubricity is also better depicted by the Stribeck test method. The friction coefficient plots reveal that the major difference among the fuels occurs in the low velocity range, or in the start stop stage of moving components, where the poorest lubricity is attained with the neat diesel fuel and the best lubricity with the animal fat biodiesel.

40|$|Building change {{detection}} {{is useful}} for land management, disaster assessment, illegal building identification, urban growth monitoring, and geographic information database updating. This study proposes an automatic method that applies object-based analysis to multi-temporal point cloud data to detect building changes. The aim of this building change detection method is to identify areas that have changed and to obtain from-to information. In this method, the data are first preprocessed to generate two sets of digital surface models (DSMs), digital elevation models, and normalized DSMs from registered old and new point cloud data. Thereafter, {{on the basis of}} differential DSM, candidates for changed building objects are <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> in <b>the</b> smooth areas by using a connected component analysis technique. The random sample consensus fitting algorithm is then used to distinguish the true changed buildings <b>from</b> trees. <b>The</b> changed building objects are classified as “newly built”, “taller”, “demolished” or “lower” by using rule-based analysis. Finally, a test data set consisting of many buildings of different types in an 8. 5 km 2 area is selected for the experiment. In the test data set, the method correctly detects 97. 8 % of buildings larger than 50 m 2. The accuracy of the method is 91. 2 %.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (l. 70). This {{research project}} tackles "Merger", a topic which is nowadays widely {{spread in the}} media and throughout some nations. Merger is really wide topic because it can take place between companies, banks, financial institutions or it can be a combination of all. In addition, it can be between institutions in the same country or overseas. Therefore, the research focused on one specific area, the bank merger activity which is actually taking place in an emerging markets Lebanon. To conduct this study, both primary (interviews, newspapers, magazines and Central Bank publications), and secondary sources (books, dictionaries) were used. The project is an in-depth study of merger; mainly, its motives, types and directions. It analyses the banking sector in Lebanon, its development throughout three episodes pre-war, war and post war, as well as its unique characteristics and suggests the need for banks to merge in order to form strong units that are more effective and efficient and are able to face the challenges of the future. In order to support the need for merger a real life case study was discussed: the merger between Banque Beyrouth pour Ie Commerce and Security Bank. The motives behind merger were <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of each bank, the merger process was described and at the financial statements of both banks were analyzed before and after merger in order to assess the outcome of this merger. However, one case study is not enough to generalize the conclusions derived and further studies needs to be conducted in order to assess merger and to analyze its effect on the future performance of banks. 1 bound copy: 80 leaves; tables.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this research}} is a set of novel insights on the interplay of knowledge assets during decision making. Knowledge is conceptualised as a dynamic resource. Its value {{is a function of the}} contribution it makes relative to other knowledge stock at a <b>point</b> of application. <b>The</b> information flows can renew the resource, and the influence of power makes the knowledge development process subject to reconciliation of local interests. The focus on dynamics of knowledge development through a set of value-adding processes also moves <b>the</b> analysis away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rational and political perspectives of knowledge in decision making. This offers an alternative view on how the value of knowledge can be assessed and understood. The research proposes how the decision making process could be a useful mechanism for the development of dynamic capabilities. <b>The</b> findings stem <b>from</b> <b>the</b> view of knowledge developed in this research as a knowledge capsule comprised of two or three knowledge assets which can draw upon two other types of knowledge <b>from</b> outside <b>the</b> decision process. The analysis relies on two in-depth strategic decision case studies and suggests that the value of knowledge can be <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at which <b>the</b> central decision is generated. The value of each interplay can be assessed in a 'transactional' space where three types of knowledge 'meet'. Decision making is a knowledge-creating activity. The interplay of knowledge assets is a source of value in decision making and, this thesis argues, the basis of heterogeneity of this strategic asset between organisations. Power impacts the {{contribution of}} knowledge assets and through application is redistributed during the decision making process. As knowledge stocks interplay, some knowledge is attuning and some advancing the work in decision episodes. The value can be identified by assessing the outcomes of interplay such as insights and decisions.

40|$|Abstract. In {{constant}} {{strain rate}} tests, {{the occurrence of}} dynamic recrystallization (DRX) is traditionally <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> presence of stress peaks in flow curves. However, not all materials display well-defined peaks when tested under these conditions. It is shown that the onset of DRX can also be <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inflection <b>point</b> on <b>the</b> strain hardening rate (= /) versus flow stress () curve. In this paper, the hot compression curves can be described by an equation that fits the experimental − data <b>from</b> zero to <b>the</b> peak stress. An appropriate third order equation was fitted to the strain hardening data. The {{results show that the}} critical stress at initiation σ	 = − / 3 where A and B are coefficients of the third order equation. It is evident that this value depends on the deformation conditions. The stress–strain curve was then normalized with respect to the peak stress, leading to a normalized value of the critical stress (uc) equal to 	 = σ	/ = − / 3. Here and are coefficients of the normalized third order equation. This value is constant and independent of the deformation conditions...|$|R

An advantage of the standstill test is that parameter identification in both the direct and quadrature axes can be conducted separately. In addition these tests are relatively simple and inexpensive. Several solutions for generating the sinusoidal waveform in either hardware or software form were contemplated.

Also knowing the branching pattern of the middle cerebral artery will help the radiologists in interpreting the cranial magnetic resonance angiographies. The aim of this study was to study the variation of the branching pattern of middle cerebral artery among Tanzanian cadavers, and postmortern specimens. In this study the branching pattern of the middle cerebral artery were studied among 70 human cadavers at MNH and dissection rooms found in medical schools in Dar es Salaam and Ifakara.

40|$|Presentation to the Disability Studies Conference, Lancaster University, September 7 - 9, 2010. Inclusive {{education}} {{may be defined}} as a process of identifying any barriers within and around the school that hinder learning, and reducing or removing these barriers as part of a wider strategy to promote an inclusive society. Deaf bilingual practices are consistent with more inclusive and equitable practices in the education of Deaf children; however, the practice of Deaf bilingual programmes varies across the countries and within societies and it seems that there remain gross imbalances throughout the regions of the world. Spain has historically played a very active role in the provision of education for Deaf people, and has also been one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN, 2006) and develop a National Action Plan of Human Rights (2008) within the European context. This paper presents a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis undertaken to <b>identify,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view and participation of insiders, those internal and external factors around current existing Deaf bilingual practices in Spain which promote or prevent the processes through which more inclusive educational provision for Deaf children can be successfully implemented and good practice promoted. 11 schools with leading Deaf bilingual initiatives for Deaf children and a regional department of education were selected to conduct the SWOT analysis facilitated through the nominal group technique. A Facilitation Team – comprising three university researchers and two members (one of them Deaf) of the Spanish National Confederation of Deaf People – worked together throughout all the phases of the study using a participatory approach to research. 17 Deaf and hearing professionals participated in the analysis. To enable full access and on-going participation of Deaf participants, Spanish Sign Language translations and interpreting were used throughout the whole process. Our main conclusion is that awareness and understanding of these four internal and external inter-related factors are essential to assist educational communities to understand, practice and review ways of developing more inclusive practices within the current Deaf bilingual education school experiences in Spain, and can provide <b>the</b> starting <b>point</b> upon which policy-making and further research could be built. The study also highlights the importance of moving to a more participatory approach to {{research in the area of}} education of d/Deaf children and explores ways in which strategic planning can provide a practical and pragmatic tool for understanding and decision-making in Deaf bilingual education.

40|$|Because of {{its great}} size, the Antarctic Ice Sheet {{represents}} a considerable fresh water resource. Furthermore, it {{interacts with the}} global climate and its old ice contains information on past climate. Past and ongoing research indicates that several polar snow properties can be mapped by their microwave signature. Microwave radiation has an advantage over visible and infrared radiation {{in its ability to}} sense snow surface conditions down to some depth, even through clouds. The satellite data that we used for this study came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (aboard the satellite Nimbus 7, 1978 - 86). As a first step, we compared ground data with the SMMR data. The polarization differences are affected by the stratification of snow (number and nature of layers); large polarization ratios correspond to strong stratification, mainly for the lower frequencies. The frequency gradients are linked to the grain sizes as determined from detailed stratigraphies. As a second step, we develop a microwave snow emissivity model. The model is based on the solution of Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equations through strong fluctuation theory (A. STOGRYN; IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., GE- 24 (2), 220, 1986). A numerical solution is required when snow characteristics change with depth. The snow is considered isothermal with horizontal stratification, isotropic inside each stratum, and with smooth interfaces. We first carried out a sensitivity study. As observed through the comparison SMMR data-ground measurements, when the number of layers over the two first meters increases, the polarization difference increases : the lower the frequency, the higher the difference (A. SURDYK and M. FILY; Ann. Glaciol., 17, 161, 1993). Then simulated results were used to help with the interpretation of SMMR data. The spatial distribution of the microwave signatures over Antarctica reveals three areas with typical spectral signatures. These areas are <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of snow characteristics through a ground data set (A. SURDYK and M. FILY; Ann. Glaciol., 17, 161, 1993). As expected, the model reproduces well the effect of the stratification on the observed polarization differences (A. SURDYK and M. FILY; J. Geophys. Res., 100 (C 5), 8837, 1995). The strong gradient of emissivity versus frequency observed on one of the test sites is not completely understood. Depth hoar layers were found at that place. Depth hoar characterized by faceted and cup-shaped, coarse snow grains, seem to have a particular scattering behavior compared with that of the usual grains. When those coarse grains are replaced by fine grains, the model results are closer to the measured data. The presence of crusts, the roughness at the snow-ice interfaces, and crystal orientation may also have significant effects. Details about these results will be found in A. SURDYK and M. FILY (J. Geophys. Res., 100 (C 5), 8837, 1995) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{investigates the}} effects of {{circumferential}} casing grooves on stall flow characteristics of a transonic axial compressor. Numerical analysis is conducted by solving three-dimensional steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the shear stress transport turbulence model. The results of flow analysis for an axial compressor with smooth casing are validated in comparison with experimental data for the pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency. The numerical stall inception <b>point</b> is <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last converged <b>point</b> by convergence criteria, and the stall margin is predicted numerically. The peak adiabatic efficiency point is also obtained by reducing the normalized mass flow in the high mass flow region. In order to {{explore the influence of}} number of the circumferential casing grooves on the performance of the compressor, the stall margins and peak adiabatic efficiencies are evaluated compared to the case smooth casing. The stability of the axial compressor with circumferential casing grooves is found to be sensitively influenced by the number of grooves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} {{autonomous}} {{systems in the}} framework of artificial chemistries. More precisely, we focus on autopoietic principles, along with some thermodynamic considerations inspired by the concept of dissipative structure. We begin with a short review of existing works on computational autopoiesis in artificial chemistries, and <b>identify</b> their limitations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of the concept of dissipative structures. As a result, a new artificial chemistry system is proposed that accounts for more life-like thermodynamic principles. The model is based on an extension of lattice molecular systems, in which reaction rules are coupled with physical attractive/repulsive behavior. We design two different simulations, one is an abstract chemistry based on the RNA world, and the other one, inspired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lipid world hypothesis, tries to reproduce amphiphilic assemblies formation. We then conclude with some future extensions of the proposed model, and especially the merging of the two systems with the aim to create a functional protocell capable to reproduce. We also examine some issues concerning open-ended evolution in this model. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{something}} that is very important in our lives and is always present and ready to help but we usually don't pay our attention to it. Those are words and what has already been said really happens, but if we try to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> words <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of any science and using the appropriate methods, we would discover different criteria and characteristics of words. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of linguistics, words are basic units to some degree, <b>the</b> smallest, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of view of meaning, abstract. But basically, they are minimal free units with their structure and they express meaning. Words are parts of a language so the identification and the description of them cannot be done without a short review of what is language. The same happens with English words. In order to get a precise idea about English words, both diachronic and synchronic methods are applied. One of the biggest sources of producing new words in English, words formation process is involved, as an example; a process of prefixation is described. The main goal of the paper is to reveal some new ideas about English words and represent a new approach to words in the process of learning English as a foreign language...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{e-learning}} for {{on-the-job training}} has grown exponentially {{in the last}} decade due to it being accepted by people in charge of businesses. Few papers have explored virtual training <b>from</b> <b>the</b> workers’ standpoint, that is, the perception they have about the different training methodologies (face-to-face vs. virtual) and the attitudes they have towards on-the-job learning. Training, in this context, is an investment for both the two participating agents: businesses and workers. It seems logical that knowing the perceptions and attitudes shown by the targets of the training is, at least, as important as knowing the advantages for the companies. To analyse workers’ perceptions and attitudes we conducted an online survey of 2, 000 employees of the leading European savings bank, CaixaBank ([URL] on training habits, perceptions, motivations, and disincentives of undertaking face-to-face or online instruction. The results reveal that workers perceive e-learning as a more flexible and up-to-date training methodology. On the other hand, face-to-face training continues to be perceived as a more motivating methodology compared to virtuality and with better explanations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> course trainers. As regards motivations given by the workers when it comes to training, there are three main groups of attitudes: those which are more affective and social, those which reveal poor adaptability or fear of the new training requirements, and, finally, those linked to the knowledge society. Such results state that while the benefits of distance methodology can be clearly <b>identified</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> company’s <b>point</b> of view (i. e., as a flexible and efficient methodology to develop the employees’ skills and knowledge), <b>from</b> <b>the</b> employees’ standpoint, the advantages of virtual training are not so clear and depend to a great extent on their attitude towards the use of virtuality...|$|R
