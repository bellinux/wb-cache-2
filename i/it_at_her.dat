5|$|Kesselring {{resumed his}} work on {{a history of the}} war that he was writing for the US Army's Historical Division. This effort, working under the {{direction}} of Generaloberst Franz Halder in 1946, brought together a number of German generals for the purpose of producing historical studies of the war, including Gotthard Heinrici, Heinz Guderian, Lothar Rendulic, Hasso von Manteuffel and Georg von Küchler. Kesselring contributed studies of the war in Italy and North Africa and the problems faced by the German high command. Kesselring also worked secretly on his memoirs. The manuscript was smuggled out by Irmgard Horn-Kesselring, Rainer's mother, who typed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> home.|$|E
5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E
25|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{got into}} her pickup truck and {{attempted}} to leave the motel. Rosario Garza, a motel staff member, saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later thought {{that she had been}} on her way to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr., and others waiting for Selena to arrive for a planned recording session. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer. An officer emerged from the cruiser, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar {{to get out of the}} truck. Saldívar did not comply. Instead, she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars; her truck was then blocked by the police cruiser. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team, and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit, were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas commented that the event was reminiscent of O. J. Simpson's threatened suicide ten months earlier.|$|E
500|$|... "Artpop" [...] {{was used}} in a [...] "not safe for work" [...] video for the album, which {{featured}} Gaga in various bizarre attires and a montage of the different promotional material leading to the release. Gaga had premiered [...] "Artpop" [...] during her iTunes Festival performance of tracks from the album. She subsequently performed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> ArtRave party, on the Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular on ABC with singer Elton John and most recently on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.|$|E

500|$|Music {{critics were}} divided about the song. Reviewers praised its {{production}} and innovative composition but criticized its lyrics, which {{used the word}} [...] "burqa" [...] in a sexual manner. [...] "Aura" [...] was performed live during Gaga's headlining iTunes Festival, and it {{was used in the}} trailer for Robert Rodriguez's Machete Kills (in which the singer co-stars). She also performed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> ArtRave promotional event, the Jingle Bell Ball, South by Southwest and the 2014 [...] tour. The song entered the US Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart based on streaming activity.|$|E
500|$|Platten {{performed}} the song live during {{a number of}} public appearances, including on the July 1, 2016 episode of the Today Show, where she sang during their promotional [...] "July 4 Weekend" [...] concert series. The singer also gave a rendition of [...] "Fight Song" [...] and [...] "Stand by You" [...] during the event. Platten also performed [...] "Better Place" [...] during various summer concerts in 2016, including at a stop in Indianapolis, Indiana, where she told the crowd that she had performed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sister's wedding two months prior.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Ruth Hogben and Andrea Gelardin, and continues from where the video for previous single, [...] "Perfect Illusion", had ended. It shows Gaga singing in a white studio, and also her in a desert breaking down and finally being rescued by her friends. In order to promote [...] "Million Reasons", the singer performed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> Dive Bar Tour (2016), multiple television appearances, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016, the Super Bowl LI halftime show and the 2017 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. It also serves as the encore to Gaga's ongoing Joanne World Tour (2017–2018). Cover versions of the song were recorded by singer Kelsea Ballerini, Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Phish's Trey Anastasio.|$|E
5000|$|...

500|$|Marco {{was later}} {{killed in a}} bush fire disaster. Describing the filming process, Blair stated: [...] "Shooting the scenes for the bush fire and {{everything}} surrounding it - the wedding - the funeral - was so draining. It was full on." [...] Blair had to film scenes involving Carmella singing at Marco's funeral, which she deemed [...] "close to home" [...] because she had done <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> grandmother's funeral. She found it distressing, as they filmed in a real graveyard. She had previously been reluctant to sing on-screen but felt it was justified for Marco's funeral. Blair commented on Carmella's repetitive bad luck, stating: [...] "She's gone through so much already, just {{to get to this}} point. This should really be a happy time for her, but it's not." [...] After all the hurdles she faced, Carmella became a stronger person. Blair said it saw her become well-equipped to look after her child.|$|E
500|$|Kurt, Mercedes (Amber Riley), Artie (Kevin McHale), and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) {{are upset}} over not being {{included}} on the list, while Brittany (Heather Morris) is puzzled at not being listed among the top three, given that she has made out with everyone in the school: boys, girls, and the janitor. They perform a rendition of [...] "U Can't Touch This" [...] {{in the school library}} to cause a disruption in the hope of earning a bad reputation, but their plan backfires when the librarian asks them to perform <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> church's Sunday service. Next, Kurt confesses to Sue that {{he is the one who}} stole her video, expecting to be punished and also gain a more dangerous reputation. Instead, she thanks him, having recently been contacted by Olivia Newton-John, who had seen Sue's video and requested her help remaking the [...] "Physical" [...] video. The song's re-release gains Sue a position in the top 700 recording artists, which ends the ridicule of her colleagues. She donates her share of the profits to her sister's residential care facility.|$|E
500|$|On {{one visit}} to Poe's home in January 1846, Ellet {{allegedly}} observed letters from Osgood, shown {{to her by}} Poe's wife Virginia, and subsequently advised Osgood to ask for their return, implying to Osgood that they were an indiscretion. On behalf of Osgood, Margaret Fuller and Anne Lynch Botta asked Poe to return the letters. Poe, angered by their interference, suggested that Ellet had better [...] "look after her own letters". One such letter, written in German, asked Poe to [...] "call for <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> residence this evening", a phrase presumably meant to be seductive, though Poe either ignored it or did not understand its meaning. He then gathered up these letters from Ellet and left them at her house. Despite her letters having been returned, Ellet asked her brother [...] "to demand of me the letters". Her brother, Colonel William Lummis, {{did not believe that}} Poe had already returned them and threatened to kill him. In order to defend himself, Poe requested a pistol from Thomas Dunn English, who did not believe that Ellet ever sent Poe any letters.|$|E
50|$|Lady Amherst's {{pheasant}} {{was named}} after his first wife; <b>it</b> was <b>at</b> <b>her</b> instigation that the species was introduced from Asia to Bedfordshire. The genus Amherstia, a Burmese flowering tree, is also named after her.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Mayfield, habitually mystified <b>at</b> <b>her</b> daughter's moods, said no more. She, however, {{fulfilled}} {{her duty}} conscientiously by rising, throwing a wrap over the young girl, tucking <b>it</b> in <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet, and having, as it were, drawn a charitable veil over her peculiarities, left her alone.|$|R
50|$|Mårbacka is now kept as a {{memorial}} estate, {{as a result of}} the author writing in her testament that Mårbacka should be preserved and shown to the public in the condition <b>it</b> was <b>at</b> <b>her</b> death.|$|R
500|$|Anastasia's daring {{occasionally}} {{exceeded the}} limits of acceptable behavior. [...] "She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius", said Gleb Botkin, son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that [...] "Anastasia was nasty {{to the point of}} being evil", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.|$|E
2500|$|Ironically, {{although}} Ignatz {{seems to}} generally dislike Krazy, one strip shows his ancestor, Mark Antony Mouse, {{fall in love}} with Krazy's ancestor, an Egyptian cat princess (calling her his [...] "Star of the Nile"), and pay a sculptor to carve a brick with a love message. When he throws <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> he is arrested, but she announces her love for him, and from that day on, he throws bricks at her to show his love for her (which would explain why Krazy believes that Ignatz throwing bricks is a sign of love). In another strip, Krazy kisses a sleeping Ignatz, and hearts appear above the mouse's head.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth, meanwhile, rehearsed for the {{upcoming}} day with her maids of honour, a sheet used {{in place of the}} velvet train and an arrangement of chairs standing in for the carriage. So that she could become accustomed to its feel and weight, the Queen also wore the Imperial State Crown while she went about her daily business, sporting <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> desk, at tea and while reading the newspaper. Elizabeth took part in two full rehearsals at Westminster Abbey, on 22 and 29 May, though other sources assert that the Queen attended either [...] "several" [...] rehearsals or one. The Duchess of Norfolk usually stood in for the Queen at rehearsals.|$|E

After two minutes' grave deliberation, she asked, [...] "And why especially girls, mother?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Hale began {{painting}} her self-portrait in 1884, {{working on}} <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> family's home in Roxbury, Massachusetts and at their summer home in Matunuck, Rhode Island. The painting, Self-Portrait, depicts Hale gazing confidently at the viewer {{with her right}} hand dangling slightly over the chair. Dressed in all black, Hale wears a dress with buttons and a fur collar, covered by a loose jacket. Peeking out of a round black hat are Hale's bangs, {{which at the time}} were praised as a youthful hairstyle but could also connote promiscuity. Hale seems to be making a fashion statement with her bangs, choice of costume, and the ostrich-feather fan that she holds. When Hale first showed the painting to her instructors in 1885, artist Bouguereau significantly criticized the size and position of the hand and encouraged Hale to make it [...] "prettier". However, Hale did not make any of the suggested changes to the hand, refusing to conform her work to the idealized, academic notions of beauty. The compositional weight of her hand is also notable because it was extremely rare for artists of any gender to portray themselves looking directly at the viewer without any tools to identify their profession.|$|E
2500|$|Still in January, {{she gave}} a talk for the Independent Penwomen's Club, {{as well as at}} a private home. A week later {{she gave a}} talk for the Arché club. In February she was {{scheduled}} for a short series of talks in Goshen, Indiana. A week later a retired friend from the Chicago Daily Tribune committed suicide, naming her as one to receive the news of <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> request. She gave a series of lectures at the Masonic Temple, on variations of [...] "The Universal Ministry" [...] subjects. Still she kept up individual talks for the Arché club, one for a benefit, as February drew to a close and another as March opened. Minding of the pending divorce in Kansas City, instead articles noted tickets for a talk of hers there were sold starting mid-March. Meanwhile, she launched another series of talks for the Arché club, a talk on color, and a week later in Goshen, Indiana again, going back to Chicago the next day for a talk. At the beginning of April, Ford was in Kansas City giving her series of talks including the [...] "Holy Grail" [...] and other recent topics, as well as receptions held in her honor, and individual talks for a benefit, and otherwise. She gave her last talk, and notes of her talks were reported, while she went back to Chicago.|$|E
2500|$|Star Sapphire {{appears in}} episodes of Justice League, voiced by Olivia d'Abo in her natural English accent. She {{receives}} her {{power from the}} stone in her mask which gives her Green Lantern-like abilities that enable her to form shields, create energy constructs, fire power blasts and create a full-body field that enables her to fly and travel through deep space. While her origins are never elaborated upon of which version she's based on, the show's creators have confirmed she {{is intended to be}} Carol Ferris. In the episode [...] "Injustice For All", Star Sapphire is invited to join Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang to plot the destruction of the Justice League. She is initially repelled by the idea of working with [...] "common criminals" [...] but seems to warm to {{the amount of money that}} Luthor promises each of them (which also keeps her from quitting after their initial plan fails). In the Injustice Gang's final battle with the Justice League, she is defeated by Green Lantern. In the episode [...] "Fury", Star Sapphire is later recruited to the Injustice Gang's second incarnation led by Aresia to destroy the men of the world. When Aresia reveals the group's agenda, she is initially shocked, but ultimately joins enthusiastically. [...] While aligned with this Injustice Gang, she successfully tricks Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl into believing that she still wants to live in a world with men by luring the two women into a trap that subdues both them and Hippolyta. Later on, she and Aresia, along with Tsukuri, flee with Hippolyta aboard Aresia's plane. Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl pursue them and she is knocked out of the fight when Wonder Woman wrenches one of the plane's laser cannons free from its housing and hurls <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from behind which plunges her into the sea. In the episode [...] "Hereafter", Star Sapphire is among the several supervillains from the mayhem that reigns in Metropolis shortly after Superman's supposed death at the hands of a group of supervillains but is again defeated by Green Lantern.|$|E
