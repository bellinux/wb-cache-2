A well-known {{example of this is}} the Miller effect, in which an unavoidable <b>feedback</b> <b>capacitance</b> appears increased (i.e. its impedance appears reduced) by negative feedback. One popular case where this is done deliberately is the Miller compensation technique for providing a low-frequency pole inside an integrated circuit. To minimize the size of the necessary capacitor, it is placed between the input and an output which swings in the opposite direction. This bootstrapping makes it act like a larger capacitor to ground.|$|E

40|$|The {{benefits}} of using source field plate (FPS) in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs {{to reduce the}} phase distortion in efficient power amplifiers (PAs) is demonstrated in this contribution. The link between phase distortion of a PA and the drain - to - gate <b>feedback</b> parasitic <b>capacitance</b> of the transistor is shown.

50|$|The major {{advantage}} of this circuit arrangement stems from {{the placement of the}} upper field-effect transistor (FET) as the load of the input (lower) FET's output terminal (drain). Because at operating frequencies the upper FET's gate is effectively grounded, the upper FET's source voltage (and therefore the input transistor's drain) is held at nearly constant voltage during operation. In other words, the upper FET exhibits a low input resistance to the lower FET, making the voltage gain of the lower FET very small, which dramatically reduces the Miller <b>feedback</b> <b>capacitance</b> from the lower FET's drain to gate. This loss of voltage gain is recovered by the upper FET. Thus, the upper transistor permits the lower FET to operate with minimal negative (Miller) feedback, improving its bandwidth.|$|E

Based on the new {{input matching}} method, reconfigurable SiGe low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) by varying shunt–shunt <b>feedback</b> <b>capacitance</b> are proposed. Two approaches are used to vary the shunt–shunt <b>feedback</b> <b>capacitance.</b> One approach is to switch between two different bias currents while {{the other is to}} use a series combination of a switch and a capacitor. Miniaturized fully monolithic reconfigurable SiGe LNAs without emitter degenerative inductors were realized by the above two approaches. The reconfigurable SiGe LNA achieved by switching bias currents only occupies a very small area of 355 m 155 m, excluding measurement pads. This LNA achieves an input return losses (11) of 27. 6 dB, a voltage gain () of 19. 8 dB, and a noise figure (NF) of 3. 18 dB for 2. 4 -GHz band when biased at a current of 3. 8 mA and can be reconfigured to obtain = 204 20 3 dB, 11 =- 47. 1 /- 24. 6 dB and NF = 3 42 3 21 dB for 5. 2 / 5. 7 -GHz band when bias current is switched to 3 mA.

40|$|In this paper, a novel silicon RF {{vertical}} double-diffusion metal-oxide-semiconductor {{field effect}} transistor (VD-MOSFET) structure with a dummy-gate incorporated between the active gates is proposed. The dummy-gate functions as a field plate to minimize the drain-to-gate <b>feedback</b> <b>capacitance</b> C-rss and also to raise the device breakdown voltage. Therefore, for the same blocking voltage rating, the dummy-gate structure allows the MOSFET to have a shorter channel and a larger gate to drain overlap area to minimize the on-state resistance.

Experimental results show that with the dummy-gate a 51 % lower on the <b>feedback</b> <b>capacitance,</b> a 21 % lower on the on-state resistance, a 100 % increase in output resistance and a higher and linear transconductance are achieved.

40|$|Multi-band and {{multi-mode}} radios {{are becoming}} prevalent and {{necessary in order}} to provide optimal data rates across a network with a diverse and spotty landscape of coverage areas (3 G, HSPA, LTE, etc.). As the number of required bands and modes increases, the aggregate cost of discrete RF signal chains justi es the adoption of tunable solutions. Tunable fi lters are one of the pieces crucial to signal chain amalgamation. The main requirements for a tunable fi lter are high unloaded quality factor, wide tuning range, high tuning speed, high linearity, and small size. MEMS technology is the most promising in terms of tuning range, quality factor, linearity and size. In addition, a fi lter that maintains a constant passband bandwidth as the center frequency is tuned is preferred since the analog baseband processing circuitry tends to be tailored for a particular signal bandwidth. In this work, a novel design technique for tunable fi lters with controlled and predictable bandwidth variation is presented. The design technique is presented alongside an analysis and modeling method for predicting the final filter response during design optimization. The method is based on the well known coupling matrix model. In order to demonstrate the design and modeling technique, a novel coupling structure for stripline fi lters is presented that results in substantial improvements in coupling bandwidth variation over an octave tuning range when compared to combline and interdigitated coupled line fi lters. In order for a coupled resonator filter to produce an equal ripple Chebyshev response, each resonator of the fi lter must be tuned to precisely the same resonant frequency. Production tuned fi lters are routinely tuned in the lab and production environments by skilled technicians in order to compensate for manufacturing tolerances. However, integrated tunable filters cannot be tuned by traditional means since they are integrated into systems on circuit boards or inside front end modules. A fixed tuning table for all manufactured modules is inadequate since the required tuning accuracy exceeds the tolerance of the tuning elements. In this work, we develop tuning techniques for the automatic in-circuit tuning of tunable filters using scalar transmission measurement. The scalar transmission based techniques obviate the use of directional couplers. Techniques based on both swept and single frequency scalar transmission measurement are developed. The swept frequency technique, based on the Hilbert transform derived relative groupdelay, tunes both couplings and resonant frequencies while the single frequency technique only tunes the center frequency. High performance filters necessitate high resonator quality factors. Although fi lters are traditionally treated as passive devices, tunable fi lters need to be treated as active devices. Tuning elements invariably introduce non-linearities that limit the useful power handling of the tunable fi lter. RF MEMS devices have been a topic of intense research for many years for their promising characteristics of high quality factor and high power handling. Control and reliability issues have resulted in a shift from continuously tunable devices to discretely switched devices. However, fi lter tuning applications require fine resolution and therefore many bits for digital capacitor banks. An analog/digital hybrid tuning approach would enable the tuning range of a switched capacitor bank to be combined with the tuning resolution of an analog tunable capacitor.
