5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E

5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E

The initial yellow color characteristic of the pervanadyl ion + is replaced by the blue color of 2+, followed by the green color of 3+ and then the violet color of 2+.|$|E
