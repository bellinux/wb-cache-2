40|$|Poor {{marketing}} and distribution frequently waste opportunities provided by increased or diversified agricultural production There are many examples where farmers have produced higher yields or cultivated new crops at their own expense and risk but have not benefited from any increased income. Instead, they may have suffered financial loss from investing in higher inputs or labour. It {{is not surprising that}} farmers become disappointed and revert to less onerous and risky production strategies to meet local needs only. This limits their income and stifles the development of a rural economy. It also deprives the country of much-needed food for the cities and of products to export for foreign exchange. Many, governments have now recognized the need for improved marketing, distribution and exports. One particularly successful example is the Dominica Export Import Agency (DEXIA), which was set up by the Government of Dominica in July 1986. In less than three years it has achieved some dramatic results. DEXIA is responsible for issuing licences for the import of basic food commodities such as rice and sugar. So it controls imports, allowing local production to satisfy the domestic market first. However, DEXIA's main objective is to encourage, help and provide facilities for the private sector in Dominica to increase exports of vegetables, fruit, flowers and handicrafts. There are 20 - 25 commodities currently exported and DEXIA has prayed an important,sometimes crucial, role in finding or developing markets for them New markets Bananas are the main crop in Dominica; they are marketed through the Banana Marketing Corporation. Similarly, the bulk of coconut production is processed by Dominica Coconut Products, which manufactures a wide range of value-added coconut-based products including coconut oil and soaps. But green water nuts or jelly nuts, which previously were sold only locally, are now exported by a co-operative of growers which was formed originally to export plantains. DEXIA staff identified a market for jellynuts and plantains among expatriate Dominicans and other West Indians in the United Kingdom. The cooperative supplying this market now exports 16 times the value of plantains each fortnight that it exported in its early months of activity in 1986. Grapefruit and limes are two other long established crops In Dominica, yet new markets have been found for both crops and various products have been developed from limes to supplement the sale of fresh fruit. Mangoes, avocados and various root crops are also being exported in increasing quantities, and so are fresh flowers, herbs and spices (including ginger). DEXIA has worked in parallel with the existing cooperative of flower and ornamental growers to increase production of anthuriums, red <b>ginger</b> <b>lilies</b> and helleconia. New hybrid anthuriums have been introduced, and DEXIA has played a role in improving the quality of packaging. 20 point programme As a statutory government body, DEXIA works to fulfil its brief either by increasing exports in response to existing production or in response to new markets. Production-led export development is where existing crops are available and expansion of the market is sought to absorb surplus existing production. Market-led export development is where a new market is discovered, but either there is no existing production or existing production, does not match market requirements in terms of quality, quantity' or season of supply. Two examples where new markets were identified were red peppers and christophines, both of which have long been grown in Dominica. A visit by a senior DEXIA staff member to Canada established that the market there demanded the Scotch Bonnet variety of red peppers and white christophines. Until then, it was rare to find pure Scotch Bonnet peppers in Dominica and most of the christophines grown were of the green variety, so production was changed to match the special needs of the newly identified market. Marketing assistance In some countries statutory marketing organisations provide the only outlet for some or all products and therefore dominate the market and the farmers. In Dominica government policy is that commercial activity shall {{be in the hands of}} the private sector. Therefore DEXIA'S role is to assist the private sector by helping to form groups of growers; by serving individuals and groups with market intelligence; by advising on transport, credit sources and insurance requirements; and by helping groups to negotiate with shipping and air lines to obtain must favourable terms DEXIA may also test a new market by underwriting the supply of a pilot shipment but, once the needs of the market are established, it is left to the private sector to develop the new market opportunity. An example was when a company in France requested produce grown without ferdlizer or pesticides. Organically grown produce commands significantly higher prices and DEXIA, recognizing this as a potential new market, supplied a trial shipment of grapefruit, dried coconut and herbs. It will now be up to local growers to produce to the criteria specified and to supply further shipments. > is a new phrase for something that skilled traders have always recognised: in a competitive marketplace it is essential to recognize the precise needs of buyers and to judge how best your products can satisfy these needs. And, if a buyer demands a new product, this provides an opportunity for developing new lines of goods. Finally, high quality and efficient transportation remain as vital as ever.

40|$|In {{the past}} 2 decades, {{developing}} countries have expanded their export share to 24 % {{of the global}} cut flower market. But although there are clear opportunities for ACP producers, small-scale flower farmers still need help {{if they are to}} compete with the major growers. Three decades after the first forays by Southern producers into the global flower market, floriculture continues to hold out hope for ACP producers. In the North, demand for cut flowers has blossomed, especially in Europe, which imports more than 80 % of world output. Kenya remains the clear leader. Between 2001 and 2003, it increased its already substantial market share of EU exports by 17 %. But other ACP players have been quick to move into the field, including Cote d Ivoire, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and, most spectacularly, in Ethiopia, which chalked up a massive growth of 230 % in the same period The thorn on the rose The most recent newcomers are producers in the Caribbean and the Pacific. In Jamaica, a fledgling flower industry is supplying local markets and selling anthurium, orchids, <b>ginger</b> <b>lilies,</b> and heliconias to cruise ship passengers and to US customers via the internet. In the Pacific, a floriculture workshop supported by CTA in collaboration with the Institute for Research, Extension and Training in Agriculture (IRETA) has enabled one smallholder from the Solomon Islands to set up a blooming business. A number of ACP countries have comparative advantages for producing cut flowers, for reasons of land, labour, climate and preferential tariffs with the EU. But studies show that transport, storage, and distribution account for much of the value added, with production only netting 10 % of the sale price. Though rewarding, the future may not be as bright as the past. The growth of cut flower production now outstrips that of demand, and ACP countries face tough competition from Colombia and China. Prices of bulk cut flowers, such as carnations, alstroemeria and roses, are falling due to over-supply; those of exotic flowers are holding up better. Tropical flowers constitute a growing niche market and popular sellers include orchids, anthuriums, gingers, strelitzia (birds of paradise), heliconias and proteas. Consumer concerns Although it was only established in 1972, Kenya s horticulture industry now ranks fourth in terms of export revenues behind tea, coffee and tourism. But such rapid growth has hidden costs. Kenya has come under fire for poor labour conditions and high use of agrochemicals. Growing pressure from consumers in key importing countries such as Germany has forced the Kenya Flower Council to set up codes of conduct. FAO has sent integrated pest management experts to Nyeri, in central Kenya, to train the 5, 500 women s groups growing flowers there. Producers in the South face a number of hurdles. Flower growing is highly capital intensive and the stringent regulations in the international market such as minimum residue levels (MRLs) and other sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) regulations are often difficult to negotiate. With such a perishable product, packaging, cold storage and efficient transport links are crucial but costly pre-requisites, and Southern producers start from a disadvantage for reasons of distance. Dutch and German companies have moved into several ACP countries so they can have direct control over quality, distribution and marketing (see Spore 85). Most cut flower producers in the South are dependent on breeders in the North for their planting material, and have to pay royalties. A future in floriculture Given these constraints, {{it is not surprising that}} much of the flower industry is dominated by large concerns. According to Kenya s Horticultural Crops Development Authority, smallholder production has declined in the past 5 years. But in spite of the obstacles, some ACP producers are forging ahead to show there can be a future in floriculture. Uganda is using hydroponics, a technique which limits pests and disease, to grow flowers. In Zambia, small-scale farmer Peter Mtumbe has switched from maize to roses and is planning to double his operation. In Ethiopia, a family firm has become a major international supplier, while in Fiji women have been helped to market flowers for export to Hawaii and New Zealand (see Spore 117). South Africa has found a profitable market producing chrysanthemums. An export guide published by the Centre for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries (CBI) identifies summer flowers blooms produced during Europe s winter as a promising sector. Sales to supermarkets are also increasing, a trend which opens up opportunities for ACP producers, but also poses challenges. To take advantage of what most agree is still a flourishing market, more agricultural research is needed to develop local planting material and tackle pest and disease problems. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) is working to help Fiji flower growers deal with a fungus that is attacking red ginger (Alpinia purpurata). According to a recent CTA-supported study, producers need help with import requirements, distribution and marketing. One ingenious responses is a Flower Business Park, set up by a rose grower in Naivasha, Kenya, where flower growers pay rental fees for services ranging from land and water to on-site clearance for export documents. In the past 2 decades, developing countries have expanded their export share to 24 % of the global cut flower market. But although there are clear opportunities for ACP producers, small-scale flower farmers still need help if they are to compete [...] ...|$|E

In this study, we analyzed {{the relationship between the}} presence of the invasive white <b>ginger</b> <b>lily</b> (H. coronarium) and the functional trait indices of the aquatic insect assemblage in the littoral zone of a tropical reservoir. We sampled aquatic insects on the invaded and non-invaded banks of the reservoir and then analyzed the insect trait indices by estimating the Functional Dispersion (FDis), Functional Evenness (FEve) and the Functional Divergence (FDiv), as well as the Community level Weight-Mean traits (CWM). Finally, we compared these indices between invaded and non-invaded banks as well as their relationship with the abiotic variables, such as dissolved oxygen, pH, depth and water temperature. The result confirmed that the invaded banks had lower values of functional indices as well as dissolved oxygen. However, this abiotic variable was found to have no effect on the functional indices. In addition, the white <b>ginger</b> <b>lily</b> bank presented higher contribution of collector-gathering to predator-piercer groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT Invasive macrophytes {{threaten}} {{freshwater ecosystem}} biodiversity. We analyzed {{the impact of}} the invasive white <b>ginger</b> <b>lily</b> (Hedychium coronarium J.

We took aquatic insect samples in the littoral zone on four main vegetal profile banks: white ginger monotypic bank, forest partially invaded, native macrophyte monotypic bank and riparian forest. At each vegetal bank, we measured abiotic variables such as dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature and depth. We analyzed the aquatic insects through abundance, richness and Simpson diversity. We used the non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) analysis to analyze the spatial distribution of each assemblage, and Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) to verify differences amongst dissimilarity distances. Additionally, we analyzed the main taxa associated with invasive macrophytes through indicator species analyses using IndVal index. We observed that the invasive macrophyte banks presented higher abundance of associated specimens, as well as lower dissimilarity of aquatic insect assemblages. Additionally, invasive macrophytes shifted the water pH and littoral depth of reservoir banks. The IndVal index indicated eight aquatic insects as indicator species. Labrundinia unicolor Silva, 2013, Ablabesmyia depaulai Neubern, 2013 and Diastatops Rambur, 1842 were indicator species on banks. We concluded that invasion of white <b>ginger</b> <b>lily</b> caused loss of shallow littoral habitat and altered the pH of the surrounding water probably by high decomposition rate and high production of plant biomass.

Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, skunk cabbage, often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still be on the ground. As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the spathe that is 15-35 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly. As the spathe dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer.

40|$|If ACP {{countries}} are {{to improve their}} agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people. And, if full employment, food self-sufficiency and an exportable {{surplus of agricultural products}} are to be achieved, rural people must tee motivated. Owner ship of land is a powerful incentive, especially among young people who see no future for themselves as hired labour but who arewilling to work atbuilding up their own family holding. In the majority of Caribbean countries, widespread land ownership is very recent but, in several countries where land reform and re-distribution has begun, the benefits are already evident. For much of their modern history most Caribbean countries were developed as plantation economies, where the mass of the population worked as labour on monoculture estates owned by a minority of landowners or foreign-based companies. However, many foreign-based companies, and even some large local landowners, found the combination of poor prices for the main plantation crops (banana, citrus, cocoa, coconut and sugar) and rising labour costs and unrest in the 1970 s too problematic, and either sold up or abandoned their estates. As a result, governments gained possession and were provided with the opportunity to offer the land in small blocks to previously landless people. Privatization in Grenada In Grenada, by 1983 a succession of governments had acquired 36 estates, ranging from 17 - 105 hectares (40 - 250 acres). In 1986 it was decided by the Government to 'divest' these estates: to divide them into economically viable units and to offer them for private ownership. In common with the majority of islands in the Caribbean, Grenada has a very steep terrain so at divestment, farmers were encouraged to continue to grow one of the major crops - banana, cocoa and nutmeg but to diversify by growing other crops for food and for sale. In order to do this without encouraging erosion, a programme of soil and water conservation was started in which the farmers were involved. With FAO technical assistance, settlers were helped to build bench terraces, of eyebrow terraces, access roads and dams. A wide range of fruit trees was planted, while leucaena and Honduran Pine were planted on the steepest land as conservation forest The idea was to provide improved income, long-term security and to involve the new settlers in sustainable production techniques. Considerable progress has been made: people in Grenada are increasingly aware of the need for food self-sufficiency and import-substitution; more locally produced foods are available in markets and for the thriving tourist industry; and surplus fruit is processed for jams, jellies and confectionery. There has been a deliberate policy to choose young people as new settlers and {{there is no shortage of}} applicants: there are 30 - 40 applicants for each farm that becomes available, of whom 80 %- 90 % are in the 25 - 30 age group. Dominica diversifies Similar success has been achieved in Dominica, where the main plantation crops were banana and limes. Again, these remain the major crops on the small farms that have been carved from the big estates. Where banana still offers a good return, some far' mers continue to specialize in the crop, but others have diversified into vegetables and tubers for the local market, ginger for export and also flowers such as <b>ginger</b> <b>lily.</b> In the drier south of the island limes were and remain the major crop but, because of the depressed price over several years, farmers settled here have diversified and grow passion fruit, Aloe vera and forage grasses for feeding to one or two milk cows and 10 - 15 sheep and goats. Some farmers are also keeping one or two breeding pigs. However, land redistribution is seldom sufficient when carried out in isolation, so in Grenada and Dominica, new farmers have been provided with technical advice and assistance with marketing their crops. In Dominica the marketing of new crops has been well developed through the Dominican Export and Import Agency, DEXIA (See Spore N 20). There is a processing facility for limes on the island and a factory for coconut products, such as oil and soap. Aloe vera, a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives on dry, porous soils, is purchased by the Windward Island Aloe Company and is used in a wide range of cosmetics and body-care products. All these marketing intitiatives have resulted in firm markets, increased local employment and added value to products, to the benefit of farmers and the national economy. Integrated development Credit has also played an important role in developing the small-farmer economy in Dominica, as has the construction of feeder roads into previously inaccesible parts of the island. The United Nations lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development has assisted by providing funds for credit while IFAD and the European Development Fund have financed access roads. It is clearly evident that without an integrated approach of technical advice, credit, availability of inputs, access roads and marketing, land redistribution alone would not have had the desired impact and might even have resulted in stagnant production, frustration and a decline in standards of soil and water conservation. If ACP {{countries are}} to improve their agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people.

40|$|Abstract only availableMonocotyledons or monocots {{are one of}} {{two groups}} of {{angiosperms}} that comprise ca. 60, 000 species, 92 families, and 12 orders. Exemplary monocots include agaves, grasses, sedges, bromeliads, palms, <b>gingers,</b> orchids, irises, <b>lilies,</b> yams, pondweeds, and aroids. Even the most comprehensive evolutionary phylogenetic studies leave numerous relationships unresolved and inadequately supported. Thus, various questions remain for monocots in regards to their origin, phylogeny, patterns of morphological divergence, geographic diversification, and ecological radiation. To address these questions, we will create new nuclear monocot multigene phylogenies and compare them to previously established chloroplast/mitochondrial multigene phylogenies. Since nuclear and plastid genes have different patterns of inheritance, we will analyze conflicts and sources of incongruence of gene trees before combining all the data into a consensus phylogeny. After tissue collections, DNA/RNA extractions, and synthesizing cDNA from taxa across 39 families of monocots, I will utilize conserved low copy nuclear genes generated by our lab to construct a nuclear multigene phylogeny. In previous analyses, we identified 13 challenging nodes found in a phylogeny of 125 monocots based on several chloroplast and mitochondrial plastid genes chloroplasts. Our primary experimental approach is to generate nuclear multigene phylogenies from sequence data to resolve these 13 ambiguous nodes. We have over 100 nuclear gene primers available to screen to find phylogenetic informative variation. Upon completion of all experimentation, I will construct gene tree phylogenies for each nuclear gene independently, conduct incongruence tests, and if appropriate combine all the nuclear genes into a single analysis. Ultimately, we will construct a resolved, strongly supported higher-level phylogeny for the monocots using data from all three genomic compartments (ncDNA, cpDNA, and mtDNA). This phylogeny will then be used to interpret morphological evolution and ecological/biogeographical patterns among monocot lineages...|$|R
