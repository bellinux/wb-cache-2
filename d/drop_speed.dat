The ride also broke the record for the world's tallest vertical loop. The previous holder of all these records was Chang at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom, which was installed exactly one year prior.

500|$|Chang ("long" [...] in Mandarin Chinese) {{opened at}} Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom on April 4, 1997, setting world records {{for this type}} of coaster in height, <b>drop,</b> <b>speed,</b> length and number of inversions.

500|$|Discussions {{about a new}} {{roller coaster}} began under former Cedar Fair CEO Dick Kinzel in 2011, who credits his {{successor}} Matt Ouimet with the project. The first concept of GateKeeper was created at the 2011 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Expo. On April 24, 2012, Ouimet said at an Erie County Chamber of Commerce meeting {{that there would be}} $25 million in capital expenditures for Cedar Point in 2013. On May 30, 2012, the Sandusky Register reported that a memo written by Ouimet to Cedar Fair's board of directors on February 15, 2012, stated that a new Wing Coaster code-named [...] "CP Alt. Winged" [...] would be introduced in 2013. It also mentioned that the new coaster would set Wing Coaster records for <b>drop,</b> <b>speed,</b> and length, and that it would have a [...] "Front Gate Statement" [...] explained as a strong presence {{at the entrance to the}} park. In addition to traveling over the front entrance, part of the track would also cross over portions of the parking lot. Details claimed the ride would be [...] high, and that both Disaster Transport and Space Spiral would need to be removed to accommodate the new attraction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For long {{distance}} water transmission project, choose {{a more effective}} control method is very import for safety and decrease loss in the emergency status. In the past, the serial regulate gate method is adopted oftentimes. However, its disadvantages are obvious, such as lower efficiency and rapid <b>dropping</b> <b>speed</b> of water lever which easily lead to landslide. This paper proposes a synchronous regulating gates method for emergency control which ensures the flow of open channel can reach new status of uniform flow in shortest time. The results of simulation show the <b>dropping</b> <b>speed</b> of water level using synchronous regulation method is significantly smaller than serial regulation method. The total time requires significantly less than serial regulation method too...|$|R

40|$|Measured <b>drop</b> <b>speeds</b> from a {{range of}} {{industrial}} drop-on-demand (DoD) ink-jet print head designs scale with the predictions of very simple physical models and results of numerical simulations. The main drop/jet speeds at a specified stand-off depend on fluid properties, nozzle exit diameter, and print head drive amplitude for fixed waveform timescales. <b>Drop</b> <b>speeds</b> from the Xaar, Spectra Dimatix, and MicroFab DoD print heads tested with (i) Newtonian, (ii) weakly elastic, and (iii) highly shear-thinning fluids all show a characteristic linear rise with drive voltage (setting) above an apparent threshold drive voltage. Jetting, simple modeling approaches, and numerical simulations of Newtonian fluids over the typical DoD printing range of surface tensions and viscosities were studied to determine how this threshold drive value and the slope of the characteristic linear rise depend on these fluid properties and nozzle exit area. The final speed is inversely proportional to the nozzle exit area, as expected from volume conservation. These results should assist specialist users in the development and optimization of DoD applications and print head design. For a given density, the drive threshold is determined primarily by viscosity, and the constant of proportionality k linking speed with drive above a drive threshold becomes independent of viscosity and surface tension for more viscous DoD fluid jetting...|$|R

30|$|The method {{demonstrated}} {{in this work}} provided a simple, reproducible, controllable route to synthesize silver triangles. By adjusting {{the amount of the}} seeds, or the mole ratio between PVP and AgNO 3, the edge length of the silver triangles can be conveniently tuned in the range from 50 to 260  nm. The surface plasmon resonance regularly varied with the edge length of the silver nanotriangles. With optimized conditions, such as slower <b>dropping</b> <b>speed</b> and suitable concentration of the trisodium citrate, the silver triangles with sharper corner and narrower size distribution will be synthesized.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} manufactured shutter was {{the drop}} shutter of the 1870s.

As the slit passed the lens, it [...] "wiped" [...] the exposure onto the photographic plate. With rubber bands to increase the <b>drop</b> <b>speed,</b> a 1/500 or 1/1000 s shutter speed could be reached. Eadweard Muybridge used shutters of this type in his famous trotting horse studies.|$|E
