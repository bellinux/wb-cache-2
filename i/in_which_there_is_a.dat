5|$|Most moments <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fantastic {{occurrence}} {{constitute a}} change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events {{from the perspective of}} the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
2500|$|Forms include {{monopoly}} (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{only one}} seller of a good), duopoly (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few sellers of a good), monopolistic competition (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), monopsony (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one buyer of a good), and oligopsony (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition {{have the potential}} to be [...] "price makers", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.|$|R

5|$|Multiple organolithium {{reagents}} {{are known}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms, effectively creating a carbanion. These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. In {{many of these}} organolithium compounds, the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high-symmetry clusters by themselves, which is relatively common for alkali cations. LiHe, a very weakly interacting van der Waals compound, has been detected at very low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
