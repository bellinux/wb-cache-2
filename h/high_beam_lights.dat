500|$|Debuting in late 2009 for the 2010 model year, {{the revised}} LS 460 and LS 460 L {{included}} restyled {{front and rear}} fascias, side mirror turn signals, and new wheel designs. New technology included automatic <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights</b> and a self-repairing clear coat for the exterior paint. The standard cabin received additional chrome trim, an optional DVD entertainment system behind the center armrest, and in certain markets, an all-digital instrument panel with night vision capability. The LS 460 Sport—a performance variant equipped with a sport-tuned air suspension, Brembo brakes, forged wheels, paddle shifters, body kit, and a unique interior—was added. The Sport model received the Sport Direct Shift transmission, {{also found in the}} Lexus IS F, with downshift rev-matching capability and manual mode. A new interior customization program, [...] "L-Select", also became available for LS customers in Japan.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{automatic}} beam switching (High-Beam Assistant) was introduced. This system detects oncoming light sources to automatically engage the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights</b> in dark areas and then dip the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights</b> to avoid dazzling oncoming traffic.|$|E
50|$|The S500, besides {{switching}} {{the engine}} added Nappa leather, a heated front seat, walnut wood trim, and Xenon <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The bike's {{instrument}} cluster includes a compact analog step-motor speedometer and tachometer (both with LED illumination) and a digital LCD unit with odometer, trip meter, coolant temperature gauge, fuel gauge, LED neutral, digital clock, turn signal and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights</b> and an oil pressure warning light.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is famous}} for a stage of the Monte Carlo Rally which is held on the tight road with its many hairpin turns. Until a few years ago, the Col de Turini was also driven at night, with {{thousands}} of fans watching the [...] "night of the long knives" [...] as it was called, due to the strong <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights</b> cutting through the night.|$|E
50|$|The {{dashboard}} tachometer {{has been}} changed entirely, now with an old-school design. Four gauges sit on {{the middle of the}} dashboard, displaying the engine oil, speedometer, fuel, and temperature, with the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights</b> and turn signal displays sitting beside them. Below the gauges sits a head-like designed center console control area, and includes climate control, two air conditioning fans, temperature display, radio FM display, and other functions. Below the controls sits the 5-speed manual transmission, and the handbrake. The whole center console design resembles a copperhead snake. The steering wheel design remains, the same design used for the Phase ZB series Vipers.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrumentation}} are a cable-driven analog speedometer and tachometer with {{a stainless}} steel bezel, fuel low-level indicator, engine-trouble warning, turn signal, neutral, and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>light</b> indicators. The left-side handlebar controls include hazard, horn <b>high</b> and low <b>beam</b> control, flash-to-pass switch and turn indicator controls. The right side controls include the hazard light switch {{as well as the}} engine kill switch.|$|R
25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the low beam, since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the same}} time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>light</b> distributions. The <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and <b>high</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The dash had dials to show rpm, speed, engine {{temperature}} and fuel level. A small set of {{lights on the}} rpm dial illuminated when V-tacs was engaged; other lights on the dash lit up for turn signal, oil low (two-stroke oil) and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> (head <b>lights).</b> A small light on the speed dial flashed when speed exceeded 35 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|Sospel has an {{elevation}} of 479m, and the D70 has a maximum elevation of 1603m, for an average gradient of 6.7%. The Turini is also driven at night, with thousands of fans watching the [...] "Night of Turini", {{also known as the}} [...] "Night of the Long Knives" [...] due to the strong <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights</b> cutting through the night. In the 2007 edition of the rally, the Turini was not used, but it returned for the 2008 route. For both the 2009 and 2010 event the stage was run at night and shown live on Eurosport.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year the Bonneville became its own line, {{built on the}} [...] wheelbase of the A-body platform. A 1958 Tri power Bonneville was the pace car for that year's Indianapolis 500. Also, 1958 was the last year Pontiac Motor Division would bear the [...] "Indian" [...] motif throughout the vehicle. The exception would be the Indian head <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> indicator <b>light</b> in the instrument cluster.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} system in all {{six years of}} the XL175 was a six volt system and included a battery, headlight with high/low beam, turn signals, brake/taillight, instrumentation lights, and a horn. A warning light panel was also included on models 1976 through 1978 which displayed lights for 'High Beam' (blue light), 'Turn Signal' (orange light) and 'Neutral' (green light). Models from 1973 through 1975 incorporated warning lights for neutral and turn signals into the tachometer face, and a <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> indicator <b>light</b> {{on the top of}} the headlight housing.|$|R

40|$|Asset {{management}} is a systematic process of maintaining, upgrading and operating assets. Several agencies are applying asset management principles {{as a business}} tool and model to help them define goals and prioritize agency resources in decision making. Road asset {{management is}} focused on bridges, traffic signs, pavement markings, culverts. This project focuses {{on the development of}} traffic sign asset management system. For this we have to conduct a visual night time inspection method to find the Retro-reflectivity of a sign. This survey will be conducted at regular night time intervals. This survey will be conducted at minimum vehicle distances with vehicle <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights.</b> And some of traffic signs should be failed the test they should not visible to the driver. And some signs need for maintenance. The study findings indicate that making a business case for formal asset management programs. In the management study, we have to take manufacture cost of each sign and maintenance cost of the signs. For this we need to replace the some signs and maintenance should be required for some signs. And should note the latitude and longitude of the sign and create a file in the arc GIS and should plot a position of the each sign...|$|E
40|$|A high {{incidence}} of road accidents has been recorded in Saudi Arabia in recent years (Traffic Department Statistics 1991). Various factors might have accounted for this high rate of road accidents; {{the aim of this}} research, therefore, was to examine what factors contribute to road accidents in the country. In pursuit of this aim, a review of relevant literature on factors related with road accidents in many countries of the world was undertaken. Through this review, a list of road, vehicle and driver-related variables was selected for investigation in this study. The target population for the study was 4, 100 drivers in Eastern Saudi Arabia who had been involved in road accidents in the period. Out of this population, a sample of 600 drivers was selected. The instrument used to collect data for the study was a questionnaire which requested demographic information on factors which had caused them to have an accident, and questions analysing habitual driving behaviour. Drivers were also tested on their knowledge of road signs. Returns were received from 484 drivers, 81 % of the study sample. Two statistical techniques, chi square and correlation coefficient Spearman Brown formula, were utilised to test the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable - the number of road accidents. The findings of the study show that certain variables were significantly associated with road accidents in Saudi Arabia. Among the significant variables were the age of the driver, education level, profession, violation record, vehicle ownership, joy-riding, poor eye sight, sun haze, sand storm, long hours driving, non-observance of speed limit, emerging and exiting from roads without signals, presence of stray animals, non-marking of the road, non-familiarity with the road, lack of regular checking of vehicles, lack of regular servicing of vehicles and driving under medication. The variables that were not significant include marital status, non-possession of a licence, mechanical fault, reversing, non-alertness to others' errors, use of <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lights</b> while driving, non-lighting of the roads, passengers' behaviour, ear disorder. Conclusions were drawn as to deficiencies in driver training in Saudi Arabia and inadequacies of supervision by the law enforcement agents. It is recommended that policy makers should make intensive efforts in organising training programmes and seminars for drivers and curriculum of driving schools should be expanded. Measures for improving enforcement of traffic regulations are made, and it is suggested that an Islamic insurance policy for vehicles should be introduced in the country. Finally, suggestions are made for further research...|$|E

50|$|The {{projector}} {{is normally}} set at 90°, although 71° 31' may be used, {{in relation to}} the terrain. The projector consists of a 430 W incandescent bulb set in a weatherproof housing. Inside the housing are two mirrors; the first, above the bulb, reflects the light downwards to the second mirror, that then reflects the light upwards to the cloud. Both mirrors are focused to produce a <b>high</b> intensity <b>beam</b> of <b>light</b> that renders a visible spot on the base of the cloud.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdaptive driving beams (ADB) avoid glare for {{approaching}} or leading drivers {{but otherwise}} provide <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lighting.</b> Audi's implementation uses {{a matrix of}} LED units to deactivate individual LEDs when it detects leading or approaching vehicles. A test track study measured perceived discomfort glare by having 20 participants view and rate headlight configurations from five roadway approaches. The headlight conditions included an Audi A 8 with ADB, the A 8 with ADB deactivated (resulting in an LED low beam pattern that met European specifications), a 2013 Mazda 3 with low beam adaptive curve HID headlights, and a 2014 Dodge Durango SUV with low beam HID headlights. Five approaches included left and right gradual and sharp curves and a straight approach. Participants rated glare comfort {{on a scale from}} 1 to 9, with higher ratings indicating more acceptable glare. Glare from the Durango was rated as less comfortable (M = 6. 15) than the other three systems. The Mazda 3 (M = 6. 82) received more acceptable glare ratings than the Durango. The A 8 ADB (M = 7. 25) received more acceptable glare ratings than the Durango and the Mazda 3 but was not rated differently from the A 8 low beam LED condition (M = 7. 36). Mean and maximum illuminance measures for the approach vehicles corresponded well with subjective ratings. These findings demonstrate the promise for adaptive driving beam headlight systems, and the tested adaptive driving beam system is presently available for use in the European market. However, FMVSS 108 requires discrete <b>high</b> and low <b>beam</b> settings, which does not allow adaptive driving beam systems in the United States. Measuring illuminance dynamically may provide an alternative regulatory approach...|$|R

25|$|Complex-reflector {{technology}} {{in combination with}} new bulb designs such as H13 is enabling the creation of European-type low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> patterns {{without the use of}} a Graves Shield, while the 1992 US approval of the H4 bulb has made traditionally European 60% / 40% optical area divisions for low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> common in the US.

40|$|A {{technical}} report is given on the envisaged modifications of the UNILAC at the GIS (Darmstadt) {{in order to}} condition it for the high intensity operation for the SIS. These modifications comprise the production (new ion source) and acceleration (new linac structures) of <b>high</b> intensity <b>beams</b> and have numerous consequences for beam transport, beam diagnostics, beam loading of the rf cavities and a consistent operation strategy. An accompanying program of machine development with the already available <b>high</b> intensity <b>beams</b> of <b>light</b> ions is outlined, which ensures that the remaining, unmodified UNILAC hardware will be compatible with the increased intensities.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} European {{method of}} achieving low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> {{from a single}} bulb involves two filaments along the axis of the reflector. The <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> filament is on the focal point, while the low beam filament is approximately 1cm forward of the focal point and 3mm above the axis. Below the low beam filament is a cup-shaped shield (called a [...] "Graves Shield") spanning an arc of 165°. When the low beam filament is illuminated, this shield casts a shadow on the corresponding lower area of the reflector, blocking downward light rays that would otherwise strike the reflector and be cast above the horizon. The bulb is rotated (or [...] "clocked") within the headlamp to position the Graves Shield so as to allow light to strike a 15° wedge of {{the lower half of}} the reflector. This is used to create the upsweep or upstep characteristic of ECE low <b>beam</b> <b>light</b> distributions.

40|$|International audienceThis letter {{illustrates}} {{the design of}} a novel medium infrared (Mid-IR) laser based on a photonic crystal fiber made of dysprosium-doped chalcogenide glass, Dy 3 +:Ga 5 Ge 20 Sb 10 S 65. In order to perform a realistic investigation, the simulation is performed by taking into account the spectroscopic parameters measured on the rare earth-doped glass sample. The simulated results show that an optical beam emission close to 4400 -nm wavelength can be obtained by employing two pump beams at 2850 nm (pump # 1) and 4092 nm (pump # 2) wavelengths. The pump beams can be provided by commercial quantum cascade lasers. As example, for the pump powers of 50 mW (pump # 1) and 1 W (pump # 2), the input mirror reflectivity of 99 %, the output mirror reflectivity of 30 %, and the optical cavity length of 50 cm, a signal power close to 350 mW at the wavelength of 4384 nm can be generated. This result indicates that the designed source configuration is feasible for <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> quality Mid-IR <b>light</b> generation and it is efficient enough to find applications in optical free propagation links, optical remote sensing, and medicine. © 2016 IEEE...|$|R
