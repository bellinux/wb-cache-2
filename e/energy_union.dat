Eurocommissioner Vice President Maroš Šefčovič called the <b>Energy</b> <b>Union</b> the biggest energy project since the European Coal and Steel Community.

25|$|The federal {{division}} of the Federated Saw Mill, Timber Yard and General Wood Workers Employees' Association {{changed its name to}} the Amalgamated Timber Workers' Union of Australia. The former union had been registered federally in 1907 and had registered branches in Victoria, Adelaide, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Although the organization was deregistered in 1918 its members formed a new union, the Australian Timber Workers' Union, the same year. The new union extended coverage to workers in box and case factories, saw makers' shops, joiners' workshops, carpenters, implement workers and wood-working machinists. In 1940 the union filed an application and succeeded in extending its coverage to most workers employed in the timber and wood industry including cabinet makers and furniture factories. In 1991 it amalgamated with the Pulp & Paper Workers' Federation of Australia to form the Australian Timber & Allied Industries Union. Later in the year amalgamation with the Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia created the ATAIU & BWIU Amalgamated Union. Further amalgamations eventually saw this organization become part of the Construction Forestry Mining & <b>Energy</b> <b>Union</b> in 1993.|$|E
