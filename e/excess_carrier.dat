40|$|A novel {{measurement}} and analysis method of determining individual <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> lifetimes in multilayer systems is presented. This is particularly interesting for the characterisation of crystalline silicon thin-film samples consisting of an electrically active epitaxial layer {{on top of}} a crystalline substrate. The analysis principle is based on a comparison between a measured photoluminescence intensity ratio and associated simulated radiative recombination ratios. It benefits from the fact that for low <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> lifetimes within the epitaxial layer the carrier concentration in the said layer is limited by bulk recombination, while for high carrier lifetimes surface recombination is dominating. Depending on which <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> lifetime is realised, the <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> level in the epitaxial layer is either strongly dependent or nearly independent from the epitaxial layer thickness.

We investigate QSSPC measurements on damage-etched samples with five different resistivities from 0. 25 Omega cm p-type to 100 Omega cm n-type float-zone material with four different thicknesses each, ranging from 105 to 250 mu m. The influence of different excitation spectra, realized by adding different long pass filters to the standard QSSPC Xenon flash spectrum, on the injection-dependent effective <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> lifetime is studied in detail. We observed that the measured effective lifetime is significantly dependent upon the excitation spectrum in use and is augmented by increasing the long pass filter cut-off wavelength, the latter being equivalent to more symmetrical <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> density profiles.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{photoluminescence}} {{internal quantum efficiency}} (IQE) and recombination dynamics {{in a pair of}} polar and non-polar InGaN/GaN quantum well (QW) light-emitting diode (LED) structures as a function of <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> density and temperature. In the polar LED at 293 K, the variation of radiative and non-radiative lifetimes is well described by a modified ABC type model which accounts for the background carrier concentration in the QWs due to unintentional doping. As the temperature is reduced, the sensitivity of the radiative lifetime to <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> density becomes progressively weaker. We attribute this behaviour to the reduced mobility of the localised electrons and holes at low temperatures, resulting in a more monomolecular like radiative process. Thus we propose that in polar QWs, the degree of carrier localisation determines the sensitivity of the radiative lifetime to the <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> density. In the non-polar LED, the radiative lifetime is independent of excitation density at room temperature, consistent with a wholly excitonic recombination mechanism. These findings have significance for the interpretation of LED efficiency data {{within the context of the}} ABC recombination model...|$|E

40|$|Undesired unintentional doping and doping {{limits in}} {{semiconductors}} are typically caused by compensating defects with low formation energies. Since {{the formation energy}} of a charged defect depends linearly on the Fermi level, doping limits can be especially pronounced in wide bandgap semiconductors where the Fermi level can vary substantially. Introduction of non-equilibrium carrier concentrations during growth or processing alters the chemical potentials of band carriers and thus provides the possibility of modifying populations of charged defects in ways impossible at thermal equilibrium. Herein we demonstrate that, for an ergodic system with <b>excess</b> <b>carriers,</b> the rates of carrier capture and emission involving a defect charge transition level rigorously determine the admixture of electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels determining {{the formation energy of}} non-zero charge states of that defect type. To catalog the range of possible responses to <b>excess</b> <b>carriers,</b> we investigate the behavior of a single donor-like defect as functions of extrinsic doping and energy of the charge transition level. The technologically most important finding is that <b>excess</b> <b>carriers</b> will increase the formation energy of compensating defects for most values of the charge transition level in the bandgap.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the optical control of microwave photonic bandgap circuits using high resistivity silicon. Photoconducting processes that occur within silicon are investigated. The influence of <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> density on carrier mobility and lifetime is examined. In addition, electron-hole pair recombination mechanisms (Shockley-Read-Hall, Auger, radiative and surface) are investigated. The microwave properties of silicon are examined, in particular the variation of silicon reflectivity with <b>excess</b> <b>carrier</b> density. Filtering properties of microstrip photonic bandgap structures and how they may be controlled optically are studied. A proof-of-concept microstrip photonic bandgap structure with optical control is designed, simulated and measured. With no optical illumination incident upon the silicon, the microstrip photonic bandgap structure's filtering properties are well-defined; a 3 dB stopband width of 2. 6 GHz, a 6 dB bandwidth of 2 GHz and stopband depth of - 11. 6 dB at the centre frequency of 9. 9 GHz.
