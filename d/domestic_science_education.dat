50|$|In 1942, Meriden {{temporarily}} {{became the}} home of two schools as the Presbyterian Ladies' College (PLC), from the nearby suburb of Croydon, was occupied by the Royal Australian Air Force {{for the purpose of}} establishing a top secret Radar Unit. Meriden offered to accommodate the PLC boarders and the school's singing, <b>domestic</b> <b>science,</b> and physical <b>education</b> classes. In spite of the apparent happy relationship between the two schools, the PLC Principal, Dr Helen Wilkie, recommended that further integration between the two schools should not proceed, and thus at the end of 1942, Meriden indicated that it could no longer house the PLC boarders.|$|R
50|$|In 1851 some of Milwaukee's wealthy German {{immigrants}} {{formed the}} Milwaukee Schulverein (School Association). Many {{of the founders}} were Forty-Eighters, progressives who had left Germany after the German revolutions of 1848-49 failed. Unhappy with Milwaukee's public schools, and wanting instruction in German as well as English, they started a private school called the German-English Academy. Aside from teaching German, the Academy brought in other ideas from German education at the time: singing, drawing and <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> classes; physical <b>education</b> based on the German Turner movement. In 1873 the Academy offered the first kindergarten in Milwaukee. Classes initially met {{in the home of}} Peter Engelmann, the first teacher, but soon outgrew that.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} {{established}} as the West Virginia Colored Institute in 1891 under the second Morrill Act which provided for land-grant institutions for {{black students in}} the 17 states that had segregated schools. The school opened its doors in May 1892 and had an enrollment of over 40 students. The faculty consisted of President James Edwin Campbell, Byrd Prillerman, and T.C. Friend. The curriculum consisted of courses in agriculture, horticulture, mechanical arts, and <b>domestic</b> <b>science.</b> Teacher <b>education</b> courses were added in 1893. Military education became {{an integral part of}} the school, and in 1899 the Legislature passed a bill to admit up to 60 cadets. In 1909, Booker T. Washington recommended his friend and noted educator, Byrd Prillerman, to serve as president. Noted African-American educator and statesman, Washington was instrumental in having the institution located in the Kanawha Valley. He visited the campus often and spoke at its first commencement exercise. During Prillerman's 10-year administration, the school established itself as the center of black intellectual life in the state.|$|R
500|$|In 1941, {{both the}} Principal Mary Hamilton, and the Senior Mistress (novelist, critic and historian) Flora Eldershaw, left {{the school to}} fill wartime {{positions}} in the bureaucracy. [...] In 1942, the new Principal, Dr Helen Wilkie, arrived to find falling enrolments, staffing problems and food shortages due {{to the effects of}} the Second World War. Word was soon received that Australian military authorities wished to inspect the school with a view to taking it over. On 24 March 1942, it was requested that PLC be occupied by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for the purpose of establishing a top secret Radar Unit and military barracks known as No.1 RIMU (Radio Installation and Maintenance Unit). In order to accommodate PLC's students and classes, the Council approached Meriden School in Strathfield. Meriden agreed to house the boarders and the singing, <b>domestic</b> <b>science,</b> and physical <b>education</b> classes. PLC also purchased Lingwood, a property in Strathfield, as a centre for the school's remaining activities.|$|R

40|$|Looking solely at the legislation, {{one could}} {{claim that the}} Dutch higher {{education}} system has been officially known as a binary system since 1986. At that moment the higher professional education sector {{was taken out of}} secondary education and received separate legislation (HBO Act), formally becoming part of higher education. However, one could also argue that the general idea of the existence of two sectors of higher education is much older and {{can be traced back to}} the beginning of the previous century, when the <b>Domestic</b> <b>Science</b> and Technical <b>Education</b> Act was established in 1919. The year 1968 stands for another hallmark in the development of the sector of higher professional education: the sector was integrated with secondary education as a result of the Secondary Education Act. At present the 1993 Higher Education and Research Act (WHW) regulates the higher education system, comprising thirteen universities, the Open University and (at present) 62 hogescholen. Table 4. 1 gives an overview of the enrolments (total number of students) per sector. Both in total number of students and number of first-years students, the hogescholen sector is larger than the university sector...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{analysis}} of the connection between the <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. While it is made clear by historians such as Megan Elias and Kathy Cooke that there is ample connection between eugenics and euthenics, there has not been as comprehensive {{an analysis}} of the direct connections between <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. Close examination of literature from the <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> movement reveals the shared goals of <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. The <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> movement was also a necessary precursor to the euthenics movement, not simply a “re-envisioning” of home economics by Ellen Richards. When Richards died, her euthenic ideals would continue {{to be a part of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> in the early decades of the twentieth century. This analysis will contribute in part to the understanding of how, through rhetoric, nations can progress towards more unsightly policies of social engineering from seemingly benign beginnings. Eugenics may not have origins in <b>domestic</b> <b>science,</b> a field of homemaking, cookery, etiquette, and child-rearing, but eugenics certainly shares goals, purposes, and a vision with <b>domestic</b> <b>science...</b>|$|R
