5|$|Every {{night after}} shooting, editor Colin Goudie and his {{assistant}} Justin Hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and {{ready for the next}} day. While new footage was being captured, the previously filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel. After filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. The original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing. Edwards originally had the <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film both at the beginning and the end. He and the film's producers disagreed about the placement, so he decided to put the chronological <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film {{at the beginning and end}} the film immediately after Andrew and Samantha kiss.|$|E

When {{it was time to}} animate the <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.|$|E
