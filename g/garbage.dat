5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for <b>garbage</b> disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit <b>garbage</b> disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of <b>garbage</b> is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of <b>garbage</b> bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification of disposable <b>garbage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Beautiful <b>Garbage</b> tour {{started in}} earnest in January 2002 in New Zealand and Australia, when <b>Garbage</b> joined the Big Day Out festival. In between the festival shows, <b>Garbage</b> headlined two concerts in Melbourne and Sydney. <b>Garbage</b> then spent ten days in Japan, {{performing}} four headline shows in Osaka and Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|A local {{department}} store announces {{the formation of}} a new August holiday called Love Day intended to boost sales. The Simpsons celebrate it, but the vast amount of packaging it produces causes the <b>garbage</b> to build up. When Homer takes it out, he fails {{to make it to the}} curb in time. As the <b>garbage</b> men drive away without collecting his trash, Homer angrily shouts insults at them, causing a fight that leads to the family's <b>garbage</b> service being cut off. <b>Garbage</b> gradually piles up on their front lawn and despite Marge's pleas, Homer refuses to apologize to the <b>garbage</b> men.|$|E

5|$|Early <b>garbage</b> {{collection}} in Scarborough {{was performed by}} individual communities and dumped in local landfills which were located in nearby ravines. In 1967 waste collection was reorganized. Local landfills were closed {{and most of the}} <b>garbage</b> was directed to a new landfill on Beare Road in eastern Scarborough. This dump was eventually closed in 1981. A waste transfer site was constructed near Markham Road and Sheppard Avenue East. From there <b>garbage</b> was trucked to the Keele Valley dump in Vaughan and the Brock Road dump in Pickering. In 2002 the Keele Valley landfill was closed. As part of Toronto's overall waste management, <b>garbage</b> was then trucked to Michigan. This arrangement lasted until 2010 when <b>garbage</b> was sent to the new Green Lane landfill site in Elgin County.|$|E
5|$|<b>Garbage</b> also remixed {{a number}} of their own singles, while drummer Butch Vig remixed {{a number of}} artists while <b>Garbage</b> were active.|$|E
5|$|Managed memory {{cannot be}} {{explicitly}} freed; instead, it is automatically <b>garbage</b> collected. <b>Garbage</b> collection addresses {{the problem of}} memory leaks by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory {{that is no longer}} needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} <b>garbage</b> {{collection}} involves reading and rewriting {{data to the}} flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block, a write of {{the parts of the}} block which still include valid data, and then a write of the new data. This can significantly reduce the performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background <b>garbage</b> collection (BGC), sometimes called idle <b>garbage</b> collection or idle-time <b>garbage</b> collection (ITGC), where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data. This enables the performance of the device to remain high.|$|E
5|$|Bleed Like Me is {{the fourth}} studio album by American-Scottish {{alternative}} rock band <b>Garbage.</b> It was released on April 11, 2005 by A Records and Warner Bros. Records. The group chose a straight rock sound reminiscent of Garbage's live performances instead of the electronica that permeated the previous album, Beautiful <b>Garbage</b> (2001).|$|E

5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up of {{multiple}} cells). However, the memory can be erased only in larger units called blocks (made up of multiple pages). If the data {{in some of the}} pages of the block are no longer needed (also called stale pages), only the pages with good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called <b>garbage</b> collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of <b>garbage</b> collection, but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process. <b>Garbage</b> collection {{is a big part of}} write amplification on the SSD.|$|E
5|$|Decades {{of efforts}} to {{eradicate}} or simply thin the rat population in the system have been unsuccessful. In March 2009, the Transit Authority announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including new poison formulas and experimental trap designs. In October 2011, the MTA announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with their <b>garbage</b> rooms, of rat infestations. Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of <b>garbage</b> in the subways by removing all <b>garbage</b> bins from the subway platforms. The initiative is being tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations. As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their <b>garbage</b> cans removed due {{to the success of}} the program.|$|E

5|$|<b>Garbage</b> {{launched}} a headline UK tour on April 1, 2002 in Portsmouth, a run that included an acoustic performance in Edinburgh and headlining MTV's 5 Night Stand. The band were {{supported on the}} UK dates by Kelli Ali. Beyond the UK, the run extended {{to a number of}} shows in Cologne, Amsterdam and Bourges. On April 19, <b>Garbage</b> returned to play a six-week itinerary of North American dates.

5|$|The Park Grill {{contract}} was signed February 11, 2003.

As part of its deal, the Park District pays for water, gas, and <b>garbage</b> collection at Park Grill. The <b>garbage</b> pickup costs taxpayers about $245,000 annually.|$|E
5|$|Within {{six months}} of his election, Patton instituted the state's first mandatory, county-wide <b>garbage</b> {{collection}} program, to combat illegal <b>garbage</b> dumping, which was rampant in the county. The program won Patton statewide acclaim. When Patton sought re-election in 1985, he again faced Rutherford in the Democratic primary. Rutherford campaigned against the garbage-collection program, promising to repeal it if elected. This stance may have hurt him, because although some county residents resented the mandatory fee for <b>garbage</b> pick-up, many more recognized the benefits, as illegal dump sites became less common. Patton won the primary again, {{and went on to}} re-election. However, he won both races by much smaller margins than in 1981 (2,524 votes in the primary and 3,916 votes in the general election).|$|E

5|$|A month-long European trek began June 10 in Madrid, {{covering}} major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Matt Walker {{stood in}} for Vig {{for the rest}} of the summer. <b>Garbage</b> performed two shows in Nice and Lyon supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a further two headlining French shows in Lille and Paris with Mercury Rev as support. The European leg ended at Espárrago Rock in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was dogged by vocal problems, leading to the cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, <b>Garbage</b> returned to the United Kingdom to perform their last European shows of the year – two intimate club gigs in London.|$|E
