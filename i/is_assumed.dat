5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass of Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12. Likewise, the temperature of the planet <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> to be 1650 K, far hotter than Jupiter's, which <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> to be 124 K (not considering its internal heat and atmosphere).|$|E
5|$|No {{historical}} information {{exists on the}} Cadore region from {{the fall of the}} Roman Empire until the Lombard period. It <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> that during the Barbarian invasions, the inhabitants fled to the Fassa, Badia, Cordevole and Ampezzo valleys.|$|E

30|$|Additionally, {{there are}} often sets of {{modeling}} assumption constraints which are mutually exclusive (cannot <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> simultaneously).

In the same (part of a) system, “consider friction” and “not consider friction” (which are process consideration constraints) cannot <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> simultaneously. Such exclusiveness between modeling assumptions gives important clues to identify the differences between models/problems (see the Procedure section).|$|R

5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version.
