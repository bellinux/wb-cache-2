50|$|Unlike later designs, the Hanson boot did {{not have}} a pivot point to allow forward flex of the leg. Instead, the {{one-piece}} forward section ran from the toe to the mid-calf area as a continuous piece, and was designed to be flexible. The rear section of the boot fit inside the <b>front,</b> <b>clamping</b> forward. When the skier flexed forward, the front section would simply bend with the leg, and the rear section would be pulled forward with it by the buckle. The inner liner was a one-piece system similar to a thick sock. As the foot area was a single piece {{there was no way to}} snug it down; instead it was made very large and fit to an individual's foot shape by filling a plastic bag over the instep with hot wax.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} panel flutter were {{conducted}} at a Mach num-ber of 1. 3 {{to verify the}} existence of this phenomenon and to study the effects of some structural parameters on the flutter characteristics. Thin rectangular metal plates were used in these studies and were mounted as a section of the tunnel wall. Wst of the data were obtained by using aluminum-alloy panels, although a few steel, magnesium, and brass panels were also used. Different materials with various thicknesses and lengths were used to determine the effect of these parameters on panel flutter. The experimental program consFsted of three phases: (1) panels <b>clamped</b> <b>front</b> and rear with tension, (2) initially buckled panels <b>clamped</b> <b>front</b> and rear, and (3) buckled panels clamped on all four edges. Panel flutter was obtained under controlled laboratory conditions and it was found that, at the flow conditions of these tests, increasing tensile forces were effective in eliminating flutter, as were short-ening the panels or increasing the bending stiffness. No apparent sys-tematic trends in the flutter modes or frequencies could be observed, and it is significant that the panel flutter sometimes involved higher modes and frequencies. The presence of a pressure differential between the two surfaces of a panel was observed to have a stabilizing effect. Initially buckled panels were more susceptible to flutter than panels without buckling. Buckled panels wi;th all four edges clamped were much less prone to flutter than buckled panels <b>clamped</b> <b>front</b> and rear...|$|R

5000|$|Like the TTS, the TT RS has a 10 mm lower ride height, {{optional}} [...] "Audi Magnetic Ride", {{and rides}} on standard 18-inch roadwheels with 245/45 ZR18 tyres (optional 19" [...] or 20" [...] wheels are also available). The brakes are upgraded to include two-piece cross-drilled and radially vented front discs, sized at 370 mm in diameter.

50|$|A HangBoard bolts to a {{standard}} snowboard in place of bindings, and the pilot — wearing a harness — hangs from a T-shaped bar. Arms push against handlebars in the <b>front,</b> and feet <b>clamp</b> into rudders at the back. Most control occurs by weight shifting, but pilots can also achieve directional control by using the foot rudders. Applied simultaneously, the rudders function as brakes. The HangBoard frame is made of aircraft aluminum, weighs less than 11 kg without the snowboard, and measures 160 cm long, 32 cm high when folded up, and 47 cm wide.|$|R

The effects of tensile forces and buckling were studied on panels <b>clamped</b> <b>front</b> and rear, in addition to initially buckled panels clamped on all four edges. Panel flutter was obtained under controlled laboratory conditions and it was found that tensile forces, shortening the panels, and increasing the bending stiffness were effective means for eliminating flutter. Buckled panels were more susceptible to flutter than unbuckled panels. No apparent systematic trends in the flutter modes or frequencies could be observed...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "short block" [...] of {{the engine}} {{is the same as}} other Land Rover 4.6 HSE models. Short-blocks used for the 4.6L Callaway engines were stamped with a 9.60:1 {{compression}} ratio marking from Land Rover. The increase of 0.25 points, up from the standard 4.6L compression ratio of 9.35:1 was achieved by a modification to the cylinder heads. The cylinder heads were also modified to improve the airflow {{into and out of the}} combustion chambers. The inlet manifold gasket <b>front</b> valley <b>clamp</b> has been changed to accommodate the heater hose positioning on the bottom front of the Callaway manifold. The ram pipe housing has been modified by shortening the ram pipe tube lengths. The intake runner lengths were tuned to increase both power and torque. The black plastic air inlet tube was replaced with a larger diameter fancy looking carbon fiber inlet tube to match the larger throttle bore in the plenum. The air cleaner box base was modified to increase the airflow. The Lucas GEMS ECU was calibrated to support the mechanical changes to the Callaway engine (the Callaway engine had the same basic FI as in 1998 and did not have the Bosch system that was on other 1999 HSEs).|$|R

Dol's attacks include the Dol Fire (Doru Faiyā) that breathes out fire from its mouth, the Dol Kick (Doru Kikku) that uses its <b>front</b> feet to <b>clamp</b> down pesky fighters, the Dol Crush (Doru Kurasshu) similar to Dol Kick but used by Gavan Type G, the Dol Laser (Doru Rēzā) that fires laser beams from Dol's eyes and its claws, and the Screw Attack (Sukuryū Atakku) that whips fighters attacking from behind with Dol's tail.|$|R
40|$|The {{lifting system}} of a PrandtlPlane is {{a box in}} the front view, made of two swept wings set at {{different}} heights and of vertical wings at their tips; one or two fins connect the rear wing to the upper fuselage, and the <b>front</b> wing is <b>clamped</b> to the same; thus, the wing system is over-constrained, and the structural design becomes a challenge. In this paper, starting from a preliminary solution, an optimization procedure is applied to minimize the overall weight with the constraints of maximum allowable stress, stability of compressed structures, minimum aileron effectiveness, aeroelastic effects on load distribution and flutter. The system is approximated as beams with 54 elements. Two models of the wing section are presented: in the first, the wing section is approximated with three parameters (skin thickness, spar web thickness and stringer section total area) {{for a total of}} 162 degrees of freedom; in the second one, two other parameters are adjoined in any section (areas of two spar flanges) with a total of 270 d. o. f. According to the first model, the overall weight, including the fins, is about 17. 5 % of the maximum takeoff weight, while, in the second one, it is reduced to 15. 8 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{drilling}} {{length is}} an important parameter {{in the process of}} horizontal directional drilling (HDD) exploration and recovery, but there has been a lack of accurate, automatically obtained statistics regarding this parameter. Herein, a technique for real-time HDD length detection and a management system based on the electromagnetic detection method with a microprocessor and two magnetoresistive sensors employing the software LabVIEW are proposed. The basic principle is to detect the change in the magnetic-field strength near a current coil while the drill stem and drill-stem joint successively pass through the current coil forward or backward. The detection system consists of a hardware subsystem and a software subsystem. The hardware subsystem employs a single-chip microprocessor as the main controller. A current coil is installed in <b>front</b> of the <b>clamping</b> unit, and two magneto resistive sensors are installed {{on the sides of the}} coil symmetrically and perpendicular to the direction of movement of the drill pipe. Their responses are used to judge whether the drill-stem joint is passing through the clamping unit; then, the order of their responses is used to judge the movement direction. The software subsystem is composed of a visual software running on the host computer and a software running in the slave microprocessor. The host-computer software processes, displays, and saves the drilling-length data, whereas the slave microprocessor software operates the hardware system. A combined test demonstrated the feasibility of the entire drilling-length detection system...|$|R
