5|$|This {{statistical}} theory, {{proposed by}} Alfred Saupe and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> between adjacent liquid crystal molecules.

40|$|Motivation. The Mulliken {{permanent}} electric <b>dipole</b> <b>moments</b> {{have been}} calculated for several aliphatic primary amines (ammonia, methylamine, ethylamine and propylamine). These calculated <b>dipole</b> <b>moments</b> {{were compared to}} the experimental <b>dipole</b> <b>moments</b> obtained in the gas-phase {{in order to find}} a reliable ab initio quantum chemistry model of calculating these quantities. Method. The Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out for the geometry optimization and calculating the <b>dipole</b> <b>moments.</b> An important number of basis sets incorporating diffuse and polarization functions are used and compared. Results. 6 - 31 G(3 df) and 6 - 31 ++G(3 df, 3 pd) were found to be the most reliable ab initio models for the calculation of equilibrium molecular geometries and permanent electric <b>dipole</b> <b>moments</b> of aliphatic primary amines. This method allowed us to obtain calculated <b>dipole</b> <b>moments</b> very concordant with experimental ones for the four molecules studied. Conclusions. Ab initio quantum chemistry models can be used to predict <b>dipole</b> <b>moments</b> with a good accuracy. The choice of the basis set used for the calculations is of great importance and the best basis set is neither the one including the most complicated polarization functions nor the one including the most important number of diffuse and polarization functions...|$|R
5|$|The dipole {{component}} of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune {{may be the result}} of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} possible tennessine compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E

5|$|If the {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} two interacting bodies {{is affected by the}} presence of one another, covalent interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed. Ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency. Conversely, covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial ionic character. The circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be understood using Fajans' rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most ionic character will have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with a high charge. More generally HSAB theory can be applied, whereby the compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation. This difference in electronegativities means that the charge separation, and resulting <b>dipole</b> <b>moment,</b> is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess electrons on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).|$|E
25|$|It now is {{explored}} just in {{what way}} the polarization density P(r) that enters Maxwell's equations {{is related to the}} <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> p of an overall neutral array of charges, and also to the <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> density p(r) (which describes not only the <b>dipole</b> <b>moment,</b> but also the array location). Only static situations are considered in what follows, so P(r) has no time dependence, and there is no displacement current. First is some discussion of the polarization density P(r). That discussion is followed with several particular examples.|$|E
25|$|A {{physically}} {{more realistic}} modeling of p(r) {{would have the}} <b>dipole</b> <b>moment</b> density drop off rapidly, but smoothly to zero at the boundary of the confining region, rather than making a sudden step to zero density.

40|$|<b>Dipole</b> <b>moments</b> are a simple, global {{measure of}} the {{accuracy}} of the electron density of a polar molecule. <b>Dipole</b> <b>moments</b> also affect the interactions of a molecule with other molecules as well as electric fields. To directly assess the accuracy of modern density functionals for calculating <b>dipole</b> <b>moments,</b> we have developed a database of 200 benchmark <b>dipole</b> <b>moments,</b> using coupled cluster theory through triple excitations, extrapolated to the complete basis set limit.
