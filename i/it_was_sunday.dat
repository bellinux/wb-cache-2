60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Sunday</b> {{morning when}} I left the valley where the Italians lived. I went quickly over the stream, heading for Lucerne. It {{was a good}} thing to be out of doors, with one's pack on one's back, {{climbing}} uphill. But the trees were thick by the roadside; I was not yet free. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>Sunday</b> morning, very still.|$|E

60|$|Below, in the street, a {{military}} band passed glittering.
