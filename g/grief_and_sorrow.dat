25|$|Abid Rogers Bhatti in {{his book}} A Textbook of Soteriology writes {{about the meaning of}} metanoia/μετάνοια. In the Urdu Bible, the word for “repentance” is “toba.” Toba means regret, <b>grief,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorrow</b> over sinful deeds that lead to a change of mind and life. Abid agrees with Tertullian in preferring “conversion” rather than “repentance” to {{translate}} metanoia/μετάνοια in Mark 1:4. In summary, Abid believes that “conversion” (rather than “repentance”) is the best English word to express the meaning of the Greek metanoia/μετάνοια.|$|E

6000|$|The soul {{by being}} in hell loseth nothing of its aptness to think, its quickness to pierce, to pry, and to understand; nay, hell has ripened it in all these things; but, I say, the soul with its {{improvements}} as to these, or anything else, {{is not in the}} hand of him that hath lost himself to manage for his own advantage, but in the hand, and in the power, and to be disposed as is thought meet by him into whose revenging hand by sin he has delivered himself--to wit, in the hand of God. So, then, God now has the victory, and disposeth of all the powers, senses, and passions of the soul for the chastising of him that has lost himself. Now the understanding is only employed and improved in and about the apprehending of such things as will be like daggers at the heart--to wit, about justice, sin, hell, and eternity, to grieve and break the spirit of the damned; yea, to break, to wound, and to tear the soul in pieces. The depths of sin which the man has loved, the good nature of God whom the man has hated, the blessings of eternity which the soul has despised, shall now be understood by him more than ever, but yet so only, as to increase <b>grief</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorrow,</b> by improving of the good and of the evil of the things understood, to the greater wounding of the spirit; wherefore now, every touch that the understanding shall give to the memory will be as a touch of a red-hot iron, or like a draught of scalding lead poured down the throat. The memory also letteth those things down upon the conscience with no less terror and perplexity. And now the fancy or imagination doth start and stare like a man by fears bereft of wits, and doth exercise itself, or rather is exercised by the hand of revenging justice, so about the breadth and depth of present and future punishments, as to lay the soul as on a burning rack. Now also the judgment, as with a mighty maul, driveth down the soul in the sense and pangs of everlasting misery into that pit that has no bottom; yea, it turneth again, and, as with a hammer, it riveteth every fearful thought and apprehension of the soul so fast that it can never be loosed again for ever and ever. Alas! now the conscience can sleep, be dull, be misled, or batter, no longer; no, it must now cry out; understanding will make it, memory will make it, fancy or imagination will make it. Now, I say, it will cry out of sin, of justice, and of the terribleness of the punishment that hath swallowed him up that has lost himself. Here will be no forgetfulness; yet nothing shall be thought on but that which will wound and kill; here will be no time, cause, or means for diversion; all will stick and gnaw like a viper. Now the memory will go out to where sin was heretofore committed, it will also go out to the word that did forbid it. The understanding also, and the judgment too, will now consider of the pretended necessity that the man had to break the commandments of God, and of the seasonableness of the cautions and of the convictions which were given him to forbear, by all which more load will be laid upon him that has lost himself; for here all the powers, senses, and passions of the soul must be made self-burners, self-tormentors, self-executioners, by the just judgment of God; also all that the will shall do in this place shall be but to wish for ease, but the wish shall only be such as shall only seem to lift up, for the cable rope of despair shall with violence pull him down again. The will indeed will wish for ease, and so will the mind, etc., but all these wishers will by wishing arrive to no more advantage but to make despair which is the most twinging stripe of hell, to cut yet deepeer into the whole soul of him that has lost himself; wherefore, after all that can be wished for, they return again to their burning chair, where they sit and bewail their misery. Thus will all the powers, senses, and passions of the soul of him that has lost himself be out of his own power to dispose for his advantage, and will be only in the hand and under the management of the revenging justice of God. And herein will that state of the damned be worse than it is now with the fallen angels; for though the fallen angels are now cast down to hell, in chains, and sure in themselves at last to partake of eternal judgment, yet at present they are not so bound up as the damned sinner shall be; for notwithstanding their chains, and their being the prisoners of the horrible hells, yet they have a kind of liberty granted them, and that liberty will last till the time appointed, to tempt, to plot, to contrive, and invent their mischiefs, against the Son of God and His (Job 1:7; 2:2). And though Satan knows that this at last will work for his future condemnation, yet at present he finds it some diversion to his trembling mind, and obtains, through his so busily employing of himself against the gospel and its professors, something to sport and refresh himself withal; yea, and doth procure to himself some small crumbs of minutes of forgetfulness of his own present misery and of the judgment that is yet to pass upon him; but this privilege will then be denied to him that has lost himself; there will be no cause nor matter for diversion; there it will; as in the old world, rain day and night fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven upon them (Rev 14:10,11). Misery is fixed; the worm will be always sucking at and gnawing of, their soul; also, as I have said afore, all the powers, senses, and passions of the soul will throw their darts inwards, yea, of God will be made to do it, to the utter, unspeakable, and endless torment of him that has lost himself.

40|$|Grief {{that accompanies}} {{significant}} loss {{is a universal}} human experience. It has long been presumed that grief should resolve over a finite period of time. Because of the difficulties with defining the appropriate time limitations for uncomplicated grieving, an alternate conceptualization of grief resolution, in which sorrow is expected to recur periodically rather than dissipate over time was introduced as a conceptual perspective. The research followed a retrospective design in which three groups of persons who had experienced significant, yet different, types of loss were examined to determine the pattern of grief resolution over time. The groups included those whose loved one had a congenital cognitive deficit (Congenital), persons whose loved one had an acquired cognitive deficit (Acquired), and bereaved persons (Bereaved). The outcome variables of initial <b>and</b> present <b>grief,</b> recurrent <b>sorrow,</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms were examined for relationship to the covariates of attachment, spirituality, and perceived social support. Participants completed questionnaires that referenced past and present feelings about the loss. Instrumentation included a new scale, the Recurrent Sorrow Inventory, developed to assess pattern of grief over time. Data were analyzed with descriptive and chi-square statistics, analysis of variance, and factor analysis. In addition, graphic format data were used to supplement analysis of the other Likert-format scales. One hundred twenty subjects completed questionnaires. For the combined sample, a significantly greater number of participants selected graphs and descriptive phrases representative of recurrent sorrow over time, than the other choices that suggested either time-bound grief resolution or persistent sadness following loss. The findings did not differ across groups when the sample was separated by type of loss. As hypothesized, the data supported separate, orthogonal factors of initial <b>and</b> present <b>grief,</b> recurrent <b>sorrow,</b> <b>and</b> depression. This supports distinction of depression from <b>grief</b> <b>and</b> recurrent <b>sorrow</b> <b>and</b> suggests avenues for theory development regarding human response to loss. The findings of the study support the need to continue examination of the pervasive nature of grief over time, particularly for relevance to emotional and psychosocial well-being.

The Rabbis also called the messiah the leper scholar, using a pun related to a disciple of Rabbi Judah haNasi who was smitten by leperosy. The passage states that he has borne our <b>grief</b> <b>and</b> carried our <b>sorrows.</b> Yet we esteemed him a leper smitten by god.|$|R

While negotiating possible outcomes for animal patients, veterinary emotion work is designed to assuage guilt <b>and</b> <b>grief</b> to facili-tate timely and rational decisions. However, after clients make the difficult decision to euthanize their pet, veterinary emotion work is geared toward creating “safe ” emotional space for grieving clients. This study illustrates that veterinarians have a growing commitment to comforting the owners of eutha-nized animals and to validating their feelings of <b>grief,</b> pain, <b>and</b> <b>sorrow.</b> On a broader, theoretical level, this study also applies and extends concepts developed in previous sociological analyses of emotion management and human–animal relationships.
