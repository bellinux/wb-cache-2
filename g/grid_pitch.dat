40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} two regulators for a wind turbine equipped with a synchronous generator and a full converter for the interconnection to the grid. The idea is to extract a temporary amount of power from the wind turbine in order to provide short-term frequency support. The wind turbine model presented is specifically designed to analyse effects of wind generation on the electric grid. The first proposed regulator works to decelerate the rotor and hence transferring part of its kinetic energy to the electric grid: this can be done with variable speed wind turbines because the presence of electronic converters decouples the rotational speed of the turbine rotor from the grid frequency. The second proposed regulator acts on the pitch angle of the blades. Normally wind generators work at maximum efficiency: in this case a reserve of power is obtained working at a degraded point in the aerodynamic characteristic and it can be injected into the <b>grid</b> by <b>pitching</b> the blade.

With its user-friendly graphical user interface, the user may interactively manipulate the default settings to obtain a quality grid within a fraction of time that is usually required for building a grid about the same geometry with a general-purpose grid generation code. Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline formulations are utilized in the algorithm to maintain geometry fidelity while redistributing grid points on the solid surfaces. Bezier curve formulation is used to allow interactive construction of inner boundaries. It is also utilized to allow interactive point distribution.

40|$|Single {{junction}} indium {{gallium arsenide}} (InGaAs) based TPV devices have demonstrated efficiencies {{in excess of}} 20 % at radiator temperatures of 1058 C. Modeling suggests that efficiency improvements in single bandgap devices should continue although they will eventually plateau. One approach for extending efficiencies beyond the single bandgap limit is to follow the technique taken in the solar cell field, namely tandem TPV cells. Tandem photovoltaic devices are traditionally composed of cells of decreasing bandgap, connected electrically and optically in series. The incident light impinges upon the highest bandgap first. This device acts as a sieve, absorbing the high-energy photons, while allowing the remainder to pass through to the underlying cell(s), and so on. Tandem devices reduce the energy lost to overexcitation as well as reducing the current density (Jsc). Reduced Jsc results in lower resistive losses and {{enables the use of}} thinner and lower doped lateral current conducting layers as well as a higher <b>pitch</b> <b>grid</b> design. Fabricating TPV tandem devices utilizing InGaAs for all of the component cells in a two cell tandem necessitates the inclusion of a buffer layer in-between the high bandgap device (In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As - 0. 74 eV) and the low bandgap device (In 0. 66 Ga 0. 34 As - 0. 63 eV) to accommodate the approximately 1 % lattice strain generated due to the change in InGaAs composition. To incorporate only a single buffer layer structure, we have investigated the use of the indium phosphide (InP) substrate as a superstrate. Thus the high-bandgap, lattice- matched device is deposited first, followed by the buffer structure and the low-bandgap cell. The near perfect transparency of the high bandgap (1. 35 eV) iron-doped InP permits the device to be oriented such that the light enters through the substrate. In this paper we examine the impact of the buffer layer on the underlying lattice-matched InGaAs device. 0. 74 eV InGaAs devices were produced in a variety of configurations both with and without buffer layers. All structures were characterized by reciprocal space x-ray diffraction to determine epilayer composition and residual strain. Electrical characterization of the devices was performed to examine the effect of the buffer on the device performance. The effect of the buffer structure depends upon where it is positioned.

The recorded temperature was compared to the numerical values evaluated after tuning the heat transfer coefficient. The shape of the grid after rolling was checked against the deformed mesh using different friction coefficients in order to obtain the optimum match. The unusually large length of the insert enabled the rolling process to be stopped halfway so that a picture of the roll-gap area could be obtained.

Widely used in applications such as displays, imaging, sensors, communications, and scientific instrumentation, the wire grid polarizer (WGP) consists of an array of metallic lines with sub-wavelength pitch, often supported by a transparent substrate. Benefits of the WGP over competing designs include a compact form factor with the ability for very large clear apertures, large acceptance angle with minimal performance variation over broad bandwidths, and improved stability over organic polarizers in high temperature and high brightness environments. Existing WGP products designed for long wavelength thermal IR applications typically suffer from low contrast between transmission of linearly polarized light in the passing and blocking configurations, which is due to their relatively large wire <b>grid</b> <b>pitch</b> (typically ≥ 370 nm). Moxtek has previously demonstrated a dramatic increase in aluminum WGP contrast at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths by reducing the pitch. We postulated that a dramatic reduction in pitch from that found in typical IR WGP products should greatly improve mid- and long-wavelength IR contrast. Moxtek has therefore developed several high contrast IR polarizers on anti-reflection (AR) coated silicon suitable for mid-wavelength IR (MWIR) and long-wavelength IR (LWIR) applications using our aluminum nanowire, large area patterning capabilities. Potential applications for these MWIR and LWIR polarizers include spectroscopic measurement systems, optical isolators for industrial lasers, and polarization sensitive imaging systems for hyperspectral imaging, guided missile technology, and forward-looking infrared thermal imaging. Accurate WGP metrology was gathered in both transmission and reflection from the SWIR to LWIR using a combination of FTIR and dispersive spectrometers, as well as laser-based light sources. The WGP structures were analyzed using SEM, FIB, and STEM techniques and optical data was derived from IR VASE, transmission, and reflectance measurements. Modeling of device performance was achieved using rigorous coupled wave analysis. Our 144 nm pitch broadband MWIR polarizer transmits better than 95 % of the passing state while maintaining a contrast ratio of better than 33 dB from 3. 3 - 5. 7 μm. Between 7 and 15 μm, our LWIR polarizer transmits better than 70 % of the passing polarization state and has a contrast ratio better than 40 dB. A narrowband AR-coated WGP for 7. 5 μm wavelength transmits better than 94 % of the passing state while maintaining a contrast ratio of better than 42 dB. With the widespread use of lasers in defense, academia, and industry, Moxtek has pursued laser damage threshold (LDT) testing in both the passing and blocking polarizer orientations, as well as a narrow band AR coated WGP product for 10. 6 μm laser line applications. Preliminary testing and analysis indicate that defects introduced during silicon AR coating are currently limiting the LDT performance in our broadband LWIR product. The MWIR polarizer uses an improved AR coating and does not show the same damage initiation mechanism. The LWIR product showed LDT values of 110 kW/cm 2 and 10 kW/cm 2 in the blocking and passing states respectively for a continuous wave, 10. 6 μm CO 2 laser beam with 360 μm beam diameter. The high reflectivity and low absorption of the Aluminum nanowires evidently protects the defects from laser induced damage in the blocking polarizer configuration. Removing these AR coating defects should further improve LDT performance as well as passing state transmission in the thermal IR. The Moxtek MWIR product showed LDT values of 0. 65 kW/cm 2 and better than 14 kW/cm 2 in the blocking and passing states respectively for a 7 ns, 25 kHz pulsed laser beam at wavelength of 4. 0 μm. SEM analysis of the damage mechanisms for the passing and blocking configurations will also be presented...|$|E
