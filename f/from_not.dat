5|$|Although the {{acquisition}} project organisers originally {{planned for the}} first submarine to be constructed overseas, the Cabinet decided {{as part of the}} project's approval that all six submarines would be built in Australia; the increases in construction time and cost <b>from</b> <b>not</b> building the lead ship in the winning designer's home shipyard was considered to be offset by the additional experience provided to Australian industries. Even so, two sections of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums' shipyard in Malmo, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Apart <b>from</b> <b>not</b> smoking, the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} {{keeping a}} healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} processed meat, {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and <b>from</b> <b>not</b> throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

Other than Mac Murchada himself, another man making a bid for the high-kingship was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1198). Within {{the same year as}} Mac Lochlainn's demise, Ua Conchobair and his allies expulsed Mac Murchada <b>from</b> <b>not</b> only Dublin, but Ireland altogether; and Ua Conchobair himself was duly {{recognised}} as High King of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far <b>from</b> <b>not</b> having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
5|$|Simon de Montfort {{had seized}} power in England {{following}} his victory over Henry III at the Battle of Lewes during the Second Barons' War, but {{his grip on}} the country was under threat. In an attempt to gather more support he summoned representatives <b>from</b> <b>not</b> only the barons and the knights of the shires, as had occurred in previous parliaments, but also burgesses from the major towns. The resulting parliament in London discussed radical reforms and temporarily stabilised Montfort's political situation. Montfort was killed at the Battle of Evesham later that year, but the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments became more popular under the reign of Henry's son Edward I. By the 14th century this had become the norm, with the gathering becoming known as the House of Commons. This parliament is sometimes referred to as the first English parliament and Montfort himself is often termed the founder of the Commons.|$|E

5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate <b>from</b> <b>not</b> beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Bronze Age and Roman activity in the area. A Late Bronze Age axe head dating to around 1000-801 BC was found near Fields Farm Fisheries in Bradwall. Around a thousand Roman coins dating <b>from</b> <b>not</b> earlier than 270 AD were discovered in 1820, {{on the eastern side}} of Bradwall, a short distance from the Brindley Moor's Farm and about four miles direct from the Roman station at Kinderton, at a point where a small brook is crossed by the footpath from Brereton to Sandbach. Discovered by a mole-catcher, the coins included examples of denarii of Gallienus, Claudius II, Tetricus, Victorinus, and Diocletian. The remains of part of a Roman road, are also thought to have been discovered near the western side of Bradwall, by Boothlane, towards the west of Sandbach, and near King Street. Since the 1936 parish boundary changes, the road's location is now in Elworth on Roman Way in Sandbach Parish.|$|E
