Sometimes <b>feathers,</b> <b>bones,</b> and other {{trinkets}} are braided into the string as symbols for a desired spell effect. An earlier version of a witch's ladder consisted of a rope or cord of three, nine, or thirteen knots.|$|R
50|$|Amphipteres {{generally}} {{were said}} to have greenish-yellow feathers, a serpentine body similar to a lindworm, bat-like green wings with <b>feathered</b> <b>bone,</b> and an arrow-tipped tail much like a wyvern's. Others are described as entirely covered in feathers with a spiked tail, bird-like wings, and a beak-like snout. Even more uncommon is the description of one with legs.|$|R
50|$|Sikus are {{typically}} made from bamboo shoots, but {{have also been}} made from condor <b>feathers,</b> <b>bone,</b> and many other materials. Additionally, different types of bamboo are employed to change {{the quality of the}} sound. Songo, or shallow-walled bamboo, gives a louder, more resonant sound than regular deep-walled bamboo, but is less common due to its fragility.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Feathers</b> & <b>Bones</b> is {{the ninth}} studio album by Pittsburgh-native band, the Clarks. Released on July 8, 2014, the album marked their first studio effort in five years, since 2009's Restless Days. Additionally, {{it was the}} band's first release of any kind in four years, {{following}} 2010's downloadable-only EP Songs in G. <b>Feathers</b> & <b>Bones</b> was first announced in early 2013, and soon thereafter, the Clarks began a PledgeMusic campaign to help fund the album's production. The campaign succeeded beyond the band's expectations, achieving 317% of their desired goal. Upon the album's release, the song [...] "Take Care of You" [...] received steady airplay on Pittsburgh-region radio stations, such as WDVE.|$|R

50|$|It {{is illegal}} to capture or keep these owls in most {{southern}} African countries, but the nestlings are easy to tame and they make affectionate, companionable pets. However, feeding them is demanding, because they do best on balanced diets that include <b>feathers,</b> <b>bones</b> and various tissues, not just meat. Suitably dismembered chicks, rodents, or non-toxic frogs make good food if available. Otherwise the owlets suffer malnutrition of various types, with poor bone formation and eventually {{they are likely to}} die and in any case would have no hope of survival in the wild. Also, teaching them to hunt and not to fixate on humans instead of their own species is no job for novices, however loving.|$|R

60|$|A nest which I found a {{few years}} ago shows how well this kind of hunting succeeds. It was in a gloomy {{evergreen}} swamp, in a big tree, some eighty feet from the ground. I found it by a pile of pellets of hair and feathers {{at the foot of the}} tree; for the owl devours every part of his game, and after digestion is complete, <b>feathers,</b> <b>bones,</b> and hair are disgorged in small balls, like so many sparrow heads. When I looked up, there at the top was a huge mass of sticks, which had been added to year after year till it was nearly three feet across, and half as thick. Kookooskoos was not there. He had heard me coming and slipped away silently.|$|R
60|$|As I write, {{the whole}} picture comes back to me again vividly; the dark, cobwebby old garret, pierced here and there by a pencil of light, in which the motes were dancing; the fierce bird {{down on the floor}} in the darkest corner, horns up, eyes gleaming, {{feathers}} all a-bristle till he looked big as a bushel basket in the dim light, standing on his game with one foot and tearing it savagely to pieces with the other, snapping his beak and gobbling up <b>feathers,</b> <b>bones</b> and all, in great hungry mouthfuls; and, over the scuttle, two or three small boys staring in eager curiosity, but clinging to each other's coats fearfully, ready to tumble down the ladder with a yell at the first hostile demonstration.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{until the}} 19th century when {{different}} people who explored or visited southwest Coahuila, particularly the Comarca Lagunera, made more precise descriptions of several caves {{in which the}} ancient pre-Hispanic inhabitants of the region deposited their dead in a flexed position, wrapped in blankets and tethered, resembling a package, hence the current name [...] "mortuary package”.In 1880 English botanist Edward Palmer toured the Comarca Lagunera, where he found some caves with mortuary remains {{and a number of}} associated artifacts in wood, <b>feathers,</b> <b>bone,</b> seashells and stone. In June 2006 the book [...] "The exploration of Edward Palmer" [...] was published. To write this book, Leticia Gonzalez Arratia spent a year at the Smithsonian Institution and a few weeks in the Peabody Museum of Harvard University with the goal of gathering further information on Palmer and his findings on the coahuilense desert.|$|R

40|$|Bird remains from {{archaeological sites}} have the {{potential}} to inform research on many aspects of prehistoric life. In Mesoamerica, they were a food source, as well as a source of <b>feathers</b> and <b>bone.</b> But they were also components of ritual performance, dedicatory offerings, subjects of iconographic representation, characters in myth, and even deities. Their significance is demonstrated ethnographically, ethnohistorically, and archaeologically. This thesis addresses the role of birds at an Early Formative period ceremonial center on the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico. The avian faunal assemblage from the site of Paso de la Amada was analyzed in order to understand how the exploitation and use of birds articulated with the establishment of hereditary inequality at Paso de la Amada and its emergence as a ceremonial center. Results indicate that birds were exploited as a food source as well as for their <b>feathers</b> and <b>bone,</b> and that they played a particularly strong role in ritual performance...|$|R
5000|$|Columbus {{thought the}} Lucayans resembled the Guanche of the Canary Islands (in {{part because they}} were {{intermediate}} in skin color between Europeans and Africans). The Lucayans were described as handsome, graceful, well-proportioned, gentle, generous and peaceful, and customarily going almost completely naked. Peter Martyr d'Anghiera said that the Lucayan women were so beautiful that men from [...] "other countries" [...] moved to the islands to be near them. Women past puberty wore a small skirt of cotton, and the men might wear a loincloth made of plaited leaves or cotton. Some people wore head bands, waist bands, <b>feathers,</b> <b>bones</b> and ear and nose jewelry on occasion. They were often tattooed and usually applied paint to their bodies and/or faces. They also practiced head flattening. Their hair was black and straight, and they kept it cut short {{except for a few}} hairs in back which were never cut. Columbus reported seeing scars on the bodies of some of the men, which were explained to him as resulting from attempts by men from other islands to capture them.|$|R

5000|$|Initial {{stages of}} {{excavation}} concentrated on improving access by widening the cave's opening. The cave was surveyed and divide into twelve sections 3 ft wide by {{the width of}} the cave for individual excavation. Sections were excavated in 6 in increments. Apart from fur, <b>feather,</b> <b>bone,</b> wood and horn that had been damaged by insects and rodents, artifacts were recovered in near-perfect condition. A total of about [...] of deposits were removed from the cave. No significant evidence of distinct occupation levels was apparent. Heizer proposed that Humboldt Cave's occupants corresponded to those of the later or upper levels of Lovelock Cave. The cave had been occupied by pack rats, who filled any available space with gathered material, which included artifacts, particularly in a low hollowed space that the excavators called the [...] "South Alcove." [...] Pack rats jumbled much of the material, as was illustrated when, during excavation, a wool sweater was left in the cave. Rats shredded the sweater and took the pieces into the alcove, where parts of sweater were recovered {{all the way to the}} solid cave floor during later excavation.|$|R

50|$|Uhle {{returned}} to South America in 1896, now {{sponsored by the}} American Exploration Society in Philadelphia. He also enjoyed the patronage of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, the mother of William Randolph Hearst. He undertook excavations at Pachacamac, near the coast of Peru, and on Mochica and Chimu sites. His site report of work at Pachacamac was highly praised and is still used as a basic text for studying South American archaeology. He recognized versions of Tiwanaku stone sculpture imagery on ceramics, textiles, and other artifacts in these coastal sites. On this trip, he recovered approximately 9,000 artifacts spanning over 3,000 years of Andean pre-history. These included Nazca pottery, shells, textiles, metals, objects made of wood and other plant material, and objects constructed of animal materials such as <b>feathers,</b> <b>bone,</b> and leather. He concentrated on the dating of these artifacts, and established a system primarily based on textile design. Artifacts found in the Mocha Valley were dated based on the sequential position of Inca ceramic styles. This early dating was later advanced by American archaeologist Alfred Kroeber {{and is one of}} the key points in understanding the chronology of pre-Inca Peru. Uhle later worked in the highlands of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Chile. In 1917 he was the first to scientifically describe the Chinchorro mummies.|$|R

50|$|The {{northern}} {{spotted owl}} is primarily nocturnal. Its diet consists mainly of wood rats (Neotoma sp.) and flying squirrels, although {{it will also}} eat other small mammals, reptiles, birds and insects. They will often swallow their catch whole and regurgitate pellets of indigestible hair, <b>feathers</b> and <b>bones.</b> Males and females both hunt, except during nesting, when males {{do most of the}} hunting. They can take prey on the ground and in flight.Northern spotted owls {{are one of the few}} owls with dark-colored eyes. Most owls have yellow to red-orange colored eyes.|$|R
5000|$|They also {{collect and}} store various nonfood {{items such as}} bottle caps, snail shells, coins, gun cartridges, <b>feathers,</b> and <b>bones.</b> This trait is {{responsible}} for the nickname [...] "trade rat" [...] or [...] "pack rat". These rats form small colonies in which their nesting areas consist of a network of underground runways and many conspicuous latrines. Latrines are large fecal piles the rats deposit on protected flat rocks. In some cases, researchers have found dried leaves placed around the nesting area which appear to act as alarms to warn the rats of approaching danger.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{having a}} {{guardian}} spirit, men would {{also try to}} acquire protection and powers from specific spirits, which was done by making offerings along with tobacco. For example, a man could not go on the warpath without first performing the [...] "war-bundle feast," [...] which contained two parts. The first part honored the night-spirits {{and the second part}} honored the Thunderbird spirit. The blessings that these spirits gave the men were embodied in objects that together made the war-bundle. These objects could include <b>feathers,</b> <b>bones,</b> skins, flutes, and paints.After the boys became men, they were allowed to court young women. Pubescent women had their own rite of passage associated with their first menstruation, and learning the skills to support a family. Young men would first visit young women in their menstruation lodges. Women were separated from their families during this time because of the Ho-Chunk belief that a woman's menstruation was strong medicine. Other occasions associated with blood, such as childbirth, or preparation for war, also called on strong medicine. Men visited women in their lodges at night, as there was some shame in associating with a woman during menstruation. After courting, the man and woman (whom his family had chosen from another clan) would elope. Elopement was an accepted and practiced form of marriage in the Ho-Chunk culture.|$|R

25|$|The {{partially}} digested and pulverized gizzard contents {{are passed}} into the intestine, where pancreatic and intestinal enzymes complete the digestion of the digestible food. The digestion products are then absorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the blood. The intestine ends via the large intestine in the vent or cloaca which serves as the common exit for renal and intestinal excrements {{as well as for}} the laying of eggs. However, unlike mammals, many birds do not excrete the bulky portions (roughage) of their undigested food (e.g. <b>feathers,</b> fur, <b>bone</b> fragments, and seed husks) via the cloaca, but regurgitate them as food pellets.|$|R
