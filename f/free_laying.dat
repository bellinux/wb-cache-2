40|$|In model based image {{interpretation}} the cue generation process must be robust; i. e. {{able to generate}} appropriate cues for wide variety of objects. In this work we describe a model-based approach to cue generation and demonstrate its operation on both synthetic test data and natural images of epithelial cells. Epithelial cells were chosen because their appearance is highly variable. Statistical inference is used to interpret step, ramp and composite grey-level edges where an edge is modelled {{in terms of the}} greylevel distributions {{on each side of the}} edge. This approach provides a measure of confidence for each edge cue generated. The cue generation process reported here is shown to be more selective than other, previously reported methods that in turn compare favourable with the performance of the Canny operator for cue generation. The cue generation process reported here is also shown to be robust for <b>free</b> <b>laying,</b> touching and overlapping cells when combined with a simple boundary interpretation strategy. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in the polymer (plastic) pipes {{in terms of their}} use in district heating networks of large cities settlements and neighborhoods as flexible pre-insulated pipes in the polyurethane foam insulation channel <b>free</b> <b>laying</b> increased in Russia during the last decade. Pipes made of PE-RT (polyethylene of Raised Temperature Resistance) and PE-X (cross-linked polyethylene) are the most promising plastic pipes. Pipes made of PE-RT have long term hydrostatic resistance (ability to prevent the liquid expiration under pressure) at high temperatures, without molecular cross-linking. This resistance provides significant technological advantages (the ability to weld) comparing with the crosslinkable systems (PE-X), as well as pipes cost reduction. The paper presents the method of determining the service life of polymer heat pipelines made of PE-RT and PE-X at a temperature of 110 °C, based on domestic and foreign standards. The analysis of heat pipelines performance made of PE-RT and PE-X and the plastic pipes service life calculation at temperatures up to 110 °C indicate obvious advantages of PE-RT Type II DOWLEX ™ 2388. In addition, the article gives the guidance to developers of the standard GOST R 52134 next edition, based on European regulations and essential for the laying plastic pipe improvement...|$|E

5000|$|The {{position}} of the equator during the Late Ordovician Epoch ( [...] Ma) on Laurentia has been determined via expansive shell bed records. Flooding of the continent {{that occurred during the}} Ordovician provided the shallow warm waters for the success of sea life and therefore a spike in the carbonate shells of shellfish.

Cluny created a large, federated order in which the administrators of subsidiary houses served as deputies of the abbot of Cluny and answered to him. <b>Free</b> of <b>lay</b> and episcopal interference, responsible only to the papacy, the Cluniac spirit was a revitalising influence on the Norman church.
