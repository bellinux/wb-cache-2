40|$|Abstract. Some {{waste rock}} piles create some {{problems}} such as acid mine drainage (AMD), leaching of heavy metals, and slope stability concerns. These problems {{are related to the}} flow of water through the rock pile. Understanding the physical and hydrological properties of the waste rock piles is important for flow and solute transport modeling. To study physical properties and unsaturated flow in rock pile, some soil samples were collected from surface of the large coal waste rock pile and tested for some common geotechnical parameters in the laboratory. The results showed that materials are so heterogeneous and highly supporting segregation and natural <b>gravity</b> <b>sorting</b> of waste rock materials from top to toe. Numerical simulation was performed to investigate the unsaturated flow conditions in the pile. The results obtained showed that pile is unable to fully saturate and drain during the simulated period. It was also found that high evaporation and also coarse grain nature of waste rock materials results holding few amounts of water in the system...|$|E
40|$|Well exposed Early–Middle Frasnian (E–MF, Palmatolepis transitans to Palmatolepis punctata zonal interval) {{deposits}} of the Holy Cross Mountains, {{in particular the}} reference Wietrznia section at Kielce, were studied in terms of conodont biofacies dynamics. Frequency of the conodont elements has been controlled mostly by depositional rate in hemipelagic muddy lithofacies and post−mortem <b>gravity</b> <b>sorting</b> during lateral redeposition in storm−generated, talus−like and encrinite layers. The conodont assemblages are dominated by a highly varying proportion of polygnathid, icriodontid, and ancyro− dellid fauna. Major biofacies turnovers coincided with the deepening pulses corresponding to Timan, Middlesex, and early Rhinestreet global events. Trends in the conodont dynamics, mortality, and diversity point that the biotic shifts also coincide with the large−scale 13 C excursions as a record of changing trophic conditions during the major biogeochemical perturba− tion. A gradual decline of the Early Frasnian Ancyrodella reef−dwelling community correlates with the minor positive and succeeding larger negative 13 C excursion, and this is paired with a replacement by, mostly sparse, polygnathid and polygnathid−icriodontid biofacies, {{as well as with}} a short−term Belodella acme in mud−mounds areas. The distinctive habitat deterioration in pelagic and reef ecosystems is broadly correlative with the Domanik Crisis. The progressive biofacies unifi− cation is a conodont response to onset of the prolonged (ca. 0. 5 Ma) 13 C enrichment, probably linked with high−stress life conditions due to eutrophication and partly anoxic regimes. A negative carbon isotope excursion in the late Pamatolepis punctata Zone is marked by the second major biofacies turning point during the Rhinestreet transgression, as recorded pri...|$|E
50|$|Bead <b>sort,</b> {{also called}} <b>gravity</b> <b>sort,</b> {{is a natural}} sorting algorithm, {{developed}} by Joshua J. Arulanandham, Cristian S. Calude and Michael J. Dinneen in 2002, and published in The Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. Both digital and analog hardware implementations of bead sort can achieve a sorting time of O(n); however, the implementation of this algorithm tends to be significantly slower in software and can only be used to sort lists of positive integers. Also, {{it would seem that}} even in the best case, the algorithm requires O(n2) space.|$|R

40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of strip mining features, commonly found in the Northern Great Plains Coal Region, on ground-water hydrology. The features examined are: reclaimed mine geometry, relative transmissivity between the reclaimed spoil and the surround-ing unmined coal bed aquifer, anisotropy, the <b>gravity</b> <b>sorted</b> rubble layer, coal wedges left between trench cuts, and the position and size of an operational mine in the regional flow system. A finite element computer model was used to simulate the ground-water flow field from three frames of reference: a local plan view of the mine site (local hydrology), a cross sectional view of flow through the reclaimed mine interior (interior flow), and a cross sectional view of a regional flow system (regional hydrology). The simulation model solved for the piezometric head distribution in each system. For each simulation the piezometric head contours were plotted, and in some cases, the increase in flux induced by the min...|$|R

40|$|Freight {{railroad}} terminals receive inbound trains, classify or regroup railcars, {{and build}} outbound trains. There {{are two types}} of terminals: hump yard which uses <b>gravity</b> to <b>sort</b> railcars and flat switching yard. In general, a hump yard is more productive than a flat switching yards. Due to the complexity of terminal operations, computer simulation offers a flexible and credible technique to identify opportunities for yard performance improvements. However, the use of simulation technique to model terminal operations is not a common practice in freight railroads. In this paper, we introduce a simulation model which depicts the typical operations in a railroad hump yard and present key performance measurements that are used to gauge the efficiency of yard operations and infrastructure. Finally, we illustrate the use of simulation model to improve terminal operations. ...|$|R

A finite element computer model was used to simulate the groundwater flow field from three frames of reference: a local plan view of the mine site (local hydrology), a cross sectional view of flow through the reclaimed mine interior (interior flow), and a cross sectional view of a regional flow system (regional hydrology). The simulation model solved for the piezometric head distribution in each system. For each simulation the piezometric head contours were plotted, and in some cases, the increase in flux induced by the mine properties, and the contact time of water passing through the reclaimed spoil were calculated. Although only {{the flow of water}} through the spoil was modeled, water quality effects were inferred through a set of indices dealing with the reclaimed mine size and amount of water passing through it. The effects of a reclaimed mine were studied in the local and interior flow simulations. The influence of an operational mine was examined in the regional simulation. In all cases, the long term impacts were simulated by solving for the steady state condition. Regional location is found {{to be the most important}} factor in {{the influence of}} an operational mine on groundwater resources. Relative transmissivity is the most important factor in determining the influence of a reclaimed mine. When present, the rubble layer dominates the flow pattern through the mine spoil. The coal wedges are apparently of little hydrologic consequence. Equidimensional mine shapes are preferred to elongated shapes because they induce the least amount of flow through the spoil per unit extracted coal.

30|$|In {{this type}} of problems, an {{underwater}} generated bubble by an explosion is considered when it reaches a place {{very close to the}} free surface in its latest part of migration toward the water surface. Obviously, it has a large internal pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure. It will rise toward the water level and burst suddenly. Once the bubble collapses, this is often accompanied by a jet shooting up {{from the bottom of the}} bubble. When the thrown water particles loss their kinetic energy and attain to the possible maximum height, they will fall back due to the <b>gravity.</b> During this <b>sort</b> of events, the free surface of water starts to oscillate due to primary and secondary disturbances that are generated by surface deformation and impact of fallen water particles, respectively. Consequently, a second peak or more may appear before water-free surface major deformation decreases progressively via wave propagation toward the far field, (Kedrinskii [46] and Ni et al. [47]).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Separation {{of plastic}} from {{various types of}} waste streams {{represents}} one of major problematic process in energy recovery through different thermochemical processes. The sorting of plastics is a very essential step in different waste management technique. Manual sorting is suitable when plastic component are present in large amount {{but it is a}} labor intensive process. In automated sorting technique NIR(near infrared) offers great advantage among all wave sorting technique but not suited for dark coloured plastic and can be used on transparent bodies. In air sorting lighter particles are separated from heavier ones based on specific <b>gravity.</b> In electrostatic <b>sorting</b> method materials are separated based on electrostatic charge. In float-sink separation technique the plastics are in a fluid that has density in between the materials making it possible for less dense material to float and heavier to sink whereas sorting by selective dissolution is based on batch dissolution of mixed plastics using solvents. Hydrocyclones enhance the difference of specific weight by centrifugal force so materials with little difference can be separated as well. The presen...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} the tectono- sedimentary evolution of aMiddle Jurassic, rift-related supra-detachment basin of the ancientAlpineTethysmargin exposed in theCentralAlps (SE Switzerland). Based on pre- Alpine restoration, we {{demonstrate that the}} rift basin developed over a detachment system that is traced over more than 40 km from thinned continental crust to exhumed mantle. The detachment faults are overlain by extensional allochthons consisting of upper crustal rocks and pre-rift sediments up to several kilometres long and several hundreds of metres thick, compartmentalizing the distal margin into sub-basins. We mapped and restored one of these sub-basins, the Samedan Basin. It consists of aV- shape geometry in map view,which is con¢ned by extensional allochthons and £oored by a detachment fault. It can be restored over a minimum distance of 11 km along and about 4 km perpendicular to the basin axis. Its sedimentary in¢ll can be subdivided into basal (initial), intermediate (widening) and top (post-tectonic) facies tracts. These tracts document (1) formation of the basin initially bounded by high-angle faults and developing into low-angle detachment faults, (2) widening of the basin and (3) migration of deformation further outboard. The basal facies tract is made of locally derived, poorly <b>sorted</b> <b>gravity</b> £owdeposits that show a progressive change from hangingwall to footwall-derived lithologies. Upsection the sediments develop into turbidity current deposits that show retrogradation (intermediate facies tract) and starvation of the sedimentary system (post-tectonic facies tract). On {{the scale of the}} distal margin, the syn-tectonic record documents a thinning- and ¢ning-upward sequence related to the back stepping of the tectonically derived sediment source, progressive starvation of the sedimentary system and migration of deformation resulting in exhumation and progressive delamination of the thinned crust during ¢nal rifting. This study provides valuable insights into the tectono- sedimentary evolution and stratigraphic architecture of a supra-detachment basin formed over hyper- extended crust...|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} seismic {{anisotropy}} is non-unique, {{a range of}} phenomena may cause Earth materials to display seismic anisotropy. The anisotropy may be strongly dependent on wavelength if it {{is due to the}} average properties of aligned or partially aligned heterogeneity. A solid has intrinsic anisotropy when it is homogeneously and sinuously anisotropic down to the smallest particle size, which may be due to crystalline anisotropy. Relevant crystallographic anisotropy {{can be found in the}} upper mantle. When an otherwise isotropic rock contains a distribution of dry or liquid-filled cracks which have preferred orientation it is named crack induced anisotropy. The presence of aligned cracks, open or filled with some different material, is an important mechanism at shallow depth, in the crust. It is well known that the small-scale, or microstructural, factors include (e.g. Kern & Wenk 1985; Mainprice et al. 2003): (1) crystal lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of constituent mineral phases; (2) variations in spatial distribution of grains and minerals; (3) grain morphology and (4) aligned fractures, cracks and pores, and the nature of their infilling material (e.g. clays, hydrocarbons, water, etc.). Because of the overall microstructural control on seismic anisotropy, it follows that anisotropy can be diagnostic for specific rock types. Here, we consider whether seismic anisotropy can be used as an indicator of specific sedimentary lithologies within the Earth’s crust.In sedimentary rocks, anisotropy develops during and after deposition. For anisotropy to develop, there needs to be some degree of homogeneity or uniformity from point to point in the deposited clastics. During deposition, anisotropy is caused by the periodic layering associated with changes in sediment type which produces materials of different grain size, and also by the directionality of the transporting medium which tends to order the grains under <b>gravity</b> by grain <b>sorting.</b> Fracturing and some diagenetic processes such as compaction and dewatering of clays, and alteration etc. are post depositional processes that can cause anisotropy [...]|$|R
60|$|I was {{not left}} without society. My {{landlord}} {{had a very}} pretty little daughter whom we shall call Lizzie. If I had made any notes at the time, I {{might be able to}} tell you something definite of her appearance. But faces have a trick of growing more and more spiritualised and abstract in the memory, until nothing remains of them but a look, a haunting expression; just that secret quality in a face that is apt to slip out somehow under the cunningest painter's touch, and leave the portrait dead for the lack of it. And if it is hard to catch with the finest of camel's hair pencils, you may think how hopeless it must be to pursue after it with clumsy words. If I say, for instance, that this look, which I remember as Lizzie, was something wistful that seemed partly to come of slyness and in part of simplicity, and that I am inclined to imagine it had something to do with the daintiest suspicion of a cast in one of her large eyes, I shall have said all that I can, and the reader will not be much advanced towards comprehension. I had struck up an acquaintance with this little damsel in the morning, and professed much interest in her dolls, and an impatient desire to see the large one which was kept locked away for great occasions. And so I had not been very long in the parlour before the door opened, and in came Miss Lizzie with two dolls tucked clumsily under her arm. She was followed by her brother John, a year or so younger than herself, not simply to play propriety at our interview, but to show his own two whips in emulation of his sister's dolls. I did my best to make myself agreeable to my visitors, showing much admiration for the dolls and dolls' dresses, and, with a very serious demeanour, asking many questions about their age and character. I did not think that Lizzie distrusted my sincerity, but it was evident she was both bewildered and a little contemptuous. Although she was ready herself to treat her dolls as if they were alive, she seemed to think rather poorly of any grown person who could fall heartily into the spirit of the fiction. Sometimes she would look at me with <b>gravity</b> and a <b>sort</b> of disquietude, as though she really feared I must be out of my wits. Sometimes, as when I inquired too particularly into the question of their names, she laughed at me so long and heartily that I began to feel almost embarrassed. But when, in an evil moment, I asked to be allowed to kiss one of them, she could keep herself no longer to herself. Clambering down from the chair on which she sat perched to show me, Cornelia-like, her jewels, she ran straight out of the room and into the bar--it was just across the passage,--and I could hear her telling her mother in loud tones, but apparently more in sorrow than in merriment, that the gentleman in the parlour wanted to kiss Dolly. I fancy she was determined to save me from this humiliating action, even in spite of myself, for she never gave me the desired permission. She reminded me of an old dog I once knew, who would never suffer the master of the house to dance, out of an exaggerated sense of the dignity of that master's place and carriage.|$|R
