40|$|Abstract Background Most {{analyses}} of microarray data {{are based on}} point estimates of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates. By determining uncertainties from Affymetrix GeneChip data and propagating these uncertainties to downstream analyses {{it has been shown}} that we can improve results of <b>differential</b> expression <b>detection,</b> principal component analysis and clustering. Previously, implementations of these uncertainty propagation methods have only been available as separate packages, written in different languages. Previous implementations have also suffered from being very costly to compute, and in the case of <b>differential</b> expression <b>detection,</b> have been limited in the experimental designs to which they can be applied. Results puma is a Bioconductor package incorporating a suite of analysis methods for use on Affymetrix GeneChip data. puma extends the <b>differential</b> expression <b>detection</b> methods of previous work from the 2 -class case to the multi-factorial case. puma can be used to automatically create design and contrast matrices for typical experimental designs, which can be used both within the package itself but also in other Bioconductor packages. The implementation of <b>differential</b> expression <b>detection</b> methods has been parallelised leading to significant decreases in processing time on a range of computer architectures. puma incorporates the first R implementation of an uncertainty propagation version of principal component analysis, and an implementation of a clustering method based on uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques are brought together in a single, easy-to-use package with clear, task-based documentation. Conclusion For the first time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation methods available to a general audience. These methods can be used to improve results from more traditional {{analyses of}} microarray data. puma also offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously available methods. puma is recommended for anyone working with the Affymetrix GeneChip platform for gene expression analysis and can also be applied more generally. </p...|$|R

Secondly, the sundry particles (apparently from the constellation Cygnus) would have travelled through the Earth itself before reaching SUPL's instruments.

[...] More objective methods for assessing CWBs include disciplinary records, absentee records, and job performance statistics. [...] Each of these methods present potential problems in the measurement of CWBs. For example, self-reports always {{have the potential for}} bias with individuals trying to cast themselves in a good light. [...] Self-reports may also cause problems for researchers when they measure what an incumbent 'can-do' and what an incumbent 'will-do.' [...] Peer and supervisor reports can suffer from personal bias, but they also suffer from lack of knowledge of the private behaviors of the job incumbent whose behavior is being studied. [...] Archival records suffer from lack of information about the private behaviors of incumbents, providing instead information about instances where incumbents are caught engaging in CWBs.

In this paper, based on the minimum BER criterion, we investigate cooperating-user-selection (CUS) and adaptive-power-allocation (APA) for two types of differentially modulated cooperative cellular uplinks requiring no channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, namely, for the differential-amplify-and-forward (DAF) and the selective differential-decode-and-forward (DDF) assisted systems. They both employ multiple-symbol <b>differential</b> sphere <b>detection</b> (MSDSD) to combat rapid-fading-induced performance degradation.

40|$|An {{effective}} frequency offset acquisition technique based on <b>differential</b> <b>detection</b> for wireless orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication is investigated. By {{taking advantage of}} differentially coherent detection involving coherent cross-correlation extraction and subsequent <b>differential</b> <b>detection,</b> data-aided frequency acquisition assisted by frequency-domain pseudo-noise (PN) matched filters (MF’s) reduces probabilities of false alarm and miss over a propagation channel with a sufficiently wide coherence bandwidth than its noncoherent counterpart can. Furthermore, the proposed technique achieves low probabilities of false alarm and miss on a severe multipath fading channel by exploiting the inherent frequency diversity with maximum ratio combining (MRC) while exploiting subcarrier-level <b>differential</b> <b>detection</b> and subsequent coherent cross-correlation accumulation. To realize the subcarrier-level <b>differential</b> <b>detection</b> approach proposed here, the in-lock sequence must be modified by taking into consideration the self-interference caused by Rayleigh fading; and the out-of-lock sequence must be re-modeled {{by means of the}} discrete Wiener process.
