40|$|Abstract. Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) is an {{approach}} showing {{main sources of}} emission and flows of pollution to the environment, which allows to define possible environmental risk. Total identified mercury <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> soil and water in Poland for year 2010 from anthropogenic sources was estimated as 18. 0 Mg. Annual Hg <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> from by-product sources was equal 13. 5 Mg, with the highest share of emission from brown coal-fired power plants. Mercury contained in combustion residues and removed from flue gases is transferred to waste waters, disposed to landfills and used to a concrete production with unknown amounts. Annual mercury <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> {{from the use of}} mercury-containing products (0. 5 Mg) was estimated by authors based on model for distribution and emissions for batteries, light sources, other electrical and electronic equipment and also for measuring and control equipment. <b>Emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> from dental practice (0. 3 Mg) was estimated for combustion of wastes containing dental amalgam and from bodies cremation. SFA for the use of mercury-containing products and dental practice presents significant load of 10. 4 Mg mercury contained in hazardous wastes produced annually. It covers wastes of used products, dental amalgam wastes directly from clinics as well as stream from incineration of infectious dental wastes. In the paper mercury discharges to water from large and medium industrial facilities (2. 9 Mg) and municipal waste-water treatment plants in large agglomerations (0. 4 Mg) are presented. Smaller loads are generates by leachate transfer from municipal landfills to WWTPs and further to agriculture and also by releases from dental amalgam in buried bodies.

We examined the relationships between methane (CH 4) emission and temperature in two marsh stands dominated by the Phragmites australis and Cyperus malaccensis, respectively, in a subtropical estuarine wetland in southeast China based on three years of measurement data (2007 - 2009). We found that the Q 10 coefficient of CH 4 emission to soil temperature (Qs 10) from the two marsh stands varied slightly over the three years (P > 0. 05), with a mean value of 3. 38 ± 0. 46 and 3. 89 ± 0. 41 for the P. australis and C. malaccensis stands, respectively.

For this purpose, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied according to the ISO 14040 : 2006 and 14044 : 2006. All data used were collected on site based on observations during site visits, review of documents and interviews with technical personnel and management. They were processed by using SimaPro 7. 3. 3, accessing the Ecoinvent v. 2. 2 database and using the Impact 2002 þ method.

40|$|Comparisons of {{measured}} and model-predicted atmospheric copper concentrations show a severe underestimation {{of the observed}} concentrations by the models. This underestimation may be (partly) due to underestimated emissions of copper to air. Since the phase out of asbestos brake lining material, the composition of brake lining material has changed and may contain up to ∼ 15 % copper. This makes brake wear from vehicles potentially {{an important source of}} atmospheric (particulate) copper concentrations. In this paper, we reassess the copper emissions due to exhaust emissions and brake wear from road transport. Overall, our reassessments result in an estimate of total copper <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> in UNECE-Europe of 4. 0 - 5. 5 ktonnes yr- 1, which is substantially higher than the previous estimate of 2. 8 ktonnes yr- 1. Copper concentrations over Europe are calculated with the LOTOS-EUROS model using the revised emission data as model input. The results show that the revised emission estimates are a major step towards gap closure of predicted versus observed copper concentrations in ambient air. Brake wear emissions may be responsible for 50 - 75 % of the total copper emissions to air for most of Western Europe. The hypothesis that road transport is an important source of copper emissions is tested and confirmed by (1) reviewing available literature data of chemically speciated PM data from road tunnel studies and (2) the gradient observed in copper concentrations from ambient PM monitoring going from rural sites to street stations. The literature review and observational data suggest {{that the majority of the}} emitted PM 10 brake wear particles is in the PM 2. 5 - 10 size range. The results of this study indicate that modification of brake lining composition is an important mitigation option to reduce copper exposure of the population in Western Europe. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Regulations have entered into force or will in the near future, which will force shipowners to reduce the air emissions from their vessels. Multiple technologies or operational measures reducing these main pollutants are available and the term air emission control has here been defined as any effort made by ship-owners, operators or designers {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> from a vessel. Knowing which air emission control to install and when to do so to comply with regulations is a challenging decision problem. This thesis develops optimization models for selecting air emission controls enabling a ship to comply with air emission regulations. This work consists of four papers. The first one establishes the air emission reduction problem in shipping and presents a deterministic optimization problem solving it. The three following papers are extensions of this model adding different aspects to the problem, respectively: Design phase, uncertainty and non-financial decision criteria. The thesis aims to answer the four following research questions: RQ 1 : Can the real-life problem of selecting air emission controls be efficiently captured in an optimization model? RQ 2 : Which specific problem aspects that are not currently being taken into account, such as interaction effects, should be part of this model?

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{comparative}} {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) of a fuel cell and a gas engine. It includes emission release over a lifetime, and recommendations to which system to install in operating vessels today. IMO and MARPOL are the main regulators of emission at sea. An increased focus on the marine environment has provided new regulations to limit the impact from ships. Emission to sea has lately been given much attention; dangerous substances have been trapped in local food chains and disturbed the eco-systems. It is assumed that regulations today are to be followed up by stricter limits in the future. Both the fuel cell and the gas engine are solutions which reduce <b>emission</b> <b>to</b> <b>air.</b> The {{results of the study}} show a large impact from fuel cell materials. This is mainly harmful to the various ecosystems, and the marine ecosystem is the largest impact category. The fuel cell is a more efficient solution with lower fuel consumption. Because of the electrolyte reaction, there is no combustion process. This gives low CO 2 and NO x emissions and approximately zero SO x and PM emissions. This result in a 30 % global warming potential reduction compared to the gas engine. Evaluating the results we found the gas engine to be the best solution at the moment. This is based on an overall evaluation of the environmental impact. In addition to this, the capital cost is low. Fuel cell technology is not developed enough to meet today’s standards. To be able to install a fuel cell delivering energy supply to a whole ship, the volume per kW output has to decrease and the lifetime has to be increased. Increased lifetime does not only reduce the environmental impact, it reduces the capital cost as well. The fuel cell has better operational qualities, {{especially when it comes to}} global warming impact. In the future the use of fuel cells can be an important tool to reduce the CO 2 emission and other emissions to air. </p...|$|E
