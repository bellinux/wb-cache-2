40|$|Parameter {{estimation}} of the spatial auto-regression model (SAR) is important because we can model the spatial dependency, i. e., spatial autocorrelation present in the geo-spatial data. SAR is a popular data mining technique used in many <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>application</b> domains such as regional economics, ecology, environmental management, public safety, public health, transportation, and business. However, it is computationally expensive {{because of the need}} to compute the logarithm of the determinant of a large matrix due to Maximum Likelihood Theory (ML). Current approaches are computationally expensive, memory-intensive and not scalable. In this paper, we propose a new ML-based approximate SAR model solution based on the Gauss-Lanczos algorithm and compare the proposed solution with two other ML-based approximate SAR model solutions, namely Taylor's series, and Chebyshev polynomials. We also algebraically ranked these methods. Experiments showed that the proposed algorithm gives better results than the related approaches when the data is strongly correlated and problem size is large...|$|E
40|$|Part 6 : Human Interaction and Human Factors Driving Future EIS/EDSS DevelopmentsInternational audienceResults {{from global}} and {{regional}} climate scenario modelling predict {{significant changes in}} temperature and precipitation {{during the rest of}} the century. Episodes with extremely high temperatures and more intense rainfall will occur more often. Climate change will affect the urban environment and should be taken into account in long term and sustainable urban planning for adaptation to the new climate conditions. To consider the effects of climate change in today’s planning, tools are needed to support the development of climate change enabled applications. These tools have to support several aspects of application development in the context of EDSS: a) How can the results from climate change models be integrated in today’s applications? b) How to access climate change information? c) How to compare local effects of climate change scenarios? d) How to gain access to downscaling functionality required for local problems? e) How to feed local models with climate scenario data. Or in other words: How to build climate change enabled applications. Within the FP 7 project SUDPLAN, which integrates environmental modelling and software expertise, a system of standardised services and end user applications has been developed. The system delivers long term projections of environmental data for different aspects of local modelling (air quality, hydrological conditions and intense rainfall) based on different climate scenarios. The services are interactive and require input of local observations to improve downscaled projections. This is necessary to support wide applicability as the resolution requirements of local models can be very different. All services are provided through standardized service interfaces. On top of these services, the so-called Scenario Management System (SMS) provides end user components for scenario management, visualisation, model integration as well as wizards to support the relevant workflows and the interaction with common downscaling services. The SMS is based on the <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>application</b> suite CIDS which allows to build decision support systems (DSS) with a focus on using climate change projections in the workflow...|$|E
40|$|Many <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications</b> are {{explicitly}} or implicitly {{designed with}} {{the premise that the}} user will be able to devote full attention to the interaction. However, in many situations where <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications</b> will be used, there are primary tasks, such as driving an automobile or pedestrian navigation. In these scenarios, the interaction is secondary or supplemental. In this paper, we differentiate between applications and tasks where geo-spatial interaction can be the primary activity, and where it must be relegated as a secondary activity. We examine some issues related to interaction as a secondary task, and discuss whether current techniques that support interaction as a primary task still hold if the task is secondary...|$|R

40|$|Background With {{the advent}} of rich {{internet}} applications (RIA’s), part of processing has been transferred from the server to the client. However, many <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications</b> still require serverside access to a geodatabase to select and manipulate data using SQL. It would be profitable if these actions could be handled by an {{out of the box}} serverside component, thus eliminating the need {{for the development of a}} custom serverside component. Can OGC standards like WMS and WFS play a role here? Since WFS-T provides select, insert, delete and update methods much like SQL, it was decided to investigate whether the WFS-T implementation specification could replace SQL when developing complex <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications.</b> Or is SQL still needed? Method To answer this research question, this approach was tested during the development of several tailor made internet GIS applications: - a wheater and crop growth monitoring system; - a discussion support system for the water domain; - a national cultural heritage portal. Results Filtering and manipulating serverside data by WFS-T using the OpenGIS Filter Encoding Standard (FES) fullfills the needs to a large extent. Almost all of the desired functionality is there. There is one major limitation: FES lacks the ability to define a filter expression based on a joined table. Dependant on the implementation a work around may be available. Xml-schemas support 1 -to-many relationships. They can be implemented as a joined table, which as a result can be queried. For larger datasets - a couple of ten thousand records or more - WFS-T tends to end up with a bad performance. Larger datasets should be processed serverside. Downloading large amounts of data and processing them clientside is too time-consuming. Compared to SQL WFS-T has less possibilities to influence the serverside performance. So for performance reasons SQL stays inevitable to handle larger datasets...|$|R

Many of these applications rely on the innovativc use of several technologies, including remote sensing, global positioning systems (GPS), and telecommunication, all of which require satellite technology to be feasible and accessible globally.

Despite wide applications in Web-based services and their many benefits, <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications</b> based on cloud computing technology are still developing. Auto-scaling realizes automatic scalability, i. e., the scale-out and scale-in processing of virtual servers in a cloud computing environment. This study investigates the applicability of auto-scaling to geo-based image processing algorithms by comparing {{the performance of a}} single virtual server and multiple auto-scaled virtual servers under identical experimental conditions. In this study, the cloud computing environment is built with OpenStack, and four algorithms from the Orfeo toolbox are used for practical geo-based image processing experiments. The auto-scaling results from all experimental performance tests demonstrate applicable significance with respect to cloud utilization concerning response time.

40|$|Abstract. Infrastructures like transportation, power, and {{pipeline}} networks {{which are}} characterized by a spatial embedding are known as spatial networks. Spatial networks are ubiquitous in our everyday life and used in transport, navigation, and city planning {{as well as in}} Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and other <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications.</b> The largely increasing amount of generated data about spatial networks can only be efficiently stored and analyzed in a database system. However database support for large spatial networks in order to represent, store, query, and manipulate them is rare. This article aims to provide a conceptual, abstract, and formal model of spatial networks, called Spatial Network Algebra (SNA). It includes data types, operations, and predicates and serves as a specification for their later implementation in spatial database systems and GIS. Finally, we show how our spatial network concepts can be embedded into an SQL-like query language...|$|R
40|$|In many <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications,</b> {{freehand}} sketch maps are considered as an intuitive way to collect user-generated spatial information. The task of automatically mapping information from such hand-drawn sketch maps to geo-referenced maps {{is known as}} the alignment task. Researchers have proposed various qualitative representations to capture distorted and generalized spatial information in sketch maps, however thus far the effectiveness of these representations has not been evaluated {{in the context of an}} alignment task. This paper empirically evaluates a set of cognitively plausible representations for alignment using real sketch maps collected from two different study areas with the corresponding geo-referenced maps. Firstly, the representations are evaluated in a single-aspect alignment approach by demonstrating the alignment of maps for each individual sketch aspect. Secondly, representations are evaluated across multiple sketch aspects using more than one representation in the alignment task. The evaluations demonstrated the suitability of the chosen representation for aligning user-generated content with geo-referenced maps in a real-world scenario...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} within the map generalization research community that open research platforms will allow closer integration in terms of collaborative research, data abstractions, interoperability of functional components, and the augmentation of <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications</b> with generalization capabilities. This chapter describes the authors' experiences in developing systems to support collaborative research in map generalization. The increasing complexity of methods used in generalization research together with growing demands for generalization processing to support a myriad of new geospatial services and technologies has led researchers to investigate how open architectures might better support such changing needs. The chapter explains two such requirements: to share generalization techniques among researchers within the field and to present generalization functionality externally to geographic services.

40|$|The {{automatic}} segmentation of {{land cover}} features, within very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, {{is a complex}} task which is important to <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications</b> such as urban planning, crop monitoring and change detection. The dynamic grey-value variety of VHR imagery, along with environmental interference factors, such as cloud cover and poor lighting, impede the automation of land cover segmentation. The Fuzzy Band Ratio Hierarchical Split Merge Refinement (FBR HSMR) algorithm (Wuest and Zhang, 2008) presents a successful method for land cover segmentation through well known Band Ratios and Fuzzy Logic based comparison measures using the region-based Hierarchical Split Merge Refinement (HSMR) algorithmic framework. This paper is the presentation {{of an attempt to}} improve the automation of the FBR HSMR. In this approach, class development for region description and comparison is dynamically determined in contrast to static class development through Band Ratios. Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is employed for dynamic class development because of its unsupervised self-organizing capabilities and ability to estimate classes without initial estimates. In addition, users can control input to class development through input vector type selection. It is hypothesized that this approach will i) improve the automation of the FBR HSMR segmentation methodology and ii) expand the capabilities of the FBR HSMR to provide land cover segmentation to a wider range of satellite image scenes. 1...|$|R
40|$|Several {{important}} {{concepts are}} presented {{one after another}} {{in the field of}} Cartography and GIS (geography information system) recently. The idea of “Citizens as Voluntary Sensors ” describes the cooperative production of geo-spatial information and sharing of geo-spatial knowledge in a more persuasive way (Goodchild 2007). The trend towards the "Wikification of GIS " and geography without geographers (Daniel Z. Sui 2008) lets everybody participate in the developing of the four components of GIS including geo-spatial data, software, hardware and people. It also changes <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications</b> and even basic GIScience questions dramatically. With the arrival of "the New Era of Geography " (Li D R and Shao Z F 2009), serviced users are extended from professionals to all public users and geospatial data are measurement-on-demand through smart sensor web. Google Earth/Maps is changing the way we see the world (Ratliff E. 2007). A volunteer army of amateur cartographers is collaborated in a sprawling, networked geoweb atlas. Mapmaking power is within the grasp of a 12 -year-old with support of tools from Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo nowadays. The map designers usually are the same person as the map readers.

However, {{the majority of}} publicly available imagery from online communities lack a reasonable exact location and orientation information, which is important for many <b>geo-spatial</b> <b>applications</b> like object geo-referencing, knowledge transfer or augmented reality. In this work we exploit publicly available drone videos in order {{to bridge the gap}} between ground and aerial imagery. We propose a framework for the fast determination of full 6 -D georeferenced motion trajectories of online community drone video footage using geo-localized map data. Our method requires the registration of a single video frame from an video sequence in order to exactly geo-reference complete motion trajectories w. r. t. to existing geo-referenced map data. The method relies on SfM and SLAM techniques in combination with a simple, yet efficient appearance and structure matching based on rendered map data (e. g. Li-DAR) in order to generate geo-registered 3 D feature maps. These maps enable a simple and fast global appearance based geo-registration of visually overlapping community videos and images. We evaluate our method on a large set of community drone videos. Our method produces drift free geo-data overlays at an average speed of 29 : 7 frames per second with an average positional error of 0 : 4 m. In addition we release a large scale processed LiDAR dataset and geo-registered feature maps as an extension to the converging perspectives dataset. This data may provide visual links from ground based sensors to aerial imagery. Possible applications are numerous and include autonomous navigation, map updating/extension, image and video dehazing, object localisation or augmented reality...|$|R

The advent of powerful computing has revolutionized the rather conservative surveying world, widened its scope and popularized the domain of <b>geo-spatial</b> engineering. <b>Applications</b> such as GPS-navigation, Google Earth or Street-view are publicly adapted. Traditional surveying research has now become a wide, multi-disciplinary field, commonly referred to as Geomatics. The art of obtaining accurate and complete positional information is still an important aspect of Geomatics research and has undergone important changes in the last decade as well. Laser scanners have become affordable and photogrammetry –traditionally a playground for experts processing aerial imagery– now yields 3 D models from close-range images, taken on the ground or with drones.

40|$|Abstract. Finding a {{convenient}} meeting {{point for a}} group is a common problem. For example, a group of users may want to meet at a restaurant that minimizes the group’s total travel distance. Such queries are called Group Nearest Neighbor (GNN) queries. Up to now, users have {{had to rely on}} an external party, typically a location service provider (LSP), for computing an optimal meeting point. This implies that users have to trust the LSP with their private locations. Existing tech-niques for private GNN queries either cannot resist sophisticated attacks or are computationally too expensive to be implemented on the popular platform of mo-bile phones. This paper proposes an algorithm to efficiently process private GNN queries. To achieve high efficiency we propose an approach that approximates a GNN with a high accuracy and is robust to attacks. Unlike methods based on ob-fuscation, our method does not require a user to provide an imprecise location and is in fact location oblivious. Our approach is based on a distributed secure sum protocol which requires only light weight computation. Our experimental results show that we provide a readily deployable solution for real life applications which can also be deployed for other <b>geo-spatial</b> queries and <b>applications.</b> ...|$|R
