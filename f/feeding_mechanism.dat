5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|They {{possess a}} unique <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> known as suction feeding. Instead of {{catching}} their prey with teeth, it is sucked into their oral cavity. Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is distended, the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in with the water. The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E

500|$|The early Cambrian sessile frond-like fossil Stromatoveris, from China's Chengjiang lagerstätte {{and dated}} to about , {{is very similar}} to Vendobionta of the {{preceding}} Ediacaran period. De-Gan Shu, Simon Conway Morris et al. found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia, used for filter feeding. They suggested that Stromatoveris was an evolutionary [...] "aunt" [...] of ctenophores, and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> to a propulsion system.|$|E
500|$|So far Kimberella fossils show {{no sign of}} a radula, the toothed chitinous [...] "tongue" [...] that is the {{diagnostic}} feature of modern molluscs, excluding bivalves. Since radulae are very rarely preserved in fossil molluscs, its absence {{does not necessarily mean that}} K. quadrata did not have one. The rocks in the immediate vicinity of Kimberella fossils bear scratch marks that have been compared to those made by the radulae of molluscs as they graze on microbial mats. These traces, named Radulichnus and Kimberichnus, have been interpreted as circumstantial evidence for the presence of a radula. In conjunction with the univalve shell, this has been taken to indicate Kimberella was a mollusc or very closely related to molluscs. In 2001 and 2007 Fedonkin suggested that the <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> might be a retractable proboscis with hook-like organs at its end. Kimberella′s feeding apparatus appears to differ significantly from the typical mollusc radula, and this demonstrates that Kimberella is at best a stem-group mollusc. [...] Notably, the scratch marks indicate that the 'teeth' were dragged towards the organism, not pushed away as in molluscs, and that the maximum impact on the sediment was when the mouthpart was furthest from the organism. [...] The direction of grazing is also backwards, as opposed to forwards as in molluscs. [...] Furthermore, the constant width of grooves implies stereoglossy – a trait that is very derived in molluscs. It has been argued that the shape of the feeding traces is incompatible with a radula, and that despite the molluscan body form, the lack of a radula places Kimberella well outside the molluscan crown group. [...] Butterfield points out that plenty of other groups of organisms bear structures capable of making similar marks.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the [...] "last gunfighter" [...] moniker, the F-8s {{achieved}} {{only four}} victories with their cannon; the remainder were accomplished with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, {{partly due to}} the propensity of the 20mm (.79in) Colt Mk 12 cannons' <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> to jam under G-loading during high-speed dogfighting maneuvers. Between June and July 1966, during 12 engagements over North Vietnam, Crusaders claimed four MiG-17s for two losses. The Crusader would claim the best kill ratio of any American type in the Vietnam War, 19:3. Of the 19 aircraft claimed during aerial combat, 16 were MiG-17s and three were MiG-21s. U.S. records only indicate 3 F-8s lost in aerial combat, all to MiG-17 cannon fire in 1966, but the VPAF claimed 11 F-8s were shot down by MiGs. A total of 170 F-8 Crusaders would be lost to all causes – mostly ground fire and accidents -during the war.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> face {{a special}} {{difficulty}} {{as compared to}} feeding on land, because the density of water {{is about the same}} as that of the prey, so the prey tends to be pushed away when the mouth is closed. This problem was first identified by Robert McNeill Alexander. As a result, underwater predators, especially bony fish, have evolved a number of specialized <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as filter feeding, ram feeding, suction feeding, protrusion, and pivot feeding.|$|R

2500|$|The LMG {{design is}} a {{traditionally}} laid-out machine-gun. It has several features conducive to its {{use as a}} light machine gun, such as a quick-change barrel, a vented fore-grip, a belt <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism,</b> provisions {{for the use of}} an ammunition pouch, and a rate of fire of approximately 600 RPM. [...] Other features include its light weight, an ammunition counter, and a highly stiff and heat resistant barrel achieved with the use of fluting and specialized alloys. [...] When firing, the weapon's chamber swings around a longitudinal pivot; it swings from horizontally parallel with the pivot (the firing position) to vertically parallel (the feed position), and back again. [...] A long-stroke gas-piston is used to operate this action. [...] A round is fed into the chamber at the feed position using a rammer, and the new round also serves to push a spent or dud round out of {{the far end of the}} chamber. [...] Such rounds are pushed forward, parallel to the barrel, and they slide into a separate mechanism that ejects them out of one side of the gun. [...] The advantages of this whole action include its simplicity, its isolation of the chamber from barrel heat, and its positive control of round movement from extraction to ejection. [...] In the caseless firing version of the weapon, another mechanism is introduced to seal the chamber during firing, accounting for the slightly increased weight of the caseless version.|$|E
