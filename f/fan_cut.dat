By calculating the flux of fluid and sediment into the crater, {{we find that the}} crater cavity was flooded for at least months and that the time of active fluvial sediment transport without hiatus is on the order of decades to centuries, with a preferred timescale of centuries. We also calculate the total amount of water required to transport the volume of sediment we measure in Milna and conclude that impacts alone are likely insufficient to deliver enough water to Milna to allow the sedimentary fill we see.

40|$|In this paper, {{effect of}} {{geometric}} parameters of a centrifugal fan with backward- and forward-curved blades has been investigated. Centrifugal fans {{are used for}} enhancing the heat dissipation from the IC engine surfaces. In the process, the fan consumes power generated from the engine. As a first step, an experimental setup was developed and prototypes of fans were made to carry out measurements of flow and power consumed by the fan. The fan mounting setup was such that fan with uniform blades can be tested. Generally, <b>fans</b> have <b>cut</b> blades on the vehicle due to mounting accessories. We describe a patented design of shaft that would enable mounting of fan with uniform blades on the vehicle. Next, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed for the above setup {{and the results are}} validated with the experimental measurement. Further, parametric studies were carried out to quantify the power coefficient, flow coefficient, efficiency and flow coefficients. The parameters considered in this study are number of blades, outlet angle and diameter ratio. The results suggest that fan with different blades would show same performance under high-pressure coefficient. However, the difference between the performances becomes distinct under low pressure coefficients suggesting that the fan performance testing should not be done on vehicle level where high pressure coefficients is observed due to various resistances in the system. The results show that increase in flow coefficient is accompanied by decrease in efficiency and increase in power coefficient. Effect on th...|$|R

A regional geological analysis indicates that three generations of alluvial <b>fans</b> are <b>cut</b> by the fault. Absolute (TL and U/Th) and relative datings show that the oldest fan is 300 ka old and the intermediate one is 125 ka old.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in electronic and optoelectronic devices, {{especially in the}} highly power-sensitive areas of portable and wearable applications, have led to increased challenges in their thermal management. Conventional rotary fans are difficult to scale down and power-inefficient when miniaturized. Piezoelectric fans, which typically consist of flexible blades mechanically fixed to piezoelectric actuators, are promising alternatives to rotary fans because they have simpler structures, produce less noise, and require less power consumption [1]. Although piezoelectric fans have been commercially available for over a decade, systematic study of their power consumption mechanism has been limited. A combined experimental and modeling study is conducted to help elucidate the mechanism of power dissipation in piezoelectric fans, and correlate them with heat transfer performance. Powers consumed by a commercially available piezoelectric fan and by its piezoelectric actuator (with the <b>fan</b> blade <b>cut</b> off) are measured separately {{as a function of}} frequency and bias input voltage. A mechanical model is next developed to theoretically partition the fraction of power transferred to the surrounding air and that portion consumed by the piezoelectric actuator. In parallel, the heat transfer coefficients over a heated flat surface are measured for a set of piezoelectric fans of different blade lengths and thicknesses to obtain insight into piezoelectric fans’ cooling enhancements normalized by power consumptions. It is observed that the power consumption predicted by the proposed model for a piezoelectric actuator (with the blade cut off) agrees with that measured. In addition, the model estimated flow power (power transferred to surrounding air) matches the difference between the separately measured total power consumption of the piezoelectric fan and that of its piezoelectric actuator, indicating the validity of the proposed model in partitioning the power consumption of a complete piezoelectric fan. It is also confirmed that the heat transfer performance of the piezoelectric fan is closely related to its induced flow power rather than the total power consumed. As will be discussed in following chapters, the “power efficiency of piezoelectric fan cooling” should be characterized by its flow power rather than total power consumption...|$|R
