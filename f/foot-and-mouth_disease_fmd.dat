The MAb 404 binds to the exposed flexible GH-loop of viral protein 1 (VP 1), which appears to retain its flexibility, allowing movement of the bound Fab. This is in striking contrast to MAb SD 6, which binds to the same GH-loop of VP 1 but exhibits no movement of the bound lab when observed under identical conditions. However, MAbs 4 C 4 and SD 6 have very similar neutralisation characteristics. The known atomic structure of FM DV C-S 8 cl {{and that of the}} 4 C 4 Fab cocrystallised with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the GH-loop of VP 1 were fitted to the cryoelectron microscope density map. The best fit of the 4 C 4 Fab is compatible only with monovalent binding of the MAb in agreement with the neutralisation data on 404 MAbs, Fab 2 s, and labs. The position of the bound GH-loop is related to other known positions of this loop by a hinge rotation about the base of the loop. The 4 C 4 Fab appears to interact almost exclusively with the G-H loop of VP 1, making no other contacts with the viral capsid. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

In swine immunized with pCEIS {{at the back of the}} ear, immune responses were achieved after the second administration. Swine showed a T-cell proliferative response with a stimulation index (SI) of up to 8. 1 and a neutralizing antibody response that was able to protect suckling mice from 10 (2) LD 50 (lethal dose 50) FMDV challenge. To compare the immunogenicity of the DNA-based vaccine candidate, Versus the protein-based Vaccine candidates, a second group of swine was immunized with the protein F 1 -sclgG, which was encoded by the plasmid pCEIS.

5000|$|Although these cattle {{were and}} are an {{important}} part of the pastoral economy of Africa, Diane Gifford-Gonzalez and others have found that cattle domestication in Eastern and Southern Africa was delayed by as much as a millennium past everywhere else. The tentative date for domestication of cattle is set around 9000 BP. Archaeologists that work at sites dating back to the 10th millennia; such as Nabta Playa, claim that cattle remains found at their sites come from domestic cattle. The basis of these archaeologist arguments is that cattle are not usually found with certain kinds of desert-adapted animals that they are also finding at these sites. Even so, Gifford-Gonzalez is not entirely sure that the genetic findings should be fully trusted as there is a wide-margin for errors in the findings. This delay occurred even though the ancestor of the modern, domestic cattle was originally from northern Africa. One cause of this delay may have been the uncharacteristically wet-period that went through eastern Africa from 12,500-7000 BP, where rainfall was 35% higher than it is today. This wet period caused all the lakes and rivers to rise dramatically and changed all the flora of the area so that they were less grassland-like and more forest-like. Once the rainfall dropped to more modern levels in 3000 BP, pastoralism picked up as well. Along with the steadying of the rains, there is also evidence of Nderit ceramics that appears in south-central Kenya between 5000 BP and 4000 BP. Nderit pottery found south of Lake Turkana is usually associated with local hunter-gatherers. Local hunter-gatherers may have adopted these ceramics and a few domestic animals while still practicing their hunting-and-gathering lifestyles. Another cause for the delay could have been due to disease of the cattle, such as Bovine Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF), which is almost 100% lethal for cattle. Another problem she found was the diseases that affect humans, such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF), East Coast Fever (ECF), <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (<b>FMD),</b> and trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). As of right now, it is impossible to tell if coming into contact with cattle caused epidemics of unfamiliar diseases.|$|E
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that the quasispecies nature (extreme genetic heterogeneity) of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> virus is relevant to the virus evading an immune response.
