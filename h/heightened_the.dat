Shuey was promoted from Kinston to the major leagues during the 1994 season, becoming the first player promoted from Class-A to the majors since Greg Swindell during the 1986 season. He made his MLB debut on May 8, 1994. On May 14, Shuey became the tenth American League pitcher to strike out four batters in an inning. He also pitched for the Charlotte Knights of the Class-AAA International League that season. Baseball America ranked Shuey as the 67th best prospect in baseball heading into the 1995 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} each {{game in the}} Myst series has fallen to various composers. Originally, the Millers {{believed}} that any music or sound besides ambient noise would distract the player from the game and ruin the sense of reality; Myst, therefore, was to have no music at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers that music <b>heightened</b> <b>the</b> sense of immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for Riven, which featured leitmotifs {{for each of the}} main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Rising {{tension between}} Japan and the United States {{stretched}} back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in the Mukden Incident. Japan's continued aggression, instigating the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and invading French Indochina in 1940to which the United States and European powers responded with embargoes on iron and oil importsfurther <b>heightened</b> <b>the</b> tension. The Japanese thereafter decided {{to attack the}} Western powers in Asia, beginning with a surprise attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Mahan was at sea with the aircraft carrier , three cruisers and four destroyers as part of Task Force 12. Lexingtons mission was to ferry Marine aircraft to reinforce Midway Island. After news {{of the attack on}} Pearl Harbor, the task-force commander received orders to terminate the ferry mission and to search for the Japanese strike force. Unable to locate them, the task force returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 December.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increased}} flood protection {{afforded by the}} Prado Dam, major industrial development migrating south from the Los Angeles Basin, and the Southern California housing boom in the 1950s and 1960s, the Santa Ana River watershed began its third and final transition—from agricultural to urban. The population of the Santa Ana River basin increased dramatically, but brought with it the threat of greater damage from floods, somewhat compromising the protection afforded by Prado Dam. Because housing and urban areas encroached on the river's historic floodplain—an area once occupied by farms—and the river became confined to a narrow channel—a flood {{similar to the ones}} surrounding the turn of the 20th century would cause much more damage. The construction of roads and buildings also <b>heightened</b> <b>the</b> runoff that would flow into the river during rainfall, a process known as urban runoff. In fact, the river flooded again in 1969, and while much of the runoff from the Inland Empire was captured behind Prado Dam—probably saving Orange County from an even greater flood—Santiago Creek, a large tributary flowing from the Santa Ana Mountains, eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in the cities of Tustin and Orange.|$|E

25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2000 revealed that poverty of Nicaraguan families <b>heightened</b> <b>the</b> risk of infant mortality.

In addition to income levels, {{it has been shown}} that violence against mothers increases the risk of infant and child mortality. Intimate partner abuse also contributes to low birth weight of infants. Overall decreasing national infant mortality trends correspond with higher educational levels of mothers and lower fertility rates.|$|E

Subsequent investigations found atypically high property tax rates, allegations of voter fraud in municipal elections and other irregularities which <b>heightened</b> <b>the</b> ensuing scandal.

25|$|Wallace’s {{objectives}} for the battle were simple: keep {{the road to}} Washington secure {{as long as possible}} and maintain a line of retreat for his men. On July 9, between 9 and 10 a.m., Confederate Maj. Gen.

Rodes's division clashed with Tyler's brigade, who was guarding the Baltimore Pike and its stone bridge across the river. Clendenin's Union cavalry was downstream, watching the river.
