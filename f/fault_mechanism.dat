40|$|Two {{microearthquake}} swarms {{occurring in}} Southeastern Sicily during November 1999 and January 2000 were analysed {{with respect to}} their seismotectonic features. Given the low magnitude of the events fault plane solutions for only four major events were computed, which revealed normal fault and inverse fault mechanisms. From the comparison of waveforms and the relation of P- and S-wave peak amplitudes, two families of multiplets were identified, each representing a distinct type of seismic dislocation. Composite fault plane solutions for the two families showed the same trends as for the single major events. The small number of mismatches of the composite solutions supports the hypothesis of two distinct types of seismic dislocation during the whole sequence, i. e. a normal <b>fault</b> <b>mechanism</b> along E-W striking planes and an inverse <b>fault</b> <b>mechanism</b> along NE-SW striking planes...|$|E

The epicenter determinations show that the first event in 04.01. 1935 was located at 40.72 N– 27.72 E, while the second one occurred at 40.61 N– 27.43 E, indicating that both were located near the Marmara Island. Another finding is that the 1963 event was located at 40.80 N– 29.18 E, near the Princes’ Island fault. Furthermore, moment tensor inversion method was applied on these earthquakes by using original seismograms, which provided an opportunity to illuminate the seismotectonic features of Marmara Region based on the retrieved <b>fault</b> <b>mechanism</b> solutions.

The <b>fault</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the Tottori earthquake is assumed to be a receiver <b>fault</b> <b>mechanism,</b> although the result is almost the same whether the <b>fault</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the 1927 Tango or that of the 2000 Tottori-Ken Seibu earthquake is used because they occurred on conjugate fault systems. The spatial correlations between the positive ΔCFF regions and recent seismicity are also found even if other fault models (e.g., Chinnery, 1961, 1964; Kanamori, 1972, 1973; Sato, 1973) are used as a source fault. Linear seismic activity along the source faults can be recognized. The Kita-Tajima earthquake (M 6.8) occurred on May 23, 1925, between the source region of the Tango and Tottori earthquakes, and current seismicity may include the aftershocks of this earthquake. Inclusion of the ΔCFF due to this earthquake in the analysis may enable a more reliable analysis; however, the detailed rupture process has not been revealed. The 1927 Tango earthquake increased the ΔCFF at the hypocenter of both the 1943 Tottori and the 1963 Wakasa Bay earthquakes (discussed later); the 1943 Tottori earthquake increased the ΔCFF by 0.1 bars at the hypocenter of the 2000 Tottori-Ken Seibu earthquake, and thus probably accelerated the earthquake occurrences.|$|E

Based on this general approach, a maturing layeredmanufacturing process is investigated, notably, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). We first show through experimental analysis that layer-thickness and part orientation affect surface quality. Using these experimental results, random-process analysis is carried out to determine the specific fault patterns. The quantification of these fault patterns leads to the identification of fault sources, which provide a foundation for monitoring and control.

By comparisons with seismic surveys in the Tonankai region, this earthquake could be interpreted as a rupture on the PHS interface, rather than on a mega-splay fault. First-motion analysis using a local 3 D velocity structure model provided additional constraints of the centroid depth, and results suggest that the rupture of the 2016 SE offshore Mie earthquake occurred on the PHS interface. Simulations of strong long-period ground motions using our MT solution for periods below 5  s practically reproduced the observed waveforms.|$|R

Many techniques {{have been developed for}} properly modeling the radial vibration of large hydro-turbine generator units. However, an applicable dynamic model has not yet been reported in literature due to the complexity of the boundary conditions and exciting forces. In this paper, a finite element (FE) rotor dynamic model of radial vibration taking account of operating conditions is proposed. A brief and practical database method is employed to model the guide bearing. Taking advantage of the method, rotating speed and bearing clearance can be considered in the model. A novel algorithm, which can take account of both transient and steady-state analysis, is proposed to solve the model. Dynamic response for rotor model of 125 MW hydro-turbine generator units in Gezhouba Power Station is simulated.
