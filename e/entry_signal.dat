2500|$|The track {{layout of}} each station {{shows that in}} 1899 the Gotthard railway ran on double-tracks from the villages of Flüelen to Giubiasco. Facing north {{the picture on the}} right shows the [...] at the Mondascia bridge depicts the double-tracks and advance signal to the <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> before Biasca (at132.5km), {{mentioned}} in the timetable. The next picture on the right shows the Pianotondo viaduct and the Pianotono-spiral tunnel's upper gate with its watchman's house, which came into use during the days of the double-track steam service, roughly {{at the time of the}} graphic timetable's validity.|$|E
2500|$|When Germany {{built its}} {{high-speed}} lines, {{beginning with the}} Fulda-Würzburg segment that started operation in 1987, it incorporated LZB into the lines. The lines were divided into blocks about [...] long, but instead of having a signal for every block, there are only fixed signals at switches and stations, with approximately [...] between them. If there was no train for the entire distance the <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> would be green. If the first block was occupied it would be red as usual. Otherwise, if the first block was free and a LZB train approached the signal would be dark and the train would proceed on LZB indications alone.|$|E
50|$|The station <b>entry</b> <b>signal,</b> {{which was}} set to Stop, is {{superseded}} by a Zs-1 subsidiary signal, which permits continuing travel at 40 km/h. This subsidiary signal, because it is in relationship to a station <b>entry</b> <b>signal,</b> is valid only until the next main signal is reached, {{in this case the}} station exit signal. Therefore, the train should have traveled through Brühl station at40 km/h.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas DeMark's {{indicators}} enjoy {{a remarkable}} endorsement {{in the financial}} industry. A recent work [...] has investigated the predictive power of three DeMark indicators (Sequential, Combo and Setup Trend), over 21 commodity futures markets and 10 years of data. Market <b>entry</b> <b>signals</b> have been tested by comparing conditional returns (i.e. conditioned on the <b>entry</b> <b>signals)</b> to unconditional returns. For the period from Jan. 2004 to Jan. 2014, the tests suggest statistically significant predictive power {{on a wide range}} of commodity futures.|$|R
50|$|H1s and L1s are {{considered}} reliable <b>entry</b> <b>signals</b> when the pull-back is a microtrend line break, and the H1 or L1 represents the break-out's failure.|$|R
50|$|Trains {{must stop}} here {{to wait for}} visual or verbal signal to proceed. Found on lightly-used lines where {{telephone}} block operation (without signals) is in force and at double-tracked lines at the left track at the entry to a station if no other signal is installed; it effectively replaces a station's <b>entry</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Train 168 {{had only}} {{travelled}} 130 m from the <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> at Vigerslev towards {{the direction of}} Brondbyøster. The boy who fell off the train had been found next to the track, he had survived with a broken leg. Meanwhile, the dispatcher ran towards Brondbyøster to signal the express train to stop with his lantern. The express train, however, was already nearing rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|Passenger train No 1308 from Budapest via Győr to Graz {{should have}} used track No 3, {{but had been}} {{inadvertently}} led to track No 2. The station master wanted to correct this mistake, but miscalculated {{the time that the}} delayed express train would need to reach the station. He ordered that the passenger train should move to track No 3. He secured this movement by displaying [...] "Stop" [...] at the <b>entry</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although the red <b>entry</b> <b>signals,</b> the red tail {{signals of}} train 168 and the dispatcher's lantern were {{visible to the}} {{engineer}} of the express train, the train didn't brake, as passengers in the train would later testify.|$|R
50|$|Leipzig-Wahren station did {{not receive}} a central signal box, only a signal box at its exit with a track-diagram relay {{interlocking}} of the GS II DR type. Also, colour-light signals were not installed throughout the station and were essentially only used as <b>entry</b> <b>signals</b> and on the passenger tracks. Electrodynamic track brakes were installed on the marshalling-yard hump.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is {{comparison}} of selected methods for prediction of the capital markets. It is about technical analysis methods, used to predict trend of share prices of the capital market and finding <b>entry</b> <b>signals</b> to buy stock and exit sinals to sell stock. Methods are analyzed for selected stock from SPAD, {{which is part of}} Prague Stock Exchange...|$|R
50|$|After {{the style}} of Brooks, the price action trader will place the initial stop order 1 tick below the bar that gave the <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> (if going long - or 1 tick above if going short) and if the market moves as expected, moves the stop order up to one tick below the entry bar, once the entry bar has closed and with further {{favourable}} movement, will seek to move the stop order up further to {{the same level as}} the entry, i.e. break-even.|$|E
50|$|Located at {{the site}} of the former tower station there is now only a simple station. The <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> to the freight yard from the {{direction}} of Aachen is located a few metres behind the platform. The station, which is located in the zone of the Aachener Verkehrsverbund (Aachen Transport Association), is used by about 2,000 passengers per day. Because Baal had become part of the municipality of Hückelhoven in 1972, it renamed Hückelhoven-Baal station in 2002. The station needs repairs and is to be rebuilt by the town (including the reactivation of the lift).|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after Cologne, in Hürth-Karlscheuren, {{the driver}} slowed the train per signal command to 60 km/h switch necessitated by line {{construction}} {{work on the}} track that D 203 was presently using. The train passed several switches and was running on the left-hand track. The driver correctly accelerated, as the track was approved for a speed of 130 km/h. D203 approached the station <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> to Brühl station at around 100 km/h. The distant signal (Vorsignal) indicated an [...] "Expect Stop" [...] signal, and the driver decelerated the train.|$|E
50|$|The {{support and}} {{resistance}} levels {{calculated from the}} pivot point and the previous market width {{may be used as}} exit points of trades, but are rarely used as <b>entry</b> <b>signals.</b> For example, if the market is up-trending and breaks through the pivot point, the first resistance level is often a good target to close a position, as the probability of resistance and reversal increases greatly.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on one {{approach}} to technical analysis - technical indicators, which are used for forecasting the future trend of share prices and finding <b>entry</b> <b>signals</b> to buy stocks and exit signals to sell stocks generated by technical indicators. The application of chosen technical indicators is demonstrated on selected stocks traded on the Prague Stock Exchange during the chosen period. The result of analyses is a comparison of technical indicators and the successfulness of trading based on the indicated signals...|$|R

5000|$|... oskar is {{translationally}} repressed {{prior to}} reaching the posterior pole of the oocyte by Bruno, which binds to three bruno response elements (BREs) on the 3' {{end of the}} transcribed oskar mRNA. [...] The Bruno inhibitor has two distinct modes of action: recruiting the Cup eIF4E binding protein, which is also required for oskar mRNA localization due to interactions with the Barentsz microtubule-linked transporter, and promoting oligomerization of oskar mRNA. Oskar mRNA harbours a stem-loop structure in the 3’UTR, called the oocyte <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> (OES), that promotes dynein-based mRNA accumulation in the oocyte.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the incident, the Deutsche Bundesbahn removed the blind on the hand lanterns, which could previously be switched between showing a green and a red light. The rules were changed so that a train which was to make an unscheduled stop at a station without exit signals had to be stopped at the <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> before it could enter the station. The accident also caused criticism of the lightweight construction of the railbus, whose units dated back to the 1950s. Their replacements, the DB Class 628 railcars that were built from the mid-1970s on, were constructed considerably more sturdily.|$|E
50|$|A modern {{variation}} of the One Train Working system operates without any train staff. On these lines the clearance of the controlled branch <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> is the driver's sole authority to enter the branch, and once the train has passed that signal, the interlocking will hold it at 'danger' (and the signal cannot be cleared a subsequent time) until the branch service train, on its return journey has sequentially operated two track circuits {{at the start of}} the branch. Continuous train detection on the branch is not required. Safety is ensured by the interlocking circuitry, and if a track-circuit failure occurs then special emergency working by pilotman must be introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} first opened on 17 July 1900. During the 1930s {{it was given}} a new station building, <b>entry</b> <b>signals</b> and {{accommodation}} for the track maintenance gang. The station was only manned by a stationmaster during the summer half-year because, in the winter, no trains ran on the Brocken Railway. After 1961 only goods trains worked the route and, in the 1980s, supply trains for the Brocken, usually moved by a pusher engine, terminated at Goetheweg station because of the increasingly poor condition of the permanent way.|$|R
50|$|One way {{of using}} this {{advantage}} to deter entry is to charge a price {{less than the}} monopoly level. If an entrant is considering entry {{in a number of}} similar markets, a low cost incumbent can signal its efficiency to a potential entrant through lowering prices - thereby discouraging what the entrant believes would be unprofitable <b>entry.</b> <b>Signalling</b> needs to be credible to be effective - a low cost firm must be able to show that it can withstand lower profits {{for an extended period of}} time, which it would not be able to if it had higher costs.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{distribution}} of the <b>signal</b> <b>entries</b> in Figure[*] 1, we can find that compared with the Laplace distribution, the rapid attenuation of the pdf function of the Meridian distribution will guarantee more <b>signal</b> <b>entries</b> which would be zero or close to zero. That is to say, the relatively small ratio of <b>signal</b> <b>entries</b> will have the most energy. Thus, for Laplace distribution as a prior of signal, the high dispersiveness of energy will result in some undesired false targets. However, for the Meridian distribution as a prior, the energy localized in {{a small number of}} entries will make the resulting signal sparser and then the reconstruction error smaller.|$|R
50|$|When Germany {{built its}} {{high-speed}} lines, {{beginning with the}} Fulda-Würzburg segment that started operation in 1987, it incorporated LZB into the lines. The lines were divided into blocks about 1.5 to 2.5 km long, but instead of having a signal for every block, there are only fixed signals at switches and stations, with approximately 7 km between them. If there was no train for the entire distance the <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> would be green. If the first block was occupied it would be red as usual. Otherwise, if the first block was free and a LZB train approached the signal would be dark and the train would proceed on LZB indications alone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{protected}} by ten semaphore signals. At {{both ends of the}} station there were a twin-armed <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> and a distant signal. Exit signals were installed at both ends of tracks 1 to 3. All exit signals were single-armed {{until the end of the}} 1930s. The signals on the crossing and passing loops, tracks 2 and 3, were then given a second arm so that the [...] "proceed slowly" [...] aspect could be displayed. Tracks 4 to 7 were secured by derailers between tracks 3 and 4, so that stored railway vehicles could not inadvertently roll onto the lines being used by through traffic. The level crossing to the loading road was originally gated.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the night}} of the {{accident}} southbound line was closed for maintenance work at the Brühl Güterbahnhof (Brühl goods/freight station) north of the passenger station. Trains going south switched to the opposite (northbound) line at Hürth Kalscheuren. Since the <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> at Brühl could only show a green-yellow (Hp2, [...] "proceed with low speed") aspect when the route switched to the main signals in the Güterbahnhof part (the opposite track didn't have any [...] "destination signal" [...] from the view of the tower like the other tracks have), all trains on the left track received a substitute signal Zs1, limiting the speed to 40 km/h till the next main signal. Two slow orders had also been issued to drivers, restricting speed in the area to: ...|$|E

5000|$|From a musicological {{perspective}} both Spain's [...] "Bandido" [...] and France's [...] "White and Black Blues" [...] {{can be said}} to be {{the first}} <b>entries</b> to <b>signal</b> a new trend at Eurovision, with both songs fusing contemporary dance music with ethnic influences, from flamenco and calypso respectively.|$|R
3000|$|... (·,·,·) enforces {{the joint}} {{sparsity}} structure. This is done via binary latent variables that indicate whether a <b>signal</b> <b>entry</b> is zero or nonzero; in a probabilistic manner, the prior probability {{for a specific}} <b>signal</b> <b>entry</b> to be zero is updated. The likelihood ratios that are generated by the extrinsic group update function are converted into new prior probabilities in line 10. After several iterations of BASSAMP, a consensus emerges. For a detailed derivation, we refer the interested reader to [15].|$|R
5000|$|As time passed, however, doubt {{began to}} grow about the {{exclusive}} fault of the driver. Other drivers have complained about the condition at Brühl station, in particular about the shortage, and confusing arrangement, of signs and signals in the construction area. In addition, the printed [...] "slow speed directive" [...] did, in fact, have directions for a speed of 120 km/h for that track in that spot, but which were meant only for the opposite direction. Signs for a maximum speed of 120 km/h were {{also found in the}} area. The driver of D 203 made one very serious error, which his colleagues had not made: The alternate signal for 40 km/h, by the station <b>entry</b> <b>signal,</b> had precedence over any other directives - had he followed that signal, nothing would have happened.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{the line between}} Hauptbahnhof Ingolstadt and Weichering station was {{completely}} rerouted. Previously, it departed from the station northwards and crossed the city in a great loop; today the line is directly connected to the south. The newly routed line runs initially {{on both sides of}} the high-speed line from Ingolstadt to Munich. Trains on the Danube Valley Railway regularly use the eastern track in both directions. The western track is primarily used by the trains on the Paar Valley Railway that, since the re-routing, runs on the Danube Valley Railway as far as the Seehof depot. Seehof station also has two tracks as well as various crossovers between the two lines. After Seehof, the Paar Valley Railway separates out and from here on the line is single-tracked to Weichering station, where the original trackbed, which to that point has been completely dismantled, is used again after the <b>entry</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{the train}} {{dispatcher}} {{decided that the}} train carrying the fire fighting equipment had priority and signalled that the track was free to this train. Train 168 had to wait at the Vigerslev station, the engineer of train 168 was told {{to look for the}} boy as soon as the other train had passed. After the train passed, train 168 reversed in the direction of Brøndbyøster station, passing the <b>entry</b> <b>signal</b> from behind. The train dispatcher had only thought about the train carrying the firefighting equipment, and gave train 168 a free path to Brondbyøster. Shortly after he noticed that he didn't think about the express train, and he tried to contact Brøndbyøster station. This was unsuccessful however, as his colleague at Brondbyøster was busy with the throughcoming express train. After the dispatcher at Vigerslev managed to have phone contact with the Brondbyøster dispatcher and made him aware of the danger, he grabbed a red signalling lantern, ran toward the engineer of train 168 and commanded him to reverse. The engineer followed his command, but the steam locomotive accelerated only slowly.|$|E
