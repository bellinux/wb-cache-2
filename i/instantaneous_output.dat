40|$|This paper proposes an {{simplified}} <b>instantaneous</b> <b>output</b> {{power control}} {{to suppress the}} second harmonic DC bus voltage due to asymmetry in a three-phase PWM converter system without any sequential component decomposers. Normally, in the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>output</b> power control, {{the positive and negative}} output voltages and currents are required and they are usually decomposed by notch filters or dual second-order generalized integrals that are difficult to tune and complicated. While in the proposed method, the positive-sequence and negative-sequence currents are regulated by PI plus resonant (PI-R) controllers in dq-frame. Therefore, the sequential current decomposers can be avoided. Meanwhile, the positive and negative sequence output voltages, which are essential for calculating the positive-sequence and negative-sequence current references, are simply obtained from the outputs of the PI and resonant controllers, respectively. The proposed method is robust to any asymmetries and its effectiveness is verified on a prototype asymmetric three-phase permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) system with inherent and externally added asymmetries...|$|E

The influence of {{the parameters of the}} close-loop feedback circuit to the inhibition effects to the outputting circulation current is observed. After analyzing the circulating current inhibition characteristics, the proportion integration (PI) controller is introduced into the close-loop adjustment by instantaneous voltage feedback.

40|$|A biologically {{realistic}} {{neural network}} model is proposed for the binaural processing of interaural-time and level cues that closely resembles computational schemes suggested for atereopsis in vision. The network requires no neural delay lines to generate such attributes of binaural hearing as the lateralization of all frequencies, and the detection and enhancement of noisy signals. The two-dimensional network measures interaural differences by detecting the spatial disparities between the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>outputs</b> of the two ears. It achieves this by comparing systematically at various horizontal shifts, the spatiotemporal responses of the tonotopically ordered array of auditory-nerve- fibers. An alternative view of the network operation is that it computes approximately the cross-correlation between {{the responses of the}} two cochlei by combining an ipsilateral input at a given CF with contralateral inputs from locally off-CF locations.
