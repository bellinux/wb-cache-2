Following this action, Joseph, now Emperor, awarded him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa (19May 1779). This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> characterized the entire war; there were no major battles. The armies of the opposing sides conducted series of raids and counter-raids from which they lived off the country-side and tried to deny each other access to supplies and fodder.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

25|$|When McNamara {{took over}} the Pentagon in 1961, the United States {{military}} relied on an all-out nuclear strike {{to respond to a}} Soviet attack of any kind. This kind of strike would lead to the death of Soviet military forces and also civilians. This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> He sought for other options after seeing how this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. McNamara’s alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces. This concept would be used to prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow up strike. McNamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but likely to provoke retaliation. The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.|$|E
500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – {{what he describes as}} a personal experience or event. When we talk with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, we are only looking to be heard, not inspire any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E
500|$|While {{his main}} army was entrenched on the heights above the Elbe, Joseph {{encouraged}} raids against the Prussian troops. On 7 August 1778, with two squadrons of his regiment, the intrepid [...] "rookie", now Major, Nauendorf, led a raid against a Prussian convoy at Bieberdorf in the County of Glatz. The surprised convoy surrendered and Nauendorf captured its officers, 110men, 476horses, 240wagons of flour, and thirteen transport wagons. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> characterized the entire war. There were no major battles; the war {{consisted of a}} series of raids and counter-raids during which the opposing sides lived off the country-side and tried to deny each other access to supplies and fodder.

His eyes are opened, however, by Will, who is in love with Grace, and is told by her when she refuses him that she loves John.

2500|$|After President Trump {{took office}} in January 2017, Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, began {{to work on a}} plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They faced {{opposition}} from both Democrats and moderate Republicans, who claimed that the bill would leave too many people uninsured, and more conservative Republicans, who protested that the bill kept too many of the ACA's regulation and spending increases, and was thus not a full repeal. Numerous attempts at repeal failed. On June 27, after a meeting with President Trump at the White House, McConnell signaled improvements for the repeal and replacement: [...] "We're not quite there.

The SWP {{was involved in}} the relaunch the ANL in 1992 in response to the growth of the British National Party and campaigned against the Criminal Justice Bill. A demonstration for justice for murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence near the BNP headquarters in Welling in 1993 turned into a violent confrontation with the police, leading to criticism from Ken Livingstone, then a Labour MP and a supporter of the rival Anti-Racist Alliance (ARA), in which Socialist Action plaed a major role. Livingstone argued that this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was playing {{into the hands of the}} BNP. He said at the time: [...] "'No one's discussing [...] policies. Now the question is the violence of the SWP, arguments between the police and the SWP about who is to blame." [...] Although Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence attended the Welling demo, she came to realise that the ANL was a [...] "front for the Socialist Workers Party". She later wrote that [...] "the various groups that had taken an interest in Stephen's death were tearing each other apart and were in danger of destroying our campaign which we wanted to keep focused and dignified", and Doreen and Neville Lawrence wrote to both the ANL and ARA to demand that they [...] "stop using Stephen's name".|$|E

2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon list several {{disadvantages}} {{of the union}} organizing model, with the most critical being that the model is very [...] "resource-intensive," [...] {{in terms of both}} people and money. Since the organizing model is, at its core, about people, rather than services, it cannot be effective without people to both implement it and carry it out. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon talk about [...] "...instances of a lack of support or even opposition to organizing within unions." [...] Because the organizing model is so dependent upon worker motivation and action, if the workers themselves oppose the implementation of the organizing model, it cannot be effective. Fletcher and Hurd suggest that even if members are not resistant to adoption of the organizing model, they still {{have to learn how to}} perform tasks previously handled by organizers, and there have to be enough active members to facilitate this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> This clear dependence on the support and actions of the workers is a disadvantage of the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, which, for the most part, does not require worker support or demand worker action. According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, [...] "Employers are often resistant." [...] Unions that have to deal with this problem would very clearly have a hard time using the organizing model, as it could antagonize the employer even further and erode any previously existing relationship between the employer and the union.|$|E
2500|$|The ruling {{noted that}} the {{rejection}} of some past appeals by the Supreme Court were not necessarily {{a sign that the}} appeal was ill-founded, and such meaning should not be read into them ("this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> - or inaction - imports no expression upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times"). The ruling examined various dubious bases often allowed by States for marriage, and the extent of sanctimonious expressions used in discussing and practicing marriage, and the deference owed to individual states' legislative power to examine such questions at their own pace, and the fact that just one year had passed from the first legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States to the matters leading to this case. It concluded that [...] "what we are left with, is [...] by creating a status (marriage) and subsidizing it (with privileges) the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for the purposes of rearing offspring". The court also described the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Windsor as one that should be seen less as an affirmation of same-sex marriage, and instead, as a case concerning Federal law encroachment upon State law, in which it had been confirmed that it was not the place of the Federal legislation to effectively seek to determine for all States how they should each treat same-sex marriage. Writing for the majority, Judge Jeffrey Sutton also dismissed the arguments made on behalf of same-sex couples in this case: [...] "Not one of the plaintiffs' theories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for removing the issue from the place it has been since the founding: in the hands of state voters." ...|$|E
