5|$|Germanwings' {{parent company}} Lufthansa offered victims' {{families}} an <b>initial</b> <b>aid</b> payment {{of up to}} €50,000, separate from any legally-required compensation for the disaster. Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Technical University of Berlin quoted by the Rheinische Post, said he expected the airline would pay €10–30million in compensation. The Montreal Convention sets a per-victim cap of €143,000 in the event an airline is held liable, unless negligence can be proved. Insurance specialists said although co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid a serious illness from his employer and deliberately crashed the passenger aircraft, these facts would not affect the issue of compensation nor be applicable to the exclusion clause in Lufthansa's insurance policy. Lufthansa's insurance company set aside US$300million (€280million) for financial compensation to victims' families and {{for the cost of}} the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The colony cycle {{requires}} {{six months}} and begins with {{one or a few}} females founding the nest and beginning construction. These females build the colonies independently, without the <b>initial</b> <b>aid</b> of workers. This entails building individual cells and putting an egg in each cell; at this point, the growth rate of the colony is one cell (and egg) per day. This process continues until the first eggs begin to hatch, at which point growth of the colony stops. The first larvae born are all worker females who help {{in the formation of the}} nest once they have matured. Thus, once the larvae cocoon and pupate, the rate of growth increases. After the female workers mature, male and female non-workers are born and the nest continues to grow. During the next three to four months, more males and nonworkers are born in relation to the rest of the nest population. Next, the rate of growth decreases until the nest is no longer growing. At this point the phenomenon of abortion of larvae and pupae occurs, more cells are abandoned, and the adult population decreases. Finally, the nest is abandoned, signifying the end of the cycle.|$|E

500|$|Between 12–14 {{international}} aid agencies were concurrently active in Odisha in the storm's aftermath. The Odishan Government made appeals to various non-governmental organizations as the government's relief supplies only covered 40%percent of affected areas. In {{response to the}} storm's devastation, Oxfam prepared an <b>initial</b> <b>aid</b> package, including emergency water equipment worth £250,000 (US$306,665) and 50,000instant meals. Several members of the Action by Churches Together Alliance made contributions to the post-cyclone relief efforts. Lutheran World Relief made initial grants of US$15,000each to the Church's Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA) and Lutheran World Federation for emergency programs in northeastern India. The United Evangelical Lutheran Churches in India sent US$700,000worth of various relief supplies in concert with CASA. The Indian Red Cross Society distributed relief supplies from their zonal warehouse in Calcutta, with initial supplies valued at CHF20,000 (US$19,491). In addition to the Indian society of the Red Cross, a joint Indian and International Federation assessment team was assembled to survey the damage. CARE carried over its preexisting relief operations from the early October cyclone, routing food supplies by train to hard-hit locations in Odisha. The Odisha state branch of the Red Cross extended the emergency relief phase to a three-month relief operation and a six-month rehabilitation program {{with the help of}} the Federation. The overall humanitarian response spanned well into late 2000. Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha dispatched aid to [...] 91villages greatly affected by the storm in the Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapada districts; medical camps were established in 32villages. Three villages were [...] "adopted" [...] by BAPS Charities in January2000 to rebuild in Jagatsinghpur: Chakulia, Banipat, and Potak. A total of 200concrete homes were constructed, as well as two concrete schools and two village tube-wells. The project was finally completed in May2002, two and a half years after the cyclone hit. Similarly, Oxfam facilitated various restoration projects in the Ganjam district, including in the communities of Denotified Tribes.|$|E
2500|$|Cameron was {{an active}} {{politician}} who, with the <b>initial</b> <b>aid</b> of his father Simon Cameron, and his political ally Matthew Quay, set up a political machine in the Pennsylvania legislature that ensured Cameron would be reelected to office. Senator Cameron rarely gave speeches, and he was viewed as being judicious, unemotional, and reticent. Cameron disapproved of the popular artful oratory methods used by his contemporaries while his own speeches were forceful and direct. Adopting his father's method, Cameron's strength as a politician relied on working inside the antechamber, committees, and caucuses to obtain his goals. [...] Cameron distinguish himself in the Senate in 1890 when he supported the Federal Elections Bill, that ensured African Americans's voting protection rights in the Solid South. However, on the whole, Cameron's nearly twenty years in the Senate remained undistinguished while {{for the most part}} he voted on the Republican Party line. Cameron, like his father, protected the interest of the Pennsylvania Railroad PRR, ensuring that Pennsylvania government House Speakers E. Reed Myer and his successor Henry M.

40|$|Abstract Between 1979 and 1989 the {{government}} of the German Democratic Republic provided health assistance to Sandinista Nicaragua. After <b>initial</b> relief <b>aid,</b> the Sandinista embrace of a primary health care-based health system made East German health support difficult. The non-convertible currency, the repressive quality of the East German leadership, and the lack of experience with primary health care processes all limited its potential to provide support. After 1985, when implementation of this system stalled, East German health assistance was revitalized with the donation of the Hospital Carlos Marx. Providing medical services to three hundred thousand people, it combined elements of a strictly East German institution, using German personnel and equipment, with some integration into local systems...|$|R
