5000|$|Vomitoxin, {{also known}} as {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON), is a type B trichothecene, an epoxy-sesquiterpenoid. This mycotoxin occurs predominantly in grains such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and corn, and less often in rice, sorghum, and triticale. The occurrence of deoxynivalenol is associated primarily with Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and F. culmorum, {{both of which are}} important plant pathogens which cause fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> in wheat and gibberella or fusarium ear blight in corn. A direct relationship between the incidence of fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> and contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol has been established. The incidence of fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> is strongly associated with moisture at the time of flowering (anthesis), and the timing of rainfall, rather than the amount, is the most critical factor. However, increased amount of moisture towards harvest time has been associated with lower amount of vomitoxin in wheat grain due to leaching of toxins. Furthermore, deoxynivalenol contents are significantly affected by the susceptibility of cultivars towards Fusarium species, previous crop, tillage practices, and fungicide use. [...] It occurs abundantly in grains in Norway due to heavy rainfall.|$|E

5000|$|One {{example of}} using {{molecular}} markers in identifying a particular trait within a plant is, Fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> in wheat. Fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> {{can be a}} devastating disease in cereal crops but certain varieties or offspring or varieties may be resistant to the disease. This resistance is inferred by a particular gene that can be followed using MAS (Marker Assisted Selection) and QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci). QTL's identify particular variants within phenotypes or traits and typically identify where the GOI (Gene of interest) is located. Once the cross has been made, sampling of offspring may be taken and evaluated to determine which offspring inherited the traits and which offspring did not. This type of selection is becoming more beneficial to breeders and farmers because it is {{reducing the amount of}} pesticides, fungicides and insecticides. [...] Another way to insert a GOI is through mechanical or bacterial transmission. This is more difficult but may save time and money.|$|E
50|$|Fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> {{is caused}} by the release of mycotoxins from Fusarium species, which damage wheat kernels or spikelets. The {{infection}} of spikelets results in a loss of chlorophyll, whilst in infected kernels, F. sporotrichioides mycelia extend from the kernel wall, or pericarp, resulting in a scaliness and discolouration. The infection usually spreads to other areas of the wheat head in favourable environmental conditions.|$|E
50|$|F. sporotrichioides {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causative agents of <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> in Scandinavia, as well as Eastern and Northern Europe, {{although}} other species such as F. poae and F. avenaceum are usually more prevalent in these areas. Favourable temperature and humidity conditions are associated with an increased likelihood of infection of wheat by Fusarium species, with higher humidity being more conducive to infection, especially during the flowering period, or anthesis, of wheat.|$|E
50|$|Fusarium ear blight (FEB) (also called Fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight,</b> FHB, or scab), is a {{fungal disease}} of cereals, {{including}} wheat, barley, oats, rye and triticale. FEB {{is caused by}} a range of Fusarium fungi, which infects the heads of the crop, reducing grain yield. The disease is often associated with contamination by mycotoxins produced by the fungi already when the crop is growing in the field. The disease can cause severe economic losses as contaminated grain cannot be sold for food or feed.|$|E

50|$|F. graminearum is a haploid {{homothallic}} ascomycete. The fruiting bodies, perithecia, develop on the mycelium {{and give}} rise to ascospores, which land on susceptible parts of the host plant to germinate. The fungus causes fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> on wheat, barley, and other grass species, as well as ear rot on corn. The primary inocula are the ascospores, sexual spores which are produced in the perithecia. Spores are forcibly discharged and can germinate within six hours upon landing on the plant surface. The scab disease is monocyclic; after one cycle of infection with ascospores, the fungus produces macroconidia by asexual reproduction. These structures overwinter in the soil or in plant debris {{on the field and}} {{give rise to}} the mycelium in the next season.|$|E
50|$|Crown Rot of Wheat {{is caused}} by the fungal {{pathogen}} Fusarium pseudograminearum. F. pseudograminearum {{is a member of the}} fungal phylum Ascomycota and is also known as Gibberella coronicola (teleomorph). It is a monoecious fungus, meaning it does not require another host other than wheat to complete its life cycle. Although F. pseudograminearum can produce both anamorphic and teleomorphic states, the teleomorph is usually not present for crown rot of wheat. This Fusarium species has, until recently, been considered to be the same as the species known as Fusarium graminearum (<b>head</b> <b>blight</b> of wheat) due to many similar characteristics. One of the only differences between the two species is that F. pseudograminearum lacks its sexual stage on the wheat host.|$|E

50|$|Fusarium sporotrichioides is a fungal plant pathogen, one {{of various}} Fusarium species {{responsible}} for damaging crops, in particular causing a condition known as Fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> in wheat, consequently being of notable agricultural and economic importance. The species is ecologically widespread, being found across tropical and temperate regions, {{and is a}} significant producer of mycotoxins, particularly trichothecenes. Although mainly infecting crops, F. sporotrichioides-derived mycotoxins can have repercussions for human health {{in the case of}} the ingestion of infected cereals. One such example includes the outbreak of alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) in Russia, of which F. sporotrichioides-infected crop was suspected to be the cause. Although current studies on F. sporotrichioides are somewhat limited in comparison to other species in the genus, Fusarium sporotrichioides has found several applications as a model system for experimentation in molecular biology.|$|E
50|$|Gibberella zeae, {{also known}} {{by the name of}} its anamorph Fusarium graminearum, is a plant {{pathogen}} which causes fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight,</b> a devastating disease on wheat and barley. The pathogen is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid composition of wheat, resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the remaining grain with mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol, which inhibits protein biosynthesis; and zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin. These toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and are harmful to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts to find resistance genes against F. graminearum, no completely resistant variety is currently available. Research on the biology of F. graminearum is directed towards gaining insight into more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in the life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat from scab infection.|$|E
50|$|Outbreaks {{of barley}} scab (also known as {{fusarium}} <b>head</b> <b>blight)</b> usually occur {{when there are}} high moisture conditions during the flowering stages of barley development. The infected crops become bleached in color, shrunken, and discolored and will grow pink spore masses on the barley heads. The disease {{has the potential to}} destroy a crop within weeks. The shrunken kernels can become so light that the wind can blow them away {{from the rest of the}} crop. In addition, barley scab produces toxins that severely reduce the value of the harvested barley. This toxin, deoxynivalenol, also known as vomitoxin because of its tendency to induce vomiting at high levels, will pass through the brewing process into the beer. When the beer is opened the toxin will cause the liquid to overflow from the bottle or can. Because this is not commercially desirable, barley producers receive severe price discounts when vomitoxin is present.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} aim {{of plant}} breeding {{is to improve}} the agronomic or nutritional qualities of a crop. Typical goals are improved yield, reduced susceptibility to diseases and pests, homogeneous maturation (to optimize harvest) and increased tolerance to environmental stresses—i.e., drought, acid soil, high or cold temperature, etc. Most of the known wheat species today are polyploid.Whereas common bread wheat is hexaploid, Khorasan wheat is tetraploid. To do further breeding with this tetraploid Khorasan wheat, the genetic pool to use is a little bit limited to the tetraploid subspecies of triticum turgidum such as Durum (subsp. durum), Polish (subsp. polonicum), Persian (subsp. carthlicum), Emmer (subsp. dicoccum) and Poulard (subsp. turgidum) wheat. Especially to develop resistances against common fungi (e.g. Fusarium <b>Head</b> <b>Blight),</b> this genomic pool is interesting. Problematic in this case, is the economic unimportance of most of the tetraploid subspecies of wheat (except Durum), which limits the investment to do intensive breeding, especially compared to the highly important common bread wheat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{potential}} of Lysobacter species as biological control agents for plant diseases {{has been recognized}} recently. Among L. enzymogenes strains, C3 is the most thoroughly characterized strain at both the molecular and biological levels. The ecological versatility of the strain is reflected by the range of diseases {{it is able to}} control, as well as the various plant hosts and plant parts it is capable of colonizing. For example, L. enzymogenes strain C3 (erroneously identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) has been reported to control foliar diseases such as leaf spot of tall fescue caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana, bean rust caused by Uromyces appendiculatus [...] and Fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> of wheat. L. enzymogenes strain C3 also has been reported to suppress soilborne diseases, such as brown patch in turfgrass caused by Rhizoctonia solani, the seedling disease Pythium damping-off of sugarbeet [...] and summer patch disease of Kentucky bluegrass caused by the root-infecting Magnaporthe poae.

It was defined {{that the development of}} Fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> in different variety samples of winter triticale depends on the hydrothermal conditions and genotype of the host-plant. Resistance of varieties and hybrids to the disease was partial, and no immune samples were found among the analyzed ones. The following varieties proved to be tolerant to Fusarium head blight: ‘Granat’, ‘Zorro’, ‘Obrii Myronivskyi’. The positive correlation between the development of Fusarium <b>head</b> <b>blight</b> and root rot of winter triticale was found.
