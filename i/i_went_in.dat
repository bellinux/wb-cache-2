25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in,</b> I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

He was {{surrounded}} by women. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and slammed a table. A glass broke. The bouncer came, and I punched Caymmi's face. Then I left cussing.

500|$|The {{song was}} co-produced by Canadian electro-pop band Dragonette, with Martina Sorbara. Roberts stated that Dragonette {{were among the}} first people who worked on the record. Roberts {{discussed}} the 1940s influence on the record, noting [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She stated that {{when it came to the}} production of the track she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point. The track was written in February 2010, and when asked about working with Dragonette on the track, Roberts responded, [...] "I was with them for quite a while writing, and they were the first people that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> with when I started making the record.

[...] Jackson then presented his demo to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see {{the structure of the}} song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson completed the lyrics and melody of [...] "We Are the World" [...] within two and a half hours, one night before the song's first recording session.|$|E

500|$|Winrich Kolbe, the {{director}} of [...] "Caretaker", was involved in casting the main cast for the series. He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans {{who were in the}} Screen Actors Guild. The casting process came down to two actors, and the producers decided on Robert Beltran, who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera Models Inc. and was of Mexican heritage. Beltran was not familiar with Star Trek before auditioning, and went along on the strength of the [...] "Caretaker" [...] script which showed the character becoming the second in command of Voyager after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta quadrant. Beltran explained the audition experience, [...] "I felt neutral about the audition, didn't much care one way or the other. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> the first time and wasn't really trying to get the part.

500|$|After Myers had {{completed}} providing the {{voice for the}} character, when the film was well into production, he asked to re-record all of his lines with a Scottish accent, similar to that his mother used {{when she told him}} bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and [...] According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using country and Canadian accents. After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, [...] "It was so good we took $4m worth of animation out and did it again." [...] A point Myers disputes, saying [...] "it didn’t cost the studio “millions of dollars,” as rumored. “What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.". [...] Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits.

500|$|Rockstar drew upon game protagonist archetypes {{during the}} {{scripting}} the characters; Trevor {{was considered to}} embody insanity. Houser said the team characterised Michael and Trevor as juxtapositions of each other. He said, [...] "Michael is like the criminal who wants to compartmentalise and be a good guy {{some of the time}} and Trevor is the maniac who isn't a hypocrite". He said that having three lead characters would help move the game's plot into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising through the ranks of a criminal underworld. In Grand Theft Auto V, Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor. During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed an on-set chemistry between him and Ned Luke (who portrayed Michael), which he felt helped secure them the roles. Ogg said, [...] "When [...] and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> the room together we immediately had something". While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games, it was when they signed contracts that they learned they would be involved in a Grand Theft Auto title. Ogg felt Trevor's characterisation had evolved over time. He said, [...] "Nuances and character traits that began to appearhis walk, his manner of speech, his reactions, definitely informed his development throughout the game".|$|E
500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything I could think of, but I will mention that Ted and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was a pretty big deal to break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest running story on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in,</b> and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

I had a little moment of worry about six laps from the end when the {{throttle}} didn't seem to pick up properly and I thought the engine was going to stop, but it came back and all was well." [...] Schumacher added that his team was confident of securing third in the Constructors' Championship; although he could not match Häkkinen's pace, he praised the team for his car's set-up. Coulthard was disappointed with his fourth-place finish, and thought his team's decision to call him into the pit lane after his competitors cost him the victory; however, he remained confident about his championship chances. Button was also disappointed to finish fifth: [...] "It was a bad race for me, if not the worst. The car was working well at the start, but when I tried to pass Jarno <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> a bit late." [...] Trulli refused to criticise Button after the race, believing that Button made a mistake. Fisichella and Verstappen felt similarly about their lap-nine collision, with Fisichella saying that he [...] "felt sorry" [...] for Verstappen and describing his weekend as [...] "disastrous". Verstappen said that he struggled with his car's balance, which resulted in oversteer. He was [...] "happy to go home", because [...] "it's not been a good weekend." [...] Frentzen said that although {{he was happy to}} score points, he had hoped for a better finish.|$|E
500|$|The team wrote each {{character}} to embody a game protagonist archetype; Michael embodies greed, Franklin ambition and Trevor insanity. Houser felt Michael and Trevor were written to juxtapose each other, with Michael [...] "like the criminal {{who wants to}} compartmentalise and be a good guy some of the time" [...] and Trevor [...] "the maniac who isn't a hypocrite". He considered that the three lead characters helped move the game's story into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising {{through the ranks of}} a criminal underworld. Ned Luke portrayed Michael, Shawn [...] "Solo" [...] Fonteno portrayed Franklin and Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor. Fonteno first became aware of the acting job through his friend DJ Pooh, who worked on San Andreas and was involved in Grand Theft Auto Vs music production. When Luke's agent advised him of the casting call, he initially did not want to audition for the part because it was in a video game. After reading the audition material and learning more about the project, he became interested. He reflected, [...] "I went immediately after reading the material from 'I'm not doing it' to 'nobody else is doing it'. It was just brilliant". During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed an on-set chemistry between him and Luke, which he felt helped secure them the roles.

500|$|The 12th Man {{tradition}} {{began in}} Dallas on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic, {{the forerunner of}} the Cotton Bowl Classic. [...] A played defending national champion Centre College in the first postseason game in the southwest. [...] In this hard-fought game, which produced national publicity, an underdog Aggie team was slowly defeating a team which had allowed fewer than six points per game. The first half produced so many injuries for A, Coach D. X. Bible feared {{he would not have}} enough men to finish the game. [...] At that moment, he called into the Aggie section of the stands for E. King Gill, a student who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill, who was spotting players for a Waco newspaper and was not in football uniform, donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir and stood on the sidelines to await his turn. Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. When the game ended in a 22-14 Aggie victory, Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, [...] "I wish I could say that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] A statue of E. King Gill stands to the north of Kyle Field to remind Aggies of their constant obligation to preserve the spirit of the 12th Man.|$|E
