40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) has {{developed}} a test procedure to compare the initiating strength of detonators by using adjustable-sensitivity liquid explosives. Various tests of <b>detonator</b> <b>strength</b> are currently used by the industry, {{but many of them}} do not quantify the ability of detonators to initiate detonation reactions in an explosive charge. The USBM used mixtures of nitromethane and ethylene diamine, the sensitivity being 'fine-tuned' by 2 -nitropropane. Military standard J- 2, commercial No. 6, and commercial No. 8 detonators were evaluated using three test configurations: (1) axially immersed in the test explosive, (2) tip just touching surface of the explosive, and (3) immersed transversely in the explosive.
