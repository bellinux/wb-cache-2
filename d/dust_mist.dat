Satellite remote sensing has been instrumental in providing this knowledge, through long time series of observations of atmospheric dust transport. Three remote sensing methodologies have been used, and are reviewed briefly in this paper. Firstly the use of observations from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), secondly the use of the Infrared Difference Dust Index (IDDI) from Meterosat infrared data, thirdly the use of MODIS images from the rapid response system.

40|$|Abstract Background The current {{literature}} reports increased infectious disease occurrence in various construction occupations, {{as an important}} contributor to morbidity and mortality arising from employment. These observations should be expanded to asbestos abatement workers, as the abatement can create an environment favorable for bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Discussion Asbestos abatement work employs activities resulting in cuts, blisters and abrasions to the skin, work in a dirty environment and exposure to <b>dust,</b> <b>mists</b> and fumes. Furthermore, this population exhibits a high smoking rate which {{increases the risk of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory infections. In addition, these workers also commonly employ respirators, which can accumulate dirt and debris magnifying exposure to microbes. Use of respirators and related types of personal protective equipment, especially if shared and in the close environment experienced by workers, may enhance communicability of these agents, including viruses. Summary Abatement workers need to be provided with information on hazards and targeted by appropriate health education to reduce the infection risk. Epidemiological studies to investigate this risk in asbestos removers are recommended. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{additive}} formaldehyde is an {{aqueous solution}} containing 37 % formaldehyde and 14 % methanol. It {{is intended for}} use in all animal species at concentrations between 68 and 680 mg active substance/kg complete feed. Free and reversibly bound formaldehyde is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and joins the pool of endogenous formaldehyde. It is rapidly oxidised to formic acid further on to carbon dioxide and water. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen by inhalation. While local irritation is expected to strongly promote carcinogenesis, lower local concentrations of formaldehyde are known to produce DNA adducts. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel deems it prudent not to consider the exposure to non-irritant concentration as totally riskless. Moreover, {{on the basis of}} the present knowledge, a causal association between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia cannot be ruled out. The FEEDAP Panel estimated the oral intake of formaldehyde of consumers from food of animal origin to be 4 mg per person per day. A reliable additional exposure of consumers to formaldehyde from supplementing feedingstuffs cannot be calculated. However, the FEEDAP Panel considers that the proposed use of formaldehyde as a feed additive would not increase consumer exposure and consequently would not pose an additional risk for the consumer. A safe feed concentration for all animal species and categories could not be determined. Formaldehyde is a strong irritant, a potent skin and respiratory sensitiser. Measures should be taken to ensure that the respiratory tract, skin and eyes of any person handling the product are not exposed to any <b>dust,</b> <b>mist</b> or vapour generated by the use of formaldehyde. The use of formaldehyde in animal nutrition is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Formaldehyde in concentrations between 340 and 680 mg/kg feed (compound feed and/or feed material) has the potential to be an efficacious preservative...|$|E
40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of superphosphate by the acidulation of phosphate rock with sulphuric acid, fluorine is evolved, mainly as silicon tetrafluoride, along with carbon dioxide and steam. This environmentally unacceptable fluoride is required to be removed before being vented to the atmosphere. This is usually done by absorbing the gas in water. However, industrially the absorption {{is complicated by the}} presence of entrained phosphate rock <b>dust,</b> <b>mist</b> particles and condensing steam in the gas stream, and by the silica formed from the reaction between silicon tetrafluoride and water. The absorption of dry silicon tetrafluoride in water under laboratory conditions is reasonably well understood. However, information on the absorption under industrial conditions is lacking. In all industrial measurements of the mass transfer coefficient the liquid-gas interfacial area is not known accurately and hence what is usually obtained is a coefficient per unit volume of the absorption equipment. This value is of limited use in exploring the effect of particulates and surface reaction as it is a complex average for different drop sizes and scrubber volumes and the chemical composition of the gas stream. Gas absorption, particulate collection and surface reaction need to be considered separately in comparing industrial scrubbers. Therefore {{in order to be able}} to translate the performance of a given scrubber from one works to another, the measurement of the mass transfer coefficient for one standard geometry in industrial conditions is needed. Thus the aim of this work is to establish a method of providing this information. By using a spinning cup sampling apparatus we were not only able to establish a method of determining a mass transfer coefficient for the absorption of the industrial effluent gas stream fluorides, but were also able to establish a method for determining the size of the particulate fluorides present in the gas stream. The main points arising from this work include: (1) The absorption is "gas" phase controlled (under normal conditions surface silica is unimportant) and the particulate fluorides in the gas stream will often be the controlling factor in scrubber performance. Thus the collection of particulate fluorides must be a primary concern in scrubber design, and high liquid to gas ratios in some section of a scrubber will promote this collection. (2) The particulate fluorides are small, of the order of 2 micrometers in diameter. (3) In the spinning cup apparatus used in this study, the mass transfer coefficient for a "gas" stream containing 25 % particulate fluorides at 90 to 100 °C is approximately 55 m h-¹...|$|E

40|$|Within the DOE, it has {{recently}} become apparent that some contractor {{employees who have}} worked (or are currently working) with and around beryllium have developed chronic beryllium disease (CBD), an occupational granulomatous lung disorder. Respiratory exposure to aerosolized beryllium, in susceptible individuals, causes an immunological reaction that can result in granulomatous scarring of the lung parenchyma, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, weight loss, and, ultimately, respiratory failure. Beryllium disease was originally identified in the 1940 s, largely in the fluorescent light industry. In 1950, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) introduced strict exposure standards that generally curtailed both the acute and chronic forms of the disease. Beginning in 1984, with the identification of a CBD case in a DOE contractor worker, there was increased scrutiny of both industrial hygiene practices and individuals in this workforce. To date, over 100 additional cases of beryllium-specific sensitization and/or CBD have been identified. Thus, a disease previously thought to be largely eliminated by the adoption of permissible exposure standards 45 years ago is still a health risk in certain workforces. This good practice guide forms {{the basis of an}} acceptable program for controlling workplace exposure to beryllium. It provides (1) Guidance for minimizing worker exposure to beryllium in Defense Programs facilities during all phases of beryllium-related work, including the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of facilities.

40|$|Possibly the world's first {{research}} on breathing problems among snow crab processing workers {{took place in}} Newfoundland in the 1970 's. Preventing/mitigating these problems {{is of paramount importance}} as the snow crab industry is a major contributor to the regional economy in rural Newfoundland and Labrador communities. Crab asthma is caused by overexposure to the <b>dusts,</b> <b>mists,</b> fumes or aerosols that are generated during various processes. During these processes, proteins in the crab may become airborne and can enter the lungs and breathing tubes. A recent study suggests that very low levels of allergen will need to be achieved in crab processing plants to prevent respiratory symptoms from occurring among sensitized workers. Prior to the study described in this report, there had been no air sampling of allergen levels in snow crab processing plants in Newfoundland and Labrador. Air sampling has been carried out in four crab processing plants in Newfoundland and Labrador to identify the problematic areas. Allergen contamination concentrations have been identified and related to specific areas of the processing plants and to the individual processes themselves. [...] A variety of ventilation methods have been examined with local exhausting of the workplace comprising the majority of the investigated techniques.

40|$|The Advanced REACH Tool (ART) is an {{exposure}} assessment tool that combines mechanistically modelled inhalation exposure estimates with available exposure data using a Bayesian approach. The mechanistic model {{is based on}} nine independent principal modifying factors (MF). One of these MF is the substance emission potential, which addresses the intrinsic substance properties as determinants of the emission from a source. This paper describes the current knowledge and evidence on intrinsic characteristics of solids and liquids that determine the potential for their release into workplace air. The principal factor determining the release of aerosols from handling or processing powdered, granular, or pelletized materials is the dustiness of the material, {{as well as the}} weight fraction of the substance of interest in the powder and the moisture content. The partial vapour pressure is the main intrinsic factor determining the substance emission potential for emission of vapours. For generation of mist, the substance emission potential is determined by the viscosity of the liquid as well as the weight fraction of the substance of interest in the liquid. Within ART release of vapours is considered for substances with a partial vapour pressure at the process temperature of 10 Pa or more, while mist formation is considered for substances with a vapour pressure = 10 Pa. Relative multipliers are assigned for most of the intrinsic factors, {{with the exception of the}} weight fraction and the vapour pressure, which is applied as a continuous variable in the estimation of the substance emission potential. Currently, estimation of substance emission potential is not available for fumes, fibres, and gases. The substance emission potential takes account of the latest thinking on emissions of <b>dusts,</b> <b>mists,</b> and vapours and in our view provides a good balance between theory and pragmatism. Expanding the knowledge base on substance emission potential will improve the predictive power of occupational exposure models and thereby the accuracy and precision of the exposure estimates. © The Author 2011...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} effectiveness of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems and to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results with actual experimental results. Three case studies had been conducted at Ventilation Laboratory in National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Bangi, Welding Laboratory and Thermal Environmental Laboratory in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). LEV is a ventilation system that captures contaminants, for example <b>dusts,</b> <b>mists,</b> gases, vapours or fumes out from workstations, so that they can‟t be breathed by occupants. Employers allocate and install LEV in order to protect occupants‟ exposure to contaminants, but it doesn‟t work properly. To overcome this issue, Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health for Design, Inspection, Testing and Examination of LEV system and CFD can be implemented. The guideline stated that the recommended minimum hood velocity is 100 ft/min; while the recommended velocity along ducts for vapours, gases, smoke is 1000 ft/min and 2000 ft/min is required for welding. It was found that Ventilation Laboratory in NIOSH Bangi using Control Speed of 80 %, Welding Laboratory and Thermal Environmental Laboratory in UTHM met all the minimum requirements set by the guideline, where LEV systems are effective to be used. In terms of CFD modeling, upon validation, average absolute error obtained from three case studies ranges from 2. 804 % and 4. 862 %. Validity of CFD modeling is acceptable, which is less than 5 % and good agreement is achieved between actual experimental results and CFD simulation results. Therefore, it can be concluded that simple CFD modeling can be performed as a tool to simulate air velocity in LEV system, which saves labour costs and time consumption when it is used during earliest stage of LEV design development prior to actual construction. The outcome of this study can be used as a benchmark or guideline for training facilities building equipped with LEV system to protect occupants‟ health...|$|R
