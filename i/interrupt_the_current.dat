25|$|The {{system is}} powered by a {{lead-acid}} battery, which is charged by the car's electrical system using a dynamo or alternator. The engine operates contact breaker points, which <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> to an induction coil (known as the ignition coil).|$|E
2500|$|Vacuum circuit breakersWith {{rated current}} up to 6,300 A, and higher for {{generator}} circuit breakers. These breakers <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> by creating and extinguishing the arc {{in a vacuum}} container - aka [...] "bottle". Long life bellows are designed to travel the 6–10mm the contacts must part. These are generally applied for voltages up to about 40,500 V, which corresponds roughly to the medium-voltage range of power systems. Vacuum circuit breakers tend to have longer life expectancies between overhaul than do air circuit breakers.|$|E
2500|$|These signals work by {{preventing}} trains from entering a [...] "block" [...] occupied by another train. Typically, the blocks are [...] long, although some highly used lines, {{such as the}} IRT Lexington Avenue Line, use shorter blocks. Insulators divide the track segments into blocks. The two traveling rails conduct an electric current, as they are connected to an electric current. If the circuit is closed and electricity can travel across the rails without interruption, the signal will light up as green, as it is unoccupied by a train. When a train enters the block, the metal wheels <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> on the rails, and the signal turns red, marking the block as occupied. The train's maximum speed {{will depend on how}} many blocks are open in front of it. However, the signals do not register the trains' speed, nor do they register where in the block the train is located. If a train passes a red signal, the train stop automatically engages and prevents the train from moving forward.|$|E
50|$|The system {{delivers}} {{traffic information}} (TP and TA) to enabled devices, by <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> stream of media (radio, cd, etc.) and sends the traffic message.|$|R

50|$|Cycling is {{achieved}} by <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> through <b>the</b> electromagnet. Slippage normally occurs only during acceleration. When the clutch is fully engaged, there is no relative slip, assuming the clutch is sized properly, and thus torque transfer is 100% efficient.|$|R

"It grieves me, Sir Priest, to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> of your eloquence as discourteously as I {{have already}} broken your meditations; {{but the day}} already waneth to night.

60|$|As for Thousandacres, {{though he}} watched every {{movement}} of Ursula Malbone with jealous interest, {{he said nothing}} to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> of her feelings. As soon as she left her uncle's arms, however, Dus drew back and took the rude seat that I had placed for her close to Chainbearer's side. I was paid for this little act of attention by a sweet smile from its subject, and a lowering look from the old squatter, that admonished me {{of the necessity of}} being cautious of manifesting too much of the interest I felt in the beloved object before me. As is usual in assemblages composed of the rude and unpractised, a long, awkward pause succeeded this introduction of Dus to our presence. After a time, however, Aaron resumed the subject in hand.|$|E
6000|$|The {{faithful}} Tibb echoed her complaints, and, more violently clamorous, made deep {{promises of}} revenge on Sir Piercie Shafton, [...] "if {{there were a}} man left in the south who could draw a whinger, or a woman that could thraw a rape." [...] The presence of the Sub-Prior imposed silence on these clamours. He sate down by the unfortunate mother, and essayed, by such topics as his religion and reason suggested, to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> of Dame Glendinning's feelings; but the attempt was in vain. She listened, indeed, with some little interest, while he pledged his word and his influence with the Abbot, that the family which had lost their eldest-born {{by means of a}} guest received at his command, should experience particular protection {{at the hands of the}} community; and that the fief which belonged to Simon Glendinning should, with extended bounds and added privileges, be conferred on Edward.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> {{scheduler}} <b>interrupts</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> {{process or}} thread {{in a critical}} section, the scheduler will either allow the currently executing process or thread to run to completion of the critical section, or it will schedule the process or thread for another complete quantum. The scheduler will not migrate the process or thread to another processor, {{and it will not}} schedule another process or thread to run while <b>the</b> <b>current</b> process or thread is in a critical section.|$|R
2500|$|In {{electronics}} and electrical engineering, a fuse is an electrical safety device that operates to provide overcurrent protection of an electrical circuit. [...] Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it, thereby <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current.</b> It is a sacrificial device; once a fuse has operated {{it is an}} open circuit, {{and it must be}} replaced or rewired, depending on type.|$|R
25|$|The {{circuit breaker}} {{contacts}} must carry <b>the</b> load <b>current</b> without excessive heating, and must also withstand {{the heat of}} the arc produced when <b>interrupting</b> (opening) <b>the</b> circuit. Contacts are made of copper or copper alloys, silver alloys and other highly conductive materials. Service life of the contacts is limited by the erosion of contact material due to arcing while <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current.</b> Miniature and molded-case circuit breakers are usually discarded when the contacts have worn, but power circuit breakers and high-voltage circuit breakers have replaceable contacts.|$|R
50|$|The ISA-based Action Replay needs {{memory-resident}} {{drivers for}} both the real and protected mode. The card has a grabber, a trainer, and a slowdown feature. It can also <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> game or save it to disk (freezer).|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} powered by a {{lead-acid}} battery, which is charged by the car's electrical system using a dynamo or alternator. The engine operates contact breaker points, which <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> to an induction coil (known as the ignition coil).|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{breakdown}} or {{dielectric breakdown}} is when current flows through an electrical insulator when the voltage applied across it exceeds the breakdown voltage. This {{results in the}} insulator becoming electrically conductive. Electrical breakdown may be a momentary event (as in an electrostatic discharge), or {{may lead to a}} continuous arc if protective devices fail to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> in a power circuit.|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} field study <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> protection <b>current</b> offered by Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) to ten in-service reinforced concrete structures. The study aimed {{to identify the}} longterm effects of ICCP after it was recognised {{that some of the}} systems are now reaching the end of their design life and require a significant level of maintenance. It was found that after five or more years of ICCP, the steel remained passive for at least 24 months after <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> protection <b>current</b> despite chloride contamination that would represent a corrosion risk...|$|R
5000|$|In {{previous}} iOS versions, notifications {{popped up}} on the screen as dialog boxes, <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> activity. In iOS 5, notifications are revamped, and show up as a temporary banner {{at the top of the}} screen. Recent notifications can also be accessed by pulling a [...] "Notification Center" [...] down from the top of the screen.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the contact breaker is to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> flowing in the primary circuit of the {{ignition}} coil. When this occurs, the collapsing current induces a high voltage in the secondary winding of the coil, which has many more windings. This causes a very high voltage to appear at the coil output for a short period—enough to arc across the electrodes of a spark plug.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum circuit {{breakers}} - With rated current up to 6,300 A, and higher for generator {{circuit breakers}}.

5000|$|... ===Persistent arcs=== If a fuse {{or circuit}} breaker fails to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> through a spark {{in a power}} circuit, current may continue, forming a very hot {{electric}} arc (about 30 000 degrees). The color of an arc depends primarily upon the conducting gasses, {{some of which may}} have been solids before being vaporized and mixed into the hot plasma in the arc. The free ions in and around the arc recombine to create new chemical compounds, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide. Ozone is most easily noticed due to its distinct odour.|$|E
50|$|Since {{critical}} sections may execute only on {{the processor}} on which they are entered, synchronization is only required within the executing processor. This allows critical sections to be entered and exited at almost zero cost. No inter-processor synchronization is required. Only instruction stream synchronization is needed. Most processors provide the required amount of synchronization by {{the simple act of}} <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> execution state. This allows critical sections in most cases to be nothing more than a per processor count of critical sections entered.|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{a switch}} is an electrical component that can [...] "make" [...] or [...] "break" [...] an electrical circuit, <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> or diverting {{it from one}} conductor to another.The mechanism of a switch removes or restores the conducting path in a circuit when it is operated. It may be operated manually, for example, a light switch or a keyboard button, may be operated by a moving object such as a door, or may be operated by some sensing element for pressure, temperature or flow.|$|R
25|$|The Benz Patent-Motorwagon and the Ford Model T used a {{trembler}} {{coil ignition}} system. A trembler coil was a battery-powered induction coil; <b>the</b> trembler <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> through <b>the</b> coil and caused a quick series of sparks during each firing. The trembler coil would be energized at an appropriate {{point in the}} engine cycle. In the Model T, the four-cylinder engine had a trembler coil for each cylinder; a commutator (timer case) delivered power to the trembler coils. The Model T would be started on battery but then switched to an alternator.|$|R
5000|$|Even in a CPU which {{supports}} nested interrupts, a handler is often reached with all interrupts globally masked by a CPU hardware operation. In this architecture, an interrupt handler would normally save the smallest amount of context necessary, and then reset the global interrupt disable flag {{at the first}} opportunity, to permit higher priority interrupts to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> handler. It is also important for the interrupt handler to quell the current interrupt source by some method (often toggling a flag bit of some kind in a peripheral register) so that the current interrupt isn't immediately repeated on handler exit, resulting in an infinite loop.|$|E
50|$|In {{competitive}} debate, {{most commonly}} in the World Schools, Karl Popper and British Parliamentary debate styles, a Point of Information or a POI {{is when a}} member of the team opposing that of the current speaker gets to briefly <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> speaker, offering a POI {{in the form of a}} question or a statement. This may be as a correction, asking for clarity or just a plain question. As in some debating styles, such as World Schools Style, they often may not be offered in the first or last minute of any speech (known as protected time), or during reply speeches. Points of information may never be offered to {{a member of the}} same team.|$|E
5000|$|Callan's {{induction}} coil also used an interrupter {{that consisted of}} a rocking wire that repeatedly dipped into a small cup of mercury (similar to the interrupters used by Charles Page). Because of {{the action of the}} interrupter, which could make and break the current going into the coil, he called his device the [...] "repeater." [...] Actually, this device was the world's first transformer. Callan had induced a high voltage in the second wire, starting with a low voltage in the adjacent first wire. And the faster he interrupted the current, the bigger the spark. In 1837 he produced his giant induction machine: using a mechanism from a clock to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> 20 times a second, it generated 15 in sparks, an estimated 60,000 volts and the largest artificial bolt of electricity then seen.|$|E
50|$|Gnawgahyde is sent with newer Dreadnoks when Tomax and Xamot {{decide to}} {{physically}} destroy {{the evidence of}} a money laundering scheme, which involves a television studio. His team includes the diminutive Rugrat, the female Heart-Wrencher and the Dreadnok mechanic Burn-Out. The last man, eager to break things instead of fix them, starts the action early by <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> program, a cooking show. Coincidentally, this is hosted by G.I. Joe member Roadblock. The soldier and his co-host defeat the Dreadnoks in hand-to-hand combat. The cooking program becomes a rousing success due to the recorded footage.|$|R
50|$|This {{creates an}} {{electrical}} circuit that is monitored by signaling equipment. In normal operation, <b>the</b> electric <b>current</b> in <b>the</b> fence wires causes a relay to energize, {{indicating that the}} fence is intact. When a rock slide occurs, the rock breaks {{one or more of}} <b>the</b> wires, <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current.</b> This causes <b>the</b> relay to become de-energized, indicating that a rock slide has occurred. A contact of the relay is typically used to prevent the approaching signal from displaying a proceed aspect if the fence has been broken. Restoring normal operation requires splicing the broken fence wires back together.|$|R
50|$|As {{the magnet}} moves {{with respect to}} the coil, the {{magnetic}} flux linkage of the coil changes. This induces an EMF in the coil, which in turn causes a current to flow. One or more times per revolution, just as the magnet pole moves away from the coil and the magnetic flux begins to decrease, a cam opens the contact breaker and <b>interrupts</b> <b>the</b> <b>current.</b> This causes <b>the</b> electromagnetic field in the primary coil to collapse rapidly. As the field collapses rapidly there is a large voltage induced (as described by Faraday's Law) across the primary coil.|$|R
5000|$|The {{debates in}} each episode are tightly structured. Each of the news issues is {{introduced}} by a thirty-second video followed by a nine-minute discussion. One guest starts the discussion and has one minute to introduce the debate, with no one allowed to interrupt. Then each of the remaining two guests gives their one-minute take on the issue. After the first speaker, each guest also has one [...] "right of rebuttal", allowing them to <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> speaker with an interjection lasting at most 30 seconds. When a speaker is interrupted, they have a further 60 seconds to respond. Once each speaker {{has been able to}} speak for 60 seconds without interruption, the discussion continues with the presenter asking questions of the three guests. The first speaker in the first three issues under debate is chosen by the order in which they signed for the show. The first speaker in the fourth debate is the one currently placed second in the tele-voting, while the first speaker in the fifth debate is the one currently placed last.|$|E

50|$|The {{electric}} arc is self-sustaining; once the tube is triggered, it conducts until <b>the</b> arc is <b>interrupted</b> by <b>the</b> <b>current</b> falling {{too low for}} too long (under 10 milliamperes for more than 100 microseconds for the KN22 krytrons).|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for measuring IR-free potentials of electrodes of full-size electrolytic cells. It consists of <b>interrupting</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> on {{a small fraction of}} the working electrode only, called the probe electrode, and measuring the potential difference between probe electrode and reference electrode.

40|$|The FM 08 style fuse is {{specified}} {{to interrupt}} an overcurrent {{of up to}} 300 A in a bus of up to 125 VDC, but this applies only when its barrel is filled with air. When placed into a space-grade vacuum, the FM 08 style fuse exhausts its air within a year. Then, the probability of an enduring arc is high for all ratings when the bus is above 75 VDC, and the overcurrent is large. The arc endures until something else <b>interrupts</b> <b>the</b> <b>current.</b> <b>The</b> fuse can violently eject metal vapor or other material during the sustained arcing. The evacuated FM 08 does not develop a sustained arc when interrupted in a bus of 38 VDC or less, at least when there is little inductance in the circuit. This is consistent with its successful use in many spacecraft having buses in the range 24 to 36 volts...|$|R
