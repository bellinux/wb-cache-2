50|$|In many instances, {{microbiological}} reductive dechlorination of chlorinated {{organic molecules}} {{is important for}} bioremediation of polluted groundwater.

Bioremediation of these chloroethenes can occur when other microorganisms at the contaminated site provide H2 as a natural byproduct of various fermentation reactions. The dechlorinating bacteria use this H2 as their electron donor, ultimately replacing chlorine atoms in the chloroethenes with hydrogen atoms via hydrogenolytic reductive dechlorination. If the soil and groundwater contain enough organic electron donor and the appropriate strains of Dehalococcoides, this process can proceed until all of the chlorine atoms are removed, and TCE is dechlorinated completely via dichloroethene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) to ethene, a harmless end-product.|$|E

Additionally, Mancelona hosts the annual [...] "Bass Festival", a four-day event featuring a Grand Parade, carnival, flea market, and other community activities. The Bass Festival is held the first weekend in June. In 1999, a new high school was opened, and renovations to the middle school were completed. Up until recently, the town had three factories that employed most of the town. The largest factory, a Dura Automotive Systems plant, closed in February 2009 and the community has had a change for the worse. From 1947 to 1967, Mount Clemens Industries, Incorporated, formerly Mt. Clemens Metal Products Company, used trichloroethylene (TCE) in vapor degreasers. Afterwards, the TCE was disposed of by dumping it on the ground near the building. Some TCE may also have been dumped into seepage pits and burned. Through these improper disposal methods, TCE has now contaminated the groundwater in and around Mancelona, MI. The contaminated plume begins at the manufacturing plant, currently known as Dura Automotive Manufacturing Plant, and extends approximately six miles to the northwest to the Schuss Mountain/Shanty Creek Resort area. The leading edge of the Wickes Manufacturing TCE Plume (also known as Mancelona-Cedar River TCE Plume), at the resort area, is approximately 1.25 miles wide. The plume has also reached the Cedar River, and is now contaminating a cold-water, high quality trout stream. TCE is a colorless liquid with a sweet odor similar to chloroform. TCE is most commonly used as a <b>degreasing</b> <b>solvent</b> in manufacturing plants. Breathing small amounts may cause headaches, dizziness, lung irritation, and difficulty concentrating. Drinking water that contains TCE {{over an extended period of}} time can lead to liver and kidney problems and may also be carcinogenic.The TOSC Program at Michigan State University has been asked to provide assistance to Mancelona-area citizens regarding the Mancelona-Cedar River TCE Plume. TOSC met with Antrim County United through Ecology (ACUTE) and Mancelona-area citizens to assess community concerns and discuss TOSC's involvement.

40|$|Past use of {{trichloroethylene}} (TCE) as a <b>degreasing</b> <b>solvent</b> {{for aircraft}} maintenance {{has resulted in}} widespread groundwater contamination at Air Force Bases around the world. Travis AFB in California and Fairchild AFB in Washington are evaluating phytoremediation as a treatment option, since trees {{have been reported to}} take up dissolved TCE from shallow groundwater and volatilize it to the atmosphere while enhancing the volatilization of TCE from surrounding soil. Previous studies generally focused on the identification of removal mechanisms. The emphasis of this research was to quantify total TCE removal from phytoremediation demonstration plots at Travis and Fairchild AFBs. Tree cores, collected using an increment borer and analyzed using headspace GC/MS, were used to determine the relative TCE concentrations within the plume beneath the trees and to estimate the mass of TCE in each tree. To estimate the volatilization of TCE from leaves, a small section of tree branch was placed inside a flow-through glass chamber. Continuous air flow through the chamber maintained normal transpiration and temperature. Air exiting the chamber was sampled for TCE using Tenax® tubes. Humidity probes placed at the chamber entry and exit were used to estimate transpiration. Volatilization of TCE from tree trunk and soil surfaces was measured by enclosing a section of trunk or ground surface within a small stainless steel chamber. Fans in the chamber mixed the air that was recirculated through Tenax® tubes to continuously remove TCE. After a measured time interval, the Tenax® tubes were analyzed for TCE by thermal desorption GC/MS. By using a Thiessen polygon method, the removal of TCE was estimated to be 839 g/yr at Travis and 18 g/yr at Fairchild with the majority from leaf and soil volatilization. Soil surface volatilization of TCE was greater inside the planted areas than outside the planted areas, indicating that the trees enhance this removal by this mechanism. Based on these estimates phytoremediation removed 5 and 50 % of the mass of TCE in the groundwater at Fairchild and Travis Air Force sites, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a carcinogenic, {{chlorinated}} {{volatile organic}} compound that was commonly used as a <b>degreasing</b> <b>solvent</b> for aircraft maintenance at many US Air Force bases. Past improper disposal of TCE has resulted in contaminated groundwater at many of these facilities. Phytoremediation, defined {{as the use of}} plants and their associated microorganisms to stabilize or remove contamination, has been implemented as part of a TCE groundwater cleanup at Travis Air Force base near Sacramento, CA and is being considered as a remediation option at other bases. Volatilization of TCE from leaves and the surface of the soil near the trees were shown {{to be the most important}} removal mechanisms at the Travis site. Past studies conducted on indigenous trees growing above TCE contaminated groundwater at several Hill Air Force Base (HAFB) locations have also shown that TCE is taken up and volatilized by the trees. However, phytoremediation has not been implemented, in part because of the difficulty in predicting the potential effectiveness of TCE removal over time. Flow through or recirculating chambers were used to quantify the amount of TCE removed by volatilization through leaf, trunk, and soil surfaces. Tenax™ sorbent tubes, used to collect TCE from the chambers, were analyzed by thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Tree cores were collected using an incremental borer and analyzed by headspace GC/MS to quantify the TCE mass contained in the trees. Field measured transpiration stream concentrations (TSC) and groundwater data were used to calculate transpiration stream concentration factors (TSCF) for TCE. Comparing current and historical data, it was found that trees reach a steady state TSCF value of 0. 26 after about 15 years. Using this information, it was predicted that a phytoremediation plot containing 40 poplar trees located in a seep area within HAFB OU 2 would remove 4. 82 kg of TCE annually.

Although toluene {{is reported to be}} the most effective inducer, it is regulated as a hazardous material and should not be applied to the environment.

40|$|With {{environmental}} regulations limiting {{the use of}} volatile organic compounds, low-vapor pressure solvents have replaced traditional <b>degreasing</b> <b>solvents</b> for bond substrate preparation. When used to clean and prepare porous bond substrates such as phenolic composites, low vapor pressure solvents can penetrate deep into substrate pore networks and remain there for extended periods. Trapped solvents can interact with applied adhesives either prior to or during cure, potentially compromising bond properties. Currently, methods for characterizing solvent time-depth profiles in bond substrates are limited to bulk gravimetric or sectioning techniques. While sectioning techniques such as microtome allow construction of solvent depth profiles, their depth resolution and reliability are limited by substrate type. Sectioning techniques are particularly limited near the adhesive-substrate interface where depth resolution is further limited by adhesive-substrate hardness and, {{in the case of}} a partially cured adhesive, mechanical properties differences. Additionally, sectioning techniques cannot provide information about lateral solvent diffusion. Cross-section component mapping is an alternative method for measuring solvent migration in porous substrates that eliminates the issues associated with sectioning techniques. With cross-section mapping, the solvent-wiped substrate is sectioned perpendicular rather than parallel to the wiped surface, and the sectioned surface is analyzed for the solvent or solvent components of interest using a two-dimensional mapping or imaging technique. Solvent mapping can be performed using either direct or indirect methods. With a direct method, one or more solvent components are mapped using red or Raman spectroscopy together with a moveable sample stage and/or focal plane array detector. With an indirect method, an elemental "tag" not present in the substrate is added to the solvent before the substrate is wiped. Following cross sectioning, the tag element can then be mapped by its characteristic x-ray emission using either x-ray fluorescence, or electron-beam energy-and wavelength-dispersive x-ray spectrometry. The direct mapping techniques avoid issues of different diffusion or migration rates of solvents and elemental tags, while the indirect techniques avoid spectral resolution issues in cases where solvents and substrates have adjacent or overlapping peaks.

The long-range goal of the U. S. Magnetic Fusion Energy Research Program is to create innovations to make fusion power a practical reality [...] an alternative energy source. 1999 marked the first year of National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) operations and Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) dismantlement and deconstruction activities. A collaboration among fourteen national laboratories, universities, and research institutions, the NSTX is a major element in the U. S. Fusion Energy Sciences Program. It has been designed to test the physics principles of spherical torus (ST) plasmas. The ST concept could {{play an important role in}} the development of smaller, more economical fusion reactors. With its completion within budget and ahead of its target schedule, NSTX first plasma occurred on February 12, 1999. The 1999 performance of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory was rated ''outstanding'' by the U. S. Department of Energy in the Laboratory Appraisal report issued early in 2000. The report cited the Laboratory's consistently excellent scientific and technological achievements, its successful management practices, and included high marks in a host of other areas including environmental management, employee health and safety, human resources administration, science education, and communications. Groundwater investigations continued under a voluntary agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. PPPL monitored for the presence of non-radiological contaminants, mainly volatile organic compounds (components of <b>degreasing</b> <b>solvents).</b> Monitoring revealed the presence of low levels of volatile organic compounds in an area adjacent to PPPL.

With its completion within budget and ahead of its target schedule, NSTX first plasma occurred on February 12, 1999. In 2000, PPPL's radiological environmental monitoring program measured tritium in the air at on-site and off-site sampling stations. PPPL is capable of detecting small changes in the ambient levels of tritium by using highly sensitive monitors. The operation of an in-stack monitor located on D-site is a requirement of the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) regulations with limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The results of the 2001 environmental surveillance and monitoring program for PPPL are presented and discussed. The report also summarizes environmental initiatives, assessments, and programs that were undertaken in 2001. PPPL has engaged in fusion energy research since 1951. The vision of the Laboratory is to create innovations to make fusion power a practical reality [...] a clean, alternative energy source.

30|$|In industry, polychlorinated ethanes and propanes {{are used}} as <b>solvents,</b> <b>degreasing</b> agents, and paint removers; they are also {{globally}} produced {{on a massive scale}} as intermediates during production of other industrially important chemicals ([De Wildeman and Verstraete, 2003]; [Field and Sierra-Alvarez, 2004]). Due to spills and past disposal methods, these chlorinated organic compounds are prevalent groundwater and soil contaminants. For example, 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCA) is present in at least 570 current or former Superfund sites [(ATSDR 2001]), and 1, 2 -dichloropropane (1, 2 -DCP) is present at more than 100 Superfund sites ([Fletcher et al., 2009]). The prevalence of these polychlorinated alkanes as environmental contaminants is of concern because of their known or suspected toxicity and/or carcinogenicity ([ATSDR, 2001]; [1989]).|$|R
40|$|Hazardous wastes are {{generated}} from cold <b>solvent</b> <b>degreasing</b> operations {{used in many}} industrial processes. The spent solvents are managed under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). With the land ban of spent solvents, disposal has become increasingly difficult. As a result, industries began investigating ways to avoid using RCKA listed cleaning solvents. EPA's Pollut. ion Prevention Research Branch along with APS Materials, Inc [...] a small metal finishing company, participated in a joint research project to evaluate the substitution of a dilute, terpene-based cleaner for 1, 1, 1 trichloroethane (TCA) and methanol, hazardous wastes FO 0 l and F 003 respectively, in their degreasing operations.

40|$|Cleaning {{has always}} been an {{important}} step in manufacturing operations. Cleaning proceeds functions such as machining, inspection, plating, bonding, welding, heat treatment, and painting. If a surface is not properly cleaned or prepared, the results can be disastrous. The majority of industry has used cleaning methods such as vapor <b>degreasing</b> or <b>solvent</b> cleaning with chlorinated solvents such as chlorofluorocarbons, methyl chloroform, or perchloroethylene. These solvents were non-flammable, were considered to have low toxicity, and worked fairly well. However, recent finding regarding these solvents have caused them to fall from favor. Chlorofluorocarbons and methyl chloroform have been implicated as ozone depleting substances and are being regulated as such. Current plans call for a ban on production of these substances in the year 2000 and 2005, respectively. Perchloroethylene has been classified as a suspect carcinogen and has also come under recent guidelines and regulations in the United States. Personnel at the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant have been actively pursuing substitutes for these solvents. Ultrasonic cleaning with aqueous detergent was originally implemented as a substitute for vapor degreasing at Y- 12 approximately 7 years ago. This type of cleaning has been proven to be very reliable and effective. Organic solvents to replace chlorinated solvents have also been investigated for "squir...|$|R
