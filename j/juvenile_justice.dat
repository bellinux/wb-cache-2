40|$|The {{justice system}} handles {{thousands}} of cases involving juvenile victims each year. These victims {{are served by}} {{a complex set of}} agencies and institutions, including police, prosecutors, courts, and child protection agencies. Despite the many cases involving juvenile victims and the structure in place for responding to them, the <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system model presented in this Bulletin is a new concept. Although the <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system has a distinct structure and sequence, its operation is not very well understood. Unlike the more familiar <b>juvenile</b> offender <b>justice</b> system, the <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system has not been conceptualized as a whole or implemented by a common set of statutes. This Bulletin identifies the major elements of the <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system by delineating how cases move through the system. It reviews each step in the case flow process for the child protection and criminal justice systems and describes the interaction of the agencies an individuals involved. Recognizing how the <b>juvenile</b> victim <b>justice</b> system works can inform policy decisions and improve outcomes for juvenile victims. Acknowledging the existence of the system has important implications for system integration, information sharing, and data collection—all of which {{play a key role in}} ensuring the safety and well-being of juvenile victims...|$|R

5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> system, however. He {{encouraged}} passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The prison barge was {{temporarily}} closed in August 1995 due to less crowded city jails, {{caused by a}} decline in arrests and inmate transfers. In late 1996, the prison was slated for reopening due to the rise in arrests from a campaign targeting drugs and drug dealers. The six-month campaign expected more than seven thousand additional arrests than usual, but the ship was not reopened until 1998 when it {{was used by the}} Department of <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Justice.</b> The Bain Center is currently used as a processing facility for inmates in the Department of Corrections system. There are three other processing facilities that each handle specific boroughs.|$|E
5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on <b>juvenile</b> <b>justice</b> that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is {{accurate}} then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E

40|$|Problems in Juvenile Criminal Justice" The {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> issues in the Czech Republic. The work is divided into three parts. The first part includes a historical view of the punishment of minors and the situation before the adoption of Act No. 218 / 2003 Coll. The second part describes the basic principles of <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> which are important for the understanding of the meaning of the Act. A study of basic principles can assist in drawing attention to controversial issues, or perhaps also assist in resolving them. The third part is divided into four chapters by individual selected institutes of the Act. What is analyzed in detail are issues of the protection of minors' privacy, the question of the changed local jurisdiction of the juvenile court, the withdrawal from the criminal prosecution and the institute of arrest. Keywords: <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> minors basic principle...|$|R

40|$|How {{should we}} respond to a {{criminal}} offence committed by a young person? It is obvious {{that this is a}} very complex question. Multiple factors play important roles: the offence itself, but also the juvenile’s background in terms of education, socialization, prior convictions, etc. Every case is unique, but the criminal legal system has to follow the principles of legal certainty and predictability. A legal response to juvenile offending is a consequence of the criminal action, but it also has to consider the lesser maturity and greater vulnerability of young offenders. This dualism makes a trial against a young perpetrator complicated. The ideology of culpability and punishment emphasizes the seriousness of a certain offence. The ideology of welfare accentuates the social situation of the young offender and his or her individual needs. <b>Juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> systems seem to face contradictory demands: from the law in a strict sense and from society at large. They are caught in the middle: between the culpability for the offence and the best interests of the young person. This thesis investigates the tension(s) between “welfare” and “justice” that the <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> system has to deal with (the “welfare/justice clash”) in Sweden and Germany. After exploring the differences between young and adult offenders which underlie the welfare/justice clash, the project presents an in-depth investigation of the Swedish and the German <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> systems. Thus, this study is comparative in its approach. To illustrate the different forms the welfare/justice clash takes in the Swedish and the German <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> systems, I focus on these systems’ guiding principles, legal responses and sentencing rules, procedural rules and safeguards, and on the figures in the juvenile courtroom. The investigation is not limited to a doctrinal study. I also present an empirical study, in the form of participant observations in the juvenile courtroom and semi-structured interviews with judges and public prosecutors from both countries, to gain insight into legal practice. The study of the two <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> systems shows that the theoretical welfare/justice clash is visible in books as well as in action, irrespective of the different approaches towards young offenders these countries pursue. However, this does not appear to give rise to any major problems in legal practice, as surprising as this may be. The practitioners in the juvenile courtroom seem to be able to balance and respect both ideologies. In the analysis, I suggest an explanation for the ability of the <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> systems in Sweden and in Germany to function in spite of the tensions highlighted in the previous chapters. Here, I switch perspectives from an internal view of the <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> system to an external view. I suggest abandoning the purely legal dogmatic (justice) approach and the purely welfare-based or social approach and instead combining elements of them in an approach to <b>juvenile</b> criminal <b>justice</b> that understands it as a system in its own right...|$|R

We present evidence from a longitudinal social network analysis of a sample of 55 young adult offenders (18 - 21 years old) serving probation and custody in Catalonia during 2013. Results show different profiles of clients regarding their background and network properties, as well as different explanations for desistance regarding processes of psychosocial maturation, the experience of the sanction and the network resources...|$|R
