40|$|Calcium-aluminum-rich {{inclusions}} (CAIs) are {{the oldest}} solar system solids known in primitive meteorites (chondrites). They predate the other components by 1 - 2 Myr, and likely condensed {{within a short}} time interval, close to the Sun in the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Their preservation must counterbalance both the sunward drift caused by gas drag and the general inward motion of the <b>entraining</b> <b>gas.</b> We propose that an efficient outward transport of CAIs can be achieved by advection {{as a result of the}} viscous expansion of the disk, provided it is initially less than 10 AU in size, which we argue is plausible from both observational and theoretical points of view. Gas drag would stop this outward motion within $ 10 ^ 5 $ yr. However, by that time, a magnetically dead zone would have developed as gravitational instabilities fade away, which would trap CAIs for a significant fraction of the disk lifetime because of the reduced advection velocities. The dead zone would also prevent outward diffusion of subsequently condensed CAIs, contributing to their observed narrow age range. This preservation mechanism is independent of the outward transport scenario (before the dead zone formation) and a natural consequence of considering the source of turbulence in accretion disks.

30|$|Historically, one of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in algae cultivation is CO 2 limitation. Carbon constitutes almost 50  % by weight of the elemental composition of algal biomass, with CO 2 representing the most significant nutrient requirement. One of the inherent benefits of working with coal flue gas is the high percentage of CO 2 in the gas (10 – 15  %) as compared to atmospheric conditions (0.04  %). Introducing CO 2 -rich gas to the system can often be energy intensive, {{as is the case in}} systems requiring gas compression and bubbling. To minimize the costs associated with CO 2 entrainment, while maximizing mass transfer, a liquid driven vacuum pump (i.e., venturi or eductor) was employed in this study. An eductor uses the Bernoulli principle to <b>entrain</b> <b>gas</b> in a driven liquid flow. The extremely turbulent nature of the biphasic flow encourages good mixing and mass transfer, thereby facilitating CO 2 dissolution in the growth medium.|$|R

At low oil flow rates, a well becomes unstable and this leads to reduced production and processing problems. The formation of slug flow in pipelines is a manifestation of such instability. The front of a slug may be regarded as a propagating, continuously breaking wave, which continuously <b>entrains</b> <b>gas.</b> The Study Group was asked to explore alternative or new ways to treat the gas entrainment problem, to improve understanding of physical processes governing entrainment and to suggest models for the various phenomena. The Study Group obtained mathematical models of slug propagation in horizontal and inclined pipelines, examined possible models of gas entrainment, and outlined an approach to modelling the onset of slug flow.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the general {{topic of the}} gas entrainment from a free surface by a swirl issued from the pumping of fluids below the free surface. This phenomenon is investigated through an analytical experiment in water. A shear flow is generated between a horizontal flow and a stagnant flow. At {{the bottom of the}} test section, a vertical pumping is added to produce gas entrainment. One particularity of these experiments is the possibility to change the shape of the channel generating the inlet conditions by adding obstacles so as to trigger different conditions for the turbulent shear flow. Depending on the flow conditions, a surface swirl can be created with a sufficient strength to <b>entrain</b> <b>gas</b> below the free surface to the vertical pumping outlet. The frequency of gas entrainment occurrence is measured using visualizations of the flow.

40|$|A {{plunging}} jet is {{an efficient}} device to <b>entrain</b> <b>gas</b> into liquid flow. In many practical occasions, the gas entrainment {{needs to be}} carefully controlled, and {{the interaction between the}} shear flow turbulence and entrained bubbles has to be better understood. This paper presents a physical study of vertical supported two-dimensional plunging jets using a relatively large-size facility. The air-water flow and turbulence properties were measured with an intrusive phase-detection probe and a total pressure sensor simultaneously. The inflow pre-aeration and turbulence level of the falling jet were carefully characterised, and the effects of jet impact velocity and jet length on air entrainment in plunging pool were investigated. The experimental results were systematically compared to relevant studies. A discussion was developed on the quantification of turbulence intensity in highly-aerated flow based on total pressure measurement. The flow turbulence properties were derived respectively from the interfacial phase-detection signals and total pressure signals. The results highlighted difference in terms of the turbulence intensities between interfacial motions and water-phase turbulence. The present work showed that the jet impact velocity, jet length, inflow disturbance and pre-entrainment of air had considerable effects on air entrainment capacity and subsurface air-water flow properties in plunging jets hence should be carefully characterised in relevant studies...|$|R

However, {{the importance of}} these structural characteristics on other physical processes within a peatland has not been fully assessed. Here, we evaluate the importance of peat structure on its ability to <b>entrain</b> biogenic <b>gas</b> bubbles and control ebullition, an important transport mechanism for methane. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was applied to characterize the structure of a range of peats at varying levels of decomposition. The structural properties of the peat were quantified from a vector representation of the CT images, and the potential of each sample to <b>entrain</b> biogenic <b>gas</b> bubbles was quantified using a rule-based Monte Carlo model that calculates the tortuosity of bubbles pathways through the peat. Sixty-six percent of the variability in the trapping potential of the peat results from porosity variations and 34 % from structural variations between samples. A metric that represents this structural control was not identified for all peat types because of difficulties adequately representing some peats as a vector network. However, for S. magellanicum peat we were able to establish that the influence of peat structure on the entrainment of gas bubbles is characterized by (L) over bar (v), the average vector length of the stems and branches. Peat characterized by longer structural components (larger (L) over bar (v)) enhances the entrainment of gas bubbles. Our findings demonstrate the need to incorporate some representation of the peat structure in numerical models of biogenic gas transport in peat...|$|R

This process is analogous to what occurred in the fall-out suevite deposits at the Ries impact structure in Germany. At Ries, impact heating of water-bearing target material resulted in the rapid degassing of its water and other volatiles. The martian environment {{plays an important role in}} enhancing the effects of this degassing by increasing the flow-speed of the escaping gas. The high flow-rate of gas through particulate materials, such as suevite, tends to quickly form segregation channels or vent pipes, similar to those found in the Ries deposits.

40|$|Gas-mixing {{phenomena}} {{may play}} a significant role in fluidized bed combustion of solid fuels. Issues associated with gas mixing include: a) effectiveness of mass transfer between the bubble and the emulsion phases in the bed; b) degree of mixing between segregated gaseous streams in plume-like or bubbly flow in the bottom bed; c) extent of mixing between segregated gaseous pockets/streams in the splashing zone or in the upper freeboard. Among the others, issues b) and c) turn out to be relevant to fluidized bed combustion of high-volatile solid fuels (biomass, RDF, etc.). In this case, the rate of gas mixing often overcomes intrinsic kinetics as the rate-controlling step in volatile matter burn-out, especially under "stratified" combustion conditions. Despite several and significant contributions to the subject, understanding of gas-mixing in bubbling fluidized beds is still poor and calls for additional investigation. The present work aims at investigating gas-mixing in bubbling fluidized bed with specific reference to the above issue c). A laser assisted imaging technique has been used to characterize the hydrodynamic patterns associated with the bursting of either isolated bubbles or couples of closely time-delayed bubbles at the surface of a fluidized bed. Quantitative image analysis procedures were exploited in order to assess parameters defining the general fluid-dynamic behaviour and macromixing of the bubble-generated gas pockets with the mainstream gas. The formation of toroidal flow structures upon bubble bursting is highlighted in the case of isolated bubbles. The toroidal pockets <b>entrain</b> mainstream <b>gas</b> and grow accordingly while rising along the splash zone. Toroidal flow structures are observed also in the case of couples of closely time-delayed bubbles, but interference between leading and trailing pockets leads to more complex structures characterized by multiple incoherent eddies.

The sketch on the right shows a cross section through a smokebox, rotated 90 degrees; it can be seen that the same components are present, albeit differently named, as in the generic diagram of an injector at the top of the article. Exhaust steam from the cylinders is directed through a nozzle on the end of the blastpipe, to reduce pressure inside the smokebox by <b>entraining</b> the flue <b>gases</b> from the boiler which are then ejected via the chimney. The effect is to increase the draught on the fire to a degree proportional to the rate of steam consumption, so that as more steam is used, more heat is generated from the fire and steam production is also increased.

However, due {{to the complexity of}} fuel-oil combustion, to date HiTAC is mainly applied to gaseous fuel or coal, and little is known about spray combustion under HiTAC condition. In the present study, we numerically investigate the Delft Spray-in-Hot-Coflow (DSHC) using ethanol in high temperature diluted combustion air, and extend it to more co-flow conditions. We employ different temperatures and oxygen concentrations of the co-flow in order to dilute the oxidizer/fuel before it reacts with the fuel/ oxidizer. The pressure-swirl atomizer model with an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was implemented for the spray modeling. Collision, coalescence, secondary breakup and evaporation of the drops were taken into account. The steady laminar flamelet model for the combustion of ethanol, the Discrete Ordinate model for radiation and the k-ε model for the turbulence with enhanced wall treatment were validated by the simulation of the NIST flame under conventional conditions and then used in the current study. The results indicate that the decreased peak temperature in many HiTAC applications with high temperature combustion air is mainly due to the reduced oxygen concentration by <b>entraining</b> flue <b>gas.</b> In the present study, a low oxygen concentration slows the evaporation process of droplets.

However the dynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. For the typical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a rapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole.

However, the observed median optical depths for the τCIV(τHI) and τSi IV(τHI) relations are higher than those measured from the mock spectra. The discrepancy increases from up to ≈ 0. 1 dex at τHI = 1 to ≈ 1 dex at τHI = 102, where we are likely probing dense regions at small galactocentric distances. As possible solutions, we invoke (a) models of ionizing radiation softened above 4 Ryd to account for delayed completion of He II reionization; (b) simulations run at higher resolution; (c) the inclusion of additional line broadening due to unresolved turbulence; and (d) increased elemental abundances; however, none of these factors can fully explain the observed differences. Enhanced photoionization of HI by local sources, which was not modelled, could offer a solution.

40|$|The {{key issues}} {{addressed}} this quarter {{were related to}} operational problems in the coal feed system, namely, the inability to accurately measure all of air entering the system, and plugging of coal in the feed lines due to poor entrainment. Both of these problems caused unacceptable uncertainty and/or fluctuations in the operating conditions and therefore required solutions. The coal entrainment problem was solved by installing a new educator designed for <b>entraining</b> solids in <b>gas</b> streams. All of the air entering the reactor now flows through the educator, either as motive air or through the suction air inlet. This ensures that the coal is entrained at relatively high velocity, {{so that it will}} flow to the reactor without forming slugs in the lines. A new feeder shroud was also installed with an air jet directed towards the auger to sweep off the tip in order to reduce pulsations when feeding coal. The problems associated with accurately metering the air have been somewhat more difficult to resolve. New strategies for completely closing the system have been tested and look promising. A new flowmeter was also purchased with cost sharing funds to directly measure the air flow rate of the two phase stream (after the coal injection point). If the system can be operated without leaks, then the changes will provide two independent measurements of the air flow to ensure accuracy. If the system cannot be sealed, the new flowmeter will still provide reliable measurement of the air flow and permit proper operation of the combustor. Consequently, we feel that the problems have been resolved {{and we look forward to}} a productive next quarter...|$|R
40|$|Idealized FIRETEC grassfire {{simulations}} {{were used}} to study some of the roles that three-dimensional aspects of coupled atmosphere/fire interactions play on fire behavior. Domains of various widths that were periodic in the cross-stream direction, simulating an infinite-length fireline, {{were used to}} isolate local fireline-scale threedimensional effects. Two-dimensional vertical plane (zero width) simulations were performed for comparison. Idealized finite-length fire simulations were used to study the larger fire-scale three-dimensional effects. In the infinitely long simulations the fireline remains fairly straight on a macroscale while significant heterogeneities develop along the fireline at fireline-scales. These simulations suggest {{that the nature of}} atmosphere–fire coupling and these heterogeneities are influenced by wind speed. At low wind speed, the spread rate is not significantly affected by the width of the domain (for domains greater than 10 m wide). For higher wind speeds, the flank of the simulated firelines is fingered and the front of the fireline exhibits lobes. The average spread rates vary by approximately 20 % for the different domain widths. In the finite-length fireline simulations, the fireline shape was fairly parabolic and the headfire rate of spread (ROS) increased with wind speed and length of ignition line. The curvature of the fire was also influenced by the length of the ignition line. The indrafts of the headfire and flanking fire lines compete for upstream wind. For wider fires, the separation between the flanking fire lines is larger and more of the upstream wind is able to reach the headfire. These finite-length simulations also suggest that there might be an overall negative pressure gradient from upwind of the fireline to downwind of the fireline near the ground. This pressure gradient is believed to be tied to the penetration of wind through the fireline and the convective heating of unburned fuel. Streamwise-vorticity pairs contribute to the heterogeneous appearance of the fire front by feeding upward momentum in the location where towers are seen on the fireline and thrusting hot gases through the fireline and down to the unburned fuel in the troughs between the firelines. These streamwise vorticies have also been recognized in the periodic infinite length and finite-length simulated firelines as well as laboratory tests. In the two-dimensional simulations with wind speeds above 3 m/s, one major effect of the two-dimensional restrictions is to preclude the nominally streamwise-vorticity structures from forming upstream of the fireline. This thus diminishes the ability of the wind to mix through the heated plume and <b>entrain</b> hot <b>gases</b> down into the fuels ahead of the fire. These simulations suggest that caution should be used when attempting to use one or two-dimensional models to simulate wildland fires. These simulations also suggest the significant value of experiments in which details of both flow and fire dynamics can be studied at scales ranging from fireline scale to overall fire geometry scales in order to better understand fire behavior. The hypothesis generated here can help provide insight in support of experimental design and analysis...|$|R

A definitive version was subsequently published in Journal of Marine Systems, 2014, Vol. 131, pp. 1 - 9 DOI: [URL] water dynamics in the near field of a massive gas eruption near Panarea (Aeolian Islands volcanic arc, SE Tyrrhenian Sea) is described. ADCP current-meters were deployed during the paroxysmal phase in 2002 and 2003 a few meters from the degassing vent, recording day-long timeseries. Datasets were sorted to remove errors and select good quality ensembles over the entire water column. Standard deviation of error velocity was considered a proxy for inhomogeneous velocity fields over beams. Time series intervals had been selected when the basic ADCP assumptions were fulfilled and random errors minimized. Backscatter data were also processed to identify bubbles in the water column with the aim of locating bubble-free ensembles. Reliable timeseries are selected combining these data. Two possible scenarios have been described: firstly, a high dynamic situation with visible surface diverging rings of waves, entrainment on {{the lower part of the}} gas column, detrainment in the upper part and a stagnation line (SL) at mid depth where currents were close to zero and most of the gas bubbles spread laterally; secondly, a lower dynamic situation with water <b>entraining</b> into the <b>gas</b> plume at all depths and no surface rings of diverging waves. Reasons for these different dynamics may be ascribed to changes in gas fluxes (one order of magnitude higher in 2002). Description of SL is important to quantify its position in the water column and timing for entrainment-detrainment, and it can be measured by ADCP and calculated from models.

40|$|Detonation {{waves are}} {{supersonic}} combustion waves {{that have a}} multi-shock front structure followed by a spatially non-uniform reaction zone. During propagation, a de-coupled shock-flame complex is periodically re-initiated into an overdriven detonation following a transient Mach reflection process. Past researchers have identified mechanisms that can increase combustion rates and cause localized hot spot re-ignition behind the Mach shock. But due to the small length scales and stochastic behaviour of detonation waves, the important mechanisms {{that can lead to}} re-initiation into a detonation requires further clarification. If a detonation is allowed to diffract behind an obstacle, it can quench to form a de-coupled shock-flame complex and if allowed to form a Mach reflection, re-initiation of a detonation can occur. The use of this approach permits the study of re-initiation mechanisms reproducibly with relatively large length scales. The objective {{of this study is to}} experimentally elucidate the key mechanisms that can increase chemical reaction rates and sequentially lead to re-initiation of a de-coupled shock-flame complex into an overdriven detonation wave following a Mach reflection. All experiments were carried out in a thin rectangular channel using a stoichiometric mixture of oxy-methane. Three different types of obstacles were used - a half-cylinder, a roughness plate along with the half-cylinder and a full-cylinder. Schlieren visualization was achieved by using a Z-configuration setup, a high speed camera and a high intensity light source. Results indicate that forward jetting of the slip line behind the Mach stem can potentially increase combustion rates by <b>entraining</b> hot burned <b>gas</b> into unburned gas. Following ignition and jet entrainment, a detonation wave first appears along the Mach stem. The transverse wave can form a detonation wave due to rapid combustion of unburned gas which may be attributed to shock interaction with the unburned gas. Alternatively, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can produce vortices along the slipline that may lead to mixing between burned-unburned gases and potentially increase combustion rates near the transverse wave. However, the mechanism(s) that causes the transverse wave to re-initiate into a detonation wave remains to be satisfactorily resolved...|$|R

DEUX COMPOSANTES CONSTITUENT CES FLOTS BIPOLAIRES : LES JETS (RAPIDES, COLLIMATES ET LEGERS) ET LES FLOTS MOLECULAIRES (PLUS LENTS, LARGES ET DENSES). IL EST SOUVENT ADMIS QUE LE JET EST RESPONSABLE DU FLOT MOLECULAIRE, LORSQUE CE PREMIER ENTRAINE PAR EFFET CHASSE-NEIGE LE MILIEU AMBIANT DANS LEQUEL IL SE PROPAGE. DANS CETTE THESE, NOUS NOUS INTERESSONS PRINCIPALEMENT AUX FLOTS MOLECULAIRES PAR L'ETUDE D'UN MODELE ALTERNATIF ET COMPLEMENTAIRE DE LA VISION STANDARD MENTIONNEE CI-DESSUS. DANS CE MODELE DE >, UNE PARTIE DU GAZ EN CHUTE EN DIRECTION DE L'OBJET CENTRAL EST DEVIEE (TRANSIT) DANS LES DIRECTIONS BIPOLAIRES, EN RAISON DE L'AUGMENTATION DE LA TEMPERATURE ET DE LA DENSITE LORSQUE LA DISTANCE A LA PROTO-ETOILE DIMINUE. NOUS MONTRONS QUE DES SOLUTIONS EXISTENT SANS QU'UN CHAMP MAGNETIQUE SOIT PRESENT, IMPLIQUANT UNE NATURE THERMODYNAMIQUE DU PROCESSUS QUE NOUS DECRIVONS. LES SOLUTIONS MAGNETISEES SONT CEPENDANT EN MEILLEUR ACCORD AVEC LES OBSERVATIONS, CONFIRMANT QUE LE CHAMP MAGNETIQUE EST UN INGRDIENT IMPORTANT DU PROCESSUS DE FORMATION STELLAIRE. GRACE A CE MODELE, NOUS PARVENONS SANS DIFFICULTE A ATTEINDRE LES ENORMES MASSES CHARRIEES DANS LES FLOTS D'ETOILES MASSIVES PUISQUE LE MODELE N'EST PAS LIMITE A CE QU'UN JET PEUT ENTRAINER. LA COMPOSITION DU MILIEU INFLUE EGALEMENT SUR LES SOLUTIONS OBTENUES ET IL EST MONTRE QUE L'ABSENCE DE POUSSIERES DANS LE MILIEU ENTRIANE POTENTIELLEMENT LA FORMATION D'ETOILES PLUS MASSIVES QUE CELLES QUI SE FORMENT DANS L'UNIVERS ACTUEL (OU LA POUSSIERE EST PRESENTE). WHEN A STAR FORMS, NOT ONLY GAS ACCRETES ONTO THE CENTRAL OBJECT BUT POWERFUL BIPOLAR EJECTIONS OF MATERIAL ARE ALSO OBSERVED. THESE BIPOLAR OUTFLOWS ARE GENERALLY SEPERATED INTO TWO COMPONENTS: THE JETS (FAST, HIGHLY COLLIMATED AND LIGHT) AND THE MOLECULAR OUTFLOWS (SLOWER, WIDER AND DENSER). IT IS USELY ACCEPTED THAT THE JETS ARE THE CAUSE OF THE MOLECULAR OUTFLOWS AS THEY <b>ENTRAIN</b> THE <b>GAS</b> OF THE MEDIUM THEY ARE PROPAGATING IN, VIA A SNOW-PLOW EFFECT. IN THIS THESIS, WE ARE PRIMARILY INTERESTED BY MOLECULAR OUTFLOWS AND STUDY AN ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MODEL OF THE STANDARD JET-DRIVEN MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN OUR SO-CALLED "TRANSIT MODEL", PART OF THE INFALLING GAZ IS BEING DIVERTED INTO A BIPOLAR OUTFLOW AS THE DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE INCREASE WITH DECREASING DISTANCE TO THE CENTRAL OBJECT. WE SOLVE THE SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS DESCRIBING THE MODEL IN BOTH THE UNMAGNETISED AND MAGNETISED CASE. THE EXISTENCE OF PURELY HYDRODYNAMICAL SOLUTIONS SHOW THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF THE PROCESS DESCRIBED HERE IS THERMODYNAMICAL. HOWEVER, MAGNETISED SOLUTIONS COMPARE BETTER WITH OBSERVATIONS, CONFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD IN THE STAR FORMATION PROCESS. WITH THE TRANSIT MODEL, IT IS POSSIBLE TO REACH WITHOUT DIFFICULTIES THE HUGE MASS OBSERVED IN THE OUTFLOWS OF MASSIVE FORMING STARS : INDEED, IN THE MODEL, THE MASS IN THE MOLECULAR OUTFLOW IS NOT LIMITED TO THE MASS THAT CAN BE ENTRAINED BY AN UNDERLYING JET. WE ALSO STUDIED THE INFLUENCE O F THE COMPOSITION OF THE GAS ON THE SOLUTIONS AND FOUND THAT MORE MASSIVE STARS CAN POTENTIALLY FORM WHEN DUST DOES NOT DOMINATE THE COOLING OF THE GAS, AS IT IS IN THE PRESENT-DAY UNIVERSE.
