40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the inhibitory growth effects of different potential chemopreventive agents in vitro and to determine their influence on PSA mRNA and protein expression with an established screening platform. METHODS: LNCaP and C 4 - 2 cells were incubated with genistein, seleno-L-methionine, lycopene, DL-alpha-tocopherol, and trans-beta-carotene at three different concentrations and cell growth was determined by the MTT assay. PSA mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and secreted PSA protein levels were quantified by the microparticle enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Genistein, seleno-l-methionine and lycopene inhibited LNCaP cell growth, and the proliferation of C 4 - 2 cells was suppressed by seleno-L-methionine and lycopene. PSA mRNA expression was downregulated by genistein in LNCaP but not C 4 - 2 cells. No other compound tested altered PSA mRNA expression. PSA protein expression was downregulated by genistein, seleno-L-methionine, DL-alpha-tocopherol in LNCaP cells. In C 4 - 2 cells only genistein significantly reduced the secretion of PSA protein. CONCLUSIONS: In the LNCaP progression model PSA expression depends on the compound, its concentration and on the hormonal dependence of the cell line used and does not necessarily reflect cell growth or death. Before potential substances are evaluated in clinical trials using PSA as a surrogate <b>end</b> <b>point</b> <b>marker,</b> their effect on PSA mRNA and protein expression has to be considered to correctly assess treatment response by PSA...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{antiproliferative}} {{effects of}} pharmacological agents used for androgen ablative therapy in prostate cancer, including goserelin, bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland), {{were tested in}} vitro. It was determined whether they affected prostate specific antigen mRNA and protein expression independent of growth inhibition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Goserelin, bicalutamide (AstraZeneca, Zug, Switzerland) and cyproterone acetate were added to prostate specific antigen expressing, androgen dependent LNCaP and androgen independent C 4 - 2 cell line (Urocor, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) cultures. Proliferation {{was determined by the}} 3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazoliumbromide assay (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Prostate specific antigen mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Secreted prostate specific antigen protein levels were quantified by microparticle enzyme-immunoassay. RESULTS: Goserelin inhibited cell growth and prostate specific antigen protein secretion in LNCaP and C 4 - 2 cells. Prostate specific antigen mRNA expression was not decreased. Bicalutamide did not affect cell growth or prostate specific antigen mRNA expression in LNCaP or C 4 - 2 cells, although it significantly decreased prostate specific antigen protein secretion in LNCaP {{and to a lesser extent}} in C 4 - 2 cells. Cyproterone acetate decreased the growth of C 4 - 2 but not of LNCaP cells. It did not affect prostate specific antigen mRNA or protein expression in either cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate specific antigen expression does not necessarily correlate with cell growth. Without a substantial effect on cell growth bicalutamide lowers prostate specific antigen synthesis, whereas cyproterone acetate decreases cell growth with no effect on prostate specific antigen secretion. Prostate specific antigen expression may be influenced by growth inhibition but also by altered mRNA and protein levels depending on the agent, its concentration and the cell line evaluated. For interpreting clinical trials prostate specific antigen is not necessarily a surrogate <b>end</b> <b>point</b> <b>marker</b> for a treatment effect on prostate cancer cell growth...|$|E

40|$|This {{case-control study}} {{examined}} whether DNA aneuploidy in colorectal adenomas {{is a risk}} factor for subsequent ademona recurrence. Cases (recurrent polyp formers) were defined as persons with diagnoses of new adenomas at 2 colonoscopies following the index (first) adenoma diagnosis; controls were persons with no new adenomas at a follow-up at least 1 year after the index diagnosis. Cases (n = 22) and up to 3 controls (n 29) were matched for factors known to be associated with polyp recurrence or aneuploidy: (a) age; (b) histology; (c) number of index polyps; and (d) size of largest index polyp. The largest adenoma from the index colonoscopy was removed from the paraffin block and analyzed for DNA content abnormalities by flow cytometry. On the basis of the observed distribution of aneuploidy in case-control sets, the point estimate for the relative odds of recurrence given aneuoploidy in the index polyp was infinity (P < 0. 035), and the lower bound for the 95 % confidence interval was 2. 02. We conclude that in this convenience sample, DNA aneuploidy increased the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas. Larger, preferably prospective studies are needed before DNA content flow cytometric analysis of colorectal adenomas can be recommended as a routine clinical practice, but these results do suggest that polyp ploidy should be assessed in research studies using adenomas as <b>end</b> <b>points</b> or intermediate <b>end</b> <b>point</b> <b>markers...</b>|$|R

This project aimed to assess the activity of these compounds, alone and in combination in pancreatic cancer cell lines (PCCLs) and stellate cells. Anti-proliferation assays were performed for curcumin and resveratrol alone and in combination, combined with <b>end</b> <b>point</b> <b>markers</b> of activity including apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Pancreatic cancer stem cell populations were defined using the cell surface markers CD 44, CD 24, ESA, CD 133, ALDH- 1 activity or sphere forming ability, and finally Nanog expression was assessed. The intracellular uptake of curcumin and its metabolites was analysed by HPLC. The PCCLs were more sensitive to curcumin than resveratrol, and combinations of these compounds showed anti-proliferative efficacy through apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at low, clinically achievable concentrations (CACs) in 2 out of 4 cell lines. Capan- 1 cells exhibited the highest sensitivity to curcumin, which was able to enhance the effectiveness of resveratrol treatments in targeting cancer stem-like populations. Spheroid growth was significantly inhibited by curcumin and resveratrol combinations in Capan- 1 cells, correlating with decreased ALDH 1 activity and Nanog expression. In human pancreatic cancer tissue, various stem-like populations were identified based on expression of ALDH 1 or CD 24 +/CD 44 +, which may provide a suitable target in vivo. Capan- 1 cells metabolised curcumin to detectable amounts of curcumin glucuronide. However, curcumin metabolites did not show any significant activity at CACs. Curcumin alone may have activity against pancreatic cancer stem cells, and enhances efficacy at low concentrations when in combination with resveratrol. Capan- 1 cells are able to internalise curcumin, and this cell line exhibited the greatest sensitivity to treatment. Overall, {{the results suggest that}} curcumin and resveratrol warrant further investigation as combination therapies for targeting cancer stem-like cells and stellate cells responsible for the dense stroma observed in pancreatic cancer...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{trials in}} {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been conducted for over half a century now and have incorporated {{a wide variety of}} drugs. Most of these trials have had negative results and a cure remains elusive. The explosion in our understanding of molecular biology and parallel developments in clinical epidemiology have opened up a vast number of novel therapeutic strategies. However, advances in statistical analysis, computing, and global communications have also put greater pressure on scientific investigators to improve the design and implementation of clinical trials so that they permit rigorous testing of hypotheses within a solid ethical framework. This article documents the first published trial for all drugs tried clinically in the treatment of ALS, focusing in more detail on the large, multicenter trials of recent years, namely those involving riluzole, ciliary neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and SR 57746 A.

40|$|The {{identification}} of mutations in ABCA 1 {{in patients with}} Tangier disease and familial HDL deficiency demonstrated that inadequate transport of phospholipid and cholesterol to the extracellular space results in the hypercatabolism of lipid-poor nascent HDL particles. However, the relationship between changes in ABCA 1 activity and HDL levels is not clear. To address this question directly in vivo, we have used bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic approaches, which allow for appropriate developmental and cellular localization of human ABCA 1 in mouse tissues. Increased expression of ABCA 1 is directly associated {{with an increase in}} HDL levels, and the relationship between the increase in efflux and HDL is completely linear (r 2 = 0. 87). Preliminary data have suggested that coronary artery disease (CAD) is increased in heterozygotes for ABCA 1 deficiency.

Two crucial aspects {{still need to}} be addressed: maximizing therapeutic efficacy and identifying appropriate and sensible outcome measures. Nevertheless, the <b>end</b> <b>point</b> of these trials remains painful muscle biopsy to show and quantify protein restoration in treated boys. In this study we show that PMMA/N-isopropil-acrylamide+ (NIPAM) nanoparticles (ZM 2) bind and convey antisense oligoribonucleotides (AONs) very efficiently. Systemic injection of the ZM 2 -AON complex restored dystrophin protein synthesis in both skeletal and cardiac muscles of mdx mice, allowing protein localization in up to 40 % of muscle fibers. The mdx exon 23 skipping level was up to 20 %, as measured by the RealTime assay, and dystrophin restoration was confirmed by both reverse transcription-PCR and western blotting. Furthermore, we verified that dystrophin restoration also occurs in the smooth muscle cells of the dorsal skin arrector pili, an easily accessible histological structure, in ZM 2 -AON-treated mdx mice, with respect to untreated animals. This finding reveals arrector pili smooth muscle to be an appealing biomarker candidate and a novel low-invasive treatment <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> Furthermore, this <b>marker</b> would also be suitable for subsequent monitoring of the therapeutic effects in DMD patients.

40|$|Background: Overdiagnosis and {{subsequent}} overtreatment are important {{side effects of}} screening for, and early detection of, prostate cancer (PCa). Active surveillance (AS) is of growing interest {{as an alternative to}} radical treatment of low-risk PCa. Objective: To update our experience in the largest worldwide prospective AS cohort. Design, setting, and participants: Eligible patients had clinical stage T 1 /T 2 PCa, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 6 at repeat biopsy. Recommendation for treatment was triggered in case of PSA doubling time < 3 yr or reclassification. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate predictors for reclassification at repeat biopsy. Active therapy-free survival (ATFS) was assessed with a Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression was used to evaluate the association of clinical characteristics with active therapy over time. Results and limitations: In total, 2494 patients were included and followed for a median of 1. 6 yr. One or more repeat biopsies were performed in 1480 men, of whom 415 men (28 %) showed reclassification. Compliance with the first repeat biopsy was estimated to be 81 %. During follow-up, 527 patients (21. 1 %) underwent active therapy. ATFS at 2 yr was 77. 3 %. The strongest predictors for reclassification and switching to deferred treatment were the number of positive cores (two cores compared with one core) and PSA density. The disease-specific survival rate was 100 %. Follow-up was too short to draw definitive conclusions about the safety of AS. Conclusions: Our short-term data support AS as a feasible strategy to reduce overtreatment. Clinical characteristics and PSA kinetics during follow-up can be used for risk stratification. Strict monitoring is even more essential in men with high-risk features to enable timely recognition of potentially aggressive disease and offer curative intervention. Limitations of using surrogate <b>end</b> <b>points</b> and <b>markers</b> in AS should be recognized...|$|R
40|$|Predicting {{risks in}} humans of either acute effects such as bone loss or muscle wasting, or late effects such as cancer, is challenging. To an approximation, {{this is because}} {{uncertainties}} of exposure to stress factors or toxic agents and the uniformity of processing subsequent damage at the cellular level within {{a complex set of}} biological variables degrade the confidence of predicting pathologic outcome. A cellular biodosimeter that simultaneously reports 1) the type of damage due to that exposure, 2) the quantity of damage incurred by that exposure, and 3) the dataset used to assess risk of developing pathologic outcome caused by that exposure would therefore be useful for predicting ultimate risks faced by an individual, such as an astronaut. It is suggested that such a biodosimeter can be based upon analyses of gene-expression and protein expression whereby large datasets of cellular response to damage are obtained and analyzed for expression-profiles correlated with established <b>end</b> <b>points</b> and molecular <b>markers</b> predictive for risks being assessed.

40|$|Background:The {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor-?agonist pioglitazone {{is established}} as a drug to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to lowering blood glucose levels, one of the favorable effects of pioglitazone is improvement of systemic chronic inflammation particularly affecting vessel walls. The effect can be monitored by the measurement of the biomarker C-reactive protein {{in the range of}} 0 – 10 mg/L (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]). This observational trial was performed to evaluate the effects of pioglitazone on hsCRP values in a large population under daily life conditions. Methods:A total of 1, 170 subjects could be included into the final analysis (633 men, 537 women; age [mean ± SD], 63. 5 ± 10. 4 years, body mass index, 31. 0 ± 5. 5 kg/m 2; duration of diabetes, 6. 9 ± 8. 1 years; glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA 1 c], 7. 5 ± 1. 1). All patients were glitazone-naive prior to study entry. The patients received pioglitazone alone or in combination with their previous treatment (acarbose, sulfonylurea drugs, and/or metformin). Patients were evaluated at baseline and after 10 ± 2 weeks and 20 ± 2 weeks of treatment. Observation parameters were fasting blood glucose, lipids, and blood pressure. The level of hsCRP was determined in a central laboratory at baseline and at <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> Results:All <b>markers</b> showed a significant improvement at trial <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> A decrease of hsCRP (baseline 3. 3 ± 1. 0 mg/L vs. <b>end</b> <b>point</b> 2. 8 ± 2. 3 mg/L, P< 0. 01), HbA 1 c (7. 5 ± 1. 1 vs. 6. 8 ± 0. 9, P< 0. 001), fasting blood glucose (8. 7 ± 2. 6 mMvs. 7. 2 ± 2. 1 mM, P< 0. 001), low-density lipoproteins (3. 3 ± 1. 0 mMvs. 3. 2 ± 0. 9 mM, P< 0. 001), and triglycerides (2. 4 ± 2. 0 mMvs. 2. 2 ± 2. 5 mM, P< 0. 001) and an increase in high-density lipoproteins (1. 3 ± 0. 4 mMvs. 1. 4 ± 0. 4 mM, P< 0. 001) was observed. Parallel to the metabolic improvement, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were reduced (141 ± 17 mm Hg vs. 137 ± 15 mm Hg and 83 ± 9 mm Hg vs. 80 ± 9 mm Hg, respectively; P< 0. 001 in both cases).

BackgroundMultimarker strategies may assist risk stratification after AMI. Midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide is a newly described stable fragment of N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide. We compared the prognostic value of MR-proANP and an established marker, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), after AMI. MethodsWe recruited 983 consecutive post-AMI patients (720 men, median age 65 [range 24 to 95] years) in a prospective study with follow-up over 343 (range 0 to 764) days. ResultsPlasma MR-proANP was raised in patients who died (n = 101) compared with that seen in survivors (median 310 [range 48 to 1, 150] pmol/l vs. 108 [range 4. 9 to 1, 210] pmol/l, p ∼ 5, 900 pmol/l), MR-proANP in the top quartile (∼ 330 pmol/l) was associated with poorer outcome (p < 0. 0001). Findings were similar for heart failure as an individual <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> However, neither <b>marker</b> predicted recurrent AMI.

40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Studies {{in adult}} {{intensive}} care have highlighted {{the importance of}} insulin and improved glucose control on survival, with 32 % reduction in mortality, 22 % reduction in intensive care stay and halving of the incidence of bacteraemia. Very low birth weight infants requiring intensive care also have relative insulin deficiency often leading to hyperglycaemia {{during the first week}} of life. The physiological influences on insulin secretion and sensitivity, and the potential importance of glucose control at this time are not well established. However there is increasing evidence that the early postnatal period is critical for pancreatic development. At this time a complex set of signals appears to influence pancreatic development and beta cell survival. This has implications both in terms of acute glucose control but also relative insulin deficiency is likely to play a role in poor postnatal growth, which has been associated with later motor and cognitive impairment, and fewer beta cells are linked to risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. METHODS: A multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of early insulin replacement in very low birth weight babies (VLBW, birth weight < 1500 g). 500 infants will be recruited from 10 centres in the UK and Europe. Babies will be randomised to receive a continuous insulin infusion (0. 05 units/kg/h) or to receive standard neonatal care from the first day of life and for the next 7 days. If blood glucose (BG) levels fall infants will receive 20 % dextrose titrated to maintain normoglycaemia (4 - 8 mmol/l). If BG is consistently above 10 mmol/l babies will receive standard treatment with additional insulin infusion. The primary <b>end</b> <b>point</b> will be mortality on or before expected date of delivery, secondary <b>end</b> <b>points</b> will be <b>markers</b> of morbidity and include episodes of sepsis, severity of retinopathy, chronic lung disease and growth.

We aimed to compare a range of potential NIHSS <b>end</b> <b>points</b> with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> Methods: We simulated a total of 6000 clinical trials, each with 1400 patients.

Results: The most powerful fixed <b>end</b> <b>point</b> was the NIHSS dichotomized at 1. For prognosis-adjusted outcome, we found greatest power if we defined success as achieving a score of &# 8804; 1 or improvement by at least 11 points from baseline.

25|$|For example, for the Tschirnhausen cubic, {{there are}} two {{infinite}} arcs having the origin (0,0) as <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> This point is the only singular point of the curve. There are also two arcs having this singular <b>point</b> as one <b>end</b> <b>point</b> and having a second <b>end</b> <b>point</b> with a horizontal tangent. Finally, {{there are two}} other arcs each having one of these points with horizontal tangent as the first <b>end</b> <b>point</b> and having the unique point with vertical tangent as the second <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> In contrast, the sinusoid is certainly not an algebraic curve, having an infinite number of monotone arcs.|$|R
40|$|Given {{a finite}} set S of n nonintersecting line {{segments}} with no three <b>end</b> <b>points</b> collinear, the segment <b>end</b> <b>point</b> visibility graph {{is defined as}} the graph whose vertices are the <b>end</b> <b>points</b> of the line segments in S and two vertices are adjacent if the straight line segment joining two <b>end</b> <b>points</b> does not intersect any element of S, or if they are <b>end</b> <b>points</b> of the same segment. Segment <b>end</b> <b>point</b> visibility graphs have a wide variety of applications in VLSI circuit design, study of art gallery problems, and other areas of computational geometry. This thesis contains a survey of the important results that are currently known regarding the characterization of these graphs. Also a weak visibility dual of a segment <b>end</b> <b>point</b> visibility graph is defined and some structural properties of such graphs are presented. Some open problems and questions related to the characterization of weak visibility graphs are also discussed. Department of Mathematical SciencesThesis (M. S. ...|$|R

Use of the optimal NIHSS prognosis-adjusted <b>end</b> <b>point</b> rather than BI 95 could justify a reduction in sample size of approximately 68 % (95 % CI, 67 % to 69 %) without loss of statistical power. Conclusions—The NIHSS neurologic scale appears more sensitive than the BI or mRS, allowing smaller sample sizes or greater statistical power.

50|$|At {{least three}} more titrations should be performed, this time more accurately, {{taking into account}} roughly where the <b>end</b> <b>point</b> will occur. The initial and final {{readings}} on the burette (prior to starting the titration and at the <b>end</b> <b>point,</b> respectively) should be recorded.

We {{investigate}} dendrites with a closed, countable set of <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> Such dendrites can {{be categorized}} according {{to the rank of}} their set of <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> We show that dendrites with a specific rank α + 1 contain some particular dendrite Mα. As a consequence, we obtain a theorem that the rank of the set of <b>end</b> <b>points</b> of a dendrite with a closed set of <b>end</b> <b>points</b> cannot be increased under weakly confluent, and thus, confluent, open, or monotone mappings. 1...|$|R

30|$|While Viragh {{supported}} by the above algorithms has been proven to be faster (in our practice) than depthMap, in some situations it still can take {{a considerable amount of}} time and memory. To address this issue, instead of the <b>end</b> <b>points</b> on border strips, the <b>end</b> <b>points</b> on the actual border line between the convex areas are considered (i.e. the line where borders face each other as marked in Fig. 4 a). Geometrically, this <b>end</b> <b>point</b> is between the two adjacent <b>end</b> <b>points</b> as if those <b>end</b> <b>points</b> are combined into one (thus we called this approach “combined”). The <b>end</b> <b>points</b> of this line inherit the visual properties of the combined <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> This means that the new <b>end</b> <b>point</b> is considered visible from all the grid cells in both convex area despite the possibility that it is not actually visible from some cells. This treatment significantly reduces the number of E-lines and hence increases the calculation speed. However, it also reduces the accuracy of the results in the sense that “accuracy” is measured by how closely it abides by the strict grid articulation. The speed and accuracy of the results of both treatments are discussed in the next subsection.|$|R
