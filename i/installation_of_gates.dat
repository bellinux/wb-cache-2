50|$|Adams {{was born}} on 12 October 1955 in Toowoomba. He became a {{paraplegic}} in 1982 {{at the age of}} 26 after being involved in an accident at a local motorbike competition, where he fell off his motorbike and broke his back. Following his accident, he underwent a six-month period of rehabilitation. He was a cattle grazier who owned a 64000 acre station near Blackall, Queensland. He made extensive modifications to the station's infrastructure to improve his access to the land, including the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> that open both ways. He produced TendaBeef, and supported the genetic breeding of cattle.|$|E
5000|$|Simpson was a {{founding}} member of the British Speleological Association in 1935, became its Recorder for much of its existence, and organized the most extensive cave archive in Britain. The <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> on BSA-controlled caves caused much friction with other caving organizations as well as within the BSA. BSA influence waned after 1945 when new or dormant caving clubs (such as Northern Pennine Club and Red Rose Cave and Pothole Club gained ground, and members expelled or resigned from the BSA went on to create other organizations, notably the Cave Research Group of Great Britain (the two merged in 1973 to form the British Cave Research Association).|$|E

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, {{restoration}} work began on {{a portion of the}} Antonelli Pond site. Efforts included initial removal of several invasive plant species, the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> to prevent vehicle access, trail grading to prevent erosion, and the construction of several wood duck boxes around the pond edge to provide nesting habitat. Native seeds will be collected and propagated from species that currently populate the area. For additional re-vegetation, seeds, cuttings, and plant starts from other native species will be obtained from local nurseries. The first native planting is planned for the fall of 2007. An interim vegetation management plan was written to guide the clean-up, restoration, and conservation efforts that will be ongoing for the next several years.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, the City of Los Angeles {{issued a}} permit to the Whitley Heights Civic Association to allow the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> that would turn the {{community}} into a private enclave. Construction, funded by Whitley Heights homeowners, began in January 1991 and was substantially completed by April 1992, {{at a cost of}} more than $350,000. Construction was permanently halted in 1992 when a group called [...] "Citizens Against Gated Enclaves" [...] successfully sued to prevent the closure of public roadways in Whitley Heights. The trial court held that state law prohibited the city from withdrawing a street from public use in that fashion. An appellate court agreed, and the end result was that the gates were removed {{at the expense of the}} Whitley Heights homeowners and the streets put back in good repair at the expense of the city, with all court costs paid by the defendants.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2009 {{expenses}} scandal it {{was suggested}} that Jonathan Djanogly improperly claimed expenses for a [...] "cleaner" [...] who was actually a childminder. In response Djanogly stated that the person in question was employed as a cleaner although “there would clearly have been times during evenings when she would have been there with a child alone, but this was not her job or what she was paid to do” and acknowledged that the person received no other payment for any services provided. In May 2009, The Daily Telegraph disclosed that Mr Djanogly claimed almost £5,000 on his parliamentary expenses for the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> at his constituency home. The MP installed the gates following security fears, after he helped constituents threatened by animal rights activists, and he was not required to repay the sum following the Legg audit of MPs' expenses in 2010. Djanogly voluntarily repaid £25,000 but the repayment was not, he maintained, acknowledgement that his arrangements had been improper, but rather in recognition of his part in Parliament’s collective failure to address the expenses system.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of a}} plan {{to upgrade}} {{high-traffic}} stations, refurbishment of the station began on 2013.

5000|$|In recent years, {{a series}} of attacks have {{resulted}} in a call for increased police protection in the quarter. Perhaps the most high-profile attack was that of James Parkes, an off-duty trainee police officer, who was set upon by up to 20 teenage thugs in a homophobic attack outside the well known gay club Superstar Boudoir on Stanley Street in October 2009. Multiple skull fractures, a fractured eye socket and a fractured cheek bone left the officer fighting for his life. [...] In May 2011, drag artist Lady Shaun suffered a broken jaw after being knocked out by a man who punched her in the face, whilst just two weeks earlier, 21-year-old choreographer Calvin Fox was assaulted by two people on his way home after a night out. In September the same year, two separate attacks in the gay quarter left two young men with serious head and facial injuries. Local authorities acknowledged there was indeed an increase in [...] "homophobic" [...] crime. Openly gay Councillor Steve Radford said, [...] "Liverpool {{has a long way to}} travel in its journey to become a gay-friendly city". Chief Inspector Louise Harrington commented, [...] "We have to strike a balance between a heavy police presence which could scare people off and those that say it makes them feel safer." [...] Liverpool City Council have been working for some time to improve the safety of the area, particularly after dark; Several community safety initiatives are due to be completed by late January 2014 including a high-volume, marshalled Taxi Rank and the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> on Progress Place, a section of Private Land off Stanley Street where many of the attacks in the area have been linked as well as antisocial behaviour.|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{collisions}} and fatalities at highway-rail intersections in the United States has declined significantly {{over the past}} thirty years, despite considerable increases in the volume of rail and highway traffic. This paper disaggregates the improvement into its constituent causes. Negative binomial regressions are conducted on a pooled data set for 49 states from 1975 to 2001. The analysis concludes that about two-fifths of the decrease is due to factors such as reduced drunk driving and improved emergency medical response that have improved safety on {{all parts of the}} highway network. The <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gates</b> and/or flashing lights accounts for about a fifth of the reduction. The development in the 1970 s and early 1980 s of the Operation Lifesaver public education campaign, and the installation of additional lights on locomotives in the mid 1990 s, each led to about a seventh of the reduction. Finally, about a tenth is due to closure of crossings resulting from line abandonments or consolidation of little-used crossings. Further analysis, using data from 1996 to 2002, finds that increasing the amount of Operation Lifesaver activity in a state reduces the number of collisions with a point elasticity of- 0. 11, but the effect on the number of deaths cannot be concluded with statistical certainty...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{the control of the}} Crockett canal an {{automated}} control system for the head gates was proposed and an analysis of design alternatives was conducted. Design alternatives were analyzed based on the criteria of reliability, operational improvement, cost and safety. After the analysis was completed recommendations as to which type of automation system to install were made. A comprehensive design of the recommended design is included. The automation <b>of</b> the head <b>gates</b> has been separated into two phases. Items to be included in phase one are: retrofit each of the existing head gates with a multi-turn <b>gate</b> actuator and, <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> an electrical system to provide power to operate actuators. The electrical system will include provisions for future expansion phases, and a programmable data logger to provide automation. The estimated cost for this phase is $ 20, 000. The second phase includes the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> a sliding <b>gate</b> for control <b>of</b> the spillway, and <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>gate</b> actuator to automate the new gate.
