Here, a novel link is made between reverse electronic auctions (<b>e-auctions)</b> and its potential impact on organisational agility, a link not previously developed in the literature. In this paper, we justify this relationship from a theoretical perspective. We investigate how information and internet technology impacts procurement, by an analysis and evaluation of the literature. <b>E-auctions</b> are reviewed and organisational agility defined; the advantages of agile management are also identified and the role that <b>e-auctions</b> can play in achieving this, discussed. Strategies for re-aligning reverse <b>e-auctions</b> in support of organisational agility are proposed and the advantages of this process discussed. Recommendations for future practice that will maximise the chances of realising agile systems management are also presented. Finally, areas for further research are identified...|$|R

To test our hypotheses, we estimate a hedonic price function using data from Central and South American <b>e-auctions</b> and calculate the implicit prices of sensory and reputation attributes. The results show that market clearing prices are a function of sensory characteristics and reputation variables including third-party quality ranking, country of origin, coffee variety, and quantity. The additional attribute information disclosed at <b>e-auctions</b> results in substantially higher prices relative to conventional commodity coffee market prices.

40|$|Food quality ratings can be {{used for}} product {{differentiation}} and strategic marketing. This article develops a differentiation measure based on the cross-entropy of two distributions for speciality coffees. It examines whether quality ratings achieve their objectives for speciality coffee supply chains. The estimation, using <b>e-auctions</b> data, indicates that the quality rating is more informative in the Cup of Excellence (CofE) relative to the Q auction. To determine significance, a statistical test for comparing the information measure across different <b>e-auctions</b> and segments of the quality rating was developed. The significant difference between the two auctions is not a surprise as the auctions trade coffee lots of different volumes and the quality evaluation is more important {{in the case of the}} CofE, with its jury of renowned coffee experts. The total cross-entropy measure of product differentiation shows that the 100 -point quality rating does not carry the same information content and meaning in the two different <b>e-auctions</b> and their respective supply chains. The cross-entropy measure of product differentiation is shown to be a good indicator of the information and the value created throughout the speciality food supply chain.

40|$|Electronic marketplaces {{have been}} used for {{procurement}} in various industries by both small and large organisations. However, the role of electronic marketplaces in procurement is still unclear and strategies and organisational implications of trading via an e-marketplace are not well defined. An electronic marketplace facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers and a common transaction mechanism for price negotiation is an electronic auction. This paper investigates the role of reverse auctions in procurement including the organisational implications and strategies for using an electronic auction. We use a case study (Revnet) of an electronic auction provider to analyse their role and benefits. The findings show that <b>e-auctions</b> can be used as part of a strategic procurement strategy to reduce procurement costs and improve efficiency {{and are more likely to}} be used for non-critical business for products and services that do not require strong ties with suppliers. The success of <b>e-auctions</b> within this context relies to a large extent on the quality of contract specifications.

40|$|NoReverse <b>e-auctions</b> are {{increasingly}} being used in business-to-business procurement and {{have been reported to}} yield significant price reductions for buyer firms. However, the adoption of online auction formats has raised many concerns among suppliers, often being criticized for damaging supplier-buyer relationships and for being antithetical to what is currently regarded as good supply chain management. Against this background this paper aims to examine the reverse auction phenomenon in the UK packaging sector. Data were collected from the direct experiences of one large food-packaging supplier, using case studies of reverse <b>e-auctions,</b> and from exploratory interviews with other suppliers in the sector. While buyers are reaping significant short-term price reductions, the benefits to suppliers are less obvious. In fact, little reference was detected to the often-quoted reductions in overall transaction costs for either buyers or suppliers.

40|$|Supply chain {{interactions}} {{have huge}} economic importance, yet these interactions are managed inefficiently. One {{of the major}} sources of inefficiency in supply-chain management is information asymmetry; i. e., information that is available {{to one or more}} organizations in the chain (e. g., manufacturer, retailer) is not available to others. There are several causes of information asymmetry, among them fear that a powerful buyer or supplier will take advantage of private information, that information will leak to a competitor, etc. We propose Secure Supply-Chain Collaboration (SSCC) protocols that enable supply-chain partners to cooperatively achieve desired system-wide goals without revealing the private information of any of the parties, even though the jointly-computed decisions require the information of all the parties. Secure supply-chain collaboration has the potential to improve supply-chain management practice, and, by removing one major inefficiency therein, improve productivity.

Organizing visions are real and perceived forces that influence the adoption of information technology. We use an extensive literature review and a case study of a reverse auction provider, that has managed thousands of auctions for organizations, to investigate how organizing visions impact on decision making in relation to reverse auction adoption and use. The findings from the study show that <b>e-auctions</b> are used to reduce procurement costs and improve efficiency {{and are more likely to}} be used for commodity purchases.
