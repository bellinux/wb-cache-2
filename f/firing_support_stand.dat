40|$|Many participants, {{observers}} and later historians have {{commented on the}} insufficiency of <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> provided for the disastrous raid on the French channel port of Dieppe in August of 1942. This seemingly facile consensus raises a number of questions: (1) What type of additional <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> was needed? (2) What might {{the effects of this}} <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> have been given the technology of the time? and (3) Is the requirement for more firepower the product of retrospective speculation or were there contemporary standards for amphibious operations that would have indicated the need for more <b>fire</b> <b>support?</b> The need for additional naval <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> during the amphibious assault on Dieppe is explored, the most efficient form of fire is identified and the possible effects on the battle are evaluated in this study. The principal conclusions are that the need for more <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> was laid down in prior amphibious doctrine, the means for providing this <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> were available, and the effect of increased heavy gunfire support might have substantially improved the results of the landing component of the raid.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the reliance on}} air power for <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> by light forces and whether other <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> assets could perform these missions better. By studying the historical evolution of <b>fire</b> <b>support,</b> air power and small wars doctrine, patterns emerge in how these developments interrelate. These patterns {{have led to a}} system that does not take advantage of some of the capabilities of other <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> assets, mainly artillery and mortars. The case of Operation Enduring Freedom, in Afghanistan, highlights how light forces have come to depend on airpower. Could other forms of <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> have provided coverage that would have been more effective than the air support received? Light forces need to be aware that they have more choices for <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> than calling in air strikes and that artillery and mortars provide capabilities that air power cannot currently duplicate. Afghanistan demonstrated that artillery remains relevant. In a very permissive environment with few competing missions, there were times when air power could not provide the needed <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> to the ground maneuver forces.

40|$|Student Integrated ProjectIncludes {{supplementary}} materialThe United States {{military has}} continually strived to develop systems and procedures {{that attempt to}} maximize the effectiveness and improve the collaborative effects of <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> across the spectrum of warfare. Despite improvements in the interoperability of the Department of Defense service components, there continue to be difficulties involved with executing emergent Joint Fires {{in a timely manner}} in support of the commander. In this context, the Joint <b>Fire</b> <b>Support</b> in 2020 project applied systems engineering procedures and principles to develop functional, physical, and operational architectures that maximize rapid battlefield effects through efficient targetprovider pairings. The unplanned, immediate joint <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> requests, and the architectures that enable the rapid pairing and tasking of <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> providers to fulfill those requests, were the emphasis of the study. Through modeling, simulation, and qualitative assessments of existing and planned command and control systems and organizations, a Centralized Joint <b>Fire</b> <b>Support</b> Network that incorporates and consolidates the various crossservice <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> functions, was chosen as the preferred evolutionary development path to a fully Distributed Joint <b>Fire</b> <b>Support</b> Network.
