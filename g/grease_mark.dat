25|$|Speed is {{the change}} in {{distance}} to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for measuring distance, combined with a memory capacity {{to see where the}} target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making <b>grease</b> pencil <b>marks</b> on the radar screen and then calculating the speed using a slide rule. Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.|$|R
50|$|A ship's galley, pantry, {{and eating}} areas are {{notoriously}} {{hard to keep}} clean and sanitary, and this activity keeps the steward's assistant busy {{for much of his}} time. The steward's assistant must clean the ship's mess and officer's saloon, and the gear in both. This includes keeping the decks clean by sweeping and scrubbing. The steward's assistant disposes of trash and keeps garbage cans clean. Other tasks could include defrosting and cleansing refrigerators, cleaning brightwork and woodwork, and removing <b>grease</b> and finger <b>marks</b> from paintwork.|$|R
50|$|Automatic floor scrubbers, {{also known}} as auto scrubbers, are a type of floor {{cleaning}} machine {{that are used to}} scrub a floor clean of light debris, dust, oil, <b>grease</b> or floor <b>marks.</b> These machines have either rotary(disk) or cylindrical scrubbing head and an automated system for dispensing cleaning solution and then vacuuming it up. So, in one pass over the floor, a user can dispense cleaning, scrub it into the floor, then vacuum it all up with an autoscrubber squeegee attachment {{at the back of the}} machine. Auto scrubbers have a separate dispensing (solution) tank and collection (recovery) tank to keep the clean water separate from the dirty water and can be categorized into one of two main types: walk behind or riding.|$|R
40|$|Upholstery {{cleaning}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} problems regarding the inner maintenance of a vehicle. Finding solutions to the usual brewery spots, <b>grease</b> stains, sausage <b>marks</b> and their smells is complicated due to both the nature of the dirt and the tedious undo of seats. At the forefront of the nowadays use of carbon fluoride based products, we present here the development of a hydrophobic and stain-resistance fabrics by using nanotechnology. Hydrophobic fabrics are water-resistant, self-cleaning and guarantee a long lasting protection against dirt. The addition of nanoparticles into upholstery fabrics result in surfaces which keep the superficial tension of water or dirt drops. Although this method drastically reduces liquid-fabric contacts and enhances the stain-resistance of the upholstery, intrinsic properties of the fabric fibers do not changePostprint (published version...|$|R
50|$|The {{shooting}} {{of a scene}} typically begins with a blocking rehearsal, in which the various actors' positions are established. During the rehearsal, the 2nd AC lays tape marks {{on the floor at}} all points an actor pauses movement. The actors then leave set to go through hair and makeup, and stand-ins come in to take their places at these various positions for the purposes of lighting, framing, and focus-mark setting. Once a camera position is established by the director of photography and camera operator, the 1st AC begins to measure the various distances between the actors' marks and the focal plane of the camera. These distances are recorded in a series of <b>grease</b> pencil/pen <b>marks</b> on the focus barrel of the lens, and/or the marking disc on the follow focus device. Using the stand-ins or 2nd AC, marks are checked through the viewfinder and/or the onboard monitor for accuracy. Marks may be repositioned in order to provide specific framing desired, and the 1st AC must be aware of this and re-measure/re-set his marks accordingly. Additionally, the 1st AC may have the 2nd AC lay down specific distance marks on the floor which will be referenced during the take as actors move between their marks, in order to assist in accurately adjusting the focus to the correct intermediate distances.|$|R

40|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} {{are among}} the most common soil and groundwater contaminants due to their widespread use as cleaning solvents or degreasing agents. Due to their physico-chemical properties, chlorinated solvents produce large-scale plumes of pollution in the groundwater. In the densely populated north western Europe, these pollution plumes often are situated under residential and urban development areas and, therefore, not easily accessible. Vapors can migrate through building slabs and affect the quality of indoor air. That is why the CityChlor project was created. It aims at improving the quality and minimizing pollution of soil and groundwater by developing an integrated approach to tackle the threats caused by contamination with chlorinated solvents in urban areas. One of the goals of the project is to define the most reliable, fast, and cost-effective techniques to detect, characterize, and delineate chlorinated solvent pollution in groundwater. In this context, passive sampling is an innovative way of sampling contaminants in groundwater in Europe, and it seems very promising. Therefore, tests are required at each country level to make regulations concerning these samplers, which will encourage consultants to use them. That is why the aim of this work was to assess the performance of 3 passive samplers to sample chlorinated solvents in groundwater and to compare the results to those obtained with the traditional groundwater sampling method, that is to say well purging prior to groundwater sampling with a pump. The pilot site chosen to conduct these experiments is an in-service facility located in France, 60 km east from Paris, in an urban area. In this factory, door locks and metal fittings have been produced since 1926 and chlorinated solvents are used to remove <b>grease</b> <b>marks</b> from metal fittings. On site, soils are composed of one layer of silty embankments (2 to 3 m) and then a sandy horizon. The water table is at around 2 m below the ground surface and it goes to 10 m deep. In order to test passive sampling, 5 dedicated water wells were installed on site. In this way, the design of the wells was totally known and passive samplers were tested in controlled conditions. One of them was screened from 2 to 8 m deep and the other ones were screened respectively from 2 to 3. 5 m; 3. 5 to 5 m; 5 to 6. 5 m and 6. 5 to 8 m. Three passive samplers were therefore tested: PDB (Polyethylene Diffusion Bags), Ceramic Dosimeters and Gore Sorber Modules. Multilevel sampling was done in the well screened from 2 to 8 m and one sampler was installed in the middle of each screened interval of the other wells. This was done for the 3 samplers tested. PDB were very easy to install and the cost of these samplers was lower than the one corresponding to the conventional method with the pump. In addition, these samplers exhibited a good reproducibility. Ceramic dosimeters were very easy to use as well, but results were not reproducible for some compounds. Some tests are still in progress to confirm this trend. For Gore Sorber Modules, the first sampling campaigns gave consistent results comparing to the pump. In general, passive samplers seemed to be very efficient to sample HVOC in groundwater and to be a good alternative to the standard method with purge and sampling with a pump...|$|R

One of the goals of the project is to define the most reliable, fast and cost effective techniques to detect, characterize and delineate chlorinated solvent pollution in groundwater. In this context, Direct Push Technology (DPT) is an innovative technique in Europe to characterize soil, soil gas and groundwater pollution. The goal of this work was to assess this technique in order to evaluate its efficiency to locate polluted zones. This could be an important step of the characterization process of a polluted site which could help consultants to decide where to install groundwater and soil gas wells for an efficient site monitoring. This work was carried out on an in-service facility located 60 km from Paris, in an urban area. In this factory, door locks and metal fittings are produced and chlorinated solvents are used to remove <b>grease</b> <b>marks</b> from metal fittings. On site, soils are composed of 50 cm to 1 m of embankments, then about 3 m of clay and finally fine sand to 10 m deep. The alluvial aquifer was studied during the project: the mean depth of the water table was 1. 5 to 2 m below the ground surface and was about 10 m deep. Amongst the DPT, 3 specific techniques were used: the CPT (cone penetration test) which gives indications on the lithology, the MIP (Membrane Interface Probe) giving semi-quantitative concentrations of pollutants in soil and groundwater along a vertical profile and the BAT sampling allowing us to take depth discrete samples of groundwater. The DPT work was carried out in 2 steps. First of all, it was used as a screening technique: the tool was equipped with a CPT cone and a MIP probe and 19 locations were investigated outside and inside buildings near supposed pollution sources and downstream these pollution sources. Then, in the most polluted zones, 10 BAT sampling were carried out at 2 different depths. Thanks to the Robertson CPT soil classification, the CPT allowed us to determine the soil characteristics which were in accordance with the lithology observed during soil sampling. The MIP was very efficient as well to obtain a good picture of polluted areas. In addition, the results obtained after analyzing groundwater from the BAT sampling confirmed the ones given by the MIP. This work allowed us to highlight general advantages of the DPT. This technique is mobile and as we can get information on the contaminant concentration almost in real time thanks to the MIP system, this implies a better reactivity on site. As DPT systems are hold by mobile structures of different sizes, investigations can be carried out almost everywhere (in small buildings or outside). In addition the BAT sampling is a very efficient technique to carry out depth discrete sampling without cross contamination between the samples. Nevertheless other limitations have {{to be taken into account}} when planning to use such a technique. For example, DPT is not suitable when soils are too hard (the CPT cone could not get deeper than 6 - 7 m on this pilot site). Finally results are not obtained in real time with the MIP system because post treatment of raw data is needed before having final results on polluted areas...|$|R
5000|$|Green Archer solved {{this problem}} by quickly moving the antenna between two set {{vertical}} angles. The scanner was first set so it scanned back and forth near the horizon line. When a mortar shell was seen on the display, the operator used a <b>grease</b> pencil to <b>mark</b> its location. He then pressed a button that quickly raised the scanner so it was pointed at a higher vertical angle. This happened rapidly enough that the bomb would {{take some time to}} reach this higher altitude, at which point it would appear on the display again and this second location would also be marked. The operator them placed cursors over the marks and input the plot to the radar's analogue computer. [...] These two plots, the time between them and the angle between the two beam positions gave two points on a parabolic curve. Such a curve is defined by two points and is a good approximation of a mortar bomb trajectory. Using these, the azimuth of the radar beam centre and the radar's coordinates, the mortar position coordinates were calculated. These could be adjusted to reflect the actual height of the ground.|$|R
