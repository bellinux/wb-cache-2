Thus a power tracking control strategy based on <b>feedback</b> <b>frequency</b> instead of MPPT is put forward. The <b>feedback</b> <b>frequency</b> is transferred to controlling unit of DC-DC inverter. The DC bus voltage is adjusted by controlling the duty cycle of DC-DC invertor.

40|$|Excessive rotor oscillations, {{stemming}} from disturbances to synchronous generators, {{give rise to}} adverse operating conditions in a power system. These oscillations increase tie-line power losses and cause unnecessary controller action. Oscillatory action of the rotor gives rise to prolonged periods of frequency and voltage transients which, {{depending on the type}} of load, may present a serious operating problem. The ideal situation would be for the generator to have sufficient damping so that when it is subjected to a load change (or other type of disturbance), the new rotor position would be reached with a minimum of oscillations. One method of damping out these oscillations is to transfer a signal, related to the rotor frequency error, through a coupling element to the voltage regulator. This thesis presents a method for determining the parameters of this <b>frequency</b> <b>feedback</b> coupling element to obtain improved system camping. Results obtained from simulated models of the generator, controllers and the <b>frequency</b> <b>feedback</b> element agree very closely with those predicted by analytical means. a study carried out using state variable representation gave information with regard to the influence of the feedback element on system stability. The results obtained from this study indicate that a frequency error signal fed back into the voltage regulator of a synchronous generator gives a marked improvement in system damping provided that the settings of the <b>frequency</b> <b>feedback</b> element are compatible with existing controllers and external load conditions...|$|E

Measurements on a frequency wise down-scaled prototype show that the RF-PWM modulator modulates a UMTS signal with more than 17 dB margin to the modulation mask and EVM below 0. 5 % RMS.

40|$|Adults with {{acquired}} apraxia {{of speech}} (AOS) {{often do not}} generalise effects of treatment to untreated speech behaviours. Recent studies suggest that using the principles of motor learning (PML) approach may optimise retention and generalisation in AOS. PML guide the structure of motor practice along with the frequency and type of feedback provided during practice. This study aimed to investigate the effects of order of stimulus presentation and feedback frequency, on the acquisition, retention, and generalisation of speech skills in persons with acquired AOS plus aphasia. Four participants with AOS participated in a crossover design with multiple baselines across behaviours to compare two sets of motor learning principles– random order of stimulus presentation with low <b>frequency</b> <b>feedback</b> (R-L)), considered more beneficial for learning, versus blocked order with high <b>frequency</b> <b>feedback,</b> considered less beneficial. All participants demonstrated significantly improved performance with treated words for both treatment regimes, both throughout treatment and on retention probes. There was a trend for better retention for some participants following the R-L condition. Performance data from treatment sessions did not support more rapid acquisition under either regime. Three of four participants showed generalisation of treatment effects to untreated related words, regardless of treatment conditions. Consistent with previous studies, individuals with chronic AOS responded positively to articulation-based intervention. The limited difference between the treatment conditions tested here suggests that the practice schedule and feedback frequency may be {{less important than the}} amount of practice provided; although the interaction of these principles and treatment dosage with other factors such as disorder severity require further investigation.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{absolute}} frame timing of BS is unknown to each RSS since the propagation delay is unknown to each RSS (refer Figure 1). Therefore, each RSS only estimates its relative downlink frame timing position at first. Next, each RSS transmits its own initial ranging sequence, which is locked on the estimated frame timing, to the BS with the network access request. Once BS receives the sequences from multiple RSSs, the BS should identify multiple RSSs and estimate every RSS’s timing offset and residual frequency offset independently. Finally, from the given estimate, the BS provides {{the timing and}} <b>frequency</b> <b>feedback</b> info to the identified RSSs with the network grant message. Consequently, it is crucial on the initial ranging process for BS to identify as many as RSSs and to estimate their timing and frequency offsets as accurate as possible.|$|E

These local algorithms interact over the network through nonlinear power flows. We design the local <b>frequency</b> <b>feedback</b> control so that any equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is the solution to an optimization problem that minimizes the total generation cost and user disutility subject to power balance across entire network. With Lyapunov method we derive a sufficient condition ensuring an equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.
