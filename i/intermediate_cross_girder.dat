50|$|According to a 2001 {{study by}} the civil {{engineering}} department of the University of Minnesota, cracking had been previously discovered in the <b>cross</b> <b>girders</b> {{at the end of}} the approach spans. The main trusses connected to these <b>cross</b> <b>girders</b> and resistance to motion at the connection point bearings was leading to unanticipated out-of-plane distortion of the <b>cross</b> <b>girders</b> and subsequent stress cracking. The situation was addressed prior to the study by drilling the cracks to prevent further propagation and adding support struts to the <b>cross</b> <b>girder</b> to prevent further distortion. The report also noted a concern about lack of redundancy in the main truss system, which meant the bridge had a greater risk of collapse in the event of any single structural failure. Although the report concluded that the bridge should not have any problems with fatigue cracking in the foreseeable future, regular inspection, structural health monitoring, and use of strain gauges had been suggested.|$|R
50|$|Each span {{comprises}} 2No. riveted longitudinal {{steel deck}} <b>girders,</b> supporting riveted <b>cross</b> <b>girders,</b> {{which in turn}} support a reinforced concrete slab deck. The bridge has two sets of approach spans, {{each of which has}} three spans, either side of the central main lifting span. Each set of three spans consists of two simply supported end spans which continue as cantilevers approximately 1/5 span into the middle span. The central 3/5 span sections are simply supported drop in spans supported by halving joints. The main span is a structurally independent lifting span. The bearings are inset from the end lifting beams. Spans 1, 3, 5 and 7 are 24.994m c/c of bearings. Spans 2 and 6 are 26.213m, with halving joints 5.334m from both end and a 15.547m suspended span. The central lifting span, Span 4, is 31.242m c/c of bearings, with cantilevers of 3.124m either end to the lifting <b>cross</b> <b>girders.</b> The approach spans have <b>cross</b> <b>girders</b> spaced 2.438m apart, and the lifting <b>girder</b> has <b>cross</b> <b>girders</b> spaced 6.248m.|$|R
40|$|A Flat Bed Rail Wagon (FBRW) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an alternative solution for replacing bridges on low traffic volume roads. The subject matter for {{this paper is to}} investigate the impediment to load transfer from <b>cross</b> <b>girders</b> to main girder, through visually identifiable structural flaws. Namely, the effect of having large openings at close proximity to the connection of the main <b>girder</b> to the <b>cross</b> <b>girder</b> of a FBRW was examined. It was clear that openings locally reduce the section modulus of the secondary members; however it was unclear how these reductions would affect the load transfer to the main girder.

40|$|Nowadays {{the most}} modern and {{economical}} bridges are designed as composite structures with orthotropic plates. In a traditionally designed composite bridge the trapezoidal, longitudinal stiffener is attached, welded to the <b>cross</b> <b>girder</b> web and to the bottom flange of the main girder.

40|$|The {{cable-stayed}} Ting Kau Bridge {{has been}} permanently instrumented {{with more than}} 230 sensors for long-term structural health monitoring. In this article, the feasibility of using the measured dynamic characteristics of the bridge for damage detection is studied. Making use of a validated three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model (FEM), modal flexibility matrices of the bridge are constructed using a few truncated modes and incomplete modal vectors at the sensor locations. The relative flexibility change (RFC) between intact and damage states is then formulated as an index to locate damage. The applicability of this flexibility index for damage location in the cable-stayed bridge is examined by investigating various damage scenarios including those at stay cables, longitudinal stabilizing cables, bearings and supports, longitudinal <b>girders</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>girders,</b> and taking into account measurement noise in modal data. The influence of two ambient factors, that is, temperature change and traffic loading, on the damage detectability is also analyzed by approximately considering an equivalent alteration in the material and structural behaviors. It is revealed that {{in the absence of}} ambient effects the RFC index performs well for locating damage of different severities in single-damage cases. In multi-damage cases the RFC index may provide false-negative identification for damage at the members with low sensitivity. Eliminating ambient effects is requisite for reliable detection of damage at stay cables and <b>cross</b> <b>girders.</b> The capability of the RFC index for locating damage at <b>cross</b> <b>girders</b> is significantly dropped in the presence of measurement noise.

50|$|When {{commissioned}} in 1943, Howrah was the 3rd-longest {{cantilever bridge}} in the world, behind Pont de Québec (549 m) in Canada and Forth Bridge (521 m) in Scotland. It has since been surpassed by three bridges, making it the sixth-longest cantilever {{bridge in the}} world in 2013. It is a suspension type balanced cantilever bridge, with a central span 1,500 ft between centers of main towers and a suspended span of 564 ft. The main towers are 280 ft high above the monoliths and 76 ft apart at the top. The anchor arms are 325 ft each, while the cantilever arms are 468 ft each. The bridge deck hangs from panel points in the lower chord of the main trusses with 39 pairs of hangers. The roadways beyond the towers are supported from ground, leaving the anchor arms free from deck load. The deck system includes <b>cross</b> <b>girders</b> suspended between the pairs of hangers by a pinned connection.
