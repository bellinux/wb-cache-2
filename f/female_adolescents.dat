40|$|This {{treatise}} is {{a qualitative}} study that critically explores a current {{body of knowledge}} significant {{to the development of}} the <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> voice. The <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> voice is a field that is relatively under-researched in comparison to the male adolescent voice, although research in this regard has shown an increase in interest in the last two decades (Gackle 2011 : 11). However, information related to the male adolescent voice still far outweighs the <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> voice. This study, through the use of six secondary objectives, identifies and highlights areas of the <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> voice development, where much of the current research lacks depth and insight. It therefore analyses and compares applicable literature in an attempt principally to contribute to a more structured and academic approach in this field. Insight into the auditory effects that occur during physiological mutation is further supported by investigating the functioning of the female voice registers and the respective influences of these on the different phases of vocal development of the <b>female</b> <b>adolescent.</b> The assistance and expertise of the conductor in this process, as well as in common areas such as voice classification, auditioning, voice placement, and repertoire selection are investigated to further consolidate and compare possible interventions for problems pertaining specifically to the <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> voice. The study concludes with a summary of the treatise and proposes suggestions for further study in this field...|$|R

25|$|Scoliosis affects 2–3% of the United States population, {{which is}} {{equivalent}} to about 5 to 9 million cases. A scoliosis spinal column's curve of 10° or less affects 1.5% to 3% of individuals. The age of onset is usually between 10 years and 15 years (can occur at a younger age) in children and adolescents, making up to 85% of those diagnosed. This is seen {{to be due to}} rapid growth spurts occurring at puberty when spinal development is most relenting to genetic and environmental influences. Because <b>female</b> <b>adolescents</b> undergo growth spurts before postural musculoskeletal maturity, scoliosis is more prevalent among females. Although fewer cases are present today using Cobb angle analysis for diagnosis, scoliosis remains a prevailing condition, appearing in otherwise healthy children. Incidence of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) stops after puberty when skeletal maturity is reached, however, further curvature may proceed during late adulthood due to vertebral osteoporosis and weakened musculature.|$|E

40|$|This Fact Sheet {{provides}} {{professionals with}} known information about <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> sex offenders. The information {{is based on}} the limited available research on this population. <b>Female</b> <b>adolescent</b> sex offenders are defined as females from ages 13 to 17 who commit illegal sexual behavior as defined by the sex crime statues of the jurisdictions in which the offense occurred. Over the past decade, adolescent sexual offending has become a growing concern in the United States. Although the majority of cases of adolescent sexual aggression appear to be committed by males, females account for 1 % of forcible rapes committed by juveniles and 7 % of juvenile arrests for sex offenses, excluding prostitution. 2 The current research indicates that <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> sexual offenders (<b>female</b> ASOs) have been under-reported and under-represented in the sexual offender literature. 3 A number of hypotheses regarding this phenomenon have been suggested. 4, 5, 6 • Individuals, including parents, law enforcement, and child protective services staff, may fail to recognize and address <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> sex offending because they consider females to be physically and/or emotionally incapable of committing such offenses. • Society may more readily tolerate <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> sexual behavior, particularly of non-contact sexual offenses as exhibitionism, peeping, and making indecent phone calls. • Child protection, law enforcement, and other professionals may perceive that <b>adolescent</b> <b>females</b> pose a significantly lower risk for sexual offending than adolescent males, believing them to be more mature and better able to separate emotional needs from sexual behaviors than their male peers. One complication of this under-representation is that it has been difficult for researchers to locate adequate samples of female ASOs to participate in research. Much of the published literature on female ASOs was drawn from information gathered through single case studies and small samples of specific populations (e. g., adolescent girls who were incarcerated or in inpatient treatment programs). It is unclear whether this information adequately represents the general population of female ASOs. • The average female ASO is 14 years old. 3,...|$|R

Sixteen <b>female</b> <b>adolescent</b> gymnasts between the ages of 12 - 20 competing at Junior Olympic levels 7 - 10 were recruited. Participants were divided into resistance training (N = 10 age; 13. 5 ± 1. 00 years, height; 155. 19 ± 8. 38 cm, weight; 51. 58 ± 9. 63 kg) or gymnastics training (N = 6 age; 15. 25 ± 2. 25 years, height; 149. 23 ± 11. 91 cm, weight; 46. 52 ± 10. 22 kg) groups.
