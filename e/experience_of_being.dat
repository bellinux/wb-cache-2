5|$|The <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> entertained {{has come}} to be {{strongly}} associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he felt as a fatherless child and the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him {{to believe that he}} could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39â€“40.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar is {{reputed to}} have been a staunch disciplinarian, with {{willingness}} to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who have personally approached the Sultan in his later years described him as a person with a warm and generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was a person with a turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of past notorious incidents, which include an <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E
5|$|Hart's duties at Sling Camp {{ended in}} July, {{when he was}} {{recalled}} to France to take over command of the 3rd New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade. He led the brigade through the Hundred Days Offensive, which included an action during the Second Battle of Bapaume that impressed his commanding officer, Russell. During the battle, Hart's headquarters was again shelled with mustard gas. After his previous <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> gassed, Hart found the shelling 'annoying'. The brigade also participated in the capture of Le Quesnoy in November 1918. This was a difficult assignment {{for the presence of}} civilians in the walled town meant that artillery could not support the attack. Instead a small party was able to scale the walls and put flight to the Germans defending that section. This allowed the remainder of the attacking force to enter the town, which quickly surrendered. A few days later, the mayor of Le Quesnoy presented Hart with the French flag that was raised over the town on the day it was captured from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he was too old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> recognised in public.|$|E

40|$|Research on fear {{of crime}} {{typically}} examines the perceptions of those who fear, emphasizing womenâ€™s <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability in public space. In this paper, I invert this practice to examine instead menâ€™s <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> feared in public spaces. Drawing on interviews with 82 male college students, I use a social constructionist approach to examine how menâ€™s <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> feared interact with menâ€™s formation of racial identities and the racialization of public places. Fear is a key mechanism for justifying and maintaining race privilege and exclusion. The <b>experience</b> and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>being</b> feared (or not feared) in public space intersects with menâ€™s construction of gender and race identities, and the ways that men assign racial meanings to public places. This paper examines these processes and proposes strategies for challenging fear and the exclusion it supports. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: For {{patients}} with end-stage organ failure receiving an organ is lifesaving. To be transplanted means {{a big change}} and adjustment in life with lifelong medication. The ambition for these patients is {{to go back and}} live as normal of life as possible. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} describe patients <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> organ transplanted. Method: The method used was a literature-based study based on qualitative scientific articles. A total of 9 articles were analyzed with a qualitative content analysis. Result: After analysis 5 categories emerged; indebted, limitations in daily life, fear of organ rejection, concerns about medicine and a positive attitude to life. It showed that patientÂ´s <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> organ transplanted are individual and unique. Some experiences are harder to deal with than others. Conclusion: Patients describe both negative as well as positive <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> transplanted. They express a need for more knowledge about their condition and a need that health care staff enhance their knowledge and understanding about their unique situation...|$|R
