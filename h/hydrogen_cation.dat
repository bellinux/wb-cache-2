5|$|The {{universal}} {{emergence of}} atomic hydrogen first {{occurred during the}} recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E

5000|$|... has a value {{close to}} 10−14 at 25 °C, so the {{concentration}} of hydroxide ions in pure water is close to 10−7 mol∙dm−3, {{in order to satisfy}} the equal charge constraint. The pH of a solution is equal to the decimal cologarithm of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> concentration; the pH of pure water is close to 7 at ambient temperatures. The concentration of hydroxide ions can be expressed in terms of pOH, which is close to 14 − pH, so pOH of pure water is also close to 7. Addition of a base to water will reduce the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> concentration and therefore increase the hydroxide ion concentration (increase pH, decrease pOH) even if the base does not itself contain hydroxide. For example, ammonia solutions have a pH greater than 7 due to the reaction NH3 + H+ [...] , which results in a decrease in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> concentration and an increase in hydroxide ion concentration. pOH can be kept at a nearly constant value with various buffer solutions.|$|E

50|$|Deprotonation is {{the removal}} (transfer) of a proton (a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation,</b> H+) from a Brønsted-Lowry acid in an acid-base reaction. The species formed is the {{conjugate}} base of that acid. The complementary process, when a proton is added (transferred) to a Brønsted-Lowry base, is protonation. The species formed is the conjugate acid of that base.|$|E

50|$|In living cells, DNP {{acts as a}} proton ionophore, {{an agent}} that can shuttle protons (<b>hydrogen</b> <b>cations)</b> across {{biological}} membranes. It dissipates the proton gradient across mitochondria and chloroplast membranes, collapsing the proton motive force that the cell uses to produce most of its ATP chemical energy. Instead of producing ATP, {{the energy of the}} proton gradient is lost as heat.|$|R
5000|$|The Brønsted-Lowry {{theory is}} an acid-base {{reaction}} theory which was proposed independently by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry in 1923. The fundamental concept of this {{theory is that}} when an acid and a base react with each other, the acid forms its conjugate base, and the base forms its conjugate acid by exchange of a proton (the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation,</b> or H+). This theory is a generalization of the Arrhenius theory.|$|E
50|$|The Tiffeneau-Demjanov {{rearrangement}} (after Marc Tiffeneau and Nikolai Demjanov) is {{a variation}} of the Demjanov rearrangement, which involves both a ring expansion and the production of a ketone by using sodium nitrite and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation.</b> Using the Tiffeneau-Demjanov reaction is often advantageous as, while there are rearrangements possible in the products, the reactant always undergoes ring enlargement. As in the Demjanov rearrangement, products illustrate regioselectivity in the reaction. Migratory aptitudes of functional groups dictate rearrangement products.|$|E
5000|$|The Hartree-Fock {{method is}} {{typically}} used {{to solve the}} time-independent Schrödinger equation for a multi-electron atom or molecule {{as described in the}} Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Since there are no known solutions for many-electron systems (there are solutions for one-electron systems such as hydrogenic atoms and the diatomic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation),</b> the problem is solved numerically. Due to the nonlinearities introduced by the Hartree-Fock approximation, the equations are solved using a nonlinear method such as iteration, which gives rise to the name [...] "self-consistent field method." ...|$|E

50|$|Urea {{contains}} a carbonyl group. The more electronegative oxygen atom pulls electrons {{away from the}} carbon forming a greater electron density around the oxygen, giving the oxygen a partial negative charge and forming a polar bond. When nitric acid is presented, it ionizes. A <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> contributed by the acid is attracted to the oxygen and forms a covalent bond H+. The electronegative NO3− ion then is attracted to the positive hydrogen ion. This forms an ionic bond and hence the compound urea nitrate.|$|E
50|$|If {{oxygen supply}} is {{inadequate}} (hypoxia), the mitochondria {{are unable to}} continue ATP synthesis at a rate sufficient to supply the cell with the required ATP. In this situation, glycolysis is increased to provide additional ATP, and the excess pyruvate produced is converted into lactate and released from the cell into the bloodstream, where it accumulates over time. While increased glycolysis helps compensate for less ATP from oxidative phosphorylation, it cannot bind the hydrogen cations that result from ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> concentration rises and causes acidosis.|$|E
50|$|Hydroxide is a {{diatomic}} anion {{with chemical}} formula OH−. It {{consists of an}} oxygen and hydrogen atom held together by a covalent bond, and carries a negative electric charge. It is an important but usually minor constituent of water. It functions as a base, a ligand, a nucleophile and a catalyst. The hydroxide ion forms salts, some of which dissociate in aqueous solution, liberating solvated hydroxide ions. Sodium hydroxide is a multi-million-ton per annum commodity chemical. A hydroxide attached to a strongly electropositive center may itself ionize, liberating a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> (H+), making the parent compound an acid.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} enols, rhodizonic acid can lose the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cations</b> H+ from the hydroxyls (pK1 = 4.378 ± 0.009, pK2 = 4.652 ± 0.014 at 25°C), {{yielding}} the hydrogenrhodizonate anion C6HO6 and the rhodizonate anion C6O62. The latter is aromatic and symmetric, as the double bond {{and the negative}} charges are delocalized and evenly distributed over the six CO units. Rhodizonates tend to have various shades of red, from yellowish to purplish.|$|R
50|$|In chemistry, diprotic acid is a {{class of}} Arrhenius acids which are capable of {{donating}} two protons or <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cations</b> per molecule when dissociating in aqueous solutions. The most important chemical feature for a diprotic acid molecule {{is its ability to}} deprotonate two protons in two sequential steps during dissociation. Most diprotic acids are common acids which are used everyday in many different areas. Also, they exist everywhere in nature, such as in human bodies.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} enols, rhodizonic acid can lose the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cations</b> H+ from the hydroxyls (pK1 = 4.378 ± 0.009, pK2 = 4.652 ± 0.014 at 25 °C), {{yielding}} the hydrogenrhodizonate anion C6HO6&minus; and the rhodizonate anion C6O62&minus;. The latter is aromatic and symmetric, as the double bond {{and the negative}} charges are delocalized and evenly distributed over the six CO units. Rhodizonates tend to have various shades of red, from yellowish to purplish.|$|R
50|$|The ions {{observed}} by mass spectrometry may be quasimolecular ions {{created by the}} addition of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> and denoted + H+, or of another cation such as sodium ion, + Na+, or the removal of a hydrogen nucleus, − H−. Multiply charged ions such as + nHn+ are often observed. For large macromolecules, there can be many charge states, resulting in a characteristic charge state envelope. All these are even-electron ion species: electrons (alone) are not added or removed, unlike in some other ionization sources. The analytes are sometimes involved in electrochemical processes, leading to shifts of the corresponding peaks in the mass spectrum. This effect is demonstrated in the direct ionization of noble metals such as copper, silver and gold using electrospray.|$|E
50|$|Cation {{exchange}} capacity should {{be thought of}} as the soil's ability to remove cations from the soil water solution and sequester those to be exchanged later as the plant roots release hydrogen ions to the solution. CEC is the amount of exchangeable <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> (H+) that will combine with 100 grams dry weight of soil and whose measure is one milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil (1 meq/100 g). Hydrogen ions have a single charge and one-thousandth of a gram of hydrogen ions per 100 grams dry soil gives a measure of one milliequivalent of hydrogen ion. Calcium, with an atomic weight 40 times that of hydrogen and with a valence of two, converts to (40/2) x 1 milliequivalent = 20 milliequivalents of hydrogen ion per 100 grams of dry soil or 20 meq/100 g. The modern measure of CEC is expressed as centimoles of positive charge per kilogram (cmol/kg) of oven-dry soil.|$|E

50|$|In {{the higher}} {{oxidation}} {{states of the}} pnictogens, chalcogens, halogens, and noble gases there are oxoacids in which the central atom is attached to oxide ions and hydroxide ions. Examples include phosphoric acid H3PO4, and sulfuric acid H2SO4. In these compounds one or more hydroxide groups can dissociate with the liberation of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cations</b> as in a standard Brønsted-Lowry acid. Many oxoacids of sulfur are known and all feature OH groups that can dissociate.|$|R

[...] The croconate ion, in particular, is aromatic and symmetric, as the double bond {{and the negative}} charges become delocalized over the five CO units. [...] The lithium, sodium and potassium croconates crystallize from water as dihydrates but the orange potassium salt can be dehydrated to form a monohydrate.|$|R
5000|$|The excess {{hydrogen}} cations {{produced during}} lactic acidosis are {{widely believed to}} actually derive from production of lactic acid. This is incorrect, as cells do not produce lactic acid; pyruvate is converted directly into lactate, the anionic form of lactic acid. When excess intracellular lactate is released into the blood, maintenance of electroneutrality of the blood requires that a cation be released into the blood, as well. This can reduce blood pH. Glycolysis coupled with lactate production is neutral {{in the sense that}} it does not produce excess hydrogen cations; however, pyruvate production does produce them. Lactate production is buffered intracellularly, e.g. the lactate-producing enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, binds one <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> per pyruvate molecule converted. When such buffer systems become saturated, cells will transport lactate into the bloodstream. Hypoxia certainly causes both a buildup of lactate and acidification, and lactate is therefore a good [...] "marker" [...] of hypoxia, but lactate itself is not the cause of low pH. During exercise and some illnesses, lactate production is not generated by lack of oxygen, per se, but by the catecholamine-driven glycolysis that cells use when they cannot get enough energy from oxygen reactions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{proposed}} {{mechanism for}} the oxidation of an alcohol by Fétizon's reagent involves single electron oxidation of both the alcoholic oxygen and the hydrogen alpha to the alcohol by two atoms of silver(I) within the celite surface. The carbonate ion then proceeds to deprotonate the resulting carbonyl generating bicarbonate which is further protonated by the additionally generated <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cation</b> to cause elimination of water and generation of carbon dioxide.The rate limiting step of this reaction is proposed to be the initial association of the alcohol to the silver ions. As a result, the presence of even weakly associating ligands to the silver can inhibit the reaction greatly. As a result, even slightly polar solvents of any variety, such as ethyl acetate or methyl ethyl ketone, are avoided when using this reagent as they competitively associate with the reagent. [...] Additional polar functionalities of the reactant should also be avoided whenever possible as even {{the presence of an}} alkene can sometimes reduce the reactivity of a substrate 50 fold. [...] Commonly employed solvents such as benzene and xylene are extremely non-polar and further acceleration of the reaction can be achieved through the use of the more non-polar heptane. [...] The solvent is also typically refluxed to drive the reaction with heat and remove the water generated by the reaction through azeotropic distillation.Steric hindrance of the hydrogen alpha to the alcohol is a major determination of the rate of oxidation as it effects the rate of association. Tertiary alcohols lacking an alpha hydrogen are selected against and generally do not oxidize in the presence of Fétizon's reagent.Increasing the amount of celite used in the reagent accelerates the rate of the reaction by increasing the surface area available to react. However, increasing the amount of celite past 900 grams per mole of silver(I) carbonate begins to slow the reaction due to dilution effects.|$|E
