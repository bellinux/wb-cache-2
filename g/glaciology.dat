25|$|In November 1864, Huxley {{succeeded in}} {{launching}} a dining club, the X Club, composed of like-minded people working {{to advance the}} cause of science; not surprisingly, the club consisted of most of his closest friends. There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting {{that there should be no}} more. The members were: Huxley, John Tyndall, J. D. Hooker, John Lubbock (banker, biologist and neighbour of Darwin), Herbert Spencer (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), William Spottiswoode (mathematician and the Queen's Printer), Thomas Hirst (Professor of Physics at University College London), Edward Frankland (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and George Busk, zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for HMS Dreadnought). All except Spencer were Fellows of the Royal Society. Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day. On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter's trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in <b>glaciology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Only a {{few years}} later, the Danish-Norwegian {{geologist}} Jens Esmark (1762–1839) argued a sequence of worldwide ice ages. In a paper published in 1824, Esmark proposed changes in climate {{as the cause of}} those glaciations. He attempted to show that they originated from changes in Earth's orbit. During the following years, Esmark's ideas were discussed and taken over in parts by Swedish, Scottish and German scientists. At the University of Edinburgh Robert Jameson (1774–1854) seemed to be relatively open to Esmark's ideas, as reviewed by Norwegian professor of <b>glaciology</b> Bjørn G. Andersen (1992). Jameson's remarks about ancient glaciers in Scotland were most probably prompted by Esmark. In Germany, Albrecht Reinhard Bernhardi (1797–1849), a geologist and professor of forestry at an academy in Dreissigacker, since incorporated in the southern Thuringian city of Meiningen, adopted Esmark's theory. In a paper published in 1832, Bernhardi speculated about former polar ice caps reaching as far as the temperate zones of the globe.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Antarctic Division {{conducted}} {{an expedition to}} Heard Island during the austral summer of 2003-04. A small team of scientists spent two months on the island, conducting studies on avian and terrestrial biology and <b>glaciology.</b> Glaciologists conducted further research on the Brown Glacier, {{in an effort to}} determine whether glacial retreat is rapid or punctuated. Using a portable echo sounder, the team took measurements of the volume of the glacier. Monitoring of climatic conditions continued, with an emphasis on the impact of Foehn winds on glacier mass balance. Based on the findings of that expedition, the rate of loss of glacier ice on Heard Island appears to be accelerating. Between 2000 and 2003, repeat GPS surface surveys revealed that the rate of loss of ice in both the ablation zone and the accumulation zone of Brown Glacier was more than double average rate measured from 1947 to 2003. The increase in the rate of ice loss suggests that the glaciers of Heard Island are reacting to ongoing climate change, rather than approaching dynamic equilibrium. The retreat of Heard Island's glaciers is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.|$|E
500|$|Ross {{discovered}} the [...] "enormous" [...] Ross Ice Shelf, correctly observing {{that it was}} the source of the tabular icebergs seen in the Southern Ocean, and helping to found the science of <b>glaciology.</b>|$|E
500|$|By plan, the {{following}} summer, {{the team was}} to drill down again to take a sample of that ice and analyze it. The Russians resumed drilling into the lake in January 2012 and reached the upper {{surface of the water}} on 6 February 2012. [...] The researchers allowed the rushing lake water to freeze within the bore hole and months later, they collected ice core samples of this newly formed ice and sent to the Laboratory for <b>Glaciology</b> and Environmental Geophysics in Grenoble, France, for analysis.|$|E
500|$|The {{grade of}} the railway {{approaching}} Rogers Pass was too steep {{to allow for}} dining cars on the trains, so the CPR built a hotel west of the pass in 1886. [...] This added to a collection of CPR-owned hotels across Canada, including Mount Stephen House in Yoho National Park, built {{in the same year}} and with the same floor plan. [...] Glacier House, located near the terminus of the Illecillewaet Glacier (called the Great Glacier at the time), became a center for tourism, mountaineering, <b>glaciology,</b> and photography in the Selkirks. [...] The hotel was expanded in 1905 and 1911. [...] It was considered one of western Canada's premier tourist destinations {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century.|$|E
500|$|On 6 September 2007 Belgian-based International Polar Foundation {{unveiled}} the Princess Elisabeth station, the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to research climate change. Costing $16.3million, the prefabricated station, {{which is part}} of the International Polar Year, was shipped to the South Pole from Belgium by the end of 2008 to monitor the health of the polar regions. Belgian polar explorer Alain Hubert stated: [...] "This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic." [...] Johan Berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in climatology, <b>glaciology</b> and microbiology.|$|E
500|$|The Vaux {{family were}} well-off Quakers from Pennsylvania. [...] The family first visited Glacier House and Illecillewaet Glacier in 1887. [...] On a {{subsequent}} trip, they noticed a visible retreat of the glacier's terminus. [...] The Vaux children, William, George, Jr., and Mary (later Mary Vaux Walcott) were amateur photographers {{and began a}} study of the glacier using pictures taken from fixed points. [...] William and George, Jr. presented their findings to the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S. [...] Their study and methods were considered a [...] "breakthrough" [...] in the new field of <b>glaciology.</b> [...] Mary Vaux would continue to visit the area every summer until her death in 1940.|$|E
500|$|When British {{scientists}} in Antarctica performed airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys {{in the early}} 1970s, they detected unusual radar readings at the site which suggested {{the presence of a}} liquid freshwater lake below the ice. In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a remote sensing specialist with the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, directed the ERS-1 satellite to turn its high-frequency array {{toward the center of the}} Antarctic ice cap. The data from ERS-1 confirmed the findings from the 1973 British surveys, but these new data were not published in the Journal of <b>Glaciology</b> until 1993. Space-based radar revealed that this subglacial body of fresh water is one of the largest lakes in the world, and one of some 140 subglacial lakes in Antarctica. Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating radar imaging observations and space-based radar altimetry. It has been confirmed that the lake contains large amounts of liquid water under the more than [...] ice cap. The lake has at least 22 cavities of liquid water, averaging [...] each.|$|E
500|$|The International Geophysical Year (1957–1958) saw {{increased}} <b>glaciology</b> research {{around the}} world, {{with one of}} the high priority research targets being deep cores in polar regions. [...] SIPRE conducted pilot drilling trials in 1956 (to 305 m) and 1957 (to 411 m) at Site 2 in Greenland; the second core, with the benefit of the previous year's drilling experience, was retrieved in much better condition, with fewer gaps. [...] In Antarctica, a 307m core was drilled at Byrd Station in 1957–1958, and a 264m core at Little America V, on the Ross Ice Shelf, the following year. [...] The success of the IGY core drilling led to increased interest in improving ice coring capabilities, and was followed by a CRREL project at Camp Century, where in the early 1960s three holes were drilled, the deepest reaching the base of the ice sheet at 1387m in July 1966. [...] The drill used at Camp Century then went to Byrd Station, where a 2164m hole was drilled to bedrock before the drill was frozen into the borehole by sub-ice meltwater and had to be abandoned.|$|E
500|$|The {{many books}} and {{articles}} produced by the Workmans are [...] "still useful" [...] according to Mason, especially for their photographs and illustrations, but their maps are [...] "deceptive and not always reliable". One assessment states that although the Workmans excelled at describing meteorological conditions, <b>glaciology,</b> and how high altitudes affected human health and fitness, they were poor topographers. [...] The Workmans {{were some of the}} first mountaineers to grasp that the Himalaya were the place for the ultimate climbing challenge and their explorations helped evolve mountaineering from strenuous recreation into a serious, regulated competitive sport. According to Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar, [...] "that the Workmans were intrepid explorers and climbers none could possibly doubt, but they were also aggressive self-promoters who in their eagerness for recognition and honors sometimes exaggerated the originality and significance of what they had done." [...] In their final assessment, Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar say [...] "they had logged more miles and climbed more peaks than anyone to date; they had produced five sumptuously illustrated and widely read expedition volumes; and by simple virtue of her sex Fanny of course had set an invaluable Himalayan precedent. But the Workmans were not great mountaineers. At their best they were vigorous and competent patrons who followed capably in the hard-won steps of their Italian guides." [...] However, in his chapter on Workman, Pauly writes that [...] "the few recent accounts of Fanny Workman have tended to slight or belittle her achievements, but contemporaries, unaware of the far greater accomplishments to come, held the Workmans in high regard." [...] They were the first Americans to explore the Himalaya in depth and break the British monopoly over Himalayan mountaineering.|$|E

The corresponding area of study is called <b>glaciology.</b> Glaciers are important components of the global cryosphere.|$|E
2500|$|In spring 1999, the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics {{became a}} {{territorial}} section (sezione territoriale) of the Tridentine Museum of Natural Sciences (Museo Tridentino di Scienze Naturali), thereby becoming {{a part of}} a network of 18 scientific and historical museums which are ultimately overseen by the province of Trento.

2500|$|Dr. Hinrich Johannes Rink (first name {{sometimes}} as Henrik) (26 August 1819 – 15 December 1893) was a Danish geologist, {{one of the}} pioneers of <b>glaciology,</b> and the first accurate describer of the inland ice of Greenland. Rink, who first came to Greenland in 1848, spent 16 winters and 22 summers in the Arctic region, and became notable for Greenland's development. Becoming a Greenlandic scholar and administrator, he served as Royal Inspector of South Greenland and went on to become Director of the Royal Greenland Trading Department. With [...] "Forstanderskaber", Rink introduced the first steps towards Greelandic home rule.|$|E
2500|$|Jakobshavn Glacier drains 6.5% of the Greenland {{ice sheet}} and {{produces}} around 10% of all Greenland icebergs. Some 35 billion tonnes of icebergs calve off and pass {{out of the}} fjord every year. [...] Icebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large (up to a kilometer in height) that they are too tall to float down the fjord and lie stuck {{on the bottom of}} its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. Studied for over 250 years, Jakobshavn Glacier has helped develop our understanding of climate change and icecap <b>glaciology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An ice age is {{a period}} of {{long-term}} reduction in the temperature of Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Within a long-term ice age, individual pulses of cold climate are termed [...] "glacial periods" [...] (or alternatively [...] "glacials" [...] or [...] "glaciations" [...] or colloquially as [...] "ice age"), and intermittent warm periods are called [...] "interglacials". In the terminology of <b>glaciology,</b> ice age implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres. By this definition, we are in an interglacial period—the Holocene—of the ice age. The ice age began 2.6 million years ago {{at the start of the}} Pleistocene epoch, because the Greenland, Arctic, and Antarctic ice sheets still exist.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, {{scientists}} from McGill University explored Expedition Fiord (previously Sør Fjord or South Fiord) in central Axel Heiberg Island. This {{resulted in the}} establishment of the McGill Arctic Research Station (...) , constructed [...] inland from Expedition Fjord in 1960. It consists of a small research hut, a cookhouse and 2 temporary structures that can comfortably accommodate 8-12 persons. The station was initially heavily utilied during the early 1960s, during which a population of 20 was present. The McGill Arctic Research Station is active from March to August with research currently focused on polar geomorphology, geology, <b>glaciology,</b> permafrost, climate change, and polar microbiology. Over the last 10-15 years, it has served as a significant Mars analogue for astrobiology investigations studying life and habitability of polar cryoenvironments and field testing planetary exploration instrumentation platforms.|$|E
2500|$|Akademik Fedorov then sailed {{towards the}} [...] "Ice Base", {{a group of}} nine polar explorers led by A.A.Visnevsky landed on June 7, 2007 from the nuclear {{icebreaker}} Russia at the point [...] The corresponding ice floe was {{a candidate for the}} [...] "NP-35" [...] establishment, but since then its area greatly reduced and became inappropriate for this. Sailing through {{the northern part of the}} Kara Sea Akademik Fedorov reached the northern part of Laptev Sea, then returned, passed by Schmidt Island and sailed southwards towards Shokalsky Strait of Severnaya Zemlya. 26 oceanographic stations were carried out and Mi-8 flights were performed from the research vessel to Schmidt Island for ornithology research and to north-eastern islands of Franz Joseph Land for <b>glaciology,</b> geology and ornithology research. Ornithology research was also conducted on Severnaya Zemlya islands. In particular, a significant part of the ivory gull range was observed and six new colonies of these birds found.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the islands' {{military}} significance, the Soviet Union {{closed off}} {{the area to}} foreign researchers, although Soviet researchers carried out various expeditions, including in geophysics, studies of the ionosphere, marine biology, botany, ornithology and <b>glaciology.</b> The Soviet Union opened up the archipelago for international activities from 1990, with foreigners having fairly straightforward access. The base on Graham Bell Island was abandoned in the early 1990s. The military presence at Nagurskoye was reduced {{to that of a}} border post, and the number of people stationed at Krenkel Observatory were reduced from seventy to a dozen. The archipelago and the surrounding waters was declared a nature reserve in April 1994. The opening of the archipelago also saw the introduction of tourism, most of which takes place on Russian-operated icebreakers. In 2011, in a move to better accommodate tourism in the archipelago, the Russian Arctic National Park was expanded to include Franz Josef Land.|$|E
