40|$|I {{tested the}} effects of {{conditioning}} books on the rate of acquisition of textual responses for 16 participants with (11 participants) or without (5 participants) developmental delays, {{ranging in age from}} 2. 4 to 4. 6 years old, in three experiments. Eight males and 8 females participated; the children were selected from an early intervention/preschool program that implemented a behavior analytic approach to all instruction, and they were selected for participation because they did not have book stimuli as conditioned reinforcers for observing, but they did have the necessary prerequisite skills in repertoire to acquire textual responses. The independent variable was the <b>establishment</b> of <b>books</b> as reinforcers for observing responses and as a preferred activity in a free play area. The dependent variable was the rate of acquisition of textual responses before and after books were established as conditioned reinforcers. The embedded dependent variable was the number of 5 s intervals participants observed books in the free play setting, and the embedded independent variable was one of three methods of conditioning book stimuli (textual operant discrimination training, Pavlovian second order conditioning, or conditioning books through peer observation). A non-concurrent multiple pre- and post-intervention probe design across groups was used. In Experiment I, the participants ranged in age from 2. 4 to 2. 7 years old. Participants A and B acquired conditioned reinforcement for observing books as a function of mastering pre-requisite skills (word/picture discrimination) and one set of sight words. Participants C and D required stimulus-stimulus pairings to acquire books as conditioned reinforcers. Results showed that Participants A-D learned sight words 2. 20 to 7. 25 times faster as a function of having books as conditioned reinforcers. Experiment II differed in that: a) the participants were 3. 7 and 4. 6 years old, b) more sets of sight words were taught, and c) free play area probes were conducted with peers with and without books as conditioned reinforcers in a systematic fashion. Participant E acquired conditioned reinforcement for observing books as a function of mastering two sets of sight words. Participant F did not acquire books as conditioned reinforcers through sight word instruction, nor through stimulus-stimulus pairings, but did acquire conditioned reinforcement for observing books {{as a function of the}} conditioning books through a peer observation intervention. Results indicated that Participants E and F learned sight words 1. 6 - 2. 06 times faster than in pre-intervention conditions. Experiment III differed in that a) additional sight words were taught and b) free play sessions were conducted without peers. Results showed that Participants A 1 - C 3 learned sight words 1. 5 to 9 times faster (mean= 3. 28 times faster) with the exception of Participant A 4, who required a mean of one more session (mean of 3. 5 sessions to 4. 5 sessions) in post-intervention conditions. Participants A 2, A 4, B 3, and C 1, acquired books as reinforcers as a function of textual operant discrimination training (TODT). Marked increases in observing books was noted for Participant C 3 after TODT, but not to criterion levels. TODT was not effective for Participants A 1, A 3, B 2, and C 2, but Pavlovian second order conditioning (PSOC) was effective for these participants. Neither TODT nor PSOC was successful in conditioning books as reinforcers for Participant B 1, but conditioning books through peer observation was successful. Results are discussed in terms of: (a) the different interventions to condition books as reinforcers individualized per the repertoires of the participants, (b) the <b>establishment</b> of <b>books</b> as reinforcers as a developmental cusp, and (c) supporting the argument for the <b>establishment</b> of <b>books</b> as conditioned reinforcers as an empirical definition of reading readiness.

2500|$|Later, [...] "chicken cutlets Kiev-style" [...] {{were listed}} in Apportionments for dinners, {{separate}} dishes {{and other products}} of public catering (1928) which served as a standard reference for Soviet catering <b>establishments.</b> The <b>book</b> also included other items for chicken cutlets, such as [...] "cutlet de volaille" [...] and [...] "cutlet à la Maréchale".

In post-World War II publications of this directory and in other Soviet cookery books, such as Cookery (1955), the [...] "Kiev-style" [...] name was retained, but the terms de volaille and à la Maréchale were indeed dropped in favour of simple names such as [...] "chicken cutlet stuffed with milk sauce" [...] and [...] "chicken cutlet stuffed with liver".

Swanson published four books of verse between 1942 and 1953, and also a book of logging stories, Whistle Punks and Widow-Makers, which appeared in 1993. Known as the [...] "bard of the woods", he wrote ballads of logging on the British Columbia coast, taking the advice of Robert Service, who noted that Swanson had traveled extensively through the camps and no one else was writing about that type of life. Swanson read the poems on his weekly talk show on radio station CJOR, and the chapbooks of the verses were designed to fit in racks meant for issues of Reader's Digest, found in every camp commissary. Mainly distributed through the Harry Smith News Agency, the ballads were immensely popular in bunkhouses, reputedly selling 82,000 copies. [...] Although Swanson was never accepted by the literary <b>establishment,</b> his <b>books</b> easily outsold better known poets of the 1940s such as Earle Birney and Dorothy Livesay. In the 1980s, he was part of a troupe that read and sang literature about logging.

He comments that the anonymity created by these largely shared public corridors and spaces “evoked no feelings of identity or control” [...] This indicates our relationship with space affects our behaviour and use of space. In this example lack of feelings of ownership of the space led to negative behaviour within space and furthermore created a feedback with negative effects on the wellbeing of the inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|Arguably Mason's most {{explicitly}} political novel, The Yellow Cathedral {{is set in}} {{the impoverished}} southern Mexican state of Chiapas in the early 1990s, {{at the time of the}} rebellion by the indigenous population and Zapatista activists (the EZLN) against the wealthy landowners and the political <b>establishment.</b> The <b>book</b> relates the attempt by the opposition party (the PRD) to install a (democratically elected) 'rebel' governor, Avendano, in place of Rosas, the placeman of the central government, and representative of the dominant PRI party. The narrative switches between a number of characters who represents different aspects of the conflict. Benito, a young PRD activist, is impatient at the peaceful strategy advocated by his respected uncle Hernandez, and falls in with a group who carry out a disastrous raid on a ranch. Rafael is another young man whose work for the PRD estranges him from his father. Similarly, Rafael's sister Maria has angered her father over her conversion to evangelism and her rumoured affair with the local PRD candidate, Mateo Mendez. Mateo is eventually beaten by PRI supporters, and Maria driven from her home by a mob. The life of the rebel governor Avendano, who works with little or no equipment or money in the thick of communal life, is contrasted with that of Rosas, the official governor, who frequents meetings with the President and Pereira, the leader of the local ranchers. Pereira wants Rosas to suppress the rebels ruthlessly, but the president has instructed Rosas to win hearts and minds, albeit with few resources that might back up the demands for reform. The Zapatistas initiate an uprising, which is suppressed by the army. In San Cristobal, a mob attacks the cathedral, where the left-wing Bishop Samuel Ruiz is staging a fast in support of the rebels. Indigenous supporters of the Bishop protect the cathedral, and are attacked, but police eventually arrive to disperse the mob.|$|R
5000|$|Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., , was a United States Supreme Court {{case on the}} {{controversial}} issue of adult bookstore zoning {{in the city of}} Los Angeles. Zoning laws dictated that no adult bookstores could be within five hundred feet of a public park, or religious establishment, or within 1000 feet of another adult <b>establishment.</b> However, Alameda <b>Books,</b> Inc. and Highland Books, Inc. were two adult stores that operated under one roof. They sued Los Angeles, stating the ordinance violated the first amendment. The district court concurred with the stores, stating that the 1977 study stating there was a higher crime rate in areas with adult stores, which the law was based upon, did not support a reasonable belief that multiple-use adult establishments produce the secondary effects the city asserted as content-neutral justifications for its restrictions on adult stores. The Court of Appeals upheld this verdict, and found that even if the ordinance were content neutral, the city failed to present evidence upon which it could reasonably rely to demonstrate that its regulation of multiple-use establishments was designed to serve its substantial interest in reducing crime. However, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the city. This reversed the decision of the lower court. This case was argued on December 4, 2001; certiorari was granted on March 5, 2001.

There {{have been a number of}} significant developments and trends in exchanges since the beginning of World War 11. They are as follows: the increased concern of governments for the extension and improvement of international exchanges; Unesco leadership in the same field; the <b>establishment</b> of national <b>book</b> centers, such as the United States Book Exchange; the use of procurement officers; and finally, the small beginnings of multilateral exchanges. One of the most striking trends in the exchange of current publications during the past decade has been the increased interest which governments have shown in it. World War I 1 made painfully apparent to our government the shortage in this country of vital information about other countries. Efforts to avoid World War I 11 have pointed up the importance of the wide distribution of publications from this country which might make for better understanding with other nations. Both of these needs are met by the single operation of exchanges. The United States government has supported exchanges for more than a century. The service of the Smithsonian Institution in shipping and in receiving publications for libraries in this country, now known as the International Exchange Service, has been in operation since 1849.

According to this need Croatian parliament issued a conclusion in 1849 that the Society for fostering national language and literature should be established while the Illyrian reading room decided to establish Matica ilirska nothing has changed because neither Government in Vienna nor one in Budapest wanted to confirm the Statute of the Society which was a necessary step for society to become a legal entity in order for it to legally act. The reason for the refusal to accept Statute of the Society was that the Government feared that the establishment of a cultural national institution would threaten the existence of the multiethnicthe Austrian Empire. Therefore, Count Janko Drašković proposed founding Matica {{as a part of the}} Illyrian reading room (Ilirska čitaonica) that was founded on August 4, 1838. Matica hrvatska was officially founded on February 10, 1842 in Zagreb as Matica ilirska.

[...] Janko Drasković said at the opening ceremony: [...] "The main purpose of our society is to disseminate science and literature in our national language and to give the opportunity to our young people to educate themselves in the spirit of patriotism. We have many old and famous books from the 16th and 17th century written by writers like Andrija Čubranović, Dinko Ranjina, Dinko Zlatarić, Ivan Gundulić, Junije Palmotić, Ignjat Đurđević and many others that should be published in an organic (Croatian) language." [...] From 1846 to 1886, with interruptions, Matica ilirska had its headquarters in the National home palace (Palača Narodni dom).|$|R
