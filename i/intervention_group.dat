25|$|At 10:30 CET on 8 January, the day {{following}} the attack, the two primary suspects were spotted in Aisne, north-east of Paris. Armed security forces, including the National Gendarmerie <b>Intervention</b> <b>Group</b> (GIGN) and the Force d'intervention de la police nationale (FIPN), were deployed {{to the department}} {{to search for the}} suspects.|$|E
25|$|When {{acting as}} general purpose police force, the Gendarmerie {{encompasses}} the counter terrorist {{units of the}} Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie (Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the National Gendarmerie <b>Intervention</b> <b>Group</b> (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the Search Sections of the National Gendarmerie (Sections de Recherche de la Gendarmerie Nationale), responsible for criminal enquiries, and the Mobile Brigades of the National Gendarmerie (Brigades mobiles de la Gendarmerie Nationale, or in short Gendarmerie mobile) which have the task to maintain public order.|$|E
40|$|Randomized {{controlled}} trials (RCTs), typically, randomize {{participants to}} one of two <b>intervention</b> <b>groups.</b> It has been shown, however, that about 25 % of RCTs published in the scientific literature randomize participants to three or more treatment groups. These studies are called 'multi-arm' trials: there may be, for instance, two or more experimental <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> with a common control group, or two control <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> such as a placebo group and a standard treatment group. A special case of multi-arm studies are factorial trials, which address two or more intervention comparisons carried out simultaneously, using four or more <b>intervention</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesCompare {{the impact}} of two {{worksite}} weight management programs, WM (education) and WM+ (education plus counseling), on health care utilization and costs. Secondarily, compare the <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> to an observational control group of obese workers. Finally, evaluate {{the impact of}} actual weight loss on these outcomes. MethodsEstimate {{the change in the}} WM and WM+ <b>intervention</b> <b>groups.</b> Using propensity score adjustment compare the two <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> with the observational control group; and compare those who lost weight with those who did not. ResultsNo {{significant differences between the two}} <b>intervention</b> <b>groups,</b> or between these <b>intervention</b> <b>groups</b> and the observational control group. Those who lost weight reduced their overall health care costs. ConclusionTo achieve weight loss and associated morbidity reductions, more extensive and intensive interventions, with more attention to motivation and compliance, are required.

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 January 2013, the Algerian Special <b>Intervention</b> <b>Group</b> began {{an assault on the}} complex using helicopter gunships and heavy weapons. Algerian commanders explained they launched the assault because the gunmen had demanded to be allowed to take the hostages abroad. The Mauritanian news agency ANI said the assault came while the terrorists were attempting to move hostages by vehicle. An Irish engineer who survived is reported as having said he saw four trucks of hostages being blown up by the Algerian forces. Hostages in two other SUVs were freed by the Algerian forces.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Army's Area Handbook for Rwanda, {{compiled}} in 1968-9, {{describes the}} security forces of Rwanda in 1969 as the 2,500 strong National Guard and the National Police, about 1,200 strong. The National Guard had been established two years before independence and had gained experience by repelling small Tutsi invasions in 1963 and 1964. It was {{under the direction of}} the Minister of Defence, Juvénal Habyarimana, who also held the function of Chief of Staff of the National Guard in mid-1969. At that time it was composed of a headquarters, an <b>intervention</b> <b>group</b> (effectively an infantry battalion), five other rifle companies, and five independent rifle platoons.|$|E
500|$|The 150-person team {{consisted}} {{mainly of}} first-person shooter veterans or longtime Rainbow Six players. Despite having prior knowledge on how {{these types of}} games work, the team decided to study historic examples of counter-terrorist operations, including 1980's London Iranian Embassy siege, 1997's Lufthansa Flight 181 hijacking, and 2002's Moscow theater hostage crisis {{to ensure that the}} portrayal of these operations was accurate and appropriate. The team also consulted counter-terrorism units, such as the National Gendarmerie <b>Intervention</b> <b>Group</b> (GIGN), for their opinions on how they would react during a hostage rescue situation. According to Xavier Marquis, the game's creative director, having a hostage rescue mission in the game helped create an immersive story. By allowing players to assume control of an operator tasked with saving innocents, it gives them an objective and a priority. They must be careful in dealing with the situation and try their best not to hurt the hostage. This further promotes teamwork between players and prompts them to plan before attacking, and further makes the game more realistic, tense and immersive. To make the game feel more realistic, the team introduced a mechanic called [...] "living hostage" [...] to govern the hostage character's behavior – e.g., coughing if there is dust in the air or shielding herself if there is nearby gunfire.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 December 1994, at Houari Boumedienne Airport, Algiers, Algeria, four {{armed men}} dressed as Algerian presidential police boarded Air France Flight 8969 bound to depart for Orly Airport, Paris at 11:15am. The men had blue uniforms with Air Algérie logos. Their {{presence}} originally {{did not cause}} alarm. Two of them began inspecting the passengers' passports while one went into the cockpit and the fourth stood guard. Claude Burgniard, a flight attendant, recalled noticing that the [...] "police" [...] were armed and one hijacker had dynamite showing; she considered this as unusual as the Algerian police were not usually armed while performing checks. The Algerian military felt suspicion when it noticed that the Air France flight had {{what appeared to be}} an unauthorised delay, so members began surrounding the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled seeing a group of Special <b>Intervention</b> <b>Group,</b> known as [...] "ninjas," [...] outside the aircraft. Kakachi recalled hearing one of the [...] "police" [...] say [...] "taghut," [...] an Arabic word for [...] "infidel", upon seeing the [...] "ninjas" [...] gathering outside the A300; therefore, she discovered that they were terrorists. The four men revealed then that they were not police, but mujahideen seeking to establish an Islamic state in Algeria. The men hijacked the aircraft because, {{as a part of the}} national airline Air France, it was a symbol of France, which they viewed as infidel foreign invaders.|$|E
