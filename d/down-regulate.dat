40|$|Mycotoxins {{produced}} by fungal species commonly contaminate livestock feedstuffs, jeopardizing {{their health and}} diminishing production. Citrinin (CIT) and ochratoxin A (OTA) are mycotoxins {{produced by}} Penicillium spp. and commonly co-occur. Both CIT and OTA can modulate immune response by inhibiting cell proliferation and differentiation, altering cell metabolism, and triggering programmed cell death. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of sublethal exposure (i. e., the concentration that inhibited cell proliferation by 25 % (IC 25)) to CIT, OTA or CIT + OTA on the bovine macrophage transcriptome. Gene expression was determined using the Affymetrix Bovine Genome Array. After 6 h of exposure to CIT, OTA or CIT + OTA, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG), respectively, was as follows: 1471 genes (822 up-regulated, 649 <b>down-regulated),</b> 5094 genes (2611 up-regulated, 2483 <b>down-regulated)</b> and 7624 genes (3984 up-regulated, 3640 <b>down-regulated).</b> Of these, 179 genes (88 up-regulated, 91 <b>down-regulated)</b> were commonly expressed between treatments. After 24 h of exposure to CIT, OTA or CIT + OTA the number of DEG, respectively, was as follows: 3230 genes (1631 up-regulated, 1599 <b>down-regulated),</b> 8558 genes (4167 up-regulated, 4391 <b>down-regulated),</b> and 10, 927 genes (6284 up-regulated, 4643 <b>down-regulated).</b> Of these, 770 genes (247 up-regulated, 523 <b>down-regulated)</b> were commonly expressed between treatments. The categorization of common biological functions and pathway analysis suggests that the IC 25 of both CIT and OTA, or their combination, induces cellular oxidative stress, a slowing of cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Collectively, these effects contribute to inhibiting bovine macrophage proliferation...|$|R
25|$|The TGF-β {{superfamily}} activates {{members of}} the SMAD family, which function as transcription factors. Specifically, the type I receptor, activated by the type II receptor, phosphorylates R-SMADs that then bind to the co-SMAD, SMAD4.

25|$|Notch {{signaling}} {{may be used}} {{to control}} the sprouting pattern of blood vessels during angiogenesis. When cells within a patent vessel are exposed to VEGF signaling, only a restricted number of them initiate the angiogenic process. Vegf is able to induce DLL4 expression. In turn, DLL4 expressing cells <b>down-regulate</b> Vegf receptors in neighboring cells through activation of Notch, thereby preventing their migration into the developing sprout. Likewise, during the sprouting process itself, the migratory behavior of connector cells must be limited to retain a patent connection to the original blood vessel.|$|E

The E5 protein of some animal papillomavirus types (mainly bovine papillomavirus type 1) functions as an oncogene primarily by activating the cell growth-promoting signaling of platelet-derived growth factor receptors. The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses associated to cancer, however, seem to activate the signal cascade initiated by epidermal growth factor upon ligand binding. HPV16 E5 and HPV2 E5 have {{also been shown to}} <b>down-regulate</b> the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, which may prevent the infected cell from being eliminated by killer T cells.|$|E

30|$|Bayesian method (Audic and Claverie, 1997) {{was applied}} to {{identify}} the miRNAs whose expression may have changed.

2500|$|Anti-oncomirs are a {{class of}} miRNAs that {{negatively}} regulate oncogenes. Let-7 is the first identified anti-oncomir that functions as a [...] "post-transcriptional-gatekeeper" [...] of certain genes that control cell growth. For example, in lung cancer some oncogenes are down-regulated by Let-7, which functions to maintain normal cell progression. Other anti-oncomirs, including miR-143 and miR-145, {{have been shown to}} <b>down-regulate</b> a wide range of human cancer cell lines. Tumor formation has been observed when miR-143 and miR-145 are down-regulated, particularly in colon and gastric cancer cells. When expressed in colon cancer cells, miR-143 and miR-145 are able to slow growth at the translational level by interfering with MAPK7, an enzyme responsible for cell growth. As an avenue of therapeutic research, chemical devitalization (i.e., artificial modification) of miR-143 and miR-145 may prove to be more effective version of their natural counterparts. Specifically, modified miRNAs may be imparted with increased resistance to nucleases that would otherwise break down the miRNAs.|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] Endogenous levels and signaling of gibberellin plant hormones such as gibberellic acid (GA) have been genetically <b>down-regulated</b> to create semi-dwarf varieties of poplar. The potential benefits of semi-dwarf stature include reduced risk of wind damage, improved stress tolerance, and improved wood quality. Despite these benefits, modification of growth traits may have consequences for non-target traits that confer defense against insect herbivores. According to the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, reductions in growth may shift allocation of carbon from growth to chemical resistance traits, thereby altering plant defense. To date, host-plant suitability and pest response have not been comprehensively evaluated in GA <b>down-regulated</b> plants. We quantified chemical resistance and nitrogen (an index of protein) in GA <b>down-regulated</b> and wild-type poplar (Populus alba × P. tremula) genotypes. We also evaluated performance of both generalist (Lymantria dispar) and specialist (Chrysomela scripta) insect pests reared on these genotypes. Our evaluation of resistance traits in four GA <b>down-regulated</b> genotypes revealed increased phenolic glycosides in one modified genotype and reduced lignin in two modified genotypes relative to the non-transgenic wild type. Nitrogen levels did not vary significantly among the experimental genotypes.
