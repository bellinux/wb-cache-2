Often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland is a depiction by the Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx undertaken for Charles I.|$|E

5|$|Camus was the {{supposed}} {{leader of a}} Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain {{at the point where}} the cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) grow as a drupe that is {{attached}} to the cashew apple, the fruit of the cashew tree. Native to northeastern Brazil, the cashew was introduced to India and East Africa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century, where they remain a major commercial crop. The nut must be roasted to remove the caustic shell oil before being consumed.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> and seventeenth centuries, {{the status}} of women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay for the Freedom to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of the lodge to supervise the work.|$|E

5|$|The Jain {{philosophy}} and literature have contributed immensely {{to the religious}} and cultural landscape of Karnataka. Islam, which had an early presence {{on the west coast}} of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. Christianity reached Karnataka <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.|$|E

5|$|Greyfriars, in Bristol, England, was a Franciscan friary. The name Greyfriars {{derived from}} the grey robes worn by the friars. It was founded at some time before 1234, within the town walls and then moved to Lewin's Mead in 1250. The site {{included}} extensive gardens surrounded by a stone wall. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century, the premises were leased to the town council in 1541, who desired to use the stone to make repairs to the town walls, and the harbour facilities. In succeeding centuries many different uses have {{been made of the}} site, which is currently occupied by an office block and part of Bristol Dental School.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the fifteenth century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{designs in}} Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century.|$|E

5|$|The {{lower portion}} of the river, from the sea to Ford, was navigable in the {{eleventh}} century {{at the time of}} the Norman conquest. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century, Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel built wharves at Ford, and improved the river channel below there, so that the town became a port. Over the 30 years from 1544, he also improved the river as far upstream as Pallingham Quay. Although the work involved a number of flash locks, which were not very successful, no tolls were charged for its use, and vessels of around 15 tons were used to carry timber. Attempts to make the river navigable up to Newbridge in the early sixteenth century were not successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} known to have been used for {{shipping}} in Roman times, when it was navigable to Bodiam and possibly further upstream. There are records of small boats reaching Etchingham during Saxon and Norman periods. Stone for building Bodiam Castle was transported along the river in the fourteenth century, and iron was shipped from Newenden or Udiam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century. A century later, an iron store was erected at Udiam. Maytham Wharf served Rolvenden, while Tenterden was served by Small Hythe.|$|E
5|$|Willy Vandersteen created {{one last}} new series in 1985: De Geuzen, a historical, humoristic comic set in Flanders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> century. Similar in theme to the thirty years older Tijl Uilenspiegel, the comic {{combined}} many of Vandersteen's passions, including {{the art of}} Pieter Brueghel the Elder. It contained his most mature, developed characters, compared to the often one-dimensional characters of his earlier series, and reached a graphical level that approached his work for Kuifje. The comics were not prepublished and were mostly created by Vandersteen alone, which ensured the quality but also decreased the publication rhythm. Only ten albums appeared, and the series ended {{with the death of}} Vandersteen.|$|E
