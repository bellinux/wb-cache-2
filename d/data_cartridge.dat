50|$|The first mission {{begins with}} Polyblank having to {{infiltrate}} a Soviet consulate to recover a <b>data</b> <b>cartridge,</b> {{the second to}} go to a sushi restaurant to steal a cowboy's artificial kidney. On the way back from the sushi restaurant, Polyblank is intercepted by agents telling him to 'hand over the wetware', but he escapes. The Director then states that Polyblank should take a holiday while they wait for things to die down. When Polyblank gets to Kai Tak Resort for his holiday, he receives a phone call telling him he has to find the syndicate man (The Editor) on site and switch briefcases with him. Polyblank succeeds, but then passes out after drinking a cocktail. Polyblank wakes up in a hotel room at night with a message telling him to come to the rear pool. In the empty rear pool, Polyblank talks to a man who tells him the resort is a simulation, and to get out he must find, kill and cook the mechanical pig. After doing this, and navigating an electric maze, Polyblank finds himself back in the subway station, only to find the Director and his secretary are cardboard cutouts. He then finds an audio message from the Editor telling him if he wants to see them again he should come to his house. Polyblank goes there, and he is told he must beat the Editor in a game of sport for the Director to be freed. Polyblank loses, and so must find prizes for the Editor. Polyblank does this, inflating the Editor's ego (which inflates the Editor physically), then he pops the Editor with a needle. Polyblank then finds the Director, where to free him he must either press a button. No matter which Polyblank presses, the Director turns into a crocodile and eats Polyblank. The credits take place in the Director's intestines, and then Polyblank is given special tablets to help him get out. The game ends after Polyblank takes the pills.|$|E

Spatio-temporal Database Management Systems (STDBMS) are able to process, manage and analyze spatio-temporal data. Spatial TAU 1 (STAU), developed in [Pel 02], provides spatio-temporal functionality to Oracle 10 g Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS). Although STAU is designed {{in a way that it}} can also be used as a pure temporal or a pure spatial system, its main functionality is to support modeling and querying of moving objects. Such a collection of data types and their corresponding operations are defined, developed and provided as a <b>data</b> <b>cartridge</b> using the extensibility interface of Oracle 10 g. This paper presents HERMES Moving <b>Data</b> <b>Cartridge</b> (HERMES-MDC), the core component of STAU system architecture. HERMES-MDC integrates two other data cartridges, namely the TAU temporal <b>data</b> <b>cartridge</b> and Oracle’s spatial <b>data</b> <b>cartridge.</b> It introduces time-varying geometries that change their position and/or extent in space and time dimension, either discretely or continuously.

40|$|To support {{current and}} {{emerging}} database applications, Object-Relational Database Management Systems (ORDBMS) provide mechanisms {{to extend the}} data storage capabilities and the functionality of the database with application-specific types and methods. Using these mechanisms, the database may contain user-defined data types, large objects (LOBs), external procedures, extensible indexing, query optimisation techniques and other features that are treated {{in the same way}} as built-in database features. The many extensibility options provided by the ORDBMS, however, raise several implementation challenges that are not always obvious. This thesis examines a few of the key challenges that arise when extending Oracle database with new functionality. To realise the potential of extensibility in Oracle, the thesis used the problem area of image retrieval as the main test domain. Current research efforts in image retrieval are lagging behind the required retrieval, but are continuously improving. As better retrieval techniques become available, it is important that they are integrated into the available database systems to facilitate improved retrieval. The thesis also reports on the practical experiences gained from integrating an extensible indexing scenario. Sample scenarios are integrated in Oracle 9 i database using the <b>data</b> <b>cartridge</b> mechanism, which allows Oracle database functionality to be extended with new functional components. The integration demonstrates how additional functionality may be effectively applied to both general and specialised domains in the database. It also reveals alternative design options that allow <b>data</b> <b>cartridge</b> developers, most of who are not database server experts, to extend the database. The thesis is concluded with some of the key observations and options that designers must consider when extending the database with new functionality. The main challenges for developers are the learning curve required to understand the <b>data</b> <b>cartridge</b> framework and the ability to adapt already developed code within the constraints of the <b>data</b> <b>cartridge</b> using the provided extensibility APls. Maximum reusability relies on making good choices for the basic functions, out of which specialised functions can be built. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 54 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|E
