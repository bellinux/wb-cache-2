We also examine factors associated with technical inefficiency variations across <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> using the Tobit regression model. Our findings indicate that about 5. 67 percent of <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> are technically efficient. Estimated technical and scale efficiency levels of <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> vary across regions and most of them exhibit decreasing returns to scale. The examined <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> improved their productivity by 22. 9 percent because of technological progress. Furthermore, supportive supervision, the average distance from <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> to households’ residence, the religion and region of residence of health extension workers, were the major determinants of technical inefficiency variations across <b>health</b> <b>posts.</b> Hence, this study confirms the existence of variations in technical and scale efficiencies of <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> across and within regions, suggesting potential for improving efficiency. We, therefore recommend that the Ethiopian <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> need to augment their scale size and improve their managerial practices to enhance their overall efficiency and productivity...|$|R

The survey {{was part of the}} 2014 Ethiopia Service Provision Assessment Plus Survey. A total of 1, 327 health facilities were assessed. The results shows that more than two out of three (69 %) facilities excluding <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> in Ethiopia offer any TB diagnostic, treatment or/and treatment follow up services. Among all <b>health</b> <b>posts,</b> 29 % of them offer any TB diagnostic services and any treatment and/or treatment follow up services.

40|$|Introduction : Strengthening {{health service}} {{delivery}} {{to the rural}} poor is an important means of redressing inequities. Meso-level managers can help enhance efficiency in the utilization of existing resources {{through the application of}} practical tools to analyze routinely collected data reflecting inputs and outputs. This study aimed to assess the efficiency and change in productivity of <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> over two years in a rural department of Guatemala. Methods : Data envelopment analysis was used to measure health posts' technical efficiency and productivity change for 2008 and 2009. Input/output data were collected from the regional health office of Alta Verapaz for 34 <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> from the 19 districts comprising the health region. Results : Technical efficiency varied widely across <b>health</b> <b>posts,</b> with mean scores of 0. 78 (SD= 0. 24) and 0. 75 (SD= 0. 21) in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Overall, productivity increased by 4 %, though 47 % of <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> experienced a decline in productivity. Results were combined on a bivariate plot to identify <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> at the high and low extremes of efficiency, which should be followed up to determine how and why their production processes are operating differently. Conclusions : Assessing efficiency using the data that are available at the meso-level can serve as a first step in strengthening performance. Further work is required to support managers in the routine application of efficiency analysis and putting the results to use in guiding efforts to improve service delivery and increase utilization...|$|R

Villagers'willingness to prepay was often linked to better service, with drugs more readily available and midwidves better trained. Still, the quality of service at village <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> can only {{be as good as}} the support they get {{from the rest of the}} health care system.

40|$|Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) is {{recommended}} for children under 5 in the Sahel and sub-Sahel. The burden in older children may justify extending the age range, as has been done effectively in Senegal. We examine costs of door-to-door SMC delivery to children up to 10 [*]years by community health workers (CHWs). We analysed incremental financial and economic costs at district level and below from a health service perspective. We examined project accounts and prospectively collected data from 405 CHWs, 46 <b>health</b> <b>posts,</b> and 4 district headquarters by introducing questionnaires in advance and completing them after each monthly implementation round. Affordability was explored by comparing financial costs of SMC to relevant existing health expenditure levels. Costs were disaggregated by administration month and by health service level. We used linear regression models to identify factors associated with cost variation between <b>health</b> <b>posts.</b> The financial cost to administer SMC to 180 [*] 000 children over one malaria season, reaching ∼ 93 % of children with all three intended courses of SMC was $ 234 [*] 549 (constant 2010 USD) or $ 0. 50 per monthly course administered. Excluding research-participation incentives, the financial cost was $ 0. 32 per resident (all ages) in the catchment area, which is 1. 2 % of Senegal's general government expenditure on health per capita. Economic costs were 18. 7 % higher than financial costs at $ 278 [*] 922 or $ 0. 59 per course administered and varied widely between <b>health</b> <b>posts,</b> from $ 0. 38 to $ 2. 74 per course administered. Substantial economies of scale across <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> were found, with the smallest <b>health</b> <b>posts</b> incurring highest average costs per monthly course administered. SMC for children up to 10 {{is likely to be}} affordable, particularly where it averts substantial curative care costs. Estimates of likely costs and cost-effectiveness of SMC in other contexts must account for variation in average costs across delivery months and <b>health</b> <b>posts...</b>|$|R
