5|$|In nuclear polyadenylation, a poly(A) tail {{is added}} to an RNA {{at the end of}} transcription. On mRNAs, the poly(A) tail protects the mRNA {{molecule}} from <b>enzymatic</b> <b>degradation</b> in the cytoplasm and aids in transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed histone downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3' end of the histone mRNA is formed.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures are shown in Figure. In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic linkages are phosphorothioate linkages, the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of nucleic acids, OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy nucleic acids by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester moiety. This property determines the use of OPS as antisense oligonucleotides in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of siRNA, at least one phosphorothioate linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and antisense strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to <b>enzymatic</b> <b>degradation</b> than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E

In this study, high-frequency ultrasound and ultrasound-assisted mechanical testing systems were used to quantitatively measure the morphologic, acoustic and mechanical properties of normal and enzymatically degraded bovine articular cartilages in vitro. A total of 40 osteochondral cartilage plugs were prepared from 20 bovine patellae (n = 20 × 2) and divided into two groups for collagenase and trypsin digestions, respectively. A high-frequency ultrasound system (center frequency: 40 MHz) was used to analyze the surface integrity (ultrasound roughness index, URI), thickness and acoustic properties of the articular cartilages before and after <b>enzymatic</b> <b>degradations.</b> Acoustic parameters included the integrated reflection coefficient (IRC) from the cartilage surface, reflection from the cartilage-bone interface (AIBbone), integrated attenuation (IA) and integrated backscatter (IBS) of the internal cartilage tissue. A newly developed ultrasound water jet indentation system was used to assess the mechanical properties of the cartilage samples. The results showed that the URI increased significantly (p 0. 05) was found after trypsin digestion. With regard to acoustic parameters, the IRC decreased significantly (p 0. 05) was found after trypsin digestion. The AIBbone demonstrated an insignificant change after collagenase digestion (p > 0. 05) but a significant decrease after trypsin digestion (p 0. 05) in the IA but a significant increase (p < 0. 05) in the IBS after both <b>enzymatic</b> <b>degradations.</b> The apparent stiffness measured by ultrasound water jet indentation suggested that articular cartilage from both groups became significantly softer (p < 0. 05) after the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>degradations.</b> A significant relationship was found to exist between the IRC and URI (p < 0. 05).

25|$|Bacteria {{living in}} a biofilm usually have {{significantly}} different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways.

40|$|International audienceThe {{discovery}} of effective ligands for DC-SIGN receptor {{is one of}} the most challenging concepts of antiviral drug design due to the importance of this C-type lectin in infection processes.

40|$|Disulfide {{bonds are}} post-translational {{modifications}} (PTMs) {{often found in}} peptides and proteins. They increase their stability towards <b>enzymatic</b> <b>degradations,</b> and provide the structure and (consequently) the activity of such folded proteins. The characterization of disulfide patterns, i. e the cysteine connectivity, is crucial to achieve a global picture of the active conformation of the protein of interest. Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD) constitutes a valuable tool to cleave the disulfide bonds in the gas phase, avoiding chemical reduction/alkylation in solution. To characterize the cysteine pairing, the present work proposes (i) to reduce by ETD {{one of the two}} disulfide bridges of model peptides, resulting in the opening of the cyclic structures, (ii) to separate the generated species by ion-mobility and, (iii) to characterize the species using CID. Results of this strategy applied to several peptides show different behaviors depending on the connectivity.
