40|$|Recently we have {{developed}} a direct View reflective CMOS active matrix (AM) polymer dispersed (PD) liquid crystal (LC) display. A 3 mu m 15 V CMOS technology for the silicon backplane was chosen for its voltage compatibility with PDLC. The main features of this display ape: 1 / 16 VGA resolution, pixel size 80 mu m, response time suited for all video applications, integrated analog scanner circuits and fully integrated row drivers, a low cost back-end module for defining the pixel pads and light shielding, and a non-vacuum PDLC <b>filling</b> <b>assembly</b> technology. A LVDS (low voltage differential signalling) link was chosen for the interfacing. Therefore a ceramic package was developed which contains the display chip plus other electronic components, including a LVDS receiver, a voltage step-up converter, a {{digital to analog converter}} and a video amplifier. This very simple interfacing (one 5 V voltage supply and 3 signal pairs) and the low power consumption (750 mW) for the whole light weight package, makes this display system compatible with personal and mobile IT applications...|$|E

40|$|Assembly joints {{of modern}} solid-rocket motor cases are usually sealed with {{conventional}} O-ring seals. The 5500 F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers of insulation and by special compounds that <b>fill</b> <b>assembly</b> split-lines in the insulation. On limited occasions, NASA has observed charring of the primary O-rings {{of the space shuttle}} solid-rocket nozzle-assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. Thus, solid-rocket motor manufacturer Thiokol approached the NASA Lewis Research Center about the possibility of applying Lewis braided-fiber preform seal as a thermal barrier to protect the O-ring seals. This thermal barrier would be placed upstream of the primary O-rings in the nozzle-to-case joints to prevent hot gases from impinging on the O-ring seals (see the following illustration). The illustration also shows joints 1 through 5, which are potential sites where the thermal barrier could be used...|$|R

40|$|Space shuttle {{solid rocket}} motor case {{assembly}} joints are sealed with conventional O-ring seals that are shielded from 5500 F combustion gases by thick layers of insulation and by special joint-fill compounds that <b>fill</b> <b>assembly</b> splitlines in the insulation. On {{a number of}} occasions, NASA has observed hot gas penetration through defects in the joint-fill compound {{of several of the}} rocket nozzle assembly joints. In the current nozzle-to-case joint, NASA has observed penetration of hot combustion gases through the joint-fill compound to the inboard wiper O-ring in one out of seven motors. Although this condition does not threaten motor safety, evidence of hot gas penetration to the wiper O-ring results in extensive reviews before resuming flight. The solid rocket motor manufacturer (Thiokol) approached the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field about the possibility of applying Glenn's braided fiber preform seal as a thermal barrier to protect the O-ring seals. Glenn and Thiokol are working to improve the nozzle-to-case joint design by implementing a more reliable J-leg design and by using a braided carbon fiber thermal barrier that would resist any hot gases that the J-leg does not block...|$|R
