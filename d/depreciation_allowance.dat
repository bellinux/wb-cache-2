40|$|The Government of Pakistan, {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries, has opted for tax holidays as an important fiscal measure to encourage rapid industrialisation in the backward areas. This concession is also supplemented by several other economic and non-economic measures including import duty, and depreciation allowances. Mintz (1990) discusses the efficacy of tax holidays {{in the presence of}} accelerated depreciation allowances concludes that tax holidays which are designed to increase capital formation may end up penalising capital formation. Mintz’s (1990) conclusion {{is based on the assumption}} that if the assets are long-lived, and the income tax system allows deductibility of accelerated depreciation but cannot be deferred, then the tax holidays, by preventing depreciation deduction in the early period may actually penalise investment during the tax holiday period. If on the other hand the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> is deferred till the end of tax holiday period, the tax system is genuinely generous and provides a real incentive for capital formation. In Pakistan the tax code are such that the firms in the tax holidays region are not allowed to claim or defer accelerated <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> but can claim normal <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> only after the expiry of tax holidays period. Whereas the firms in developed areas can claim both accelerated (25 percent) and normal depreciation allowances (10 percent) annually. Import duty concession is given for most of the underdeveloped areas and few of the developed areas. These different sets of incentives affects the cost of capital and hence investment differently. The purpose of the present paper is to see these effects by computing the cost of capital for developed and under developed areas. This will help us to examine whether the tax holidays as an incentive is effective or act as a barrier to claim other generous concession like the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} housing-related tax policy measures on macroeconomic aggregates using a dynamic general-equilibrium model. The model features borrowing and lending across heterogeneous households, financial frictions {{in the form of}} collateral constraints tied to house prices, and a rental housing market alongside owner-occupied housing. Using our model, we analyze the effects of changes in housing-related tax policy measures on the level of output, tax revenue and household debt, along with other macroeconomic aggregates. The tax policies we consider are (i) increasing property tax rates, (ii) eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, (iii) eliminating the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> for rental income, (iv) instituting taxation of imputed rental income from owner-occupied housing and (v) eliminating the property tax deduction. We find that among these fiscal tools, eliminating the mortgage interest deduction would be the most effective in raising tax revenue, and in reducing household debt, per unit of output lost. On the other hand, eliminating the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> for rental income would be the least effective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show that the scheme of {{investment}} allowances outlined below would be preferable to the present system of special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> as a means of encouraging investment by primary producers, especially investment by low-income farmers. The need for increased primary production for balance of payments reasons is assumed and increased investment is the major means of bringing this about. (1) The main determinant of the ability of farmers to invest is the excess of their disposable incomes over the costs of maintaining a required standard of life. (2) The effectiveness of the above schemes depends largely upon the extent to which they increase these surpluses. The empirical studies to date suggest that special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> have not been very effective in encouraging investment in primary production, especially by low-income farmers. (3) Furthermore, it appears that low-income farmers are not always aware of the existence of special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances.</b> (4) Their effectiveness is even further reduced by this ignorance. The article is in four sections. Section 1 contains a description of special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> and of the proposed scheme of investment allowances. In the remaining sections the impact of both schemes on investment is analysed for different situations, and the relative merits of the two schemes are assessed. Agricultural Finance,...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The issues {{featured}} {{in this study are}} the vulnerability to inflation of several depreciation methods allowed by the Internal Revenue Service (straight-line, sum-of-the years and declining balance), possible consequences when <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are based on historical cost and are not updated to price level changes, two proposals under national consideration (First Year Capital Recovery System and Capital Cost Recovery Act) to modify the way in which <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are calculated, and several suggested procedures to compensate for the loss of purchasing power in depreciation. It is concluded that under inflation and when <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are expressed in present dollars, additional taxation occurs and the original rate of return of the project decreases. To mitigate these circumstances, adjustments are needed. The magnitude of adjustments is evaluated for each of the main existing depreciation methods. It is shown that straight line method is itself an inflationary force. Numerical examples are presented. Two current proposals to modify the way in which <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are calculated are described. Under Capital Cost Recovery Act and First Year Capital Recovery System, the risk of purchasing power loss because of inflation is reduced, and the mechanics are simple. However, depreciation is still based on historical cost. As a consequence, capital recovery is not adequate, although, it is superior to the recovery provided for existing methods. It is shown that several procedures can provide for adjustments in depreciation charges according to price level changes and better recover funds invested in capital assets. However, uncertainty of future inflation rates, loss of tax revenue for the government and sometimes complicated mechanics are the primary disadvantages...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} the user costs of capital, or its shadow price, plays a {{prominent}} role in the neoclassical theory of investment and constitutes a convenient vehicle for evaluating effects of corporate taxation on private business investment. This paper presents a derivation of the user cost of capital for Austria for the period of 1976 to 2000 and discusses methodological and statistical issues involved. Special care is taken to ensure the correct representation of the major fiscal instruments of Austria's system of corporate taxation in place at that time. These instruments comprise the business tax, the corporation tax, the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> and the investment tax allowance. The spectrum of capital goods considered here encompasses machinery, vehicles, buildings and intangible capital goods. In addition, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the user cost of capital with respect to the aforementioned fiscal instruments is performed. Its results, coupled with empirical evidence on the sensitivity of private investment to user costs, provide the basis for fiscal policy evaluation in the field of corporate taxation. The basic measure used in the sensitivity analysis is semi-elasticity. The main findings can be summarised as follows: • Austria's corporate tax system is not investment-neutral, and its impact depends on the financial structure. Legislation particularly favours funding through borrowing. • A 1 percentage point increase in the business tax rate typically impacts as a 0. 34 percent decrease in investment made by the private sector. • The impact of the same increase in corporation tax is markedly weaker due to a fiscal provision that allows deducting interest payments on debt, amounting, on average, to a 0. 10 percent decrease in investment. In the benchmark case of investment funded exclusively by retained profit, the effect makes up – 0. 54 percent. • An increase in the rate of the investment tax allowance of the same magnitude induces, on average, 0. 36 percent more investment. • A 1 percentage point increase in the rate of <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> provides the strongest stimulus for private business investment, which is quantified at 2. 52 percent. All the above effects generally increase with the life span of the capital good. This certainly applies to <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance,</b> taxes {{and to a lesser extent}} to investment allowance.

40|$|The {{measures}} like Gross domestic Product (GDP) and Net Domestic Product (NDP) {{have been}} key indicators {{in the economic}} policy making since last 50 years. These measures {{are part of the}} national income accounts developed in each country, whose objective is to provide a database for macroeconomic analysis. Besides this, these indicators were for a long time used as a measure of the economic progress of a country and also as a measure of standard of living. These traditional measures of economic activity such as GDP and NDP are now recognised as inadequate as they cannot accurately measure the contribution of environment and the impact of economic activities on environment. As we all know, the environment provides a source of raw materials and energy, serves as assimilator of wastes of production and consumption, provides the context in which all human actions take place and sustains basic life-support systems. However, these traditional measures of economic activity failed to recognise the fact that economy cannot operate in a black box. As a result the national accounts allow <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> for man-made assets, while the contribution of environmental assets to economy are not valued and hence no <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> is made for these assets. Thus the depletion and degradation of environment is treated as increases in income, while this depletion and degradation can in fact have negative consequences to the economy in the future.

For example, if a more generous tax rule increases the firm’s <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance,</b> then the firm’s optimal level of debt should decrease due to its lower value as a tax shield. Therefore, firms can substitute non-debt tax shields for debt tax shields. Following this rationale, firms with {{a large amount of}} non-debt tax shields will have lower levels of debt than firms {{with a small amount of}} non-debt tax shields.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{analyzed}} whether capital depreciation allowances are good instruments for redistribution {{in the long}} run. In a simple two-class economy it is shown that {{in the short run}} and absent optimizing behaviour accelerated depreciation is good for growth and may stabilize investment in a recession but is generally bad for redistribution. The opposite holds for capital income taxes. However, when the private sector and the government act optimally the optimal <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> is maximal in the long run. This removes the accumulation distortion of capital income taxes. Furthermore, redistribution may be nonzero, depending i. a. on the social weight of those who receive redistributive transfers, the distribution of pre-tax factor incomes, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and the rate of time preference. It is argued that accelerated depreciation allowances, extensively used in the recent economic crisis, are an important indirect tool for redistribution.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the question of}} how the rules for calculating the investment tax credit and the associated rules for calculating depreciation allowances for tax purposes should be structured to assure the "appropriate" relationship between the subsidy granted to long-lived assets and that to short-lived assets. The increasing rate of tax subsidy under the investment credit favors long-lived assets by comparison with a flat-rate credit, while the neglect of the credit in calculating depreciation allowances favors short-lived assets (for which the <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> is a more important element in the cash flow). In reviewing the literature on this issue, Emil Sunley focused {{on the question of whether}} the investment credit should vary with the durability of the asset purchased. He concluded that neutrality requires a subsidy rate increasing with the useful life of the asset in a way qualitatively similar to that prescribed in present U. S. law. This paper develops Sunley's discussion through the use of simple formal models of the yield from investment. ...|$|E
