40|$|We generalize Lagos and Wright's (2005) {{framework}} for a monetary economy {{in a way}} that there exist two technologies, “high ” and “low, ” for producing the goods in a decentralized matching market. The high technology is more productive than the low technology, while the agents who use the high technology cannot commit in advance to deliver the goods. The lack of commitment makes it infeasible to produce the goods with the high technology if trade is conducted via a simple cash payment. To use the high technology, private valuable assets, e. g., residential property, should be put up as a “hostage ” à la Williamson (1983) in the transaction. In this setting, a deterioration in the balance sheet due to a financial crisis leads to the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> residential <b>assets</b> which are not yet put up as collateral, and hinder the usage of the high technology, leading to a decline in aggregate productivity. In this case, monetary injections cannot restore productivity after a financial crisis...|$|R

Experimental treatments were coarse milled barley, barley treated with 3. 5 % NaOH, barley treated with 0. 4 % formaldehyde and barley treated with 3. 5 % urea that all chemical treated barley milled coarse before feeding. NaOH Treatment reduced concentrations of Lysine and Cystine in the barley grain. All chemical treatments decreased rumen <b>disappearances</b> <b>of</b> barley CP but only NaOH and Formaldehyde treatments also decrease total AA and some <b>of</b> the AA <b>disappearances</b> in the rumen. All chemical treatments increased DM, OM, CP, starch, NDF, ADF and hemicellulose <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> barley in the PAT.
