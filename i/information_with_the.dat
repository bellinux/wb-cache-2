5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in the conference and shared this <b>information</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation to reconsider the necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list of priorities was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely to do both, but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing the Soviets to capture territory beyond that which had been promised to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to that which had occurred in Germany.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax {{question}} Arthur Leigh Allen, {{a suspect}} in the Vallejo case. Allen behaves suspiciously during the interview. They ask to see his watch and notice that he wears a Zodiac brand wristwatch which has the same logo used by the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming increasingly paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares <b>information</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Riverside Police Department, angering both Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is bothered when Graysmith shows up at the theater where Toschi is watching a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on the Zodiac case, with his wife.|$|E

5|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Thomson noted {{a continued}} media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson {{said he was}} contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched <b>information</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> common myths he advised them to avoid and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide. He noted when Jackson's FBI file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence. He noted how Gene Simmons' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than his interview with Jackson's long-time guitarist, Jennifer Batten, who rebutted Simmons' claims.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March, Australia {{took control}} for {{co-ordinating}} search, rescue, and recovery operations. For the following six weeks, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and ATSB worked {{to determine the}} search area, correlating <b>information</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> JIT and other government and academic sources, while the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) coordinated the search efforts. Following the fourth phase of the search, the ATSB took responsibility for defining the search area. In May, the search strategy working group was established by the ATSB to determine the most likely position on the aircraft at the 00:19 UTC (08:19 MYT) satellite transmission. The group included aircraft and satellite experts from: Air Accidents Investigation Branch (UK), Boeing (US), Defence Science and Technology Group (Australia), Department of Civil Aviation (Malaysia), Inmarsat (UK), National Transportation Safety Board (US), and Thales (UK).|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest. When he learned of the invasion the warden, Charles Uwihoreye, telephoned the government in Kigali, to request instructions. He spoke to Colonel Elie Sagatwa, one of the akazu, who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison, to avoid escape and defections during the fighting, and to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret <b>information</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> RPF. Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him to repeat the order, having confirmed it with the president. Eventually the RPF stormed the buildings, and the prisoners were saved. Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including Theoneste Lizinde, a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.|$|E

5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of <b>information</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the <b>information</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
