40|$|A brief {{report is}} given of the 4 th Network for Animal Health and Welfare in Organic Agriculture (NAWHOA) {{workshop}} at Wageningen in the Netherlands, held in March 2001. The workshop focussed on breeding (especially dairy, pigs and poultry) and feeding, {{as opposed to}} yield and productivity, {{with the emphasis on}} food quality. Feeding was discussed from two angles: <b>feeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>production,</b> and feeding to protect the animal from disease or parasitic infection. A vision of the future was described, in which higher prices are gained for fewer animals, better housed and with a regional approach to breeding, processing and marketing. ...|$|E

For such firms, it explores the economic relationship between stocking rates, drought possibilities and fodder reserves. (1) The analysis shows that an optimal stocking rate can be ascertained {{for any given}} pattern of drought incidence. Using Queensland data, an empirical application covering a range of fodder, livestock and livestock product prices is presented. Nothing is said of the macro aspects of fodder storage for drought relief; nor of the optimum level of livestock population on an aggregate basis. Likewise, the analytics of supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>production</b> [...] as distinct from drought feeding for survival [...] are not explored on either a micro or a macro basis. Still, the method of analysis used here is not without relevance to all these topics. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

Volume 2. <b>Feeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>production.</b> (Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Tjele, Animal Husbandry (Husdyrbrug) Report, 54), Strudsholm, F. Sjersen, K. Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Tjele, 295 - 321 It is emphasised that the feeding regime of animals in the dry period, particularly near the time of parturition, is intended {{to prepare them for}} the coming lactation. The length of the dry period, the body reserves (fat depots), and parity are influencing factors. Strategic planning of feeding aims to maintain body reserves {{at the end of the}} dry period when feed intake usually decreases; feed with a high energy value is preferable. Increasing feeding at this stage also prepares the rumen for the greater feed intake that is desirable for good milk production; the physiological basis for this is discussed. Feeding in the dry period also aims to increase milk protein production and build up reserves of minerals, especially calcium. Non peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Cultured marine aquatic {{species are}} {{predominantly}} carnivorous. Major {{species in the}} region are seabass, grouper, snapper, tiger shrimp, mangrove crab and abalone. These species, except for abalone, require a high level of dietary protein mostly supplied by marine sources such as fish meal. Global production of marine fish and marine shrimps showed a 3 - 4 fold increase from 1995 to 2010. For the same period, the usage of commercial <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>production</b> of marine fish and shrimps increased while the fish meal portion in the formulation decreased. This is indicative of fish meal being substituted with alternative sources in commercial feed production, and to some extent the substitution of marine oil which particularly improved the FCR for the marine fish production from 2. 0 to 1. 9 and for marine shrimps from 2. 0 to 1. 6. Plant products that include cereal grains, legumes and oilseeds have the most potential among the alternative ingredients for use in aquafeed. The use of these resources for high value marine species is limited due to a variety of anti-nutritional substances they contain. Removal of these substances by processing techniques has improved utilization but with added cost. Hence, fish meal is still the primary source of protein for marine carnivores and its substitution with higher amounts of alternative plant proteins may be difficult compared with lower levels of replacements. The Asian region has accounted for the more than 50 % of the total global aquaculture production in 2012 with indications of increased utilization of alternative protein sources in commercial <b>feed</b> <b>production.</b> <b>For</b> the major marine species in the region the increasing trend of plant protein usage with the targeted levels of substitution of fish meal with plant protein sources should be sustainable...|$|R

40|$|Interest {{in the use}} of fungal direct-fed microbials in {{ruminant}} nutrition is considerable. The ban {{of antibiotic}} growth promoters in <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>production</b> of animal foods has increased interest in evaluating the effect of yeast cultures (YC) on the gastrointestinal ecosystem, rumen microbial populations and function. The effects of specific YC preparations on the rumen environment and performance of ruminants have been well documented, and has generated considerable scientific interest over the last two decades. The precise mode of action by which YC, which are mostly derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, improve livestock performance has attracted the attention of a number of researchers in the world. It is clear from these research efforts that YC supplements can beneficially modify microbial activities, fermentative and digestive functions in the rumen. The research has demonstrated that viable YC preparations can stimulate specific groups of beneficial bacteria in the rumen, and has provided mechanistic models that can explain their effects on animal performance. The effects of YC on animal productivity are strain-dependant. So, all YC preparations are not equivalent in efficiency. This aspect opens a new field of research for new strains, each being more specialized in its use. The goal of many of these research activities has been to define the application and production strategies that can optimize anima...|$|R

We used life cycle assessment to evaluate the impact of local protein feed production on land use and greenhouse gas emissions, compared {{with the use of}} imported protein <b>feed,</b> <b>for</b> pig meat and dairy milk produced in Sweden. Our results showed that local production reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4. 5 % and 12 %, respectively, for pigs and dairy cows. Land use <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> <b>production</b> in Sweden increased by 11 % for pigs and 25 % for dairy cows, but total land use decreased <b>for</b> pig <b>production</b> and increased <b>for</b> dairy milk <b>production.</b> Increased protein feed cultivation in Sweden decreased inputs needed <b>for</b> animal <b>production</b> and improved some ecological processes (e. g. nutrient recycling) of the farm systems. However, the differences in results between scenarios are relatively small and influenced to an extent by methodological choices such as co-product allocation. Moreover, it was difficult to assess the contribution of greenhouse emissions from land use change. The available accounting methods we applied did not adequately account for the potential land use changes and in some cases provided conflicting results. We conclude that local protein feed production presents an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but at a cost of increasing land occupation in Sweden <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R
