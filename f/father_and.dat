40|$|Shared {{decision}} making between {{children and parents}} is required in orthodontics. This study compared agreement among mothers, <b>fathers,</b> <b>and</b> children regarding the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of children. A sample of 71 child patients (41 girls and 30 boys) aged 12. 6 years with an orthodontic treatment need, together with both their parents completed components of the child OHRQoL measure. Agreement among children, mothers, <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> {{was derived from the}} 31 analogous questions and assessed using comparison and correlation analyses. Comparison analyses identified significant differences between mother's and children's reports <b>and</b> between <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports. The magnitude of the difference between mother's and children's reports, <b>and</b> between <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports could best be described as moderate (standard difference > 0. 2). In addition, absolute differences in scores constituted between 12 and 18 per cent of domain and overall scores for both mother's <b>and</b> children's, <b>and</b> <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports. Correlation analysis, at the individual family unit level, showed that agreement between mothers and children, <b>and</b> between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> children was fair [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) < 0. 04]. Neither mothers nor fathers know their child's oral health status very well, as there was significant disagreement between mothers', fathers', and children's perceptions. The disagreement between mothers <b>and</b> children, <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> children was similar. While at the group level, mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> tended to agree on perception of their children's oral health status, at an individual family unit level they did not. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
