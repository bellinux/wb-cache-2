2500|$|... "I {{really want}} to fight Prince Naseem..." [...] Mayweather continued, [...] "but {{hopefully}} I can face the winner of Casamayor (vs.) Freitas". Although neither fight materialised, Mayweather's opponent Diego Corrales would later hand Freitas (the winner of the Casamayor vs. Freitas fight) his first professional defeat and defeat Casamayor via controversial decision in a rematch of their first bout. Afterwards, Bob Arum was ecstatic about his new star. [...] "Better than Sugar Ray Leonard", he asserted. [...] "And <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> at those press conferences...?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Among those {{referenced}} in {{the song}} was fellow Queensbridge-based rapper Cormega ("And night time is more trife than ever/What up with Cormega, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> are y'all together?"). Cormega's rapping career had been put on hold due to his incarceration during the early 1990s, before his release in 1995. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastizes a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin {{to tell me that}} he liked my style ... Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Music writer Susan Weinstein wrote that [...] "the literary technique Nas most strongly excels in is the one that would seem to be most pedestrian: rhyme", and cited [...] "One Love" [...] as the first display of Nas's [...] "formal inventiveness".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well he may hide it!' Mrs Gamp replied. 'He's good call to {{be ashamed}} of himself. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> a-jerking of her wrist, then?' ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him?</b> He {{is coming}} now.|$|R
6000|$|Capt. H. (Goes on chuckling; speaks cautiously). Is he gone yet, that {{information}} fellow? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> anywhere, my dear? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My gracious! That fellow {{will surely}} be drowned!" [...] gasped Sam, on {{recovering}} from the shock. [...] "Tom, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> anywhere?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed Little Bill, {{making his}} eyes and mouth into three round O's. [...] "How d'ye know that? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|FROME. Oh, yes, {{the morning}} of the arrest. Well, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> at all between the Friday and that morning? [RUTH nods] What was his manner then? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have seen}} him! And you only arrived in France last night. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him?</b> What has {{happened}} to him?' She gripped me by the wrist in her anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't envy Sir Charles Mirabel his father-in-law," [...] thought Pendennis. [...] "And how is my old friend, Mr. Bows, Captain? Have you {{any news}} of <b>him,</b> and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> still?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here, my dear. You {{can stand}} upon the door-step,' said Mould, 'and {{take a look}} at him. Ha! There he is. Where's my glass? Oh! all right. I've got it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> my dear?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Who {{came first}} - he or his brother? vs. Whom <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> - <b>him</b> or his brother? ...|$|R
6000|$|FIRST JUDGE: This {{sounds as}} bad as truth. Guards, there, Lead forth the prisoner! [ENTER LUCRETIA, BEATRICE AND GIACOMO, GUARDED.] Look upon this man; [...] 20 When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> last? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] {{cried the}} officer, turning upon Tara, [...] "you {{were the last}} to see E-Med the dwar. Answer me now and answer me truthfully. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> leave this room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw the man," [...] he said,--"the prisoner. I {{was outside}} the Duomo with Lorenzo Tornabuoni when he ran in. He had escaped from a French soldier. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> when you came out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no;--if the Duke likes it. I had an {{idea that}} the Duke would not like the display of the thing. There he is. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in the corner with his brother duke? He doesn't {{look as if he}} were happy; does he? No one would think he was the master of {{everything}} here. He has got himself hidden almost behind the screen. I'm sure he doesn't like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What game {{under the}} sun is he playing?" [...] He {{signified}} the next moment that his allusion was not to the fat gentleman immersed in dominoes on whom his eyes had begun by resting, but to their host of the previous hour, as to whom, there on the velvet bench, with a final collapse of all consistency, he treated himself to the comfort of indiscretion. [...] "Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> come out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{always the}} way with that sort of chap. He keeps on wriggling out of small rows till {{he thinks he can}} do {{anything}} he likes without being dropped on, {{and then all of a}} sudden he finds himself up to the eyebrows in a record smash. I don't say young Jackson will land himself like that. All I say is that he's just the sort who does. He's asking for trouble. Besides, who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> about with all the time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gone!" [...] ejaculated Copple. [...] "An' {{we never}} fetched him!... He ain't hurt. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> pile down an' roll off that slope?... Let's see. I got twenty-three shots at him. How many had you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's {{the grandest}} luck a new camp ever struck. Say, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an eye! He just can't {{overlook}} a clue--'tain't in him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wasn't old Foxy pleased? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> get pink {{behind the}} ears?" [...] said Beetle. [...] "It {{was an awful}} score for him. Didn't we back him up beautifully? Let's go down to Keyte's and get some cocoa and sassingers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You 'll {{know what}} to <b>do</b> when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> better than I can tell you," [...] {{answered}} Polly, readily yielding, for she knew they considered her [...] "quite one of the family," [...] as Tom said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{letters from}} Don John," [...] he wrote, [...] "more insistent {{than ever in}} their tone. He demands the instant {{dispatch}} of money and Escovedo. I have been thinking, and this letter confirms my every fear. I have cause to apprehend some stroke that may disturb the public peace and ruin Don John himself if he is allowed to retain Escovedo any longer in his service. I am writing to Don John that I will {{see to it that}} Escovedo is promptly dispatched as he requests. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> dispatched, then, in precise accordance with his deserts, and this at once, before the villain kills us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I like that? So {{you keep}} {{an account of}} my good and bad marks in Brooke's face, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> I <b>see</b> <b>him</b> bow and smile as he passes your window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a dead}} silence. [...] "And pray where <b>did</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> {{and what}} do you know about his hands?" [...] asked Mrs. Randolph, in her most {{desiccated}} voice. [...] "Or has the major already presented you to him? I shouldn't be surprised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, grandma, did {{you wear}} it? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him?</b> Do {{tell us all}} about it, {{and that will be the}} best of the whole," [...] cried Polly, who loved history, and knew a good deal about the gallant Frenchman and his brave life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I do," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "I {{remember}} him very well, and I always thought {{him to be}} a remarkably nice man! But where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> and what in the world did he tell you to throw you into such a flurry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did he say? Well, I don't exactly {{remember}} his words; {{but he made}} me understand that your marriage with Sir Peregrine would make him very unhappy. He did indeed. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> yourself, and talk to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tender-hearted!' echoed Dennis. 'Tender-hearted! Look at this man. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> call THIS constitootional? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> {{shot through}} and through instead of being worked off like a Briton? Damme, if I know which party to side with. You're {{as bad as the}} other. What's to become of the country if the {{military}} power's to go a superseding the ciwilians in this way? Where's this poor feller-creetur's rights as a citizen, that he didn't have ME in his last moments! I was here. I was willing. I was ready. These are nice times, brother, to have the dead crying out against us in this way, and sleep comfortably in our beds arterwards; wery nice!' ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{had walked}} on, {{while we were}} speaking, to {{a part of the}} park through which there flowed a rivulet of clear water. On the further bank, the open ground led down into a wooded valley. On our side of the stream rose a thick {{plantation}} of fir-trees intersected by a winding path. Captain Stanwick stopped as we reached the place. His eyes rested, in the darkening twilight, on the narrow space pierced by the path among the trees. On a sudden he lifted his right hand, with the same cry of pain which we had heard before; with his left hand he took Miss Laroche by the arm. [...] "There!" [...] he said. [...] "Look where I look! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, it's him; {{and you saw}} {{his feet}} was in the water. They were dry when the grieve left me. Mr. Dishart, the ground he is on is being washed awa bit by bit. I tell you, the flood's greedy for him, and it'll hae him---Look, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I mean Julius Sneezer," [...] {{insisted the}} Sea Serpent. [...] "That was his real name--Sneezer. They called him Caesar {{sometimes}} {{just because he}} took everything he could lay hands on. I ought to know, because I saw {{him when he was}} alive. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> when he was alive, Cap'n Bill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, mother. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> jump up when Alice ended her oration? He'd {{have gone}} to her if I hadn't held him back. I don't wonder he was pleased and proud. I spoilt my gloves clapping, and quite forgot my dislike of seeing women on platforms, she was so earnest and {{unconscious}} and sweet after the first moment.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. He may crawl down somewhere towards tea-time. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>see</b> <b>him?</b> That's what <b>you</b> came for, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And he, another time: [...] "What the deuce <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> in <b>him</b> anyway? I {{know he had}} money. But you and I were {{managing}} {{to get along with}} some sort of comfort. My practice was averaging around forty thousand a year then--I went over the books afterward. Palaces and steam yachts were about all that was denied you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Psychologically," [...] Marcia Hannaway observed, [...] "his present {{action is}} interesting. If {{he had shot}} you or me in his first fit of passionate resentment, {{everything}} {{would have been in}} order, but to leave the country, nurse a sullen feeling of revenge for years, and then come back, seems curious. What shall <b>you</b> <b>do</b> when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> sitting in his garden?" ...|$|R
