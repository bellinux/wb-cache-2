5|$|Koch {{returned}} to the East Indies operation, and on 30 January 1942, when in command of Corio, he was shot down off Timor by seven Japanese Zeros whilst carrying out a relief flight to Surabaya, Dutch East Indies. Of the eighteen people on board, five survived. Koch was wounded by gunfire in the left leg and left arm, and broke his right leg in the subsequent crash landing. Despite the injuries, he swam about five miles to the shore where he was looked after by local people, until the Dutch Navy found the survivors some days later, and rescued them with a Dornier <b>flying</b> <b>boat.</b> Some three weeks later, he was in Darwin hospital {{on the day of}} the first Japanese raid on Darwin. By good fortune, the QEA <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> Camilla survived the raid, and Koch was flown to Sydney for treatment.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 1962, a PBY Catalina <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> (registration CF-IHA) crashed during {{landing at}} Nuuk Airport. The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} a mechanical malfunction in the nose wheel doors preventing them from closing during landing on water, resulting in the aircraft sinking. The accident killed 15 of the 21 people on board.|$|E
5|$|The US was not {{the only}} country to {{consider}} the hydroski. The Saunders-Roe company of the United Kingdom, which had already built an experimental <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> jet fighter, first flying in 1947 the SR.A/1, tendered a design for a ski-equipped fighter, but little came of it.|$|E
40|$|This {{photograph}} is {{of one of}} Weldon B. Cooke's <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> outside the Davis Boat Works in Sandusky, Ohio. It was necessary to craft a water-tight fuselage as <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> were designed to take off and land on water. Fuselages of <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> so resembled the hulls of boats that workers and aviators often referred to them as hulls...|$|R
50|$|He {{approached}} Consolidated {{to license}} {{it for their}} large <b>flying</b> <b>boats.</b> The ability to generate lift at low angles of attack made it particularly interesting for use in <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> as it would reduce the need to pull up the nose for takeoff and landing, which was often limited in <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> due {{to the way they}} interacted with the water.|$|R
50|$|Prior to World War II, <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> used Hamilton Reach {{as their}} base. However, {{the level of}} river traffic {{and the lack of}} night {{lighting}} resulted in the <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> relocating to Redland Bay.|$|R
5|$|U-607 was sunk, {{while in}} convoy {{with two other}} U-boats, in the Bay of Biscay on 13 July 1943 by a Sunderland <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> of 228 Squadron Royal Air Force, {{assisted}} by a Halifax of 58 Squadron. Oberleutnant Jeschonnek and six of his crew were taken prisoner; the rest perished.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1921, Pisa was {{reclassified}} from a second-class battleship to {{a coastal}} battleship {{and became a}} training ship. In 1925 she was modified to operate a Macchi M.7 <b>flying</b> <b>boat.</b> From 1925 to 1930, the ship was used to train naval cadets and lieutenants. Pisa was stricken on 28 April 1937 and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August 1941, Mackay {{handed over}} {{command of the}} 6th Division to Herring. Mackay {{departed}} Cairo for Australia by <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> on 22 August. En route, he stopped in Singapore to confer with Bennett, now {{the commander of the}} 8th Division, which was based there, and had dinner at the Raffles Hotel with his son, Lieutenant Iven Mackay, an officer with the 8th Division's 2/18th Infantry Battalion.|$|E
50|$|With {{the closure}} of the {{dockyard}} in 1926, the year of the General Strike, unemployment was high through the Great Depression until 1931 when No. 210 Squadron RAF arrived equipped with Southampton II <b>flying</b> <b>boats.</b> For almost 30 years the Royal Air Force was based at Pembroke Dock. During 1943, when home to the Sunderland <b>flying</b> <b>boats,</b> it was the largest operational base for <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> in the world.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, four Supermarine Southampton <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> of the RAF Far East flight {{arrived in}} Melbourne, Australia. The flight was {{considered}} proof that <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> had evolved {{to become a}} reliable means of long-distance transport.|$|R
50|$|On 4 May 1948 BOAC {{introduced}} Short Solent <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> on the UK (Southampton) to South Africa (Vaaldam) service. The {{small village}} of Deneysville {{was used as}} a stop-over point by the old BOAC <b>flying</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
5|$|Burston {{departed}} for the Middle East by Qantas <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> along with Blamey and Brigadier Sydney Rowell on 12 June 1940, the party wearing civilian clothes {{as they were}} travelling through neutral countries. In November, Blamey organised a Headquarters, AIF in the Middle East and appointed Burston as its Director of Medical Services (DMS). The Australian Government had appointed Major General Rupert Downes to this post, but it deferred to Blamey. Burston was promoted to Major General on 16 February 1941.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these developments, the King immediately orders the conspirators arrested and mobilizes the army at the Bordurian border, which discourages the pending invasion. In thanks, the king makes Tintin a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican; the first foreigner to receive the honour. Later, Tintin discovers that the imposter was Alembick's twin brother, when the police arrest Müsstler and rescue Professor Alembick. Ultimately, he and the Thompsons return home by <b>flying</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the New England Air Museum, {{located at}} Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, a Sikorsky S-39 <b>Flying</b> <b>Boat</b> {{can be found}} that was used during World War II for rescuing pilots of subchasers that had gone down. A local artist painted an oil {{painting}} of the aircraft, now prominently displayed next {{to it in the}} exhibit. Photos of the exhibit, the unveiling ceremony, and the oil painting {{can be found at the}} Wing Headquarters building.|$|E
50|$|The German {{aircraft}} {{manufacturing company}} Hansa-Brandenburg built <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> {{starting with the}} model Hansa-Brandenburg GW in 1916. The Austro-Hungarian firm, Lohner-Werke began building <b>flying</b> <b>boats,</b> starting with the Lohner E in 1914 and the later (1915) influential Lohner L version.|$|R
5000|$|Short Brothers {{continued}} to build seaplanes on the Esplanade at Rochester supplying the growing market for <b>flying</b> <b>boats.</b> The name [...] "Empire" [...] and [...] "Sunderland" [...] <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> will always remain {{one of the}} important contribution made by Medway to British Aviation.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s, Martin built <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> for the U.S. Navy, and the {{innovative}} Martin B-10 bomber for the Army. The Martin Company also produced the noted China Clipper <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> used by Pan American Airways for its transpacific San Francisco to the Philippines route.|$|R
5|$|Tadayoshi Koga, a 19-year-old flight {{petty officer}} first class, was {{launched}} from the Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō {{as part of}} the June 4 raid. Koga was part of a three-plane section; his wingmen were Chief Petty Officer Makoto Endo and Petty Officer Tsuguo Shikada. Koga and his comrades attacked Dutch Harbor, shooting down an American PBY-5A Catalina <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> piloted by Bud Mitchell and strafing its survivors in the water. In the process, Koga's plane (serial number 4593) was damaged by small arms fire.|$|E
5|$|Within days, Simpson {{was heading}} east again, taking a <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> to Batavia, where {{he joined the}} advance party of the I Corps, which was being sent from the Middle East to the Dutch East Indies to counter the Japanese threat. He met there with the local {{authorities}} regarding signals arrangements for the defence of Java. These were soon well in hand, but the tactical situation rapidly deteriorated {{to the extent that}} the I Corps was ordered to leave Java on 21 February 1942. Simpson departed on the troop ship Orcades, which arrived in Adelaide on 14 March.|$|E
5|$|German {{submarines}} {{and surface}} warships sortied {{to attack the}} Allied invasion fleet, and the Australian members of Coastal Command participated in attacks on these vessels. The two RAAF <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> squadrons operated intensively throughout June, but did not sink any German ships or submarines. The aircrew {{of two of the}} British B-24 Liberators that sank German submarines during this period included Australian personnel, however, and Australians were on board several of the other RAF aircraft flying anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols. In addition, No.455 Squadron took part in several attacks on E-boats operating near Normandy as well as German shipping travelling through the English Channel. No.460 Squadron and Australians in other Bomber Command units also participated in raids on E-Boat bases at Le Havre and Boulogne on the nights of 14/15 June and 15/16 June respectively.|$|E

5|$|In February 1940, the War Cabinet {{decided to}} form a second AIF division, the 7th Division, and group the 6th and 7th Divisions {{together}} as I Corps, with Blamey as its commander. On Blamey's recommendation, Major General Iven Mackay was appointed to succeed him {{in command of the}} 6th Division, while Lieutenant General John Lavarack, a PMF officer, assumed command of the 7th Division. Blamey took Rowell with him as his corps chief of staff, and picked Major General Henry Wynter as his administrative officer. Blamey flew to Palestine on a Qantas <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> in June 1940. He refused to allow his troops to perform police duties in Palestine, and established warm relations with the Jewish community there, becoming a frequent guest in their homes.|$|E
5|$|In July 1935, Alexander {{married a}} physicist, Norman Alexander, from New Zealand. When her husband took {{the post of}} Professor of Physics at Raffles College in Singapore, Elizabeth Alexander began a study into the effects of {{weathering}} in the tropics. Whilst in Singapore, the couple had three children, William in 1937, Mary in 1939 and Bernice in 1941. On 4 January 1942, under Navy orders to take her children to safety and return with specialist equipment being made in Australia, Dr. Alexander and her children were evacuated to New Zealand by a Short S23 C <b>flying</b> <b>boat.</b> After the Fall of Singapore on 15 February she was stranded in New Zealand with no news of her husband for six months, then the inaccurate information that he was dead.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring flew to Sicily {{himself on}} 12 July {{to survey the}} {{situation}} and decided that {{no more than a}} delaying action was possible and that the island would eventually have to be evacuated. Nonetheless, he intended to fight on and he reinforced Sicily with the 29th Panzergrenadier Division on 15 July. Kesselring returned to Sicily by <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> on 16 July to give the senior German commander, General der Panzertruppe Hans-Valentin Hube, his instructions. Unable to provide much more in the way of air support, Kesselring gave Hube command of the heavy flak units on the island, although this was contrary to Luftwaffe doctrine. In all, Kesselring managed to delay the Allies in Sicily for another month and the Allied conquest of the Sicily was not complete until 17 August.|$|E

5|$|On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard {{the primary}} Axis supply port of Tripoli and was {{attacked}} {{by a pair of}} torpedo-carrying SM.79s from Rhodes. They were intercepted by a pair of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it crash-landed back at its base, although one Fulmar was also forced to crash-land aboard Formidable. The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and a pair of Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 <b>flying</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found {{on two of the}} engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure which would require an engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese planes were seen making {{reconnaissance}} flights over Miri. The Brooke government decided on a complete destruction of oilfields and airfields in Miri. Shell company officials received orders {{to carry out the}} Denial Scheme on 8 December 1941. In the evening on the same day, the task was completed. All producing oil wells were sealed up with vital equipment and machinery dismantled and shipped off to Singapore. Skilled workers and important company papers also went along with the equipment and sent to Singapore. The Punjab Regiment and several officials were sent to guard Kuching. On 16 December 1941, 9 days after the Pearl Harbor bombing, Japanese troops consisting of 10,000 men landed on Tanjung Lobang Beach, Miri without much resistance. However, on 19 December 1941, a Dutch <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> from Tarakan Island attacked the Japanese destroyer Shinonome (under the command of Hiroshi Sasagawa) off Miri. The ship was sunk along with the entire crew of 228. Another <b>flying</b> <b>boat</b> X-33 also damaged a Japanese transport ship. After the fall of Singapore on 15 January 1942, skilled workers that went into hiding with their equipment were sent back to Miri by the Japanese. They were immediately put to work for Japanese oil supply service company named Nen Ryo Hai Kyu. Much of the Japanese oil drilling and refinery equipment was portable. A total of 0.75 million barrels were produced during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945.|$|E
5|$|The I-351-class {{submarines}} {{were ordered}} under the 5th Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942 to support IJN <b>flying</b> <b>boats</b> {{in areas where}} there were no shore facilities and seaplane tenders could not operate.
