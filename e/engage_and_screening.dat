The cavalry alone required 3,379 horses, and with such {{a small number of}} ships available the Heavy Brigade would be part of a second wave – until it arrived, the Light Brigade would be relied on as the sole unit of cavalry. The force departed for the Crimea on 2 September 1854, and began landing at Kalamita Bay, 35 miles north of Sevastopol itself. Airey had the light cavalry <b>engage</b> in reconnaissance <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> {{while the rest of the}} force moved off the transports, and they were fully ashore by the 18th.

40|$|StretchTools {{is a set}} {{of tools}} for {{manipulating}} the screen space. The user interface uses the metaphor of stretching a rubber sheet. The basic tool in StretchTools is the handle. A handle is an one-dimensional rigid object of a fixed orientation, either horizontal or vertical. As a handle is placed on the <b>screen,</b> <b>engaged,</b> <b>and</b> pulled, the <b>screen</b> expands {{on one side of the}} handle and contracts on the other side. Graphical objects on the screen transforms accordingly. The other type of basic tool is the clamp. Clamps are used to impose constraints on the movement of handles by joining handles with one another. In this paper, we show how StretchTools can be used to visualize large structures on small screens by selectively enlarging single or multiple regions of the screen at a time. Transformations achieved by StretchTools have a number of properties that alleviate the problem of user-disorientation due to the introduced distortion...|$|R

Two days later French warships joined the formation; and on 15 August, the force arrived off the Delta assault {{area in the}} Baie de Bougnon. From 04:30 to 06:41, Rodman covered the minesweeping craft clearing the channels to the beaches. Two hours of shore bombardment followed. She then shifted to call fire support duties, which, with antiaircraft screening duties, she continued until retiring to Palermo on 17 August.

40|$|Latinos {{living in}} the USA account for {{one third of the}} uninsured {{population}} and face numerous cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers to accessing healthcare services. Community health fairs have developed to address the unmet need for no- and low-cost services that target prevention and education among underserved communities. The current research describes an ongoing effort in a community in Southern California and examines the barriers to health care among participants registering to receive free breast health screenings, one of the major services offered at a 2010 health fair. A total of 186 adult Latina women completed a brief questionnaire assessing their healthcare utilization and self-reported barriers to <b>engaging</b> in preventive <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> services. Approximately two thirds of the participants reported never receiving or having more than 2 years passing since receiving a preventive health check-up. Participants identified cost (64. 5 %) and knowledge of locations for services (52. 3 %) as the primary barriers to engaging in routine healthcare services. Engaging with health professionals represents a leading way in which adults obtain health information; health fairs offering cancer health screenings represent a culturally appropriate venue for increased cancer health equity. Implications of the current research for future health fairs and their role in community cancer education are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Interpersonal {{violence}} has a profoundly {{negative impact on}} individuals and our society. Health care providers are {{in a unique position}} to identify interpersonal violence, support survivors, and to contribute to violence prevention. The purpose of this article is to describe the nature, scope, and impact of interpersonal violence, its subsequent trauma on individuals, families, and society, and to delineate how providers can apply trauma-sensitive practice. The authors provide definitions, examples and prevalence rates and review theories of violence and violence prevention. They describe how to create a trauma-sensitive practice by being aware of the trauma that accompanies violence, the barriers to violence prevention, and how to intervene with patients about violence. Providers are urged to adopt universal screening practices, educate themselves on the nature of interpersonal violence <b>and</b> <b>engage</b> in <b>screening,</b> education, collaboration, <b>and</b> social justice activities to reduce interpersonal violence. Resources are provided to assist health care organizations, providers, and patients in addressing interpersonal violence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Screening {{instruments}} for mental disorders {{need to be}} short, <b>engaging,</b> <b>and</b> valid. Current <b>screening</b> instruments are usually questionnaire-based and may be opaque to the user. A prototype approach where individuals identify {{with a description of}} an individual with typical symptoms of depression, anxiety, social phobia or panic may be a shorter, faster and more acceptable method for screening. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the accuracy of four new prototype screeners for predicting depression and anxiety disorders and to compare their performance with existing scales. Methods Short and ultra-short prototypes were developed for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder (PD) and Social Phobia (SP). Prototypes were compared to typical short <b>and</b> ultra-short self-report <b>screening</b> scales, such as the Centre for Epidemiology Scale, CES-D and the GAD- 7, and their short forms. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) version 6 1 was used as the gold standard for obtaining clinical criteria through a telephone interview. From a population sample, 225 individuals who endorsed a prototype and 101 who did not were administered the MINI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the short and ultra short prototypes and for the short <b>and</b> ultra short <b>screening</b> scales. Results The study found that the rates of endorsement of the prototypes were commensurate with prevalence estimates. The short-form and ultra short scales outperformed the short and ultra short prototypes for every disorder except GAD, where the GAD prototype outperformed the GAD 7. Conclusions The findings suggest that people may be able to self-identify generalised anxiety more accurately than depression based on a description of a prototypical case. However, levels of identification were lower than expected. Considerable benefits from this method of screening may ensue if our prototypes can be improved for Major Depressive Disorder, Social Phobia and Panic Disorder. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{engaging}} discussion {{followed the}} presentation of the paper; questions were posed by those in attendance. I received positive feedback informally, from individuals attending the conference after {{the presentation of}} the paper. Working with families is fraught with complexity, including dealing with issues such as intimate partner violence. Faculty teaching within a family-newborn course with undergraduate nursing students sought innovative strategies to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> support students to broach this difficult topic with families in acute care and community settings. Faculty noted that students in clinical experiences reported that nurses were not accurately assessing <b>and</b> consistently <b>screening</b> for intimate partner violence. However, assessing <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> for violence is part of the role of all nurses and falls within the standards of practice for community health nurses. The purpose of this presentation is to share several innovative teaching strategies undertaken by faculty working with undergraduate nursing students to explore and examine intimate partner violence. Faculty employed teaching strategies integrating popular culture as a medium to explore intimate partner violence through relevant music videos and you tube clips. These strategies were followed by large group discussion surrounding the messages around gender and violence imbedded in the words and images shown. With the students engaged by the popular culture references, theory and evidence-based practice regarding assessment, <b>screening,</b> <b>and</b> intervention around intimate partner violence was offered. The foundation of these innovative teaching strategies is to invite undergraduate nursing students to: (1) examine their personal values, beliefs and assumptions around gender and violence; (2) consider the contexts for assessment <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> of families for intimate partner violence across community health nursing practice settings. The key learning outcomes for this presentation are: 1) 	influencing undergraduate nursing students to situate their nursing practice {{in the context of their}} values, beliefs and assumptions 2) 	influencing nursing educators to consider innovative teaching strategies using popular culture to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> inform undergraduate nursing students 3) 	inspiring the current and future generation of nurses to accurately assess <b>and</b> consistently <b>screen</b> for intimate partner violence across community health settings. The target audience for this presentation includes: nursing educators, nursing students, and all public health and home health nurses curious about accurately assessing <b>and</b> <b>screening</b> for intimate partner violence across community health settings.

40|$|Background: Effective {{strategies}} {{are needed to}} provide <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> treatment for hepatitis B and C to immigrant groups in the UK {{at high risk of}} chronic infection. This study aimed to build an understanding of the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards these conditions and their management in a range of high-risk minority ethnic communities and health professionals, in order to inform the design of a <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> treatment programme in primary care. Methods: Qualitative data collection consisted of three sequential phases- (i) semi-structured interviews with key informants (n = 17), (ii) focus groups with people from Chinese, Pakistani, Roma, Somali, and French- and English-speaking African communities (n = 95), and (iii) semi-structured interviews with general practitioners (n = 6). Datasets from each phase were analysed using the Framework method. Results: Key informants and general practitioners perceived that there was limited knowledge and understanding about hepatitis B and C within high-risk immigrant communities, and that chronic viral hepatitis did not typically feature in community discourses about serious illness. Many focus group participants were confused about the differences between types of viral hepatitis, held misconceptions regarding transmission, and were unaware of the asymptomatic nature of chronic infection. Most welcomed the idea of a screening programme, but key informants and focus group participants also identified numerous practical barriers to engagement with primary care-based <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> treatment; including language and communication difficulties, limited time (due to long working hours), and (for some) low levels of trust and confidence in general practice-based care. General practitioners expressed concerns about the workload implications <b>and</b> sustainability of <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> treating immigrant patients for chronic viral hepatitis in primary care. Conclusions: Strategies to reduce the burden of chronic viral hepatitis in immigrant communities will need to consider how levels of understanding about hepatitis B and C within these communities, and barriers to accessing healthcare, may affect capacity to <b>engage</b> with <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> treatment. Services may need to work with community groups and language support services to provide information and wider encouragement for screening. Primary care services will need ongoing consultation regarding their support needs to deliver hepatitis <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> treatment programmes...|$|R
