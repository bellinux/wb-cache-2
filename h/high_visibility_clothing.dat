The influence of the substituting groups of the dye molecule on the sorption rate and sorption isotherms was analyzed. The results showed that those dyed acrylic fabrics using hemicyanine dyes had obvious fluorescent effect in the spectra range 550 – 750 nm.

40|$|In this paper, the {{prediction}} {{accuracy of the}} PHS (predicted heat strain) model on human physiological responses while wearing protective clothing ensembles was examined. Six human subjects (aged 29 ± 3 years) underwent three experimental trials in three different protective garments (clothing thermal insulation Icl ranges from 0. 63 to 2. 01 clo) in two hot environments (40 °C, relative humidities: 30 % and 45 %). The observed and predicted mean skin temperature, core body temperature and sweat rate were presented and statistically compared. A {{significant difference was found}} in the metabolic rate between FIRE (firefighting clothing) and HV (<b>high</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>clothing)</b> or MIL (military clothing) (p 1. 0 clo). The predicted mean skin temperatures in three clothing ensembles HV, MIL and FIRE were also outside the expected limits. Thus, {{there is a need for}} further extension for the clothing insulation validation range of the PHS model. It is recommended that the PHS model should be amended and validated by individual algorithms, physical or physiological parameters, and further subject studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Five {{protective}} garments (light summer clothing L, <b>high</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>clothing</b> HV, military clothing MIL, climber coverall CLM and firefighting clothing FIRE) {{were assessed}} on eight unacclimated male subjects at two environments: moderate warm environment with high humidity (MWH, 20. 0 °C, 86 % relative humidity) and warm environment with moderate humidity (WMH, 30. 0 °C, 47 % relative humidity). The thermophysiological responses and subjective sensations were reported. The PHS model (ISO 7933) {{was used for}} predicting thermophysiological responses for each testing scenario. It was {{found that there were}} significant differences between clothing FIRE and other clothing on thermal sensation (p< 0. 05). Significant differences were found on skin humidity sensation between FIRE and L, HV or MIL (p< 0. 001). The RPE value in FIRE is significantly different with L and HV (p< 0. 05). In MWH, the post-exercise mean skin temperatures increased by 0. 59 and 1. 29 °C in MIL and CLM. In contrast, mean skin temperatures in L, HV, MIL, CLM and FIRE in WMH increased by 1. 7, 2. 1, 2. 1, 2. 8 and 3. 3 °C, respectively. The PHS model presented good performance on predicted mean skin temperatures in MIL and CLM at the two studied environments. However, the skin temperature prediction with light clothing in WMH was weak. For thick protective clothing, the prediction on rectal temperature was protective. It is thus concluded that the results generated by the PHS model for high insulating clothing and measurements performed in high humidity environments should be explained with caution...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{documented the}} frequency of protective and risky motorcycling opinions and behaviours and investigated whether these opinions and behaviours were more frequently expressed by licensed than unlicensed riders and by riders with high rather than low exposure to motorcycling. Areas where there was scope for improvement were identified to help guide the promotion of protective strategies. As {{part of a broader}} study of a birth cohort, 217 18 year old motorcyclists were administered a motorcycling computer questionnaire. Evidence of positive protective opinions was found, but there was considerable scope for behavioural improvements. While 92 % had worn a helmet, optimal protection was reported less frequently for other body areas: most often for the feet (54 %), hands (47 %) and upper body (35 %) and least often for the legs (8 %). Most (87 %) riders considered conspicuity increased safety, 68 % favoured mandatory day-time headlight use, and 66 % used dipped headlights in day-time. While 55 % favoured mandatory wearing of high-visibility clothing, only 15 % of day-time and 20 % of night-time riders reported doing this. During the past month, 16 % had driven within two hours of drinking alcohol and 6 % when too tired to be fully in control. Overall, 22 % had been penalized for a motorcycle driving offence, most often speeding. While 46 % said they agreed with the Graduated Driver Licensing System (GDLS), most licensed under that system reported breaking licence conditions and most were not apprehended. Licensed motorcyclists were significantly more likely than the unlicensed to favour mandatory day-time headlight usage, report using dipped headlights in day-time, and wear better protection for the head, upper body and hands, but {{were also more likely to}} report drinking and driving and traffic convictions [...] probably because of their greater exposure. Other, non-significant, results were in the same direction, except that fewer licensed than unlicensed riders were in favour of mandatory <b>high</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>clothing</b> or the GDLS. A similar pattern of more protective attitudes and behaviours was found for high rather than low exposure riders, though it was generally weaker, and high exposure was associated with drinking and driving, driving while tired and traffic convictions. The issues of representativeness and reliability are discussed and some implications for public policies towards motorcycling by young people are considered. Further research is recommended in order to determine which are the best predictors of motorcycling opinions and behaviours: personal characteristics, the formal training associated with licensure, or exposure to motorcycling. motorcycling protective opinions protective behaviours risky behaviours graduated driver licensing adolescence...|$|E
