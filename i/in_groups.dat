In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either alone or in bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E

Methods: A retrospective study of pediatric patients (15 {{years old or}} younger) who had undergone primary surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment was conducted. Patients were divided into five groups according to the predisposing factors: trauma (group 1), myopia (group 2), atopic dermatitis (group 3), congenital or developmental anomalies (group 4), and others (group 5). Results: A total of 48 eyes of 44 patients were included in this study.
