25|$|Tobacco was popular, {{both for}} {{personal}} use, and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Each person brought {{at least two}} changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred {{once or twice a}} month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel. Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, <b>hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.|$|E
500|$|The title {{story in}} Gibbons's 1940 {{collection}}, Christmas at Cold Comfort Farm, failed to equal {{the impact of}} the original. [...] When the collection was reissued many years later it was described as [...] "oddly comforting and amusing... and possibly a truer depiction of the times than we might think". Gibbons published three novels during the war: The Rich House (1941), Ticky (1942) and The Bachelor (1944). Ticky, a satire on mid-nineteenth century army life, was Gibbons's favourite of all her novels, although she acknowledged that <b>hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> liked it. It failed commercially, despite a favourable review in The Times Literary Supplement. Oliver surmises that [...] "the middle of the Second World War was perhaps the wrong time to satirise... the ridiculous and dangerous rituals that surround the male aggressive instinct". The Bachelor won critical praise for its revealing account of life in war-torn Britain—as did several of Gibbons's postwar novels.|$|E
500|$|The game's title {{stems from}} Sumerian mythology, {{particularly}} {{the myth of}} the ocean goddess Tiamat and the fresh water god Abzu uniting to form all life: a reason this was chosen was that myths surrounding land-based life and their supposed origins in a cosmic ocean were a recurring theme in multiple world mythologies. The title is made up of the words [...] "Ab" [...] (water) and [...] "Zû" [...] (to know), translated by the developers as [...] "Ocean of Wisdom". The word provided difficulties early on, as the Sumerian spelling [...] "Abzu" [...] differed from the Akkadian spelling [...] "Apsû". As a compromise, the team merged the two spellings into the game's title. The circumflex over the letter [...] "u" [...] caused problems for the team as <b>hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> knew how to type it and the computer programs had trouble handling it as part of the coding. The use of the word played into the game's focus on the ocean due to its mythic connections. The Middle Eastern influences extended to the game's architecture, and incorporated Nava's wish for structures to have meaning beyond being simple scenery or tools for player progression.|$|E

The priority then was given to agriculture and industry so at first the idea of creating a hi-tech park lacked appreciation.

Most government officials did not believe that it could become possible in Belarus.|$|R
500|$|The Referendum Party {{nevertheless}} {{may have}} cost the Conservatives certain seats. Many Conservatives themselves {{believed that this}} was the case. As noted by Anthony Heath, Roger Jowell, Bridget Taylor, and Katarina Thomson from their analysis of polling data, [...] "voters for the Referendum Party were certainly not a cross-section of the electorate. They were predominantly people who had voted Conservative (and, to a lesser extent, Liberal Democrat) in 1992. <b>Hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> who had voted Labour in 1992 supported Goldsmith's party." [...] Their evidence indicated that just under two-thirds of those who voted for the Referendum Party in 1997 had voted for the Conservatives in 1992, although the analysis also suggested that many of these people were dissatisfied with the Conservative government and would not have voted for them even had the Referendum Party not existed. Heath et al. noted that [...] "voters for the Referendum Party were remarkably Eurosceptic but were unremarkable in most other respects. They show no sign of being right-wing on the economic issues of the left-right dimension and they were not consistently right-wing ideologues." [...] Those who voted for the party held a diversity of ideological positions, the only shared factor being their Euroscepticism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final step}} of the full particularity of the Ruthenian Uniate Church was then {{effected}} {{by the development of}} the middle Ruthenian language into separate Rusyn, Ukrainian and Belarusian languages around 1600 to 1800.

2500|$|In 1102, Anselm of Canterbury {{demanded that}} the {{punishment}} for homosexuality should be moderate because [...] "this sin has been so public that <b>hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> has blushed for it, and many therefore have plunged into it without realising its gravity." [...] It was probably only in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that a mass condemnation of homosexuality began in Europe. This moderated considerably in the final {{decade of the twentieth}} century with the distinction now made by Catholic church authorities between homosexual orientation and homosexual activity, forbidding the latter while tolerating the existence of the former.|$|E
2500|$|In the European Middle Ages the Catholic church {{made use}} of {{pictures}} {{as a means of}} instruction, to supplement the knowledge acquired by reading or oral teaching. Books only existed in manuscript form and, being extremely costly, were beyond the means of most people. <b>Hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> could read, outside the ranks of the clergy and the monks. So frescoes of scenes from the Old and New Testaments, stained-glass windows, and the like were set up in the churches, because, as the Synod of Arras (1025) said, [...] "The illiterate contemplated in the lineaments of painting what they, having never learnt to read, could not discern in writing".|$|E

Myers argued {{that the decision to}} stop the match and start afresh was in Kasparov's interest, since he had been trailing and would have needed three more victories to win the match, while Karpov needed only one. Chess historian Edward Winter later wrote, [...] "This reasoning, originally voiced by <b>hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> except ... Myers, is now gaining ground." [...] Myers also asserted that Kasparov’s statements, which suggested that Campomanes had terminated the match at Karpov’s behest and over Kasparov’s opposition, were duplicitous.|$|E
2500|$|The ritual {{life of the}} Koryo-saram {{community}} has changed in various respects. [...] Marriages have taken on the Russian style. At Korean traditional funerals, the coffin is {{taken out of the}} house either through the window or a single door threshold; however, if {{there is more than one}} door threshold on the way out (e.g. in modern multi-stories buildings), three notches are made on each threshold. The name of the dead is traditionally written in hanja; however, as <b>hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> is left among the Koryo-saram who can write in hanja, the name is generally written in hangul only. On the other hand, the rituals for the first birthday and sixtieth anniversary have been preserved in their traditional form.|$|E

In the late 1930s, he was given a villa in the writer's colony of Peredelkino, outside Moscow. No secret was ever made of his having a wife and daughter in Paris. At the same time, <b>hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> outside of Moscow knew of two other children he had fathered.

[...] Malaysia was the only country that adopted such controls, and although the Malaysian government credited its rapid economic recovery on currency controls, the relationship is disputed. An empirical study found that the Malaysian policies produced faster economic recovery and smaller declines in employment and real wages. Krugman later stated that the controls might not have been necessary at the time they were applied, but that nevertheless [...] "Malaysia has proved a point – namely, that controlling capital in a crisis is at least feasible."

[...] In 2011, Hitchens was booed by the audience for a Question Time programme, on which he appears regularly, when he said that the expansion of sex education had been followed by increased numbers of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. During the same programme, chairman David Dimbleby quoted to Hitchens comments made by John Bercow that The Mail on Sunday was [...] "a bigoted, sexist, homophobic comic strip." [...] After his appearance, Hitchens wrote [...] "Is there any point in public debate in a society where <b>hardly</b> <b>anyone</b> has been taught how to think, while millions have been taught what to think?"
