40|$|The spastic mouse has a {{naturally}} occurring glycine receptor (GlyR) mutation that disrupts synaptic input in both motor and sensory pathways. Here {{we use the}} spastic mouse to examine how this altered inhibitory drive affects neuronal intrinsic membrane properties and signal processing in the superficial dorsal horn (SDH), where GlyRs contribute to pain processing mechanisms. We first used in vitro patch clamp recording in spinal cord slices (L 3 –L 5 segments) to examine intrinsic membrane properties of SDH neurones in spastic and age-matched wildtype controls (∼P 23). Apart from a modest reduction (∼ 3 mV) in resting membrane potential (RMP), neurones in spastic mice have membrane and action potential (AP) properties identical to wildtype controls. There was, however, a substantial reorganization of AP discharge properties in neurones from spastic mice, with a significant increase (14 %) {{in the proportion of}} <b>delayed</b> <b>firing</b> neurones. This was accompanied by a change in the voltage sensitivity of rapid A-currents, a possible mechanism for increased <b>delayed</b> <b>firing.</b> To assess the functional consequences of these changes, we made in vivo patch-clamp recordings from SDH neurones in urethane anaesthetized (2. 2 g kg− 1, i. p.) spastic and wildtype mice (∼P 37), and examined responses to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation of the hindpaw. Overall, responses recorded in wildtype and spastic mice were similar; however, in spastic mice a small population of spontaneously active neurones (∼ 10 %) exhibited elevated spontaneous discharge frequency and post-pinch discharge rates. Together, these results are consistent with the altered intrinsic membrane properties of SDH neurones observed in vitro having functional consequences for pain processing mechanisms in the spastic mouse in vivo. We propose that alterations in potassium channel function in the spastic mouse compensate, in part, for reduced glycinergic inhibition and thus maintain normal signal processing in the SDH...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to their classical roles in neuronal growth, survival and differentiation, neurotrophins are also rapid regulators of excitability, synaptic transmission and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. We have recently shown that mature BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor), but not proBDNF, modulates the excitability of interneurons in dentate gyrus within minutes. Here, we used brain slice patch-clamp recordings to study the mechanisms through which BDNF modulates the firing of interneurons in rat dentate gyrus by binding to TrkB receptors. Bath application of BDNF (15 ng/ml) under current-clamp decreased the firing frequency (by 80 %) and input resistance, blocking the <b>delayed</b> <b>firing</b> observed at near-threshold voltage ranges, with no changes in resting membrane potential or action potential waveform. Using TEA (tetraethylammonium), or XE 991 (a Kv 7 /KCNQ channel antagonist), the effect of BDNF was abolished, whereas application of retigabine (a Kv 7 /KCNQ channel opener) mimicked the effect of BDNF, suggesting that the M-current could be implicated in the modulation of the firing. In voltage-clamp experiments, BDNF increased the M-like current amplitude with no change in holding current. This effect was again blocked by XE 991 and mimicked by retigabine, the latter accompanied with a change in holding current. In agreement with the electrophysiology, parvalbumin-positive interneurons co-expressed TrkB receptors and Kv 7. 2 /KCNQ 2 channels.

The contracture was 17 % of the peak-tetanic tension, and {{was not associated with}} action potentials. Twitches superimposed on the contracture were at most diminished to half, as were their action potentials. Both slow and fast muscle fibres participated in the contracture.

There was evidence of <b>delayed</b> <b>firing,</b> first observed 90 seconds after the peak of the contracture. The patient had electromyographic and histological signs of myopathy. McArdle's disease is associated with painful muscle cramps and myoglobinuria after strenuous exer-cise (McArdle, 1951; Rowland et al., 1963). The cramps are not accompanied by electrical activity (McArdle, 1951). The strength of the contracture has not previously been measured. In the patient presented here we have determined the force developed during the contracture.

40|$|Neurons in the {{superficial}} dorsal horn (SDH) of {{the spinal cord}} {{play an important role}} in nociceptive, thermal, itch and light touch sensations. Excitatory interneurons comprise ~ 65 % of all SDH neurons but surprisingly few studies have investigated their role in spinal sensory processing. Here we use a transgenic mouse to study putative excitatory SDH neurons that express the calcium binding protein calretinin (CR). Our immunocytochemical, morphological and electrophysiological analysis identified two distinct populations of CR-expressing neurons, which we termed 'Typical' and 'Atypical'. Typical CR-expressing neurons comprised ~ 85 % of the population and exhibited characteristic excitatory interneuron properties including <b>delayed</b> <b>firing</b> discharge, large rapid A-type potassium currents, and central, radial or vertical cell morphologies. Atypical neurons exhibited properties consistent with inhibitory interneurons, including tonic firing or initial bursting discharge, I h currents, and islet cell morphology. Although both Typical and Atypical CR-expressing neurons responded to noxious peripheral stimulation, the excitatory drive onto Typical CR-expressing neurons was much stronger. Furthermore, Atypical CR-expressing cells comprise at least two functionally distinct subpopulations based on their responsiveness to noxious peripheral stimulation and neurochemical profile. Together our data suggest CR expression is not restricted to excitatory neurons in the SDH. Under normal conditions, the contribution of 'Typical' excitatory CR-expressing neurons to overall SDH excitability may be limited by the presence of A-type potassium currents, which limit the effectiveness of their strong excitatory input. Their contribution may, however, be increased in pathological situations where A-type potassium currents are decreased. By contrast, 'Atypical' inhibitory neurons with their excitable phenotype but weak excitatory input may be more easily recruited during increased peripheral stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{cell cycle}} {{progression}} by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) {{is essential for}} cell adaptation to extracellular stimuli. Exposure of yeast to osmostress activates the Hog 1 SAPK, which modulates cell cycle progression at G 1 and G 2 by the phosphorylation of elements of the cell cycle machinery, such as Sic 1 and Hsl 1, and by down-regulation of G 1 and G 2 cyclins. Here, we show that upon stress, Hog 1 also modulates S phase progression. The control of S phase is independent of the S phase DNA damage checkpoint and of the previously characterized Hog 1 cell cycle targets Sic 1 and Hsl 1. Hog 1 uses at least two distinct mechanisms in its control over S phase progression. At early S phase, the SAPK prevents firing of replication origins by delaying the accumulation of the S phase cyclins Clb 5 and Clb 6. In addition, Hog 1 prevents S phase progression when activated later in S phase or cells containing a genetic bypass for cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Hog 1 interacts with components of the replication complex and delays phosphorylation of the Dpb 2 subunit of the DNA polymerase. The two mechanisms of Hog 1 action lead to <b>delayed</b> <b>firing</b> of origins and prolonged replication, respectively.

40|$|Interneurons of {{the spinal}} dorsal horn take a centre stage in {{somatosensory}} and nociceptive processing. A mechanistic {{understanding of their}} function depends on profound knowledge of their intrinsic properties and their integration into dorsal horn circuits. Here, we have used BAC transgenic mice expressing eGFP {{under the control of}} the vGluT 2 gene (vGluT 2 -eGFP mice) to perform a detailed electrophysiological and morphological characterization of excitatory dorsal horn neurons, and to compare their properties to those of GABAergic (Gad 67 -eGFP tagged) and glycinergic (GlyT 2 -eGFP tagged) neurons. vGluT 2 -eGFP was detected in about one third of all excitatory dorsal horn neurons that, as demonstrated by the coexpression of vGluT 2 -eGFP with different markers of subtypes of glutamatergic neurons, likely labelled a representative fraction of these neurons. Three types of dendritic tree morphologies (vertical, central, and radial), but no islet cell-type morphology, were identified in vGluT 2 -eGFP neurons. vGluT 2 -eGFP neurons had more depolarised action potential thresholds and longer action potential durations than inhibitory neurons, while no significant differences were found for the resting membrane potential, input resistance, cell capacitance and after-hyperpolarisation. <b>Delayed</b> <b>firing</b> and single action potential firing were the single most prevalent firing patterns in vGluT 2 -eGFP neurons of the superficial and deep dorsal horn, respectively. By contrast, tonic firing prevailed in inhibitory interneurons of the dorsal horn. Capsaicin-induced synaptic inputs were detected in about half of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and occurred more frequently in superficial than in deep dorsal horn neurons. Primary afferent-evoked (polysynaptic) inhibitory inputs were found in the majority of glutamatergic and glycinergic neurons, but only in less than half of the GABAergic population. Excitatory dorsal horn neurons thus differ from their inhibitory counterparts in several biophysical properties and possibly also in their integration into the local neuronal circuitry...|$|E
40|$|Following {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), {{anatomical}} changes such as axonal sprouting occur within weeks {{in the vicinity of}} the injury. Exercise training enhances axon sprouting; however, the exact mechanisms that mediate exercised-induced plasticity are unknown. We studied the effects of exercise training after SCI on the intrinsic and synaptic properties of spinal neurons in the immediate vicinity (&lt; 2 segments) of the SCI. Male mice (C 57 BL/ 6, 9 - 10 weeks old) received a spinal hemisection (T 10) and after 1 week of recovery, they were randomized to trained (treadmill exercise for 3 weeks) and untrained (no exercise) groups. After 3 weeks, mice were killed and horizontal spinal cord slices (T 6 -L 1, 250 μm thick) were prepared for visually guided whole cell patch clamp recording. Intrinsic properties, including resting membrane potential, input resistance, rheobase current, action potential (AP) threshold and after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude were similar in neurons from trained and untrained mice (n= 67 and 70 neurons, respectively). Neurons could be grouped into four categories based on their AP discharge during depolarizing current injection; the proportions of tonic firing, initial bursting, single spiking, and <b>delayed</b> <b>firing</b> neurons were similar in trained and untrained mice. The properties of spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSCs) did not differ in trained and untrained animals.

40|$|In the {{superficial}} dorsal horn (SDH) processing of noxious and innocuous stimuli is critically {{dependent on the}} input–output relationship of its component neurones. Such relationships are routinely examined by assessing neuronal responses to somatic current injection or activation of synaptic inputs. A more complete understanding of input–output relationships would be achieved by comparing, in the same neurone, how the two forms of activation contribute to neuronal output. Therefore, we examined how SDH neurones transform depolarizing current injections and synaptic excitation via peripheral cutaneous stimuli (brush and pinch of the hindpaw) into trains of action potentials, in an in vivo preparation of the adult mouse spinal cord. Under whole-cell current clamp recording conditions four action potential discharge patterns were observed during depolarizing current injection: tonic firing neurones (21 / 93) discharged spikes throughout the step; initial bursting neurones (35 / 93) discharged several spikes at step onset; single spiking neurones (16 / 93) discharged one or two spikes at step onset; and <b>delayed</b> <b>firing</b> neurones (21 / 93) discharged spikes delayed from the step onset. Four characteristic profiles were observed in response to application of noxious (pinch) and innocuous (brush) cutaneous stimuli: nociceptive neurones (20 / 37) responded maximally to pinch stimulation; light touch neurones (9 / 37) responded maximally to brush stimulation; subthreshold neurones (4 / 37) exhibited depolarizing responses without firing action potentials; and hyperpolarizing neurones (4 / 37) exhibited a sustained pinch-induced hyperpolarization. Comparisons of current-evoked discharge patterns with peripherally evoked responses indicate SDH neurones expressing {{each of the four}} discharge patterns could receive, and therefore participate in the processing of information concerning, either noxious or innocuous stimuli.

40|$|This work quantifies seismic {{coupling}} {{as a function}} of charge weight for single-fired (simultaneously detonated) explosions observed in the mine and at regional distances. These single-fired explosions are contrasted to standard production shots from the same mine. Production shots include cast blasts to remove overburden and coal shots to fracture the resource. The blasts were conducted in a mine in NE Wyoming. The data sets consist of measurements in the mine (100 - 10000 m) and at regional distance (360 km) using a seismic array near Pinedale, Wyoming (PDAR). The single-fired explosions ranged in size from 5500 to 50000 lbs. Peak amplitude measured at a single element of the regional array are modeled by a power law dependent on explosive weight. Similar scaling constants were determined for each of the dominant regional phases: Pn – 0. 84 ± 0. 14; Pg – 0. 84 ± 0. 09; and Lg – 0. 91 ±. 08. Spectral ratios of observations from different explosions observed at the same station document the frequency dependence of the source scaling relations. Spectral ratios using in-mine observations are consistent with those using regional data. The empirical source ratio is matched with a Mueller-Murphy source model replicating both the increase in long period spectral level and the accompanying decrease in source corner frequency with increasing charge weight. The coal and cast blasts that make up the production shots ranged in size from 77, 000 to 4, 738, 230 lbs. Peak amplitudes from the largest production shots are comparable to those from the largest single-fired explosion.
