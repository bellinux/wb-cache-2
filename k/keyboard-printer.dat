50|$|The Teletype Model 42 and Teletype Model 43 are {{electronic}} teleprinters providing character-at-a-time <b>keyboard-printer</b> send receive operation. The Teletype Model 42 is the Baudot {{variant of}} the Model 43, which is an ASCII teleprinter. The Model 43 has two transmission speeds, 100 words-per-minute and 300 words-per-minute, selectable by the operator to match the distant station speed. The Teletype Model 43 printer could print up to 80 characters per line using the friction feed printer option. Model 43 sprocket feed printers print messages with up to 132 characters per line using 12 inch wide sprocket feed paper. The tractor feed printer will print messages with up to 80 characters per line using 12 inch sprocket feed paper.|$|E
40|$|A PDP 9 L {{computer}} {{is used as}} the basis for a multistation pulse height analysis system. Each station which is equipped with an analog-to-digital converter, a display and a <b>keyboard-printer</b> can perform the basic operations associated with a commercial hard-wired system. The stations are independent of one another but two or more accumulating or displaying simultaneously result in a slight increase in analog-to-digital converter dead time. The <b>keyboard-printer</b> operates in conversational mode with no output forthcoming if incorrect characters are entered. System procedures are initiated from the station keyboard to control the display, accumulate, integrate, and read and write functions as flexibly as possible without excessively increasing the program-to-data ratio for core usage. This system was designed to enable software to be modified when different procedures become necessary, and to enable adaptation of the available equipment to other modes of accumulation and display...|$|E
