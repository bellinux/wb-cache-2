We {{describe the}} distributions of <b>gaps,</b> <b>lengths</b> and overlaps among participants in a random digit dialing survey conducted among 1194 Seattle residents during 2003 - 2004.

40|$|Abstract. We present new {{algorithms}} for {{the problem}} of multiple string matching of gapped patterns, where a gapped pattern is a sequence of strings such {{that there is a}} <b>gap</b> of fixed <b>length</b> between each two consecutive strings. The problem has applications in the discovery of transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences when using gener-alized versions of the Position Weight Matrix model to describe tran-scription factor specificities. We present a simple practical algorithm, based on bit-parallelism, that, given a text of length n, runs in time O(n(log σ + gw-spandk-len(P) /we) + occ), where occ is the number of occurrences of the patterns in the text, k-len(P) is the total num-ber of strings in the patterns and 1 ≤ gw-span ≤ w is the maximum number of distinct <b>gap</b> <b>lengths</b> that span a single word of w bits in our encoding. We then show how to improve the time complexity to O(n(log σ + log 2 gsize(P) dk-len(P) /we) + occ) in the worst-case, where gsize(P) is the size of the variation range of the <b>gap</b> <b>lengths.</b> Finally, by parallelizing in a different order we obtain O(dn/welen(P) +n+occ) time, where len(P) is the total number of alphabet symbols in the patterns. We also provide experimental results which show that the presented algo-rithms are fast in practice, and preferable if all the strings in the patterns have unit-length. ...|$|R

5000|$|A local {{sequence}} alignment matches a contiguous sub-section of one sequence with a contiguous sub-section of another. [...] The Smith-Waterman {{algorithm is}} motivated by giving scores for matches and mismatches. Matches increase the overall score of an alignment whereas mismatches decrease the score. A good alignment then has a positive score and a poor alignment has a negative score. The local algorithm finds an alignment with the highest score by considering only alignments that score positives and picking the best one from those. The algorithm is a Dynamic programming algorithm. When comparing proteins, one uses a similarity matrix which assigns a score to each possible residue. The score should be positive for similar residues and negative for dissimilar residues pair. Gaps are usually penalized using a linear gap function that assigns an initial penalty for a gap opening, and an additional penalty for gap extensions, increasing the <b>gap</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some of Keszler’s {{early work}} shows the {{importance}} of his research in material science for application purposes. For example, in 2002, he worked on thin-film electroluminescent devices which display high definition monochromic color outputs, and developing them to display {{a full range of}} color. They specifically focused on phosphor(Zn,Ga)S:Mn and SrS codoped with copper(Cu) and potassium(K) powders which was observed to have identical emission properties as thin films. Essentially by codoping, the band <b>gap</b> <b>length</b> of a material can be tuned so that the color of the light can be adjusted. The light itself is emitted when excited electrons in the conduction band fall back down to the valence band. By manipulating the properties of crystal and defect chemistry, any color can be portrayed for display.Keszler has also developed a convenient method for solid synthesis. In 2001, he demonstrated a hydrothermal dehydration technique of precipitates which avoids formation of amorphous products that are created through the conventional drying process of heating. Through this method, he showed the formation of Zn2SiO4 and SnSiO3. This technique has allowed for development of materials such as powders, thin films, and luminescent materials.|$|E

Materials and Methods: All consecutive cases of EA-TEF were included and different patient parameters were recorded. Plain radiographs with a nasogastric tube in the upper esophagus were taken. Patients were grouped into T 1 -T 2; T 2 -T 3; T 3 -T 4; and T 4 depending on the thoracic vertebral level of the arrest of the tube. During surgery, the <b>gap</b> <b>length</b> between the pouches was measured using a Vernier caliper and the patients were grouped into A, B, and C (<b>gap</b> <b>length</b> > 2. 1 cm; > 1 -≤ 2 cm and ≤ 1 cm).
