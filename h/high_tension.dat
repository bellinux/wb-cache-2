5|$|The Inspector General of Police (IGP) {{reported}} that from 3 July until 11 July, 1,096 people, 628 men, 465 women, and 3 children left or were {{rescued from the}} complex. The IGP also confirmed that 102 people were killed during the operation: 91 militants, 10 SSG commandos, and 1 Ranger. This includes the sixteen dead on 10 July. A total of 248 people were injured, including 204 civilians, 41 army soldiers, and 3 Rangers. Seventy-five bodies were recovered from the premises after the operation. Securing Lal Masjid brought an end to nine days of <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> in Islamabad, normally a tranquil city that had been immune to the violence experienced in the tribal areas of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel. As a result, {{more than half of}} the {{electricity}} customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Victorian {{fires were}} {{thought to have been}} caused by sparks between {{short-circuiting}} power lines, and tree branches connecting with power lines. A systematic review of fire safety was undertaken; areas under <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> pylons were cleared and local domestic lines considered to be at risk were replaced with insulated three-phase supply lines.|$|E

Items in the nearby environment that generate electro-magnetic fields, such as <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> wires and microwave towers, are avoided. The slope, if any, should be towards the east, {{and there should be}} no obstructions that block the sun's first rays.|$|E
25|$|Roque {{appeared}} on Cuban television on February 26, 1996, where he denounced the Brothers as an illegal and anti-Cuban organization the fundamental purpose {{of which is}} to provoke incidents that aggravated relations between Cuba and United States.

25|$|To {{accelerate}} the electrons from the cathode {{to the screen}} with sufficient velocity, a very high voltage (EHT or Extra <b>High</b> <b>Tension)</b> is required, from a few thousand volts for a small oscilloscope CRT to tens of kV for a larger screen color TV. This is many times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply is turned off, some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain a charge for some time.|$|E
25|$|With reliability, unused desert, no pollution, and no fuel costs, the {{obstacles}} for large deployment for CSP are cost, aesthetics, {{land use and}} similar factors for the necessary connecting <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> lines. Although {{only a small percentage}} of the desert is necessary to meet global electricity demand, still a large area must be covered with mirrors or lenses to obtain a significant amount of energy. An important way to decrease cost is the use of a simple design.|$|E

25|$|On 14 March 2008, a Cessna-152, VT-ACC {{crashed into}} the Neera river south of the airport. The Student pilot, {{carrying}} an unauthorised female passenger on a solo training sortie, had descending from the assigned altitude to do low flying over the river for fun. Having descended to around 50ft above the river, the pilot failed to notice <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> electrical cables stretched across the river {{as a result the}} main landing gear got entangled in the cables and the aircraft {{crashed into the}} river. Both occupants sustained minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} began demobilising {{shortly after}} the end of the war. Some flying continued, however, and one of No. 92 Squadron's Beaufighters struck <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> wires and crashed at Narrandera in southern New South Wales on 3 September. This accident resulted in the death of the pilot and six airmen from a RAAF repair and maintenance unit located in the town who were being taken on a joy flight. The Beaufighter had flown from Kingaroy to Narrandera several days earlier to transport another RAAF airman to his mother's funeral. The squadron completed disbanding on 17 September 1945.|$|E
25|$|Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, born in Liverpool in 1864, was an {{electrical}} engineer who designed the layout for Deptford Power Station, the first alternating current power station {{in the world in}} 1887, and whose design all others would follow; his later company Ferranti, of Oldham, would later be an industry leader in Britain's defence electronics, on the FTSE 100 Index. Ferranti's design of increasing AC voltage to <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> at the power station, to be stepped-down at a transformer at substations before entering properties, is the system all electricity networks take today; the system reduces wasteful heating of electricity transmission cables.|$|E

25|$|Blake {{worked with}} Prince {{to create a}} new racquet with Prince's O3 technology. However, he did not feel {{comfortable}} with this racquet. So, he switched back to the Dunlop Sport Aerogel 200, then the 4D 200, for the 2009 season. He changed to Wilson {{at the start of the}} 2010 season, using the new Six.One Tour strung with Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power 16L strings at <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> (60+ pounds). He did not feel comfortable with this racquet either. Therefore, he switched back to Dunlop again. After the US Open of 2010, he began to test out rackets for Head. As August 26, 2011, he announced he will use Donnay rackets as his choice and using a customized Donnay X-Dual Pro. His clothing sponsor is Fila, with whom he started working in 2009 after using Nike for most his career. He has his own clothing line named Thomas Reynolds Collection after his father.|$|E
25|$|In {{her first}} two years with Warner Bros., Farrell starred in 17 films, {{including}} Girl Missing (1933), Gambling Ship (1933), Man's Castle (1933) opposite Spencer Tracy, and Columbia Pictures' Lady for a Day (1933) by director Frank Capra. Farrell often worked on four films at once and managed to transition from one role to another effortlessly. She worked in over 20 movies between 1934 and 1936, starring in such films as Go into Your Dance (1935), Little Big Shot (1935), and <b>High</b> <b>Tension</b> (1936). She appeared with Dick Powell and Joan Blondell in the Academy Award-nominated Gold Diggers of 1935 and Gold Diggers of 1937 musical film series. Farrell was very close friends with fellow Warner Bros. actress Joan Blondell, and throughout the early 1930s, they were paired as bombshell comedy duo {{in a series of}} five Warner Bros. movies: Havana Widows (1933), Kansas City Princess (1934), Traveling Saleslady (1935), We're in the Money (1935), and Miss Pacific Fleet (1935). Farrell and Blondell co-starred in a total of nine films. Together, they came to personify the smart and sassy, wisecracking dames of '30s and '40s film.|$|E
25|$|Not until 1927 {{were there}} once again plans for {{conversion}} to electric operations. Now, however, <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> alternating current, at a frequency of 16 Hz, {{was to be}} used. This offered, amongst other things, the advantage of requiring only one electrical insertion point, near Visp, which would drastically reduce the costs of electrical systems {{in comparison with the}} original plans. Consideration was also given to adopting completely the SBB current system at 15,000 volts without alteration, but that idea quickly had to be abandoned. In particular, the Rhätische Bahn, which since 1913 had been operating electric traffic at 11,000 volts AC on the Engadine Line, stressed the benefits of using lower voltage than the SBB voltage. Whereas light weight air cooled transformers could be used on the Engadine Line, a heavy oil cooling system would be necessary for 15,000 volt operations, and that would greatly have increased the weight of the VZ locomotives. Additionally, the use of a single phase current system would make problem free through traffic possible in the event of electrification of the Furka Oberalp Bahn. These advantages led to the decision to use a voltage of 11,000 volts also on the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn.|$|E

25|$|Barrington {{was chosen}} to manage the {{forthcoming}} tour of Pakistan in the first season of the WSC, both sides losing players as a result. Phil Edmonds and Paul Downton were taken on the tour, Downton on Barrington's advice after playing only a few county games and he gave Edmonds was long practise sessions in the nets to improve his spin bowling. The team arrived {{in the wake of}} General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's military coup displacing Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the country {{was in a state of}} <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> and disorder. In the First Test 40,000 Bhutto supporters rioted at the ground and the teams took refuge in their dressing rooms as the army restored order. The TCCB gave Barrington permission to cancel the tour if he saw fit and realising this the players urged him to let them go home for Christmas. In the Second Test England collapsed in the first innings to the leg-spinner Abdul Qadir (6/44), but Barrington bowled his own leg-spin at Brearley and Boycott for an hour before the second innings and their 185 opening stand saved the game. The Third Test was surrounded by controversy as Pakistan wanted brought in their WSC players Zaheer Abbas, Mushtaq Mohammad and Imran Khan to win a series victory in the last Test. This would have given them an edge over an England team without its WSC veterans. Several England players led by the vice-captain Geoff Boycott, Bob Willis and Derek Randall refused to play Pakistan with their Packer players and Barrington and Brearley tried to negotiate between the players, the TCCB and the Pakistani cricket authorities. Matters were made worst by Mike Brearley breaking his arm and returning to England, leaving the uncompromising Boycott as captain and Willis as vice-captain. Fortunately, the Pakistani players could only play by breaking their WSC contracts, which they refused to do, and the Test was drawn. Barrington was out of his depth in these political matters, even though Willis later admitted that his determination for the Test to be played regardless was the right course.|$|E
