5|$|According to Blythe's {{attorney}} Martin Radvan, {{the police}} launched an investigation {{following the death}} of Nosek, about a month after the concert and following a coma. After interviewing several eyewitnesses from the concert, the police asked the United States Department of Justice {{to take part in the}} investigation; however, they refused to cooperate and, moreover, did not notify anyone from Lamb of <b>God</b> <b>or</b> its management.|$|E
5|$|Seal {{impressions}} {{found in}} Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's {{time on the}} throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single <b>god,</b> <b>or</b> promoting monotheism. The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during their lifetimes. Most of the found clay seal impressions were still undeciphered and untranslated at their time.|$|E

5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect {{in the moment of}} mystic illumination. He {{goes on to say that}} the nature of <b>God</b> <b>or</b> eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E
5|$|Thor {{closely resembles}} other Indo-European deities {{associated}} with the thunder: the Celtic Taranis, the Baltic Perkūnas, the Slavic Perun, and particularly the Hindu Indra, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the vajra are obvious parallels. Scholars have compared Indra's slaying of Vritra with Thor's battle with Jörmungandr. Although in the past {{it was suggested that}} Thor was an indigenous sky <b>god</b> <b>or</b> a Viking Age import into Scandinavia, these Indo-European parallels make him generally accepted today as ultimately derived from a Proto-Indo-European deity.|$|E
5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a <b>God</b> <b>or</b> any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E

5|$|Adi Da {{initially}} {{became known}} in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. His philosophy was essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life. Distinguishing his from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared {{that he was a}} uniquely historic avatar (incarnation of a <b>god</b> <b>or</b> divinity in human form). As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names <b>God</b> <b>or</b> Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of <b>God</b> <b>or</b> consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E

If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} deities {{gave rise}} to local manifestations, which sometimes absorbed the characteristics of older regional gods. Horus had many forms tied to particular places, including Horus of Nekhen, Horus of Buhen, and Horus of Edfu. Such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings. During the New Kingdom, one man was accused of stealing clothes by an oracle supposed to communicate messages from Amun of Pe-Khenty. He consulted two other local oracles of Amun hoping for a different judgment. Gods' manifestations also differed according to their roles. Horus could be a powerful sky <b>god</b> <b>or</b> vulnerable child, and these forms were sometimes counted as independent deities.|$|E
5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a <b>god</b> <b>or</b> intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E

5|$|Symeon often {{taught that}} all {{followers}} of Christ {{could have the}} direct experience of <b>God,</b> <b>or</b> theoria, just as the early church fathers experienced and taught. In that context he frequently described his own experiences of God as divine light. He preached to his monks {{that the way to}} God's grace was through a life of simplicity, asceticism, sanctity, and contemplation, which was also the doctrine of the hermits and monks known as the Desert Fathers. In addition, Symeon placed great emphasis on putting oneself under the complete guidance of a spiritual father.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone in}} the Capitoline Temple was {{believed}} to have been among the altars located on the Capitoline Hill before the Temple was built under Tarquinius Priscus (traditional reign 616579 BC) or Tarquinius Superbus (535510 BC). When the augurs took the auspices to discover whether the <b>god</b> <b>or</b> goddess of each altar was content for it to be moved, Terminus refused permission, either alone or along with Juventas the goddess of youth. The stone was therefore included within the Capitoline Temple, and its immovability was regarded as a good omen for the permanence of the city's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{beliefs of}} the Sihanaka, as elsewhere in Madagascar, revolve around respect for a creator god (Zanahary), the ancestors, and fady (ancestral interdictions). Aspects of ancestor worship among the Sihanaka include joro (collective prayers said to invoke the blessings of <b>God</b> <b>or</b> the ancestors), burial in family tombs, the famadihana reburial ceremony, and the sanctification of particular stones (tsangambato), land (tany masina), and shrines (doany, tony and jiro). Another major element of this tradition {{is the role of}} ambalavelona, believed to be the spirits of the ancestors themselves. Each ancestral practice or tradition has a particular spirit associated with it, and the Sihanaka show respect for these spirits by maintaining ancestral customs and traditions and adhering to fady.|$|E

5|$|When {{the goddess}} is at last placated, the {{retrieving}} god escorts {{her back to}} Egypt. Her return {{marks the beginning of}} the inundation and the new year. The pacified Eye deity is once more a procreative consort for the sun <b>god,</b> <b>or,</b> in some versions of the story, for the god who brings her back. Mehit becomes the consort of Anhur, Tefnut is paired with Shu, and Thoth's spouse is sometimes Nehemtawy, a minor goddess associated with this pacified form of the Eye. In many cases, the Eye goddess and her consort then produce a divine child who becomes the new sun god. The goddess' transformation from hostile to peaceful is a key step in the renewal of the sun god and the kingship that he represents.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by <b>God</b> <b>or</b> other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of <b>God,</b> <b>or</b> challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E
