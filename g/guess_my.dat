Her mother {{encouraged her to}} read a range of genres, which Lorde cited as a lyrical influence, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> mum influenced my lyrical style by always buying me books. She'd give me a mixture of kid and adult books too, there weren't really any books I wasn't allowed to read. I remember reading Feed by M.T. Anderson when I was six, and her giving me Salinger and Carver at a young age, and Janet Frame really young too." ...|$|E

2500|$|While resurgence/takeover {{architect}} Paige Patterson {{believes the}} controversy has achieved its objective of returning the SBC from an alleged [...] "leftward drift" [...] {{to a more}} conservative stance, he admits to having some regrets. Patterson points to vocational disruption, hurt, sorrow, and disrupted friendships {{as evidence of the}} price that the controversy has exacted."Friendships and sometimes family relationships have been marred. Churches have sometimes been damaged even though local church life has proceeded for the most part above the fray and often remains largely oblivious to it. No one seriously confessing the name of Jesus can rejoice in these sorrows", Patterson writes. [...] "I confess that I often second <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> own actions and agonize over those who have suffered on both sides, including my own family." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peyton {{was further}} {{designed}} as an artist, {{in order to}} add more depth to the character and express what she cannot or {{does not want to}} say. It also complemented her romance with Lucas, as both are deep thinkers who use their skills to speak to the world. The actual artist of Peyton's works is Helen Ward. [...] "Before joining , I had already worked as a set designer, storyboard artist and illustrator for a number of films. But I still had to try out for the job," [...] she said. [...] "I think they asked a bunch of people to give their shot at a particular drawing. They were pretty specific about what they were looking for. I <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> work was closest. I got the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 31, 2007, Donaire met Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Donaire {{said the}} {{experience}} was, [...] "an overwhelming feeling. It was indescribable. The moment I {{walked up the}} stairs and she was up there and when I looked it was a moment when I couldn't even look at her face. It was a great honor." [...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was. I couldn't move well so I tried to rely on my upper body movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the songs}} {{recorded}} for the album were Parsons and Battin's [...] "Yesterday's Train", a gentle {{meditation on the}} theme of reincarnation; a cover of Lowell George and Bill Payne's [...] "Truck Stop Girl", sung by Clarence White; and a light-hearted reading of Lead Belly's [...] "Take a Whiff on Me". The album also included the Battin-penned [...] "Well Come Back Home", a heartfelt comment on the Vietnam War. Battin explained the song's genesis to author Johnny Rogan during a 1979 interview: [...] "I was personally touched by the Vietnam situation, and my feelings about it came out in that song. I had a high school friend who died out there and I <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> thoughts were on him at the time." [...] Battin also revealed in the same interview that he couldn't decide whether to name the song [...] "Well Come Back Home" [...] or [...] "Welcome Back Home" [...] but finally settled on the former. Curiously, although the song was listed on the original album and the original CD issue of (Untitled) as [...] "Well Come Back Home", it was listed as [...] "Welcome Back Home" [...] on the (Untitled)/(Unissued) re-release in 2000, possibly in error. With a running time of 7:40, the song is the longest studio recording in The Byrds' entire oeuvre. In addition, the song also continues the tradition of ending The Byrds' albums on an unusual note, with Battin chanting the Nichiren Buddhist mantra [...] "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song.|$|E
