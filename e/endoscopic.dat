5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. <b>Endoscopic</b> retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an <b>endoscopic</b> procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. <b>Endoscopic</b> ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E
5|$|A biopsy by fine needle aspiration, often {{guided by}} <b>endoscopic</b> ultrasound, {{may be used}} where there is {{uncertainty}} over the diagnosis, but a histologic diagnosis is not usually required for removal of the tumor by surgery to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|If {{other causes}} rather than gallstones are {{suspected}} (such as a tumor), computed tomography and <b>endoscopic</b> ultrasound (EUS) may be performed {{to identify the}} nature of the obstruction. EUS may be used to obtain biopsy (tissue sample) of suspicious masses. EUS may also replace diagnostic ERCP for stone disease, although this depends on local availability.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} population, {{screening}} of large groups is not currently considered effective, although newer techniques, and the screening of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated. Nevertheless, regular screening with <b>endoscopic</b> ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging {{is recommended for}} those at high risk from inherited genetics.|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after <b>endoscopic</b> resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after <b>endoscopic</b> biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still <b>endoscopic</b> retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This {{involves the use}} of endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the <b>endoscopic</b> image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> {{surveillance}} {{of people with}} Barrett's esophagus is often recommended, although little direct evidence supports this practice. Treatment options for high-grade dysplasia include surgical removal of the esophagus (esophagectomy) or <b>endoscopic</b> treatments such as <b>endoscopic</b> mucosal resection or ablation (destruction).|$|E
25|$|Forms of <b>endoscopic</b> therapy {{have been}} used for stage 0 and I disease: <b>endoscopic</b> mucosal {{resection}} (EMR) and mucosal ablation using radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, Nd-YAG laser, or argon plasma coagulation.|$|E
25|$|Over time, SEMS {{may also}} migrate to a {{different}} position that does not help with treatment of the obstructed area. This may be treated with placement of a second SEMS, or <b>endoscopic</b> attempts to reposition or remove the first. Rarely, SEMS may fracture or intussescept after <b>endoscopic</b> intervention.|$|E
25|$|Various <b>endoscopic</b> {{techniques}} are proving effective, including laser-assisted techniques.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{has shown}} {{efficacy}} in reversing <b>endoscopic</b> evidence of disease.|$|E
25|$|ERCP or an <b>endoscopic</b> {{ultrasound}} {{can also}} be used if a biliary cause for pancreatitis is suspected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> evaluation, via {{colonoscopy}} or flexible sigmoidoscopy, is {{the procedure}} of choice if the diagnosis remains unclear. Ischemic colitis has a distinctive <b>endoscopic</b> appearance; endoscopy can also facilitate alternate diagnoses such as infection or inflammatory bowel disease. Biopsies {{can be taken}} via endoscopy to provide more information. Visible light spectroscopy, performed using catheters placed through the 5mm channel of the endoscope, is diagnostic (see Diagnosis).|$|E
25|$|An imaging {{study with}} {{characteristic}} changes. CT, MRI, abdominal ultrasound or <b>endoscopic</b> ultrasound {{can be used}} for diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> OCT {{has been}} applied to the {{detection}} and diagnosis of cancer and precancerous lesions, such as Barrett's esophagus and esophageal dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{anesthesia}} also facilitates some <b>endoscopic</b> procedures such as bronchoscopy (visualization of {{the lower}} airways) or cystoscopy (visualization of the inner surface of the bladder).|$|E
25|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> {{therapy with}} botulinum toxin, known also as Botox, {{can also be}} used to improve {{dysphagia}} which stabilizes unintentional weight loss, but the effect has limited effect on other symptoms, including pain, while also being a temporary treatment lasting a few weeks. Finally, pneumatic dilatation of the esophagus, which is an <b>endoscopic</b> technique where a high-pressure balloon is used to stretch the muscles of the LES, can be performed to improve symptoms, but again no clinical improvement is seen in regards to motility.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> {{thoracic}} sympathectomy (ETS) is {{a surgical}} procedure {{in which a}} portion of the sympathetic nerve trunk in the thoracic region is destroyed.|$|E
25|$|To date, Schwartz has co-authored {{more than}} 175 {{research}} articles, 65 book chapters, {{as well as}} co-editing two neurosurgical textbooks {{on the subject of}} <b>endoscopic</b> surgery.|$|E
25|$|These {{approaches}} are 2D solutions for a 3D problem, therefore {{the results are}} not optimal. Distraction osteogenesis and minimal invasive <b>endoscopic</b> surgery are yet in experimental phase.|$|E
25|$|FEES (Fibreoptic <b>endoscopic</b> {{evaluation}} of swallowing), sometimes with sensory evaluation, is done usually by a Medical Speech Pathologist or Deglutologist. This procedure involves the patient eating different consistencies as above.|$|E
25|$|The minimal {{invasive}} <b>endoscopic</b> surgery {{has been}} gaining attention since the early 90’s, however, it has technical limitations (only strip craniectomy is possible). Attempts {{have been made to}} reach beyond these limits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> mucosal {{resection}} {{has also}} been evaluated as a management technique. Additionally an operation known as a Nissen fundoplication can reduce the reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|Less {{invasive}} <b>endoscopic</b> {{techniques have}} been done outside of the United States for some time. Recovery times are reported to be faster. However, this technique is not yet mainstream among surgeons in the US.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 43 to 75% {{of horses}} have {{blood in the}} trachea and bronchi {{following}} a single post-race <b>endoscopic</b> examination. In one study, all horses endoscoped on at least three separate occasions following racing had EIPH at least once.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{assessment}} includes {{measurement of the}} blood pressure and heart rate, as well as blood tests to determine hemoglobin concentration. In significant bleeding, fluid replacement is often required, as well as blood transfusion, before the source of bleeding can be determined by endoscopy of the upper digestive tract with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Depending on the source, <b>endoscopic</b> therapy {{can be applied to}} reduce rebleeding risk. Specific medical treatments (such as proton pump inhibitors for peptic ulcer disease) or procedures (such as TIPS for variceal hemorrhage) may be used. Recurrent or refractory bleeding may lead to need for surgery, although this has become uncommon as a result of improved <b>endoscopic</b> and medical treatment.|$|E
25|$|In a hysteroscopic {{myomectomy}} (also called transcervical resection), the fibroid can {{be removed}} by either {{the use of a}} resectoscope, an <b>endoscopic</b> instrument inserted through the vagina and cervix that can use high-frequency electrical energy to cut tissue, or a similar device.|$|E
25|$|Gastroscopy (<b>endoscopic</b> {{examination}} of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) is performed in patients with established cirrhosis to exclude the possibility of esophageal varices. If these are found, prophylactic local therapy may be applied (sclerotherapy or banding) and beta blocker treatment may be commenced.|$|E
25|$|Other common causes include trauma, {{autoimmune}} disease, {{high blood}} calcium, hypothermia, and <b>endoscopic</b> retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Pancreas divisum {{is a common}} congenital malformation of the pancreas that may underlie some recurrent cases. Diabetes mellitus type2 {{is associated with a}} 2.8-fold higher risk.|$|E
25|$|In severe cases, a <b>Endoscopic</b> {{thoracic}} sympathectomy (ETS) procedure can be performed. Here, {{the nerves}} that signal {{the blood vessels}} of the fingertips to constrict are surgically cut. Microvascular surgery of the affected areas is another possible therapy however this procedure {{should be considered as}} a last resort.|$|E
25|$|Gastroscopy, or <b>endoscopic</b> {{evaluation}} of the stomach, is useful in chronic cases of colic suspected {{to be caused by}} gastric ulcers, gastric impactions, and gastric masses. A 3-meter scope is required to visualize the stomach of most horses, and the horse must be fasted prior to scoping.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} {{diagnosis is}} {{the recovery of}} adult worms either by coughing them up or removing them with forceps, a bronchoscope, or <b>endoscopic</b> instruments. However, worms might be difficult to remove if firmly attached to the bronchial walls. Finding M. laryngeus eggs in the sputum or feces is another sure sign of infection.|$|E
25|$|Arthroscopic (also <b>endoscopic</b> spinal procedures) allow {{access to}} and {{treatment}} of spinal conditions with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. Recovery times are greatly reduced due to the relatively small size of incision(s), and many patients are treated as outpatients. Recovery rates and times vary according to condition severity and the patient's overall health.|$|E
25|$|The {{complications}} of SEMS {{are related to}} a number of factors. The first is that the <b>endoscopic</b> procedure used to insert a SEMS involves the use of sedative medications, which may lead to oversedation, aspiration, or drug reaction. SEMS also expand and can lead to perforation of the bowel or compression of structures adjacent to the bowel.|$|E
25|$|A colonic {{stricture}} is {{a band of}} {{scar tissue}} which forms {{as a result of}} the ischemic injury and narrows the lumen of the colon. Strictures are often treated observantly; they may heal spontaneously over 12–24 months. If a bowel obstruction develops {{as a result of the}} stricture, surgical resection is the usual treatment, although <b>endoscopic</b> dilatation and stenting have also been employed.|$|E
25|$|People with Barrett {{esophagus}} (a {{change in}} the cells lining the lower esophagus) are at much higher risk, and may receive regular <b>endoscopic</b> screening for the early signs of cancer. Because the benefit of screening for adenocarcinoma in people without symptoms is unclear, it is not recommended in the United States. Some {{areas of the world}} with high rates of squamous-carcinoma have screening programs.|$|E
