25|$|Roger Smyth was {{the first}} of Trevor’s two Ph.D. {{students}} and Trevor always spoke enthusiastically about their work together, which spanned many years. Roger was employed as a civil servant in the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services, and so did his Mathematics outside of his working hours. Apart from the fact that Trevor got on very well with Roger, it suited Trevor to have Roger among his Northern Ireland friends and informants on political matters. In a different way, Alastair Gillespie was well placed in Edinburgh where there were rugby matches to attend <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> while the Cork connection with Gerard was a different kind of overlap of interests. By the way, the collaboration with Rien Kaashoek did not seem to have any similar coincidence but they did travel often between Dublin and Amsterdam to collaborate. Rainer Nagel of Tubingen was also a close contact of Trevor’s but not a co-author.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} redone by the Will & Grace cast as [...] "He's Hot" [...] for the sitcom's soundtrack in 2004 and even {{includes}} vocal samples from Madonna herself. Almost {{all of the}} instrumental part of the song [...] "He's Hot!" [...] uses samples from the original song. The Canadian teen drama , which is known for naming each episode after an 80s hit song, named a two-part episode after [...] "Holiday". In 2006, critics noted strong similarity between [...] "Holiday" [...] and American singer Jessica Simpson's single [...] "A Public Affair". When criticized for its unoriginality, Simpson told MTV: [...] "I think people are ready to hear something that Madonna used to do. We all need to hear that <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> It wasn't a sample or something I meant to do, but she did influence me and still does today." [...] In 2008, [...] "Holiday" [...] appeared on the video game [...] Kelis often performs a mash-up of her own hit [...] "Milkshake" [...] with [...] "Holiday" [...] live. In 2003, a snippet of the song appeared in the film Rugrats Go Wild, when the families went on their cruise.|$|E
500|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{praise from}} video game journalists {{at the time}} of its release and in retrospect. Andy Greenwald of Spin magazine praised it as a frightening but [...] "restrained" [...] game. Jon Thompson of AllGame stated: [...] "Silent Hill 2 feels a bit rushed, and although it might not live up to the dizzying horror of the first game, it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel." [...] IGN's Doug Perry wrote: [...] "It's frightening, deep, clever, and tries to improve the genre, if just a little, and in the end, that's all I really want in a survival horror game." [...] Joe Fielder of GameSpot concluded, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than the original." [...] In [...] (2010), Tristian Donovan described Silent Hill 2 as the [...] "high point" [...] of the series. In a retrospective article on the survival horror genre, IGN writer Jim Sterling praised the game's plot as [...] "one of the finest examples of narrative construction in gaming to this day". In another retrospective article on survival horror, fellow IGN writer Travis Fahs credited the game as a factor in the [...] "short-lived period of renewed interest in horror games". Online game critic for [...] The Escapist Magazine Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw lists this game as among his top five favourite games of all time, praising it for its thick and unsettling atmosphere creating tension and fear for players. In his review of the game he commented, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is the game I replay <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> to remind myself that for all the shiny brown, quick-time event, RPG element space marines, gaming is still worth defending," [...] and that [...] "It's a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{was charged}} with {{investigating}} a detailed letter by 11th Light Infantry Brigade soldier Tom Glen, which backed up rumored allegations of the My Lai Massacre. He wrote: [...] "In direct refutation of this portrayal {{is the fact that}} relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." [...] Later, Powell's assessment would be described as whitewashing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004 Powell said to television and radio host Larry King, [...] "I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> but they are still to be deplored." ...|$|E
2500|$|The person {{leading the}} {{congregation}} in public prayers {{is called the}} shaliaḥ tzibbur (Hebrew for [...] " [...] of the congregation"). Jewish law restricts this role to adult Jews. In theory, any lay person can be a shaliaḥ tzibbur; most synagogue-attending Jews will serve in this role <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> Someone with good Hebrew pronunciation is preferred. In practice, those with the best voice and the most knowledge of the prayers serve most often. As public worship {{was developed in the}} Geonic period and as the knowledge of the Hebrew language declined, singing gradually superseded the didactic and hortatory element in the worship in the synagogue. Thus, while the idea of a cantor as a paid professional does not exist in classical rabbinic sources, the office of the hazzan increased in importance with the centuries, evolving a specialized skill set and becoming a career in itself.|$|E

2500|$|John Thaw starred as Detective Inspector John [...] "Jack" [...] Regan, a tough police officer, often {{frustrated}} by Scotland Yard's red tape. Originally from Manchester (like Thaw himself), {{he has been}} in London for several years, so his accent has modified, but traces of his northern origins are still evident. He also refers to his northern roots <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> (his poor upbringing, his father's work on the Manchester Ship Canal), which brings banter from George Carter, a Londoner, such as humming [...] "The Red Flag". A heavy drinker and smoker (comically, he is sometimes seen stealing other people's cigarettes), Regan has some success with the ladies – although not as much as Carter, or in one episode, DCI Haskins. He can be seen as quick with his fists. He has an ex-wife, Kate, and daughter, Susie, and in the last episode of the first series, [...] "Abduction", Susie is kidnapped.|$|E
2500|$|While {{he was in}} college, from 1975 to 1978, {{he handled}} [...] "labor and budget matters" [...] as an {{assistant}} to the city manager of Edmond, Oklahoma (1980 population of 34,637). His White House biography stated that he had emergency services oversight in this position. However, the head of public relations for the city was quoted as denying that Brown had oversight over anybody and that [...] "the assistant is more like an intern." [...] She said, [...] "Mike used to handle a lot of details. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> I'd ask him to write me a speech. He was very loyal. He was always on time. He always had on a suit and a starched white shirt." [...] However, Claudia Deakins, the spokesperson for the City of Edmond, submitted information to the House Committee investigating Hurricane Katrina that Time Magazine, which described his resume as [...] "padded," [...] had taken her quotes out of context, and erroneously reported Brown's position at the City of Edmond. The former Mayor of Edmond, Carl Reherman, and the former City Attorney, Mary Ann Karns, each submitted affidavits to the House investigating committee showing that Brown did have emergency management experience.|$|E
2500|$|Colin Powell, then a 31-year-old Army major {{serving as}} an {{assistant}} chief of staff of operations for the Americal Division, was charged with investigating the letter, which did not specifically refer to Mỹ Lai, as Glen had limited knowledge of the events there. In his report, Powell wrote, [...] "In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between Americal Division soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." [...] Powell's handling of the assignment was later characterized by some observers as [...] "whitewashing" [...] the atrocities of Mỹ Lai. In May 2004, Powell, then United States Secretary of State, told CNN's Larry King, [...] "I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> but they are still to be deplored." [...] Indeed, in 1966, the so called Bình Hòa massacre at the hands of South Korean troops already occurred in Quảng Ngãi Province; in February 1968, in neighboring Quảng Nam province, during a similar to Muscatine counterinsurgency search-and-destroy operation, the Phong Nhị and Phong Nhất massacre and the purported Hà My massacre were committed by South Korean Marines. As for the U.S. military, seven months prior to the My Lai Massacre, on Robert McNamara's order, the Inspector General of the U.S. Defense Department investigated press coverage of alleged atrocities committed in South Vietnam. In August 1967, the 200-page report [...] "Alleged Atrocities by U.S. Military Forces in South Vietnam" [...] was completed. It concluded that many American troops did not fully understand the Geneva Conventions. No action was taken, however.|$|E
