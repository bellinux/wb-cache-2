40|$|Abstract Background Intrapartum {{complications}} {{and the use}} of obstetric interventions are more common in primiparous childbirth than in multiparous childbirth, leading to concern about out of hospital birth for primiparous women. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the effect of birthplace on perinatal and maternal morbidity {{and the use of}} obstetric interventions differed by parity among low-risk women intending to give birth in a <b>freestanding</b> midwifery <b>unit</b> or in an obstetric unit in the North Denmark Region. Methods The study is a secondary analysis of data from a matched cohort study including 839 low-risk women intending birth in a <b>freestanding</b> midwifery <b>unit</b> (primary participants) and 839 low-risk women intending birth in an obstetric unit (individually matched control group). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Conditional logistic regression analysis was applied to compute odds ratios and effect ratios with 95 % confidence intervals for matched pairs stratified by parity. Results On no outcome did the effect of birthplace differ significantly between primiparous and multiparous women. Compared with their counterparts intending birth in an obstetric unit, both primiparous and multiparous women intending birth in a <b>freestanding</b> midwifery <b>unit</b> were significantly more likely to have an uncomplicated, spontaneous birth with good outcomes for mother and infant and less likely to require caesarean section, instrumental delivery, augmented labour or epidural analgesia (although for caesarean section this trend did not attain statistical significance for multiparous women). Perinatal outcomes were comparable between the two birth settings irrespective of parity. Compared to multiparas, transfer rates were substantially higher for primiparas, but fell over time while rates for multiparas remained stable. Conclusions <b>Freestanding</b> midwifery <b>units</b> appear to confer significant advantages over obstetric units to both primiparous and multiparous mothers, while their infants are equally safe in both settings. Our findings thus support the provision of care in <b>freestanding</b> midwifery <b>units</b> as an alternative to care in obstetric units for all low-risk women regardless of parity. In view of the global rise in caesarean section rates, we consider it an important finding that <b>freestanding</b> midwifery <b>units</b> show potential for reducing first-birth caesarean...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on {{analysis}} of a series of ethnographic case studies of midwifery units in England. Midwifery units 1 are spaces that were developed to provide more home-like and less medically oriented care for birth that would support physiological processes of labour, women’s comfort and a positive experience of birth for women and their families. They are run by midwives, either on a hospital site alongside an obstetric unit (Alongside Midwifery Unit – AMU) or a <b>freestanding</b> <b>unit</b> away from an obstetric unit (Freestanding Midwifery Unit – FMU). Midwifery units have been designed and intended specifically as locations of wellbeing and although the meaning of the term is used very loosely in public discourse, this claim is supported by a large epidemiological study, which found that they provide safe care for babies while reducing use of medical interventions and with better health outcomes for the women. Our research indicated that midwifery units function as a protected space, one which uses domestic features as metaphors of home in order to promote a sense of wellbeing and to re-normalise concepts of birth, which had become inhabited by medical models and a preoccupation with risk. However, we argue that this protected space has a function for midwives as well as for birthing women. Midwifery units are intended to support midwives’ wellbeing following decades of professional struggles to maintain autonomy, midwife-led care and a professional identity founded on supporting normal, healthy birth. This development, which is focused on place of birth rather than other aspects of maternity care such as continuity, shows potential for restoring wellbeing on individual, professional and community levels, through improving rates of normal physiological birth and improving experiences of providing and receiving care. Nevertheless, this very focus also poses challenges for health service providers attempting to provide a ‘social model of care’ within an institutional context...|$|E

Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light.

40|$|Abstract Background Midwifery units offer care {{to women}} with {{straightforward}} pregnancies, but unforeseen complications can arise during labour or soon after birth, necessitating {{transfer to a}} hospital obstetric unit. In England, 21 % of women planning birth in <b>freestanding</b> midwifery <b>units</b> are transferred; in alongside units, the transfer rate is 26 %. There is little high quality contemporary evidence on women’s experience of transfer. Methods We carried out a qualitative interview study, using semi-structured interviews, with {{women who had been}} transferred from a midwifery <b>unit</b> (<b>freestanding</b> or alongside) in England up to 12 months prior to interview. Maximum variation sampling was used. Interviews with 30 women took place between March 2009 and March 2010. Thematic analysis using constant comparison and exploration of deviant cases was carried out. Results Most women hoped for or expected a natural birth and did not expect to be transferred. Transfer was disappointing for many; sensitive and supportive care and preparation for the need for transfer helped women adjust to their changing circumstances. A small number of women, often in the context of prolonged labour, described transfer as a relief. For women transferred from <b>freestanding</b> <b>units,</b> the ambulance journey was a “limbo” period. Women wondered, worried or were fearful about what was to come and could be passive participants who felt like they were being “transported” rather than cared for. For many this was a direct contrast with the care they experienced in the midwifery unit. After transfer, most women appreciated the opportunity to talk about their experience {{to make sense of what}} happened and help them plan for future pregnancies, but did not necessarily seek this out if it was not offered. Conclusions Transfer affects a significant minority of women planning birth in midwifery units and is therefore a concern for women and midwives. Transfer is not expected by women, but sensitive care and preparation can help women adjust to changing circumstances. Particular sensitivity around decision-making may be required by midwives caring for women during prolonged labour. Some apparently straightforward changes to practice have the potential to make an important difference to women’s experience of ambulance transfer. </p...|$|R

Setting: Tower Hamlets, a deprived inner city borough in east London, England, 2007 - 2010. Participants: 620 women who were resident in Tower Hamlets and who satisfied the Barts and the London NHS Trust’s eligibility criteria for using the birth centre. Of these, 259 women were recruited to Phase 1 and 361 to Phase 2. Measurements and findings: Women who satisfied the criteria for birth centre care and who booked antenatally for care at the birth centre {{were significantly more likely to}} rate their care as good or very good overall than corresponding women who also satisfied these criteria but booked initially at the hospital. Women who started labour care in spontaneous labour at the birth centre were significantly more likely to be cared for by a midwife they had already met, have one to one care in labour and have the same midwife with them throughout their labour. They were also significantly more likely to report that the staff were kind and understanding, that they were treated with respect and dignity and that their privacy was respected.

Of these, 167 women started their intrapartum care at the Birth Centre and 166 started care at the Royal London Hospital. Measurements and findings Women who planned their birth at the Birth Centre experienced continuous intrapartum midwifery care, higher rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery, greater use of a birth pool, lower rates of epidural use, higher rates of established breastfeeding and a longer post-natal stay, compared with those who planned for care in the hospital. The total average cost per mother-baby dyad for care where mothers started their intrapartum care at the Birth Centre was £ 1296. 23, approximately £ 850 per patient less than the average cost per mother and baby who received all their care at the Royal London Hospital.

It is argued {{that it is possible}} to envision a continuum of church organizational structures, ranging from a branch office, through various forms of franchise arrangements (including company owned, business format, and trademark franchises) to <b>freestanding</b> entrepreneurial <b>units.</b> By studying those situations where the franchise model explains denominational behavior, and contrasting them with those situations where the franchise model is not a good fit, we can learn more about denominational structures.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis article {{aimed to}} provide {{estimates}} and {{analyses of the}} cost of providing voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services for HIV/AIDS in a province in northern Vietnam. MethodsThis facility-based costing study was conducted in the Thai Nguyen province, located 85 km north of Hanoi. Cost data were collected in six facility-based VCT <b>units</b> and two <b>freestanding</b> ones by using an ingredient approach. Both financial and economic costs of VCT services for HIV/AIDS were estimated {{from the perspective of the}} service providers. ResultsThe mean total annual financial costs of a facility-based and a <b>freestanding</b> VCT <b>unit</b> in the study site were US $ 15, 673 and US $ 42, 237, respectively. The mean total annual economic costs of these services were US $ 16, 695 and US $ 44, 682, respectively. The cost per visit to the facility-based VCT unit was lower than in the freestanding facility (financial cost of US $ 28. 4 vs. US $ 36. 8; economic cost of US $ 30. 3 vs. US $ 38. 9). The same was true for the cost per complete VCT procedure (financial cost of US $ 34. 7 vs. US $ 38. 0; economic cost of US $ 36. 9 vs. US $ 40. 2). The cost per HIV positive case detected in facility-based VCT unit was higher than that of the <b>freestanding</b> VCT <b>unit</b> (financial cost of US $ 149. 3 vs. US $ 111. 2; economic cost of US $ 159. 0 vs. US $ 117. 6). ConclusionsThe results of the present study offer preliminary evidence on economic aspects of providing VCT services in Vietnam. The findings from this study can serve as a basis for further studies as well as for program and policy development...|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{research}} is about midwifery one-to-one support in labour. One-to-one support in labour {{is associated with}} improved birth outcomes. However, uncertainty exists as {{to what it is}} that produces such positive birth outcomes. UK publications advocate the midwife to provide one-to-one support in labour, but research findings question their ability to focus entirely on women due to their medical, technological and documentation responsibilities. All of these studies were based within hospital environments and none were completed in the UK. This indicates a gap in knowledge concerning how midwifery one-to-one support translates into practice in the UK and within midwife–led environments. Methods: The aim of this research was to explore midwifery one-to-one support in labour in a real world context of midwife-led care. An ethnographic approach was completed over three case study sites (Alongside midwife-led <b>unit,</b> <b>freestanding</b> midwife-led <b>unit</b> and women’s homes) each including ten labouring women receiving midwifery one-to-one support in labour. Findings: Two main themes: Balancing the needs of the woman and balancing the needs of the NHS organisation. Inside the birth environment midwives used their knowledge, experience, intuition and motivation to balance six components. These included presence, midwife-woman relationships, coping strategies, labour progress, birthing partners and midwifery support. Outside the birth environment midwives experienced surveillance and territorial behaviours which were heightened during transfer from a midwife-led birth environment to the labour ward. Conclusion: When a ratio of one midwife to one woman was achieved, midwives were 100...|$|R
