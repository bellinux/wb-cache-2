40|$|THESIS 8680 The {{link between}} dietary and {{lifestyle}} behaviours {{and the development}} of chronic diseases is well established. It is also widely acknowledged that obesity linked with insufficient <b>exercise</b> <b>contributes</b> to health problems and that, conversely, weight reducing diets may compromise dietary intake of key nutrients. It is often advocated that poor dietary and lifestyle practices should be tackled through education. One of the aims of the Irish Home Economics curriculum is to teach secondary school pupils about nutrition and lifestyle practices conducive to health. However, the lifestyle practices and attitudes of those teaching this subject in Ireland have never been examined...|$|R

40|$|The {{constant}} {{growth of}} the elderly population in Brazil {{and in the world}} is an important indication that people are living longer, but it doesn’t mean they’re living better. The aging process is linked to significant loss of a person’s abilities, both physical and functional, leading to reduced independency of the elderly. Studying the related literature, it’s possible to realize that physical <b>exercise</b> <b>contributes</b> significantly to the maintenance of physical fitness in the elderly.

Separate structural equation models of relationships between physical exercise and 3 cognitive performance variables—reaction time (RT), working memory, and reasoning—fit the data well.

There were also indirect effects of age and health on performance variables, mediated through exercise. The main hypothesis of the study, that <b>exercise</b> <b>contributes</b> to performance, was supported.

To facilitate effective data collection, they made detailed arrangements in advance, collected “talk aloud ” data that captured women’s decisions, and maintained accurate records.

30|$|Rights {{are seen}} as {{beneficial}} features which arose only in a social situation.

Rights, like laws and institutions, are bound up with the realizations of individuals and their needs. “This foundation, in Green’s view, means that an individual exercising rights is intrinsically, or involuntarily, recognizing the common good. The capacity for rights in individuals is a social phenomenon; it can be guided and moralized through such institutions of society as the family. … unequal freedom of contract, unlicensed drink traffic, and insanitary homes, and going beyond Green’s stipulations, bad wages and fluctuations and seasonal employment, could affect the individual’s capacity for exercising rights.

50|$|Finally, {{geriatric}} rehabilitation {{has a large}} {{influence on}} the growing life expectancy around the globe. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) surveyed 556 adults over 65 years old {{in order to gain}} an understanding on the factors that affect adherence to an exercise program. Adherence to an exercise program influences frailty, speed, ability to live independently, and best of all, life expectancy. The study compared two factors: exercise barriers and motivation. The study concluded that exercise barriers play the largest role in determining adherence to a home exercise program (HEP). According to APTA, motivators include self-efficacy, the ability to control behavior, and outcome expectation, the belief that consequences follow certain actions. APTA describes barriers as: insufficient time, lack of social support, no place to exercise, limited finances, no transportation, and the fear of falling. Researchers recently found that depression, stress levels, increased age, decreased health status and lack of pleasure while <b>exercising</b> <b>contribute</b> to <b>exercise</b> adherence.|$|R

Those protocols using a high volume of training for young adults showed a greater fibrinolytic response, and training protocols with intensities above 80 % of 1 maximum repetition showed an increased platelet activity.

40|$|Aggression in South African {{schools is}} a matter of great concern. A review of the {{existing}} literature indicated that physical <b>exercises</b> <b>contribute</b> to people’s well-being. This study thus investigated to what extent physical exercises could be used to address the aggression of students in a secondary school. An empirical investigation was done by means of a mixed methods case study design. A purposive sample of 25 students was chosen from students in grades 9 to 11. The students completed an adapted Buss-Perry questionnaire on aggression to determine their levels of aggression. Thereafter they embarked on a 10 week physical exercise programme (30 sessions of 40 minutes each), before completing the same questionnaire. The results indicated that the programme alleviated their feelings of aggression, especially in the boys. Qualitative interviews with 10 of the participants who benefitted most from the exercises indicated how they experienced the programme.
