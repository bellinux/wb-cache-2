5|$|Radial {{cleavage}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{divisions of}} the egg {{appears to be the}} original condition for the ancestral bilaterians, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> Ecdysozoa and possibly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> Eutrochozoa, a major sub-group of the Lophotrochozoa. Hence radial cleavage does not imply that brachiopods are affiliated with deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the arctometatarsus first evolved; {{it was not}} present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> tyrannosauroids like Dilong, but {{was found in the}} later Appalachiosaurus. This {{structure}} also characterized troodontids, ornithomimids and caenagnathids, but its absence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> tyrannosauroids indicates that it was acquired by convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|Another officially {{published}} doctrinal {{change was}} {{that women in}} the church {{would be allowed to}} wear makeup. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> years of the denomination, Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women. In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted, but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching. In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{published}} {{accounts of}} the killings, in August and September 1950, two North Korean journalists with the advancing northern troops reported finding an estimated 400 bodies in the No Gun Ri area, and seeing some 200 bodies in one tunnel.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> version, Uttanka is {{described}} as the disciple of the sage Veda. In the second version, his guru is Gautama. In both legends, he is a learned sage who goes through many hurdles in procuring the earrings demanded by his guru's wife as the fee for the teacher (gurudakshina).|$|E
5|$|The SS90 was {{an early}} {{prototype}} round used only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> examples of the P90. It used a lightweight 1.5-g (23grain) {{full metal jacket bullet}} with a polymer core, which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s). The SS90 was abandoned in 1994 in favor of the heavier and shorter 2.7 mm (0.11in) SS190 projectile.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Jerusalem was carried by Abu Ubaidah under Umar the Great <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> period of Islam along with Plague of Emmaus. The {{epidemic}} is famous in Muslim sources {{because of the}} death of many prominent companions of Muhammad.|$|E

5|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{translations}} which aim to present the Gododdin as literature rather than as a subject of scholarly study. Examples are the translation by Joseph P.

5|$|German {{submarine}} U-36 was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{which served}} during World War II. She was constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{days of the}} U-boat arm at Kiel in 1936, and served in the pre-war Navy in the Baltic Sea and North Sea under Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Klaus Ewerth. Korvettenkapitän (K.Kapt.)Wilhelm Fröhlich took command in October 1938 and continued in the role until the boat was lost.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{days of the}} Vietnam War, North Vietnam {{supplied}} the Viet Cong in the South by two methods. The first was to extend the Ho Chi Minh Trail southward into the tri-border region of Laos/Cambodia/South Vietnam. The Trail, a labyrinth of paths, roads, river transportation systems and way-stations, was constantly being expanded and improved. It served as a logistical jugular vein, {{for both men and}} material, for the North Vietnamese war effort against South Vietnam. The second method was to transport supplies by sea.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{forms of}} the story, the woman's pig-like {{appearance}} {{was the result of}} witchcraft. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that the choice was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{stages of}} the First World War the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without {{submarines}} suitable {{to operate in the}} narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. By 18 August 1914, two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium, the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun.|$|E
5|$|Large {{particle}} accelerators can replicate {{the conditions that}} prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement {{of the details of}} the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into high energy regimes. Consequently, the state of the universe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.|$|E

5|$|Neuropsychological tests {{such as the}} mini–mental state {{examination}} (MMSE) are widely {{used to evaluate the}} cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> stages of the disease. Neurological examination in early AD will usually provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including other causes of dementia.|$|E
5|$|The Ignudi, {{although}} all seated, are less physically constrained than the Ancestors of Christ. While the pairs of the monochrome {{male and female}} figures above the spandrels are mirrors of each other, these Ignudi are all different. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> paintings, they are paired, their poses being similar but with variation. These variations become greater with each pair until the postures of the final four bear no relation to each other whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> advertisement {{but it was}} not featured until March 1974. This was the same size as a desktop calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was not nearly as sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
