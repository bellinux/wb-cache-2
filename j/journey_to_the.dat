5|$|Dragon Ball was loosely {{modeled on}} the classic Chinese novel <b>Journey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West. Torishima said he chose it largely {{because it was a}} free {{intellectual}} property, but also because its Chinese setting was not common in manga at the time and would make it both unique and differentiate it from Dr. Slumps West Coast of the United States feel. While the characters in <b>Journey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West travel to collect sacred scrolls, Toriyama added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give the characters a game-like activity of gathering something in order to appeal to its shōnen magazine audience. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought the story would last about a year, or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama said that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at an older audience.|$|E
