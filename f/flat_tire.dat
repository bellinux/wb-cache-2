This combined with the ABS and standard Carbon Ceramic brakes have caused a reduction in stopping distance from 100-0 km/h (62-0 mph) to 32.5 m. Tests have shown the car will stop from 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 90 ft or in 85 ft with run <b>flat</b> <b>tires,</b> 85 ft from 60 mph (97 km/h) and 80 ft from 60 mph (97 km/h) with run <b>flat</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R

25|$|Once an Accident, Out of Gas, or <b>Flat</b> <b>Tire</b> hazard {{has been}} played, and the {{appropriate}} remedy card played to correct it, the player must next play a Roll card {{in order to get}} moving again. A hazard can be played onto an opponent's battle area even if another one is already showing, but only the topmost hazard needs to be corrected before that player can use a Roll card. Playing a Roll against a Stop hazard corrects it and allows the player to start moving; a second Roll is not needed.|$|E
