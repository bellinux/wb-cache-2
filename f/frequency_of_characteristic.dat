40|$|Abstract In this study, {{chromosomal}} inversion polymorphism data for a natural population of Drosophila subobscura from a swampy region {{near the town}} of Apatin (Serbia) were compared with data for the same population collected approximately 15 years earlier. The pattern of {{chromosomal inversion}} polymorphism changed over time. There were significant increases in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristic</b> southern latitude ("warm" adapted) chromosomal arrangements and significant decreases in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristic</b> northern latitude ("cold" adapted) chromosomal arrangements in the O and U chromosomes. The chromosomal arrangements O 3 + 4 and O 3 + 4 + 22 (derived from the O 3 + 4 arrangement) showed significant increases in 2008 and 2009 with regard to the 1994 sample. There was also a significant increase (~ 50 %) in the U 1 + 2 arrangement, while U 1 + 8 + 2 (a typical southern arrangement) was detected for the first time. Since the Apatin swampy population ofD. subobscura has existed {{for a long time in}} a stable habitat with high humidity that has not been changed by man our results indicate that natural selection has produced chromosomal changes in response to the increase in temperature that has occurred in the Balkan Peninsula of central southeastern European.

40|$|In {{the recent}} high beta H-mode {{experiments}} in JFT- 2 M tokamak, total beta value above ~ 2. 5 % is obtained. The high performance plasma is obtained in high density region (normalized density ~ 1) with high triangularity ~ 0. 7 in the limiter configuration. Suppression {{of the low}} frequency (< 10 kHz) MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) oscillations {{is very important to}} obtain such high beta plasma. We find a stabilization of low mode MHD oscillation by current profile control by ramp-up of plasma current, counter neutral beam injection and inward shift of the plasma column. In the study of MHD oscillations in the edge transport barrier, we observe precursor MHD oscillations in density before the intermittent ELMs (edge localized modes), or two kinds (low frequency and high <b>frequency)</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristic</b> quasi-coherent MHD oscillations (~ 70 kHz to ~ 310 kHz) in density, or in magnetic field, or in potential.

40|$|The Alps {{provide a}} high habitat {{diversity}} for plant species, structured by broad- and fine-scale abiotic site conditions. In man-made grasslands, vegetation composition is additionally {{affected by the}} type of landuse. We recorded vegetation composition in 216 parcels of grassland in 12 municipalities representing an area of 170 × 70 km in the south-eastern part of the Swiss Alps. Each parcel was characterized by a combination of altitudinal level (valley, intermediate, alp), traditional landuse (mown, grazed), current management (mown, grazed, abandoned), and fertilization (unfertilized, fertilized). For each parcel we also assessed the abiotic factors aspect, slope, pH value, and geographic coordinates, and for each municipality annual precipitation and its cultural tradition. We analysed vegetation composition using (i) variation partitioning in RDA, (ii) cover of graminoids, non-legume forbs, and legumes, and (iii) dominance and frequency of species. Species composition was determined by, in decreasing order of variation explained, landuse, broad-scale abiotic factors, fine-scale abiotic factors, and cultural tradition. Current socio-economically motivated landuse changes, such as grazing of unfertilized former meadows or their abandonment, strongly affect vegetation composition. In our study, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristic</b> meadow species was significantly smaller in grazed and even smaller in abandoned parcels than in still mown ones, suggesting less severe consequences of grazing for vegetation composition than of abandonment. Therefore, low-intensity grazing and mowing every few years should be considered valuable conservation alternatives to abandonment. Furthermore, because each landuse type was characterized by different species, a high variety of landuse types should be promoted to preserve plant species diversity in Alpine grasslands...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} (N) deposition {{has been}} identified as a major threat to biodiversity, but field surveys of its effects have rarely focussed on sites which are actively managed to maintain characteristic species. We analysed permanent quadrat data from 106 plots in nature reserves on calcareous grassland sites in the United Kingdom collected during a survey between 1990 and 1993 and compared the data with the results from resurvey of 48 of these plots between 2006 and 2009. N deposition showed no significant spatial association with species richness, species diversity, or the frequency of species adapted to low nutrient conditions in the 1990 – 1993 dataset. However, temporal analysis showed that N deposition was significantly associated with changes in Shannon diversity and evenness. In plots with high rates of N deposition, there was a decrease in species diversity and evenness, a decline in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristic</b> calcareous grassland species, and a lower number of rare and scarce species. As all sites had active management to maintain a high diversity and characteristic species, our results imply that even focussed management on nature conservation objectives cannot prevent adverse effects of high rates of N deposition. Structural equation modelling was used to compare different causal mechanisms to explain the observed effects. For change in Shannon diversity, direct effects of N deposition were the dominant mechanism and there was an independent effect of change in grazing intensity. In contrast, for change in herb species number, indirect effects on soil acidity, linked to both N and S deposition, were more important than direct effects of N deposition...|$|E

The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on metronidazole and tinidazole using FT-IR and UV spectroscopy. The study {{was carried out in}} two groups i. e. control and treatment. Treatment groups were subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment while no treatment was given to control group. FT-IR spectrum of treated metronidazole showed the impact of biofield treatment on <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristic</b> functional groups such as C=C (imidazole ring) stretching was appeared at lower frequency i. e. from 1600 cm- 1 to 1553 cm- 1. Likewise, NO 2 asymmetric stretching and C-N symmetric stretching were appeared at higher wave number i. e. 1479 cm- 1 to 1501 cm- 1 and 1070 cm- 1 to 1077 cm- 1, respectively. FT-IR spectrum of tinidazole showed shifting in absorption peak of C-N stretching to higher wavenumber from 1002 cm- 1 (control) to 1022 cm- 1. The wavenumber of aromatic C=C bond (in imidazole) was shifted to lower frequency, which could be due to increases in conjugation effect. Further, increases in wavenumber of NO 2 and C-N in treated sample suggested the increased force constant and bond strength as compared to control. Because of higher conjugation effect and increased bond strength, the molecule supposed to be more stable. The UV spectra of both metronidazole and tinidazole showed the similar patterns of lambda max (λmax) with respect to their control. The FT-IR results of both drugs suggest that there was an impact of biofield treatment on atomic level of metronidazole and tinidazole, as compared to control...|$|E

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that evaluated 239 children with typical development (between 3 and 13 years old) regarding the presence <b>of</b> 82 morphological <b>characteristics.</b> A previously described protocol, based on the London Dysmorphology Database, was applied to evaluate the sample. This protocol was culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. Results: The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> 82 morphological <b>characteristics</b> was established in the sample; <b>of</b> 82 <b>characteristics,</b> 50 % were considered morphological anomalies (frequency less than 4 %). At least 25 % of the sample presented more than one minor morphological anomaly. Age was shown to influence the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the following morphological characteristics: widow's peak, prominent antihelix, prominent upper lip, irregular or crowded teeth, and clinodactyly, but had no influence on the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> minor morphological anomalies.
