The activation of extracellular laccase in growing fungal culture with highly diluted mediators, ABTS and HBT is described. Two high laccase-producing fungal strains, Trametes versicolor and Cerrena unicolor, were used in this study as a source of enzyme. Selected dilutions of the mediators significantly increased the activity of extracellular laccase during 14 days of cultivation what was distinctly visible in PAGE technique and in colorimetric tests. The same mediator dilutions increased demethylation properties of laccase, which was demonstrated during incubation of enzyme with veratric acid.

There were also changes in the NADH oxidase activity, which is associated with methylation processes. Microscopic observations revealed the presence of numerous enlarged vacuoles in bacterial cells during the accumulation of large amounts of vanillic acid, and their disappearance together with a decrease in 4 -O-demethylase activity.

40|$|The {{intention}} of the work described in this thesis was to identify whether extremely high dilutions of antigen can induce changes in dendritic cell maturation and dendritic cell ability to initiate immune responses. Basic research performed trying to address whether such ultra-high, <b>homeopathic,</b> <b>dilutions</b> of antigen have a biological role is limited, while clinical investigations into this matter are inconclusive. Homeopathy is, however, gaining popularity, and is very often at the epicentre of intense scientific and medical debate.

While dendritic cells are excellent APCs, capable of inducing T cell responses 100 times more effectively than other lymphocytes, there is mounting evidence suggesting that they might also be involved in bacterial dissemination during Salmonella infections.

Furthermore, we assessed whether the APC derived cytokine, IL- 23, which shares the common p 40 subunit with IL- 12 p 70, is required for the development of primary, memory as well as protective immune responses against Salmonella typhimurium.

50|$|Several thinkers have {{strongly}} criticized Baudets thinking. Sociologist Jan Willem Duyvendak {{claims the}} exact opposite in fact regarding the political elite who is focused Dutch people on 'feeling at home', {{which was part of}} the Amsterdam political plans. The opening of the Nationaal Historisch Museum and the integration policies for immigrants are focused on adapting to the Dutch identity instead of assimilation of both immigrants as well as Dutch people. Duyvendak speaks of oikophily or oikomania instead. According to cultural philosopher Thijs Lijster Baudet is making a fallacy by mixing the public space, the city and the house as one thing. The rules inside the house differ from the ones in the city and the public space. This results in the distinction to regard certain groups of people as 'guests' instead of legal civilians. Musicologist Yuri Landman explains Baudet creates a paradox by stating modern art (and atonal music) are inferior in quality compared to pre-1900 art and music, while he also states that the Western culture is superior above any other culture and should be protected to what Baudet has called 'the <b>homeopathic</b> <b>dilution</b> of our culture' by immigrants with a different cultural background. If everything after 1900 is inferior, the contemporary Western culture can not be superior.

He claimed that homeopathic preparations of extremely high dilution, i.e. those likely to contain zero molecules {{of the original}} substance, are effective because, he said, [...] "the water gets impregnated with the information or memory of the original substance." [...] When asked to suggest a laboratory experiment that 20/20 could independently conduct {{as a way to}} test the legitimacy of homeopathy, Ullman recommended the Ennis experiment, a study that seemed to show that ultra-dilute solutions of histamine, diluted to the levels used in homeopathic remedies, could affect cells just as the controls did. The result of 20/20's experiment was negative; the <b>homeopathic</b> <b>dilution</b> failed to produce a measurable effect when compared to plain water. He claimed the test was flawed as it was not a direct replication of Ennis' work. However, this experiment and one run by the BBC were ruled to be valid by independent experts commissioned by the BBC. However, other experts considered this study seriously flawed. A review of this study that was published in the New Scientist deemed that it was too small to give definitive results. Further, the producer of the Horizon showed even acknowledged that there were problems with the counting methods used in this study. Additional problems {{was the fact that the}} BBC explicitly asserted that their experiment was a replication of Ennis study, but Ennis herself discovered that there were major differences between the two study.

40|$|Objectives: Advancements in {{nanotechnology}} {{have led}} to nanoparticle (NP) use in various fields of medicine. Although the potential of NPs is promising, the lack of documented evidence on the toxicological effects of NPs is concerning. A few studies have documented that homeopathy uses NPs. Unfortunately, very few sound scientific studies have explored the toxic effects of homeopathic drugs. Citing this lack of high-quality scientific evidence, regulatory agencies {{have been reluctant to}} endorse homeopathic treatment as an alternative or adjunct treatment. This study aimed to enhance our insight into the impact of commercially-available homeopathic drugs, to study the presence of NPs in those drugs and any deleterious effects they might have, and to determine the distribution pattern of NPs in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Methods: <b>Homeopathic</b> <b>dilutions</b> were studied using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). For the toxicity assessment on Zebrafish, embryos were exposed to a test solution from 4 - 6 hours post-fertilization, and embryos/larvae were assessed up to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) for viability and morphology. Toxicity was recorded in terms of mortality, hatching delay, phenotypic defects and metal accumulation. Around 5 dpf was found to be the optimum developmental stage for evaluation. Results: The present study aimed to conclusively prove the presence of NPs in all high <b>dilutions</b> of <b>homeopathic</b> drugs. Embryonic zebrafish were exposed to three homeopathic drugs with two potencies (30 CH, 200 CH) during early embryogenesis. The resulting morphological and cellular responses were observed. Exposure to these potencies produced no visibly significant malformations, pericardial edema, and mortality and no necrotic and apoptotic cellular death. Conclusion: Our findings clearly demonstrate that no toxic effects were observed for these three homeopathic drugs at the potencies and exposure times used in this study. The embryonic zebrafish model is recommended as a well-established method for rapidly assessing the toxicity of homeopathic drugs...|$|R

Ultra diluted latex was prepared in <b>homeopathic</b> <b>dilutions</b> 5 cH, 15 cH and 30 cH by dilution and agitation (trituration for solid and sucussion for liquid phases) using 70 Ã‚Âº GL (Gay Lussac) ethylic alcohol (70 Ã‚Âº GL EtOH 70 Ã‚ÂºGL) as inert medium according to the guidelines in FarmacopÃƒÂ©ia HomeopÃƒÂ¡tica Brasileira (FHB). Homeopathic medicine Euphorbia tirucalli was prepared from mother-tincture according to the centesimal Hahnemannian method. Solutions 0. 5 % and 5 % of 70 Ã‚ÂºGL EtOH were succussed and used as control. Human melanoma cells were cultured, treated and monitored by method MTT for 24 to 72 hours. It was observed that 0. 5 % 70 Ã‚ÂºGL EtOH solution had little or no effect on the proliferation of melanoma cells (5. 1 % maximal inhibition in dilution 30 cH). Positive correlation was observed in most groups between inhibition of proliferation and diluted preparations, maximal increase (9 %) was seen in with 5 % latex. Moreover, mother-tincture proved to be more active than latex; treatment with 0. 5 % solution of latex 30 cH exhibited 19. 7 % inhibition, whereas treatment with 0. 5 % solution of Euphorbia tirucalli 30 cH exhibited 32. 1 % inhibition of cell proliferation (p< 0. 05).

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of ultra-high dilutions of Thyroxine on the morphogenesis of Xenopus laevis tadpoles using potencies of 6 C, 30 C and 200 C, to determine if the effect is stimulatory or inhibitory to morphogenesis and whether the various potencies have similar or different effects on morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of Xenopus laevis, the African clawed frog, is dependent entirely on the thyroid system and the production of thyroxine; they require the initiation and maintenance of high levels of circulating thyroid hormones to make the transition from tadpole to juvenile frog.

40|$|Objective: Performing a {{study on}} a wheat growth bio assay with a <b>homeopathic</b> <b>dilution</b> of {{gibberellic}} acid at different seasons of the year. &# 13; Methods: Grains of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum, Capo variety) were observed {{under the influence of}} extremely diluted gibberellic acid (10 - 30, 30 x). Analogously prepared water was used for control. 15 experiments were performed, 9 in autumn season (5 researchers, 4, 440 grains per group), and 6 in winter / spring (4 researchers, with 3, 140 grains per group). &# 13; Results: All 9 autumn experiments showed less stalk growth in the verum group (p > 0. 01 in 4 cases, p > 0. 05 in 3, trend in 2 cases). Mean stalk lengths (mm) were 46. 97 + 20. 50 for verum and 50. 66 + 19. 77 for control at grain level (N = 4, 440 per group) and + 3. 87 and + 3. 38 respectively at dish level (217 cohorts of 20 or 25 grains per treatment group). Verum stalk length (92. 72 %) was 7. 28 % smaller than control stalk length (100 %). In contrast, no reliable effect was found in experiments performed in winter / spring (less stalk growth in 1 case, no difference in 1, more growth in 3 cases).

Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether globules produced with high and ultra-high dilutions (6 x, 12 x, 30 c, 200 c, 200 CF (centesimal discontinuous fluxion), 10, 000 CF) of various starting materials (Aconitum napellus, Atropa belladonna, phosphorus, sulfur, Apis mellifica, quartz) could be distinguished by UV spectroscopy. Methodology: The globules were specially produced for this study by Spagyros AG (Gümligen, Switzerland) and differed only in the starting materials of the dilutions (but not in the batch of globules or ethanol used). Globules were dissolved in water at 10 mg/ml, in quadruplicates, approximately 22 h prior to the measurements. Absorbance of the samples in the UV range (from 190 to 340 nm) was measured in a randomized order with a Shimadzu double beam UV- 1800 spectrophotometer equipped with an auto sampler. Samples of each starting material were prepared and measured on 5 independent days. The daily variations of the spectrophotometer as well as the drift during the measurements were corrected for. The average absorbance from 200 to 340 nm was compared among various starting materials within equal dilution levels using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Statistically significant differences were found among 30 c (Figure 1), 200 c and 200 CF dilutions of the various starting materials. No differences were found among 6 x, 12 x and 10, 000 CF dilutions. Conclusions: Globules prepared from high dilutions of various starting materials may show significantly different UV absorbance when dissolved in water.

40|$|Background: highly diluted {{specific}} {{nucleic acids}} (SNAÃ‚Â®), designed to modulate viral and cytokine genes expression, are currently used in Micro-Immunotherapy to treat viral infections and immune disorders. Although some preliminary studies have showed clinical benefit of these homeopathic preparations [1], no experimental {{data are available}} to explain their mechanism of action. &# 13; Aims: to investigate the in vitro effect of two sets of highly diluted (HD) SNA targeting i) latent/lytic Epstein-Barr virus (SNA EBV) and ii) TNF-ÃŽÂ± and its receptor p 55 involved in rheumatoid arthritis (SNA RA) on cellular models. &# 13; Methodology: serial <b>homeopathic</b> <b>dilutions</b> of SNA EBV and SNA RA (15 cH- 18 cH) were tested on a EBV-positive B-lymphoblastoid (B 95 - 8) and on a LPS-stimulated macrophage (THP 1) cell lines respectively, in comparison with agitated/diluted water and scramble DNA sequences prepared in the same conditions (negative controls). For B 95 - 8 proliferative model, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB 1) was used as reference. Analyzed biological parameters on B 95 - 8 were i) cell proliferation measured after 24 and 48 h of incubation with HD SNA and ii) expression of the EBV ZEBRA protein in response to TGF-ÃŽÂ² by Western-blotting (T+ 24 h). For THP 1 model, TNF-ÃŽÂ± synthesis and release were determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA (protein), after stimulation by LPS (1 Ã‚Âµg/ml) and HD SNA co-administration. &# 13; Results: we demonstrated that HD SNA RA significantly down-regulated TNF-ÃŽÂ± synthesis and release. This biological activity was showed to be specific (no effect of HD scramble SNA) and related {{to the level of}} dilution (maximal effect with higher dilutions). Unexpectedly, a biological effect of agitated/diluted water was also detected in both cellular models. For B 95 - 8 model, this effect resulted in a significant decrease of B 95 - 8 proliferation (comparable to the HMGB 1 reference) and an inhibition of ZEBRA expression. Similarly, a reproducible stimulation effect of HD water was obtained in the LPS-stimulated THP 1 model. &# 13; Conclusions: these findings indicate that highly diluted SNA RA can regulate TNF-ÃŽÂ± synthesis and release by LPS-stimulated THP 1 and support the hypothesis that these homeopathic preparations may act in modulating mRNA expression of the targeted genes. This in vitro work underlines the potential effect of agitated water in context of cellular models for testing biological properties of HD. &# 13; &# 13; [1] Jenaer M, Henry MF, Garcia A, Marichal B.
