40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} optimising the wireless optical network that carries elastic packet traffic. The particular focus is on modelling the effect of elastic traffic flows slowing down {{in response to the}} decrease of the optical transmission systems’ capacity at bad weather conditions. A mathematical programming model of the network design problem is presented that assumes that the packet rates of elastic traffic flows decrease fairly. While practically any subset of network links can be simultaneously affected by unfavourable transmission conditions, a particular challenge of solving the problem results from a huge number of network states considered in the model. Therefore, how the problem can be solved by generating the most unfavourable network states is presented. Moreover, it is proved that it is entirely sufficient to consider only the states that correspond to the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> on a single link. Finally, as the general problem is nonlinear, it is shown that the problem can be transformed to a linear MIP problem and solved effectively when single-path routing of traffic flows is assumed...|$|E

This work was mainly focused on the following aspects: chemical characterization of the biosorbent, kinetic studies, study of the pH influence in mono-component systems, equilibrium isotherms and column studies, both in mono and tri-component systems, and with a real industrial effluent from the electroplating industry. The chemical characterization of peanut hulls showed a high cellulose (44. 8 %) and lignin (36. 1 %) content, which favours biosorption of metal cations. The kinetic studies performed indicate {{that most of the}} sorption occurs in the first 30 min for all systems. In general, a pseudo-second order kinetics was followed, both in mono and tri-component systems. The equilibrium isotherms were better described by Freundlich model in all systems. Peanut hulls showed higher affinity for copper than for nickel and zinc when they are both present. The pH value between 5 and 6 was the most favourable for all systems.

40|$|Found {{together}} in nature, {{the isolation of}} rare earth elements (REEs) has always been challenging. Their separation usually involves processes including solvent extraction, precipitation and ion exchange. Zeolites are well-known for their ion exchange capabilities that would be potentially applicable for the REEs separation. This study primarily investigated the ion exchange behavior of REEs onto several types of zeolites, namely the Ferrierite, the Faujasite and the Linde Type L. These zeolites were chosen because of their altered framework type and controllable charge density through synthesis. The commercially available zeolites were systematically characterized by means of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Lanthanum {{was chosen as the}} model REE. The pH-uptake behavior of La on zeolites was studied extensively. Results showed that among all our selected zeolites, only LTL gave reasonable amount of La ion exchange capacity (0. 16 mmol/g at pH 3). Subsequently, the ion exchange isotherm of La on LTL was described at pH 3. The isotherm followed Langmuir type with a maximum capacity of 0. 25 mmol/g. An equimolar ternary mixture of lanthanum, neodymium and dysprosium was used to test the selectivity of LTL zeolite towards different REEs. Results suggested that the uptake sequence followed La > Nd > Dy, which indicated the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> with increased atomic number.

40|$|ABsaxAcr: A common {{procedure}} in paleohydraulie analysis {{is to use}} some measure {{of the size of}} particles in a deposit o estimate flow velocity of the depositing current, assuming that the selected size reflects the competence of the flow. For deposition from turbidity currents, a seemingly logical selection for determination of the suspension competence is the median size, because just prior to deposition all of the particles in the mixture must have been in suspension. Many papers in the literature use grain size of turbidites to estimate flow strength in this way. Komar (1985) discovered, however, that use of the median size can lead to serious underestimation of the flow velocity as determined independently from stability fields for bed forms. This discrepancy can be explained if deposition from turbidity currents is controlled mainly by decreasing capacity of the decelerating flow to carry particles of all sizes, including those that a clear current of the same speed would be fully competent to suspend. An important con-sequence is that suspension criteria (e. g., u. > settling velocity) cannot be used to reliably estimate the flow velocity of a turbidity current from its deposit. The hypothesis that deposition is controlled mainly by <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> is supported by the results of a computer simulation of turbidite deposition. The "deposit " predicted by the simulation differs from poorly sorted natural turbidites due to settling lags and lateral grading in the bodies of natural currents.

30|$|The idea {{of adding}} the fibers to brittle {{materials}} to increase ductility {{goes back to}} old times (Felekoĝlu et al. 2007). In ancient Egypt, straw was added to mud brick. Nowadays, various types of fiber are used; for example, in concrete structures the most popular is steel fiber. Many researches have been conducted on steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) (Sahoo et al. 2016, 2015 a, b; Ozcan et al. 2009; Nataraja et al. 1999; Vandewalle et al. 2003; Ganesan et al. 2007). Reinforcing of concrete with steel fibers has some advantages such as decrease and control of cracking, increase of durability and age of concrete, increase of ductility, toughness, tensile, flexural and shear strength of concrete, and some disadvantages such as corrosion of fibers, decrease of workability of concrete, irregularity of distribution and accumulation around the local area. The fibers differ in size and shape such as straight, hooked and corrugated (Wang 2006). It {{has been shown that}} steel fibers with low volume fraction (<  1 %), in SFRC, have a nonsignificant effect on compressive strength, but improve splitting tensile and flexural strength and toughness (Sahoo and Kumar 2015; Holschemacher et al. 2010; Mohod 2012). Cho and Kim (2003) showed that the addition of steel fibers to concrete beams enhanced the initial stiffness and ultimate strength and also the ductility in specimens that failed in shear–flexural and flexural are more than those which failed dominantly in shear. The results show that the end-hooked fiber types lead to more residual load-bearing capacity for high deformation in four-point bending test, but corrugated fibers lead to high load-bearing capacity for lower deformation and there is a <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> with increasing deflection (Holschemacher and Muller 2007).|$|E
40|$|By {{changing}} the organisation of the parking, car drivers in Amsterdam {{find ways to}} increase the parking capacity of a car park considerably. In Makking traffic safety in residential areas is increased by taking away all road signs, side walks and pedestrian crossings, thus providing optimal opportunities for safe traffic operations. Also in Amsterdam, during summertime, road works will significantly hinder traffic flows on {{the western part of}} the ring road. Despite the considerable <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> and despite the absence of additional facilities, queues disappeared when road works were started. The above examples show that self-organisation can often be observed as a dominant mechanism in the evolution of processes in the transport sector On the other hand it can also be observed that, deliberately, the self-organising capabilities of traffic and other transport related processes are restricted by the introduction of strict control mechanisms. Examples are the introduction of Automated Vehicle Guidance, Intelligent Speed Adaptation and Ramp Metering in traffic control, and, traditionally, the strongly centralised and unilateral dictated policymaking by the national government. Both approaches (self-organisation and strict control) aim at a better functioning of the transport sector (e. g. improvement of the traffic performance in terms of safety or accessibility), but a rationale for applying either one of both strategies is lacking. In this paper we will address this shortcoming and we will present a framework that can be seen as a first step in the development of such a rationale. The development of this framework necessitates to take into account various characteristics of the traffic flow (or transport system) e. g. interactions between various components of the system, the individual intelligence of a component as well as the urgency of a particular situation (e. g. an incident situation as compared to free flow of traffic). Using the framework it can assessed quite easily which control strategies (including no control) should be put in operation. ...|$|E
