5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|The {{work may}} have been {{intended}} for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because {{of a lack of}} surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15thcentury-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa– an influential albergo active from 1362– who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.|$|E

5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Bronze Age, about 2000 BCE, extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife indicate that arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, beginning in the seventh century BCE, as elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced. Some of these forts in southern Scotland are associated with cultivation ridges and terraces. Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products. Aerial photography reveals extensive prehistoric field systems that underlie existing boundaries in some Lowland areas, suggesting that the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation of what is now northern England, and occasional advances into Southern Scotland, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for five centuries, suggesting that the Roman invasions had a negative impact on the native population and the extent of agriculture.|$|E
5|$|ReCore is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. It centers around Joule Adams {{and her three}} robotic machines known as corebot companions, whose function is to aid her in combat and puzzle solving; these types of machines are amenable to improvement, should players find the blueprints and materials to do so, which grants upgrades to their attack and defense. The machines' cores can be swapped between them, changing their abilities in succession, and their <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> rearrangeable. Players can level up Joule's weapons and vitality. Ranged weapons have three kinds of ammunition that serve the purpose of taking down an enemy with a matching color: red, blue and yellow. Furthermore, if one of Joule's corebots matches the color of an enemy, it will thus inflict more damage in combat. Joule also wields a grappling hook that she uses to extract her enemies' energy cores after {{a certain amount of}} damage is done. Joule must dodge, jump or dash quickly to avoid taking damage while engaged in enemy conflict.|$|E
