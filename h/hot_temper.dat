500|$|The Mahabharata tells that Kabandha was a gandharva named Vishvavasu in his {{previous}} life and was cursed by Brahma to be born [...] "from a Rakshasa womb". The Mahavira-charita calls Kabandha's real form Danu, son of Sri. The Bhattikavya does not explicitly name Kabandha. He is introduced as [...] "a dreadful demon that was always hungry and being endowed with long arms". Later, he is identified as Sri's son, who was cursed by an ascetic. The [...] Ramacharitamanas tells that Kabandha was cursed by the sage Durvasa, {{who is known for}} his <b>hot</b> <b>temper</b> in Hindu mythology.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her <b>hot</b> <b>temper</b> behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Her chief characteristics… were {{a strong}} will and a {{singularly}} straightforward habit {{of thought and}} action", wrote her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova, who recalled Olga's <b>hot</b> <b>temper</b> and her struggles to keep it under control. [...] "Admirable qualities in a woman, these same characteristics are often trying in childhood, and Olga {{as a little girl}} sometimes showed herself willful and even disobedient." [...] Olga idolized her father and wore a necklace with an icon of St. Nicholas on her chest. She, like her siblings, enjoyed games of tennis and swimming with her father during their summer holidays and often confided in him when she went with him on long walks. Though she also loved Alexandra, her relationship with her mother was somewhat strained during her adolescence and early adulthood. [...] "Olga is always most unamiable about every proposition, though may end by doing what I wish", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on March 13, 1916. [...] "And when I am severe — sulks me." [...] In another letter to Nicholas during World War I, Alexandra complained that Olga's grumpiness, bad humor and general reluctance to make an official visit to the hospital where she usually worked as a Red Cross nurse made things difficult. Olga also occasionally found her mother's attitude trying. Parlormaid Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ersberg told her niece that the Tsar paid closer attention to the children than Alexandra did and Alexandra often was ill with a migraine or quarreled with the servants. In 1913, Olga complained in a letter to her grandmother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna about her mother's invalidism. [...] "As usual her heart isn't well", Olga wrote. [...] "It's all so unpleasant." [...] Queen Marie of Romania, who met Olga and her sisters when they visited Romania on a state trip in 1914, commented in her memoirs that the girls were natural and confided in her when Alexandra wasn't present, but when she appeared [...] "they always seemed to be watching her every expression so as to be sure to act according to her desires." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., the {{painting}} [...] "has no visual precedent". As a depiction of Diana, {{the painting}} is notable in part for what it does not depict—neither Actaeon catching sight of Diana and her nymphs bathing nor the actual moment when Callisto's pregnancy is revealed, both popular themes in mannerist painting in the early 17th century. Nor does the artist show Diana's <b>hot</b> <b>temper</b> or her harsh reactions to those episodes. The goddess's ability as a huntress is not signalled by dead game or bows and arrows. Even the dog is depicted as a gentle animal, not like the fast hounds normally seen in paintings of Diana.|$|E

He wore an unusually long tunic which emphasised his lack of height. He was—at least during the Boer War—idolised by the public and during the First World War was loved by his men {{in a way that}} Douglas Haig never was.

2500|$|Hutchinson was {{inducted}} into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1965. His career record as a major league manager, in all or parts of 12 seasons, was 830–827 (...) with nine tie games. [...] He was remembered for his winning baseball teams, as the man who launched Cincinnati into an historic winning era (which ended years after his death with the [...] "Big Red Machine" [...] in the 1970s).

2500|$|Bernhardt did {{not remain}} long with the Comédie-Française. She played Henrietta in Molière's Les Femmes Savantes and Hippolyte in L'Étourdi, {{and the title}} role in Scribe's Valérie, but did not impress the critics, or {{the other members of}} the company, who had resented her rapid rise. The weeks passed, but she was given no further roles. Her <b>hot</b> <b>temper</b> also got her into trouble; when a theater doorkeeper {{addressed}} her as [...] "Little Bernhardt", she broke her umbrella over his head. She apologized profusely, and when the doorkeeper retired 20 years later, she bought a cottage for him in Normandy. At a ceremony honoring the birthday of Molière on 15 January 1863, Bernhardt invited her younger sister, Regina, to accompany her. Regina accidentally stood on the train of the gown of a leading actress of the company, Zaire-Nathalie Martel (1816–1885), known as Madame Nathalie. Madame Nathalie pushed Regina off the gown, causing her to strike a stone column and gash her forehead. Regina and Madame Nathalie began shouting at one another, and Bernhardt stepped forward and slapped Madame Nathalie on the cheek. The older actress fell onto another actor. Thierry asked that Bernhardt apologize to Madame Nathalie. Bernhardt refused to do so until Madame Nathalie apologized to Regina. Bernhardt had already been scheduled for a new role with the theater, and had begun rehearsals. Madame Nathalie demanded that Bernhardt be dropped from the role unless she apologized. Since neither would yield, and Madame Nathalie was a senior member of the company, Thierry was forced to ask Bernhardt to leave.|$|E
