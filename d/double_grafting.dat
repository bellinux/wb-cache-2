Compared to a classical multistep process, this one-pot synthesis reduces greatly the number of purification steps and avoids aggregation phenomena. The confinement of reactants inside the micellar system {{gives rise to a}} noticeable increase of the CuAAC reaction rate. In addition, using simultaneously two different substrates for CuAAC on silica allows us to obtain directly multifunctional hybrid nanoparticles displaying a <b>double</b> <b>grafting</b> without any separation or purification steps except the final recovery by centrifugation, which opens the door to a tunable coating of the nanoparticles. Particularly, the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the coating can be adjusted by implementing the pertinent MPEG:dodecyl azide ratio. As an application, the great versatility of this strategy has been proved by the one-pot synthesis of fluorescent silica nanoparticles with a PEG coating and encapsulating silver clusters...|$|E
40|$|Avocado (Persea americana) {{contributes}} $ 180 {{million at}} the farm gate and $ 420 million at retail to the Australian economy. Avocado is a woody tree species that is commercially grafted to obtain both desirable fruiting and rootstock resilience qualities. Clonal rootstocks derived from cuttings yield three times higher than sexually reproduced. However, the difficulty to generate adventitious roots on avocado stem cuttings makes propagation of rootstocks a significant challenge. The Frolich and Platt <b>double</b> <b>grafting</b> protocol is the standard practice for rootstock propagation and involves an un-interrupted etiolation step crucial for rooting. However, the molecular basis for this etiolation requirement is not yet understood. To address this, we analysed the effect of etiolation on expression of root promoting miR 160 and the root inhibitor miR 167 in avocado stems grafted for rootstock clonal propagation. Whilst miR 167 expression was not strongly correlated to etiolation treatments, etiolation resulted in a distinct spatial regulation of miR 160, with significantly stronger expression in basal tissue than in apical tissue, correlating {{to the site of}} adventitious root production. This is a trend absent in non-etiolated plants. This study suggests that etiolation facilitates a spatial gradient of miR 160 abundance in grafted stems and that this, rather than general enhancement of miR 160 expression, may be a key factor for adventitious rooting in avocado...|$|E
40|$|Musk melon (M), {{cucumber}} (C) and Cucurbita ficifolia (F) could succesfully be grafted in all single combinations, {{except for}} M/F which required foliage {{on the stock}} to survive. Defoliation of this stock caused the plant to wilt and die, generally in 4 - 5 days; necrosis started in the stock: a rapid and specific collapse of its sieve tubes occurred before any visible symptom {{was evident in the}} melon scion. With stock foliage present, a good union between xylem and phloem of the partners was formed. Growth and other phenomena reacted strongly to the number of leaves on a stock. The effect of these leaves depended largely on light intensity. M/F plants could recover from advanced stages of incompatibility, by renewed contact with leaves of the stock species. From these and experiments with <b>double</b> <b>grafting</b> it was concluded that the stock leaves provided the stock with some specific substance (enzymic or hormonal) enabling the stock phloem to function normally. Shortage or complete absence of this substance might have influenced some enzymic process in the complex of sieve tube and companion cell, upsetting metabolism as shown by local accumulation of starch. The stock leaves depended on root vitality, which in turn was determined by interaction with the scion. The growth-regulating activity of the stock leaves thus proved to be connected with the nature of the interactions between M and F. <p/...|$|E

The dopaminergic mesotelencephalic pathway was unilaterally destroyed by injection of 6 -hydroxydopamine into the medial forebrain bundle {{at the level}} of the lateral hypothalamus. Three weeks later, embryonic dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons were implanted into the denervated neostriatum, or the nucleus accumbens or into both locations (<b>double</b> <b>grafts).</b> All animals were tested over a four month period for amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotation, apomorphine-induced locomotor activity, and on a skilled paw reaching task.

40|$|Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) {{has become}} a major {{constraint}} to cassava production in East and Central Africa. The identification of new sources of CBSD resistance is essential to deploy CBSD mitigation strategies as the disease is progressing westwards to new geographical areas. A stringent infection method based on top cleft grafting combined with precise virus titer quantitation was utilized to screen fourteen cassava cultivars and elite breeding lines. When inoculated with mixed infections of Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), the scions of elite breeding lines KBH 2006 / 18 and KBH 2006 / 26 remained symptom-free during a 16 -week period of virus graft inoculation, while susceptible varieties displayed typical CBSD infection symptoms at 4 weeks after grafting. The identified CBSD resistance was stable under the co-inoculation of CBSV, UCBSV with cassava geminiviruses (CGMs). <b>Double</b> <b>grafting</b> experiments revealed that transmission of CBSV and UCBSV to CBSD susceptible top scions was delayed when using intermediate scions of elite breeding lines KBH 2006 / 18 and KBH 2006 / 26. Nonetheless, comparison of virus systemic movement using scions from KBH 2006 / 18 and a transgenic CBSD resistant 60444 line (60444 -Hp 9 line) showed that both CBSV and UCBSV move at undetectable levels through the stems. Further, protoplast-based assays of virus titers over time showed that the replication of CBSVs is inhibited in the resistant line KBH 2006 / 18, suggesting that the identified CBSD resistance is at least partially based on inhibition of virus replication. Our molecular characterization of CBSD resistance in cassava offers a robust virus–host system to further investigate the molecular determinants of CBSD resistance...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease which {{belongs to the}} movement disorders and has a prevalence of about 1 % of the total population. In PD the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of the basal ganglia {{is affected by the}} atrophy of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons, causing a severe loss of dopamine in the striatum, resulting in the inability to regulate normal movements. Many treatments and therapies (e. g. L-Dopa and DBS) exist to relieve PD patients from their symptoms, although most of these cannot repair the core problem. Cell transplantation has provided a new promising strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Foetal mesencephalic tissue and stem cells have shown to be successfully grafted into the striatum and are able to re-innervate the striatum and subsequently release dopamine. Behavioural improvements concerning movement were observed and to some extent patients could be withdrawn from L-dopa. Currently, most of the cells are grafted ectopically into the striatum. However, intrastriatal transplantation cannot provide a long-term remedy for PD and troublesome problems (e. g. dyskinesias) can arise. A possible therapy to repair the origin of the disease might be transplanting stem cells into the physiological area, the SNc. Rodent and human studies have proven that intranigral and <b>double</b> <b>grafting</b> of dopamine neuroblasts is feasible and safe. Results have shown that the grafted cells were able to grow for long distances to the striatum and rewire with the nigro-striatal pathway, resulting in an improvement of the PD symptoms. Moreover, intranigral transplantation showed faster improvements and is able to reconstruct the degenerated nigro-striatal pathway, compared to intrastriatal transplantation. Furthermore, reconstructing the pathway with sufficient dopamine neurons and projections to the striatum, may provide a long-term treatment and possibly a cure to the pathogenesis of this disease...|$|E
40|$|Grafting is a centuries-old {{technique}} used in plants to obtain economic benefits. Grafting increases nutrient uptake and utilization efficiency {{in a number}} of plant species, including fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals. Selected rootstocks of the same species or close relatives are utilized in grafting. Rootstocks absorb more water and ions than self-rooted plants and transport these water and ions to the aboveground scion. Ion uptake is regulated by a complex communication mechanism between the scion and rootstock. Sugars, hormones, and miRNAs function as long-distance signaling molecules and regulate ion uptake and ion homeostasis by affecting the activity of ion transporters. This review summarizes available information on the effect of rootstock on nutrient uptake and utilization and the mechanisms involved. Information on specific nutrient-efficient rootstocks for different crops of commercial importance is also provided. Several other important approaches, such as interstocking (during <b>double</b> <b>grafting),</b> inarching, use of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria, use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, use of plant growth substances (e. g., auxin and melatonin), and use of genetically engineered rootstocks and scions (transgrafting), are highlighted; these approaches can be combined with grafting to enhance nutrient uptake and utilization in commercially important plant species. Whether the rootstock and scion affect each other’s soil microbiota and their effect on the nutrient absorption of rootstocks remain largely unknown. Similarly, the physiological and molecular bases of grafting, crease formation, and incompatibility are not fully identified and require investigation. Grafting in horticultural crops can help reveal the basic biology of grafting, the reasons for incompatibility, sensing, and signaling of nutrients, ion uptake and transport, and the mechanism of heavy metal accumulation and restriction in rootstocks. Ion transporter and miRNA-regulated nutrient studies have focused on model and non-grafted plants, and information on grafted plants is limited. Such information will improve the development of nutrient-efficient rootstocks...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} conducted to evaluate the biomechanical effects of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; but no consensus has been reached on the preferred method of reconstruction. METHODS: The 3 D finite element mesh of a knee joint was reconstructed from computed tomography and magnetic resonance images. The ligaments were considered as hyperelastic materials. The tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints were modeled with large sliding contact elements. The 3 D model was used to simulate knee flexion from 0 degrees to 90 degrees in four cases: a knee with a "native" posterior cruciate ligament, a resected posterior cruciate ligament, a reconstructed single graft posterior cruciate ligament, and a reconstructed <b>double</b> <b>graft</b> posterior cruciate ligament. FINDINGS: A resected posterior cruciate ligament induced high compressive forces in the medial tibiofemoral and patellofemoral compartments. The pressures generated in the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral compartments were nearly the same for the two reconstruction techniques (single <b>graft</b> and <b>double</b> <b>graft).</b> The single graft resulted in lower tensile stresses inside the graft than for the <b>double</b> <b>graft.</b> INTERPRETATION: Firstly, a resected posterior cruciate ligament should be replaced to avoid excessive compressive forces, which are a source of cartilage degeneration. Secondly, the two types of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques partially restored the biomechanics of the knee in flexion, e. g. contact pressures were restored for pure flexion of the knee. The reconstruction techniques therefore partially restore the biomechanics of the knee in flexion. A <b>double</b> <b>graft</b> reconstruction is subjected to the highest tensile stresses...|$|R
40|$|Dissection {{techniques}} and optimal donor stages {{have been established}} for constructing an isolated intraocular model of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) -accumbens system using intraocular sequential grafting. Single grafts including accumbens and VTA respectively survived and developed many organotypic features when taken from 15 - 17 day fetuses. Falck-Hillarp fluorescence histochemistry showed dopamine neurons and terminals in single VTA grafts, no or almost no catecholamine fibers in single accumbens grafts, and a well-developed VTA-accumbens dopamine pathway in combined grafts where cell bodies in the VTA part provided the accumbens part with a rich terminal network. A similar distribution was found using immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase. CCK-like immunoreactivity had a distribution that mimicked that of the catecholamine-containing system. Enkephaline-like immunoreactivity was found both in single VTA and in single accumbens pieces {{as well as in}} both parts of the <b>double</b> <b>grafts.</b> Cells with long-duration action potentials typical of dopamine neurons discharged at approximately 8 Hz in single VTA grafts and below 1 Hz in the VTA part of VTA-accumbens <b>double</b> <b>grafts.</b> Cells in the accumbens portion of <b>double</b> <b>grafts</b> had shorter action potential durations and fired at 10 - 20 Hz. Haloperidol increased discharge frequency in VTA neurons with long action potential durations while apomorphine reduced discharge markedly. Antidromic activation of putative dopamine neurons in the VTA part was obtained by electrical stimulation of the accumbens part. The indirect dopamine agonist + 3 -methyl-phencyclidine slowed firing rates of neurons in the accumbens part of <b>double</b> <b>grafts.</b> Taken together, the histochemical and the electrophysiological data show that the intraocular VTA-accumbens system retains several of its normal structural and functional characteristics.

40|$|The {{effect of}} graft {{molecular}} architecture on {{the formation of}} self-assembling morphologies of strongly phase-separated, amorphous block copolymers have been systematically investigated. Three series of samples {{across a range of}} component volume fractions were characterized using transmission electron microscope and small angle x-ray and neutron for different model architectures of polystyrene-polyisoprene single <b>graft</b> and <b>double</b> <b>graft</b> copolymers. ^ The single graft architecture was an 2 ̆ 2 asymmetric single graft 2 ̆ 2, ASG, formed by grafting a polystyrene block on a polyisoprene backbone. This architecture is considered the fundamental unit, or constituting block copolymer, from which all more complex graft architecture with multiple trifunctional junction points are constructed. The ASG architecture is found to shift the volume fraction windows in which specific strongly microphase separated morphologies are observed to higher volume fractions of the PS graft material than in the corresponding linear diblock copolymers with a same molecular weight and chemical composition. As the polystyrene is grafted from the center of polyisoprene backbone, the ASG architecture becomes an I 2 S star architecture. The morphological behavior of the I 2 S block copolymers was predicted by the morphological diagram of S. T. Milner for miktoarm stars (Macromolecules, 27, 2333 (1994)). However, it is found that the morphology diagram overestimates the amount of shift in the order-order transition lines produces by asymmetry in molecular architecture. This overestimation in the theory is attributed to an effect of chain crowding close the junction points. ^ The effect of asymmetric grafting of the single PS chain on the PI backbone was investigated in a series of materials where the single PS graft is asymmetrically located along the PI backbone. Additionally the effect of multiple graft architecture was explored with S 2 IS 2 (H-shaped) and (SI) I'(SI) π-shaped) materials, each of which has two trifunctional branch points per molecule. It was found that to a good approximation the behavior of the <b>double</b> <b>graft</b> materials can be mapped onto the behavior of the single graft materials by considering the <b>double</b> <b>graft</b> molecules to be divided into component single graft parts. ...|$|R

The samples in group III behaved as <b>doubled</b> tendon <b>graft,</b> with {{asymmetric}} strands (Fig. 2). Consequently, the stresses in two strands are unequal, leading to early stretching and failure {{of one of the}} strands (Fig. 8). The samples in Group I and Group IV had no asymmetric stress distribution and all the four or three strands, respectively, failed together. This was reflected in the failure loads noted with the four groups.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{cyclosporine}} in transplant {{practice has}} at least <b>doubled</b> <b>graft</b> survival in renal transplantation, and has improved patient survival as well. In cardiac transplants, cyclosporine was first used in combination with prednisone to achieve immunosuppression by inhibition of the synthesis of lymphokines. When stimulated in vitro, lymphocytes from cyclosporine-treated patients display an impaired ability to produce the critical lymphokine interleukin- 2. When there is in vitro inhibition, the patient shows poor immunosuppression in vivo. Unfortunately, cyclosporine is toxic: given in high enough doses to weaken the immune response, it can have neuroectodermal, and (of greater concern) mesenchymal side effects, including hepato- and nephrotoxicity. Patients who display renal impairment before cardiac transplantation are at {{a greater risk of}} postoperative renal dysfunction with cyclosporine therapy. The most important adverse actions of cyclosporine upon the nephron are events that arise from reduced renal blood flow caused either by vasoconstriction or by platelet adhesion associated with reduced prostacyclin production. The accepted technique for control of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity has been to reduce the cyclosporine dose, while simultaneously initiating azathioprine therapy. In the presence of an abnormal serum creatinine level, cyclosporine trough values appear to correlate with rejection or toxicity, thereby providing an indicator of drug-induced complications. Preoperative pharmacokinetic profiling to test cyclosporine clearance can help optimize the regimen in both renal and cardiac transplant patients.

40|$|A 76 -year-old man who 2 {{years before}} {{underwent}} thoracic endovascular aortic repair for aneurysm of the aortic arch {{was admitted to}} our department with dysphonia and dysphagia due to an increasing diameter of aneurysm of the aortic arch because of type Ia endoleak. To obtain an adequate proximal neck for conventional thoracic endovascular aortic repair, the <b>double</b> chimney <b>graft</b> technique was chosen using a hypogastric component of the iliac branch Excluder (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) for the anonymous trunk. At 1 -year follow-up, computed tomography scan showed patent chimney graft and no endoleaks. This is the first report in the literature using a hypogastric branch in the aortic arch...|$|R
40|$|Chronic triceps insufficiency, causing {{prolonged}} disability, occurs due to {{a missed}} diagnosis of an acute rupture. We report a 25 year old male with history of a significant fall sustaining multiple injuries. Since then, he had inability in extending his right elbow for which he sought intervention after a year. Diagnosis of triceps rupture was made clinicoradiologically and surgery was planned. Intraoperative findings revealed a deficient triceps with a fleck of avulsed bone from olecranon. Ipsilateral <b>double</b> tendon <b>graft</b> including extensor carpi radialis longus and palmaris longus were anchored to triceps and secured with the olecranon. Six-months follow revealed a complete active extension of elbow and a full function at the donor site...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolated}} double lung transplantation {{was performed}} in 8 adult mongrel dogs using transverse sternotomy in 6 and bilateral thoracotomy in 2 dogs. The first four dogs recieved donor lungs flushed with 4 ℃ UW solution. Isolated double lung transplantation was completed in 5 dogs; in the other 3, procedure was not completed because of intraoperative cardiac arrest or massive bleeding. Two dogs with the <b>double</b> lung <b>graft</b> were sacrificed because of severe pulmonary edema, and 3 dogs died of cardiac failure 1 to 6 hours after the operation. We conclude that isolated double lung transplantation can be performed in dogs. However, survival time is limited because of progressive lung edema or cardiac failure...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructions of the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) {{are among the most}} frequently performed procedures in knee surgery nowadays. The history of ACL surgery can be traced {{as far back as the}} Egyptian times. The early years reflect the efforts to establish a viable, consistently successful reconstruction technique while, during the early 20 th century, we witness an increasing awareness of, and interest in, the ligament and its lesions. Finally, we highlight the most important steps in the evolution of the ACL reconstruction surgery by discussing the various techniques spanning the years using not only autologous grafts (fascia lata, meniscal, hamstring, patella tendon, bone-patella tendon-bone, and <b>double</b> bundle <b>grafts)</b> but also synthetic ones and allografts...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was {{developed}} in order to predict operative risk in cardiac surgery and to assess {{the quality of the}} cardio-surgical care. Introduction of the uniform terminology in result evaluation process leads to the significant improvement in measuring and evaluation of surgical treatment quality. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate our results in isolated coronary surgery using the EuroSCORE. Methods. The study was done respectively by analyzing predicted mortality according to the EuroSCORE model and observed operative risk in 4, 675 coronary patients operated at our Clinic during the period 2001 - 2008. For statistical analyses, the Pearson, Chisquare and ANOVA tests were used. Results. The total postoperative mortality predicted by the EuroSCORE was 2. 9 ± 2. 25, while the observed one was 2. 2 %. When the scoring system and observed results were compared over the years, a considerably lower observed mortality was found during the last 4 years. Overall average number of distal anastomoses was 2. 62 ± 0. 84. During the period 2004 - 2008, the average number of coronary anastomoses increased over the years reaching the value of 2. 77 ± 0. 88. The difference is at the level of statistical significance with the trend of further increase. Percentage of the patients with single or <b>double</b> <b>graft</b> myocardial revascularization decreases, while the number of the patients with triple or more bypasses increases. Conclusion. During the last years, the results in isolated coronary surgery have considerably improved. The EuroSCORE overestimates operative risk. In order to improve its predictive value, the model should be recalibrated...|$|R
