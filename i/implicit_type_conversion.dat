50|$|<b>Implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion,</b> {{also known}} as coercion, is an {{automatic}} type conversion by the compiler. Some programming languages allow compilers to provide coercion; others require it.|$|E
50|$|Explicit type {{conversion}} is a {{type conversion}} which is explicitly defined within a program (instead of being done by a compiler for <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion).</b> It {{is defined by the}} user in the program.|$|E
50|$|<b>Implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion</b> complicates {{function}} overloading {{because if}} the types of arguments do not exactly match the signature {{of one of the}} overloaded functions, but can match after type conversion, resolution depends on which type conversion is chosen.|$|E
40|$|Web {{scripting}} languages, such as PHP and JavaScript, {{provide a}} wide range of dynamic features that make them both flexible and error-prone. In order to prevent bugs in web applications, there is a sore need for powerful static analysis tools. In this paper, we investigate how Abstract Interpretation may be leveraged to provide a precise value analysis providing rich typing information that can be a useful component for such tools. In particular, we define the formal semantics for a core of PHP that illustrates <b>type</b> juggling, the <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversions</b> typical of PHP, and investigate the design of abstract domains and operations that, while still scalable, are expressive enough to cope with type juggling. We believe that our approach can also be applied to other languages with <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversions...</b>|$|R
50|$|CLU {{does not}} perform <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversions.</b> In a cluster, the {{explicit}} <b>type</b> <b>conversions</b> {{up and down}} change between the abstract type and the representation. There is a universal type any, and a procedure force to check that an object is a certain type. Objects may be mutable or immutable, the latter being base types such as integers, booleans, characters and strings.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of languages that allow <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversions,</b> but in a type-safe manner. For example, both C++ and C# allow programs to define operators to convert a value from one type to another in a semantically meaningful way. When a C++ compiler encounters such a conversion, it treats the operation just like a function call. In contrast, converting a value to the C type [...] is an unsafe operation that is invisible to the compiler.|$|R
5000|$|The {{initialization}} of [...] behaves {{exactly as}} though it were aggregate-initialization. That is, each data member of an object, in turn, will be copy-initialized with the corresponding value from the initializer-list. <b>Implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion</b> will be used where needed. If no conversion exists, or only a narrowing conversion exists, the program is ill-formed. The initialization of [...] invokes the constructor.|$|E
5000|$|An {{algorithm}} of intermediate generality implicitly declares result2 as a floating-point variable, and {{the addition}} implicitly converts [...] to a floating point. This can be correct if the calling contexts never supply a floating point argument. Such a situation shows the difference between type inference, which does not involve type conversion, and <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion,</b> which forces data to a different data type, often without restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|Smalltalk, Perl, Ruby, Python, and Self are all [...] "strongly typed" [...] in {{the sense}} that typing errors are {{prevented}} at runtime and they do little <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion,</b> but these languages make no use of static type checking: the compiler does not check or enforce type constraint rules. The term duck typing is now used to describe the dynamic typing paradigm used by the languages in this group.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{definition for}} [...] "weakly typed" [...] refers to languages, such as Perl and JavaScript, which permit {{a large number}} of <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversions.</b> In JavaScript, for example, the expression [...] implicitly converts [...] to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if [...] is , , an , or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.Strong and static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term strongly typed to mean strongly, statically typed, or, even more confusingly, to mean simply statically typed. Thus C has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.|$|R
40|$|Most popular {{programming}} languages support {{situations where}} {{a value of}} one type is converted into a value of another type without any explicit cast. Such <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversions,</b> or <b>type</b> coercions, are a highly controversial language feature. Proponents argue that type coercions enable writing concise code. Opponents argue that type coercions are error-prone and that they reduce the understandability of programs. This paper studies the use of type coercions in JavaScript, a language notorious for its widespread use of coercions. We dynamically analyze hundreds of programs, including real-world web applications and popular benchmark programs. We find that coercions are widely used (in 80. 42 % of all function executions) and that most coercions {{are likely to be}} harmless (98. 85 %). Furthermore, we identify a set of rarely occurring and potentially harmful coercions that safer subsets of JavaScript or future language designs may want to disallow. Our results suggest that type coercions are significantly less evil than commonly assumed and that analyses targeted at real-world JavaScript programs must consider coercions...|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, programming {{languages are}} often colloquially classified as strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed). These terms {{do not have}} a precise definition, but in general, a strongly typed language is more likely to generate an error or refuse to compile if the argument passed to a function does not closely match the expected type. On the other hand, a weakly typed language may produce unpredictable results or may perform <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion.</b> A different but related concept is latent typing.|$|E

A coercion function may be defined by composition: if S <: T and T <: U then s may be regarded as an object of type u under the compound coercion (coerceT → U ∘ coerceS → T).

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we discuss}} a {{lightweight}} approach {{to eliminate the}} overhead due to <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> arguments during higher-order unification of dependently-typed terms. First, we show that some <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> information is uniquely determined, and can therefore be safely skipped during higher-order unification. Second, we discuss its impact in practice during type reconstruction and during proof search within the logical framework Twelf. Our experimental results show that <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> arguments are numerous and large in size, but their impact on run-time is between 10 % and 20 %. On the other hand optimizations such as eliminating the occurs check are shown to be crucial to achieve significant performance improvements. ...|$|R

5000|$|Programming {{languages}} are often colloquially classified as strongly typed or weakly typed (also loosely typed) {{to refer to}} certain aspects of type safety. In 1974, Liskov and Zilles defined a strongly-typed language as one in which [...] "whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function."In 1977, Jackson wrote, [...] "In a strongly typed language each data area will have a distinct type and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types."In contrast, a weakly typed language may produce unpredictable results or may perform <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{special case}} of <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion</b> is type promotion, where the {{compiler}} automatically expands the binary representation of objects of integer or floating-point types. Promotions {{are commonly used}} with types smaller than the native type of the target platform's arithmetic logic unit (ALU), before arithmetic and logical operations, to make such operations possible, or more efficient if the ALU can work {{with more than one}} type. C and C++ perform such promotion for objects of boolean, character, wide character, enumeration, and short integer types which are promoted to int, and for objects of type float, which are promoted to double. Unlike some other type conversions, promotions never lose precision or modify the value stored in the object.|$|E
5000|$|C++98 {{added the}} [...] keyword as a {{modifier}} on constructors to prevent single-argument constructors from {{being used as}} <b>implicit</b> <b>type</b> <b>conversion</b> operators.

This matching {{is a form of}} program correctness, and is known as const-correctness. This allows a form of programming by contract, where functions specify as part of their type signature whether they modify their arguments or not, and whether their return value is modifiable or not.
