Indirectly paid by merchants to card issuers, interchange <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> most countries are set by credit and debit card networks. But in one country, Australia, the central bank is regulating interchange <b>fees,</b> and <b>in</b> several other countries and areas, including the European Union, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom, public officials are taking, or considering taking, a more hands-on regulatory stance. In the United States, it is largely the court system that is debating interchange issues.; The payments industry has a strong vested <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> interchange <b>fees.</b> They are a major portion of costs that merchants pay for processing debit and credit card payments and are a major source of revenue for banks that issue the cards. One reason for recent <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> interchange <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> the United States is a shift in retail payments away from checks. Research sponsored by the Federal Reserve documents a rise in electronic payments and a decline in the use of paper checks, with a milestone recently passed where the majority of noncash payments are now made using electronic instruments. This shift is also occurring in other countries. Since paper checks typically do not have an interchange fee while credit and debit payments do, the shift is a major reason why merchants face a rapidly rising cost of processing payments. Card issuers, on the other hand, rely on associated revenues to provide a return to their substantial investment in card payment networks.; Pacheco and Sullivan summarize the proceedings of a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in May 2005, which explored issues surrounding interchange fees.

40|$|The 1983 {{amendments}} to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 11, which dealt with frivolous litigation papers, prompted much controversy, satellite litigation, {{and a new}} cottage industry, Rule amendments in 1983 increased both the range of sanctionable attorney conduct {{and the extent of}} judicial sanctionable authority. By the latter 1980 s, many concluded that further amendments were warranted. Case law, commentary and empirical research culminated in a new rule which took effect in December, 1993. In part, the 1993 Rule reduces a party's incentives to pursue sanctions for frivolous papers since less misconduct will be sanctionable. Further, attorney's fees will be less available as a sanction even when a violation occurs. Other forms of sanctions, such as a fine payable to the court, will be employed. These new forms raise very different questions than did {{the most common form of}} sanction under the 1983 Rule-an award of attorney's fees.

Businesses, including banks, actively participate in CSR {{but the question of}} value still persists. What does the bank receive in return for participating in CSR? Do banks get more customers {{as a result of their}} CSR programmes? Do banks have a better customer retention rate because of their CSR programme? Will customers change banks purely because they disagree with their banks CSR programme? These were some of the issues addressed but due to the small sample size, the findings cannot be generalised. The study did not find any significant, positive nor negative relationship, between CSR and the bank customers; meaning the tests could not provide evidence that for instance CSR programmes should be targeted towards female customers or customers of a certain age or income bracket. More importantly 80 % of the respondents did not consider CSR an issue that was important enough to affect their choice of banks. They will not switch banks purely based on a bank’s CSR programme. Understandably they were more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> bank <b>fees</b> and <b>interest</b> rates. These issues directly affected their reason for choosing a particular bank.
