Further, off-screen objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Skanderbeg {{had been at}} war with Venice. Realizing the {{magnitude}} of his challenge, Skanderbeg attempted to relieve the garrison by engaging in skirmishes with the Ottoman army. His forces succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the Turkish forces through guerrilla-style attacks. Efforts were made by Skanderbeg to use intelligence forces, operating as far as Constantinople, to gather information on Murad's plans of action. Meanwhile, near Scutari, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to defeat a Venetian force and managed to considerably weaken the Venetian presence in Albania. Despite these efforts, on July 31 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered due to a disruption in the water supply. The garrison was spared and a force of Ottoman Janissaries was stationed inside the fortress instead. Two years later, Murad would march against Krujë, only to suffer a heavy defeat.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942, Koppelman {{was drafted}} into the United States Army and in 1943 he married painter Dorothy Myers. He worked as a radio {{weatherman}} during World War II, guiding ships through the rough waters of the English Channel, which was {{a critical part of}} the Invasion of Normandy. He manned an anti-aircraft machine gun in the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach, and later, as staff sergeant, was awarded a Bronze Star. Before the invasion, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to study at the Art College of Western England in Bristol, and later at the École des Beaux-Arts in Reims. While on leave, he visited Picasso's studio in Paris, and it was Picasso and Louis Aragon who told Koppelman that the war in Europe was over. Letters describing his wartime experience are in the Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman papers at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, Jack Matlock, United States {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union, told Gorbachev {{of the possibility of}} a coup attempt against him, and the Soviet leader became worried when Anatoly Chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside Moscow. On 21 June, four days after Pavlov's speech, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and Pavlov. Even when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to secure his position, Gorbachev's power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was not over, with Gorbachev promising Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the Chairman of the KGB, would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Six {{weeks from}} {{theatrical}} release, no dubbing {{had taken place}} and the score had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd {{did not have much}} music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish the score. Horner felt that, given more time, he could get the score to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to achieve. The score was recorded in roughly four days. Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.|$|E

25|$|On 26 January, Johnsson {{revealed}} he {{had been}} suffering from intense {{pain in the neck}} and shoulders, and he was diagnosed with two spinal disc herniations (allegedly produced because of years of headbanging), and he was in risk of losing the ability to perform live. As a result, the rock opera project was delayed and the band downplayed their sets of songs in concerts to allow Johnsson to perform. By 8 April, Johnsson announced <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to avoid surgery as his condition had improved through physiotherapy, and the band would resume to perform at festivals by August, although he would have to play sitting.|$|E
25|$|Kirby Smith left Knoxville on August 14, {{forced the}} Union to {{evacuate}} Cumberland Gap, defeated a small Union {{force at the}} Battle of Richmond (Kentucky), and reached Lexington on August 30. Bragg departed Chattanooga just before Smith reached Lexington, while Buell moved north from Nashville to Bowling Green. But Bragg moved quickly and by September 14 had interposed his army on Buell's supply lines from Louisville. Bragg was reluctant to develop this situation because he was outnumbered by Buell; if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to combine with Kirby Smith, {{he would have been}} numerically equal, but Smith's command was separate, and Smith believed that Bragg could capture Louisville without his assistance.|$|E

25|$|In June 1917, Maugham {{was asked}} by Sir William Wiseman, {{an officer of the}} British Secret Intelligence Service (later named MI6), to {{undertake}} a special mission in Russia. It was part of an attempt to keep the Provisional Government in power and Russia in the war by countering German pacifist propaganda. Two and a half months later, the Bolsheviks took control. Maugham subsequently said that if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to get there six months earlier, he might have succeeded. Quiet and observant, Maugham had a good temperament for intelligence work; he believed he had inherited from his lawyer father a gift for cool judgement and the ability to be undeceived by facile appearances.|$|E
25|$|Uli Schmidt, son of Louis Schmidt, was {{the prince}} of hookers and a genius of a player. A medical doctor by {{profession}} he was a favourite amongst all Bulls supporters, even when leaving Northerns for arch-enemies Transvaal {{at the beginning of}} the 1993 season. Thanks to his fiery performance and expertise he played many times for his province and country and was desperately unlucky to miss out on the 1995 World Cup year due to a neck injury. If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to play test rugby on a regular basis especially during the late 1980s, he would probably have been regarded as one of the world's greatest hookers. Legendary All Black lock, Colin Meads, in fact described Schmidt as the world's best hooker.|$|E
25|$|An {{orthodox}} batsman with {{a penchant}} for forcing strokes in front of square {{on both sides of the}} wicket he was regarded as a very sound player of fast bowling. His own bowling was a brisk fast medium, with a good off cutter his main weapon. While his commitments outside of cricket limited the number of games he played he was a key member of the very strong Yorkshire sides who won 6 county championships during his career (although this did include 1901 when Jackson did not appear in the county championship). His performances in 1896 and 1898 in particular showed what his statistics could have been if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to dedicate more time, scoring over 1,000 championship runs at better than 40.00 in each season and taking over 100 wickets across the two seasons at an average of under 20.|$|E

25|$|Following the debate, Paul {{was criticized}} by some {{political}} commentators for {{his refusal to}} yield in {{his opposition to the}} 2010 health insurance reform law ("Obamacare"), which prohibits insurers from denying coverage {{on the basis of a}} pre-existing condition, when it was pointed out that Paul's 2008 presidential campaign chair and friend had contracted a sudden severe illness necessitating a prolonged hospital stay before dying. He had not had any medical insurance through his employer and had been unable to purchase insurance due to a pre-existing condition. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to receive medical care he required over the course of his illness, when he died the bills for that care amounted to about $400,000. His friends, including Paul, were able to raise about $50,000, but that still left $350,000 to be passed to his estate — or left unpaid (and passed on to other consumers and taxpayers).|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 2005 it was {{announced}} that an inquest into the crash would be held at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berkshire. The inquest was expected to last 12 days, starting on 17 October 2005. A delay ensued over whether {{the families of the victims}} should be granted legal aid. The inquest finally began in October 2007. A policeman who had witnessed the crash, PC Brazier, testified at the inquest. He told the jury that he believed the crash was caused by a suicide attempt. The Forensic Accident Investigator, David Price, told the inquest that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine switched off, the handbrake fully applied, the vehicle's lights switched off, the steering on a partial left-hand turn (which was not consistent with driving across the crossing), and that its fuel tank still contained at least 8 litres (about 2 gallons) of petrol.|$|E
25|$|From childhood, James Dunn was a {{voracious}} {{reader with}} an excellent memory. After completing his schooling, he left {{home to find}} employment {{and for a time}} he worked as a deckhand for an American shipping company on Lake Michigan. After this, {{he made his way to}} the east coast where he was employed by a manufacturing company in Lynn, Massachusetts. However, before long he returned home where a job as a clerk at the law firm of George Gilbert, where he worked alongside Richard Bedford Bennett, led him to the decision to apply to Dalhousie University Law School in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The small amount of money <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to save was not nearly enough to cover his education costs and Dunn worked at a variety of part-time jobs to pay his way through university, including a position in the university library. He graduated in 1898, then worked as a lawyer in Halifax before setting up a law practice in Edmonton, Alberta. Within a short time, Dunn was drawn to the booming economy of Montreal, Quebec where he landed a position with one of the city's prominent law firms.|$|E
