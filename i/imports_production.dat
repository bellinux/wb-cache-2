50|$|Refined {{production}} of tin-glazed earthenware made {{for more than}} local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later 13th century, especially in the contada of Florence. The city itself declined in importance {{in the second half}} of the 15th century, perhaps because of local deforestation. Italian cities encouraged the start of a new pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside <b>imports.</b> <b>Production</b> scattered among small communes and, after the mid-15th century, at Faenza, Arezzo and Siena. Faenza, which gave its name to faience, was the only fair-sized city in which the ceramic industry became a major economic component. Bologna produced lead-glazed wares for export. Orvieto and Deruta both produced maioliche in the 15th century. In the 16th century, maiolica production was established at Castel Durante, Urbino, Gubbio and Pesaro. Some maiolica was produced as far north as Padua, Venice and Turin and as far south as Palermo and Caltagirone in Sicily. In the 17th century Savona began to be a prominent place of manufacture.|$|E

It discusses associations and controversies between theoretical statements and real world with the aims of economic policies. The <b>imported</b> <b>production</b> good {{is one of the}} causal sources of GNP for the both periods. Export causes <b>production</b> good <b>import</b> change during the import substitution period, but the <b>imported</b> <b>production</b> goods supply causes export to increase during export oriented industrialization period. Foreign exchange rate causes <b>imported</b> <b>production</b> goods to change during import substitution period, but the direction of causality exists adversely during export oriented industrialization period. The foreign exchange rate directs export, export directs GNP, and GNP directs the foreign exchange rates after 1980. The foreign TOT (terms of trade) and realized foreign direct investment inflow into Turkey are not causal sources for the changes in gross national product and <b>production</b> goods <b>import.</b> Direction of causations, growth related policy variables, Turkish Economy. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simulation model for production planning personnel to carry out optimization of part input sequence. The model simulates a flexible manufacturing system for the production of machined components. Using a custom built user interface, the planner <b>imports</b> <b>production</b> and demand data from an Excel spreadsheet into the model. The model optimizes part input sequence by simulating different combinations of part input sequences and determining the combination with the highest total slack time. Simulation conducted by the authors using this model shows that even a short, partial optimization run yields a schedule with improved slack. Presented in the paper are the steps involved {{in the development of the}} model and the benefits of the simulation-optimization model to the planner. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to describe, how supply and use tables and {{symmetrical}} input-output tables are made for Finnish regions. Analysis was done first time for the year 1995. Studies made in 1995 and 2002 are not totally comparable, because of methodological modifications at the national accounts. Goal of the project is, however, to enable studies analysing changes in the regional economic structures. Research results make possible to analyse one region at the time or to do comparisons among regions simultaneously. Tables include information about consumption, investments, exports and <b>imports,</b> <b>production</b> value and volume of goods and services, and economical interdependies of the regions and industries. Corner stone of national as well as regional accounts is a European System of National Accounts ESA 1995. In the supply and use tables national accounts are balanced and divided to the products, which reduces statistical discrepancy. The biggest difference between studies of 1995 and 2002 is the way, how trade flows are estimated. There are no survey made to the industrial establishments in the current research. Trade flows are estimated instead by freight flow approach, which combines industrial products' sales and transportation data. First regional balances of supply and demand have now been estimated. From the economical transactions, private consumption and exports and imports, are already divided to the National Accounts product classification level. Research continues now by dividing reminding parts of the regional balance of supply and demand to the products and by fixing problematic parts of it, such as production taxes and subsidies, foreign trade and interregional trade flows. When regional balances of supply and demand are almost equal, product dividing will be finished and making of supply and use tables will begin. In addition to supply and use tables there is a need of data from amount and hours of labour by industry. Data from the labor is from Regional Accounts and labor hours will be estimated as a new economic transaction by using information from Regional Accounts and service structure statistics...|$|E
