40|$|Purpose: Over 200, 000 {{young people}} in the UK embark on a smoking career annually, thus {{continued}} effort is required to understand the types of interventions that are most effective in changing perceptions about smoking amongst teenagers. Several authors have proposed the use of Social Norms programmes, where correcting misconceptions of what is considered normal behaviour lead to improved behaviours. There are a limited number of studies showing the effectiveness of such programmes for changing teenagers’ perception of smoking habits, and hence this paper reports on the results from one of the largest Social Norms programmes that used a variety of interventions aimed at improving teenagers’ perceptions of smoking. Design/methodology/approach: A range of interventions was adopted for 57 programmes in Year 9 students, ranging from more passive interventions such as posters and banners to more active interventions such as student apps and enterprise days. Each programme consisted of a baseline survey followed by interventions and a repeat survey to calculate changes in perception. A clustering algorithm was also used to reveal the impact of combinations of interventions. Findings: The study reveals three main findings: (i) the use of social norms is an effective means of changing perceptions (ii) the level of interventions and change in perceptions are positively correlated and (iii) that the most effective combinations of interventions include the use of interactive <b>feedback</b> <b>assemblies,</b> enterprise days, parent and student apps and newsletters to parents. Originality/value: The paper presents results from one of the largest social norm programmes aimed at improving young people’s perceptions and is the first to use clustering methods to reveal the impact of combinations of intervention...|$|R

This paper presents our approach for the integration of auditory <b>feedback</b> into virtual <b>assembly</b> environment (VAE), and the investigation of the effect of auditory and visual <b>feedback</b> on the <b>assembly</b> task performance in virtual environments (VE). This VE experimental system platform brought together complex technologies such as constraint-based assembly simulation, optical motion tracking technology, and real-time 3 D sound generation technology around a Virtual Reality (VR) workbench and a common software platform. Several experiments have been conducted to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of neutral, visual, auditory and integrated feedback mechanisms on task performance in the context of assembly simulation in VEs. Peg-in-a-hole assembly task has been used as the task case to perform the experiments, using sixteen subjects. Both objective performance data (task completion time) and subjective opinions (questionnaires) on the utilisation of auditory and visual feedback in VAE were gained from the experiments. The results showed that the addition of auditory feedback did introduce an improvement in the virtual assembly task performance. They also indicated that the statistically significant effect of the combination of auditory and visual <b>feedback</b> on the <b>assembly</b> task performance was better than individual feedback mechanism used alone. Most of the users preferred the combined feedbacks to the individual ones.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a networked cooperative environment to achieve human/robot cooperation for reliable and dependable remote microassembly. At a microscale, surface adhesion forces, such as van der Waals, surface tension and electrostatic forces, become stronger than the downward gravitational force. For a reliable and dependable tele-microassembly, it is absolutely necessary to allow close monitoring of the magnitude and direction of those micro-forces interacting with microdevices during the assembly process. In this paper, based on integrating an in situ polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric micro-force sensing tool with a resolution in the range of μN, and using event-synchronization for the <b>feedback</b> of <b>assembly</b> video and micro-force, the developed networked human/robot cooperative platform can greatly advance applications in tele-microassembly. As a result, the reliable and dependable human/robot cooperative assembly operations can be achieved and extended to the single or multiple remote work-cells through a local area network or the Internet. This platform has been used successfully to perform a remote assembly of surface MEMS structures with the event-synchronized micro-force/visual feedback via the Internet between USA and Hong Kong. © VSP 2006.

Forty-three subjects performed several assembly tasks (peg-in-hole, narrow passage) designed with two levels of difficulty. The used haptic rendering algorithm is based on voxel and point data-structures. Both objective -time and collision performance- and subjective measures have been recorded and analyzed. The comparison of the feedback modalities revealed a clear and highly significant superiority of force <b>feedback</b> in virtual <b>assembly</b> scenarios. The objective data shows that whereas the assembly time is similar in most cases for both conditions, force collision feedback yields significantly smaller collision forces, which indicate higher assembly precision. The subjective ratings of the participants define the force feedback condition as the most appropriate for determining clearances and correcting collision configurations, being the best suited modality to predict mountability...|$|R

With the advent of haptics and its integration into virtual assembly systems, users now have the potential advantage of tactile information. This paper reports research that aims to quantify how the provision of haptic <b>feedback</b> in an <b>assembly</b> system can affect user performance. To investigate human–computer interaction processes in assembly modeling, performance of a peg-in-hole manipulation was studied {{to determine the extent to}} which haptics and stereovision may impact on task completion time. The results support two important conclusions: first, it is apparent that small (i. e. visually insignificant) assembly features (e. g. chamfers) affect the overall task completion at times only when haptic feedback is provided; and second, that the difference is approximately similar to the values reported for equivalent real world peg-in-hole assembly tasks...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{facilities}} employ {{various types}} of transfer lines and networks with workstations and buffers. This approach promotes the production and fabrication of multicomponent equipments and systems. Analysis of these lines requires the application of discrete time Markov Chain methods. These methods when computerized present certain problems concerning the data storage of large sparse transition matrices. Repetitive multiplication techniques were used to provide the general Markov Chain solution for a series transfer line. These solutions were then computerized to evaluate the series line's availability trajectory. The limiting (leveling off) point for each trajectory provided the steady state availability. From these solutions the work then focuses {{on the development of}} new computer algorithms for the series transfer line configuration. These algorithms employ advanced techniques to minimize the storage of large sparse vectors and matices while maintaining relatively fast computational times. The algorithms rely on the line's transition matrix decomposition via graph theoretic methods. A set of library functions written in the C language were specially written to manipulate the Markov Chain matrix and vector data. An extensive set of results were analyzed for the three and four workstation series transfer lines. This analysis employed linear model regression techniques. Results were also collected for the five workstation line. These results show a marked improvement in overall availability when the line's last workstation has a high reliability. In addition, preliminary results indicate that three and four workstation series lines' overall availability are linear combinations of each workstation's availability. Finally, proposed topics for future research are presented in eight major areas. These topics include the development of models for parallel series, series parallel, <b>feedback</b> control, <b>assembly,</b> and disassembly type lines. Also, approximation models and decomposition methods are described in detail...|$|R
50|$|Designed in house, {{the third}} {{generation}} Pajero debuted in the Japanese domestic market in 1999, whilst it was made available to other markets in late 2000 as a 2001 model. The Philippines and other developing nations received this generation Pajero in 2003. The vehicle was completely redesigned, inside and out and had a lower, wider stance. A lower center of gravity meant the Pajero had better on-road handling manners and the newer body had over three hundred percent more torsional rigidity. The biggest change to bring this about was that the Pajero utilized a unibody construction, {{as opposed to the}} previous body-on-frame (box-ladder). This also permitted a longer suspension stroke. The fuel tank was also relocated to between the axles for better safety. The third generation Pajero moved one size up from mid-size to full-size SUV.

Both the underlying social {{structure and the}} formation of opinions are dynamic and changes in one affect the other. Several positive feedback mechanisms have been proposed to drive the diversity in social and economic systems (1, 2), but little effort has been devoted to pinpoint the interplay between a dynamically changing social network and the spread and gathering of information on the network. Here we analyze this phenomenon in terms of a social network model that explicitly simulates the <b>feedback</b> between information <b>assembly</b> and emergence of social structures: changing beliefs are coupled to changing relationships because agents self-organize a dynamic network to facilitate their hunter-gatherer behavior in information space. Our analysis demonstrates that tribal organizations and modular social networks can emerge as a result of contact-seeking agents that reinforce their beliefs among like-minded. We also find that prestigious persons can streamline the social network into hierarchical structures around themselves. The competition between segregation and coherence in social systems has long been a subject of both practical and theoretical interest. T. Schelling proposed simple models t...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundMany of {{the diverse}} {{functions}} of cilia depend upon tight control of their length. Steady-state length reflects a balance between rates of ciliary assembly and disassembly, two parameters likely controlled by a length sensor of unknown identity or mechanism. ResultsA null mutation in Chlamydomonas CNK 2, {{a member of the}} evolutionarily conserved family of NIMA-related kinases, reveals <b>feedback</b> regulation of <b>assembly</b> and disassembly rates. cnk 2 - 1 mutant cells have a mild long-flagella (lf) phenotype as a consequence of reduced rates of flagellar disassembly. This is in contrast to the strong lf mutant lf 4 - 7, which exhibits an aberrantly high rate of assembly. Cells carrying both mutations have even longer flagella than lf 4 - 7 single mutants do. In addition to their high rate of assembly, lf 4 - 7 mutants have a CNK 2 -dependent increase in disassembly rate. Finally, cnk 2 - 1 cells have a decreased rate of turnover of flagellar subunits {{at the tip of the}} flagellum, demonstrating that the effects on disassembly are compensated by a reduced rate of assembly. ConclusionsWe propose a model wherein CNK 2 and LF 4 modulate rates of disassembly and assembly respectively in a feedback loop that is activated when flagella exceed optimal length...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how radiative {{feedback from the}} first stars affects the assembly of the first dwarf galaxies. To this end we perform cosmological zoomed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of a dwarf galaxyassembling inside a halo reachingavirial mass ∼ 10 9 M ⊙ at z = 10. The simulations follow the non-equilibrium chemistry and cooling of primordial gas and the subsequent conversion of the cool dense gas into massive metal-free stars. To quantify the radiative feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars emit both molecular hydrogen dissociating and hydrogen/helium ionizing radiation with a simulation in which stars emit only molecular hydrogen dissociating radiation, and further with a simulation in which stars remain dark. Photodissociation and photoionization exert a strong negative <b>feedback</b> on the <b>assembly</b> of the galaxy inside the main minihalo progenitor. Gas condensation is strongly impeded, and star formation is strongly suppressed {{in comparison with the}} simulation in which stars remain dark.

40|$|A {{framework}} is proposed {{for measuring the}} difficulty of substituting a robot for semiskilled and unskilled workers in factories. Motivations for the framwork are given in the first paper. The Sensory <b>Feedback</b> Dependence of <b>Assembly</b> Tasks as a Measure of Comparative Advantage of Human Workers vis-a-vis Sensor-Based Robots; by R. U. Ayres. The basic premise {{is that the more}} a human 2 ̆ 7 s performance is degraded by interference with visual and tactile senses, the more difficult and expensive it would be to substitute a robot for a human. It is proposed that for types of tasks where there is a trade-off between performance time and precision, the relative degradation in human task performance due to sensory deprivation is a useful measure of the difficulty of replacing a worker with a robot. Results of experiments where the visual and tactile input to human subjects is degraded and the time to assemble different devicies is measured are reported in the second paper, Human Assembly Time versus Levels of Visual and Tactile Sensory Input; Experimental Results for Five Devices 2 ̆ 7, by S. M. Miller. The results show that (1) there is an inverse relationship between the amount of visual and tactile sensory input and the time required to assemble a device, (2) that the relative degradation in assembly time due to sensory deprivation varies greatly across different assembly jobs, and (3) that assembly jobs which are extremely sensitive to the degradation of visual and/or tactile input can be identified. Estimates of the sensitivity of elemental and manipulative subtasks (e. g. reach, grasp, move position, turn) to degradations in visual and tactile input are also reported...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how radiative {{feedback from the}} first stars affects the assembly of the first dwarf galaxies. We perform cosmological zoomed SPH simulations of a dwarf galaxy assembling inside a halo of virial mass 10 ^ 9 solar at z = 10. The simulations follow the non-equilibrium chemistry/cooling of primordial gas and {{the conversion of the}} gas into metal-free stars. To quantify the radiative feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars emit both molecular hydrogen dissociating and hydrogen/helium ionizing radiation with a simulation in which stars emit only dissociating radiation, and with a simulation in which stars remain dark. Photodissociation and -ionization exert a strong negative <b>feedback</b> on the <b>assembly</b> of the simulated galaxy. Gas condensation is strongly impeded, and star formation is strongly suppressed in comparison with the simulation in which stars remain dark. The feedback on the gas implies a suppression of the central dark matter densities in the minihalo progenitor by factors of up to a few, which is a significant deviation from the singular isothermal density profile characterizing the dark matter distribution in the absence of radiative feedback. The evolution of gas densities, star formation rates, and the distribution of dark matter becomes insensitive to the inclusion of dissociating radiation in the late stages of the minihalo assembly, and it becomes insensitive to the inclusion of ionizing radiation once the minihalo turns into an atomically cooling galaxy. The formation of an extended disk inside the dwarf galaxy is a robust outcome not affected by the inclusion of radiation. We estimate that dwarf galaxies such as simulated here will be among the faintest galaxies the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will detect. Our conclusions are subject to our neglect of feedback from supernovae and chemical enrichment as well as to cosmic variance. [abridged]Comment: 25 pages (including 5 pages appendix), 13 figures.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of galaxies provides a powerful probe {{of the underlying}} physics driving their evolution, complementing the traditional tools of morphology, kinematics,and colours. This dissertation examines several aspects of the galactic chemical evolution of late-type galaxies - both disc-like and dwarf - using a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which incorporate the nucleosynthetic pollution of the interstellar medium, supplemented with classical analytical models of Local Group dwarfs. Throughout the work, these models are confronted with extant observations of both local and high-redshift systems, {{in order to identify}} both {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the current generation of galaxy models. The work here has been presented across four primary science chapters which follow on from the Introduction and Motivation, prior to closing with the Conclusions and Future Directions. The first science result (Chapter 2) derives from an examination of the cold (neutral) gas content of the first-ever simulated bulgeless dwarf disc galaxies (Governato et al. 2010), and builds upon the work first presented in Pilkington et al. (2011). The focus of the work is on comparing the observables inferred from the simulated interstellar media, with those seen in nature (including The HI Nearby Galaxies Survey and the Magellanic Clouds), including their velocity dispersion profiles, disc flaring, and the distribution of power within the ISM’s structure, on different scales. Going beyond the work in Pilkington et al. (2011), two additional simulations from the Governato et al. (2010) suite are included, and the original work has been extended to include an analysis of the chemical properties of the dwarf galaxies. The second science result (Chapter 3) examines the role of feedback, metal diffusion, and initial mass function selection, on the resulting {{chemistry of}} a new grid of M 33 -like disc simulations. The emphasis of the analysis is upon the resulting age-metallicity relations and metallicity distribution functions (in particular, the extreme metal-poor tail). Aspects of the work have been presented by Pilkington et al. (2012 b), enhanced here by a further examination of the satellites associated with their respective host galaxies. The satellites are seen to be free of gas, with star formation histories which make them not unlike Local Group dwarf spheroidals. The third science result (Chapter 4) is based upon an analysis of the temporal evolution of metallicity gradients in Milky Way-like systems, and derives from the work presented in Pilkington et al. (2012 d). A large suite of simulations, sampling a range of numerical codes (particle- and grid-based, in addition to classical Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models), each with different treatments of star formation, energy <b>feedback,</b> and <b>assembly</b> histories, was employed. The analysis focussed on both the radial and vertical abundance gradients, emphasising the role of feedback in shaping the gradients, and demonstrates the critical role that new observations of in situ gradients at high-redshift can play in constraining the uncertain nature of feedback within simulations. This work has been complemented by a brief examination of the azimuthal abundance variations in the massive discs. The fourth science result (Chapter 5) expands upon our earlier exploration of the chemical properties of simulated dwarf galaxies, but now employs a classical semi-numerical GCE approach. By coupling colour-magnitude diagram-constrained star formation histories with our GEtool GCE code, we attempt to constrain the relative rates of gas infall and outflow, for the Carina, Fornax, and Sculptor Local Group dwarfs, in order to match their empirical chemical abundance patterns and metallicity distribution functions. This builds upon the preliminary work, as presented by Pilkington & Gibson (2012 a) ...|$|R
