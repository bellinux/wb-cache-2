40|$|The {{value of}} real options has been {{discussed}} extensivelyit helps explain managerial decisions in designing the rollout of bold initiatives in uncertain environments. However, few studies directly trace the impact of option usage {{on the performance of}} such <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Do all firms benefit from the flexibility that options confer? To answer this question, I collected detailed survey data on individual options designed into the implementation plans of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>initiatives,</b> focusing exclusively on options that were, eventually, in the money. The sample observations display significant variation in the degree to which flexibility benefit was realized from options, if at all. I find that this variance stems, in part, from heterogeneous organizational capability, regarding not only option creation but also option maintenance, exercise, and governance. These results imply that attainable benefit is highly firm specific. Holding valuable options does not predict performance of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>initiatives,</b> unless it is accompanied by active management of the option life cycle.

5000|$|Until about 1830 Amriswil was {{a nondescript}} village with some farming and viticulture. The {{introduction}} of cattle (1833), a monthly market (1840), {{the establishment of}} a dairy in Sommeri (1852), the emergence of large scale weaving and the opening of a knitting factory through the German refugee Joseph Sallmann (1849) were the beginning of a structural change. This was followed by the opening of the Northeastern Railway (1855). Between the square and the station a new settlement area grew up. The town center shifted from the previous settlement nuclei around the market and the road intersection in Köpplishaus toward the northeast. The rapid industrialization, however, can not be satisfactorily explained by the modest amounts of hydropower available or through the increased traffic. Rather, <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>initiative</b> seems to have been an important stimulus. The companies Sallmann, Laib, and Tuchschmid were a center of manufacturing, known as the Trikoterie. While Esco and Löw were important representatives of the clothing and footwear industry. The growth led to structural problems especially in water supply, which were resolved definitively in 1952 with the purchase of water from Lake Constance.|$|E

The request to encourage the early development of initiative and entrepreneurial competencies is articulated at structural and procedural levels of curricular approaches and changes in educational systems. This study examines self-assessment of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>initiative</b> among elementary school pupils in Croatia in order to detect pupils ’ entrepreneurial characteristics and preferences.

Therefore, the research was conducted at the national level on a sample of 1, 962 elementary school pupils.
