40|$|In the {{traditional}} science {{of medicine and}} medical education, teaching human anatomy in the class has always been done using human cadavers. Not only does this violate human sanctity, but according to our research, it is not adequate {{to provide students with}} the alleged educational value that it is supposed to deliver. It is very cumbersome to organise all the aspects of cadaver care. Cadavers are also very limited when it comes to controlling their structures and any benefit is almost completely altered the first time the cadaver is used (dissected), and ironically, it is very weak at delivering actual real-life scenarios of a human body to students. Virtual anatomy has been a promising solution that many are counting on. But even today, we have not found a complete solution that combines all the benefits of using human cadavers and those introduced by its technical counterparts. "Soul Anatomy" aims to do just that. It brings the best of all worlds, from a natural intuitive control system, life-like feel of organs, precise accuracy in moving and controlling bodily structures, to the smallest details of being able to show medical <b>information</b> <b>overlays</b> from various medical databases connected to the internet; thus making use of technology in teaching human anatomy by providing a modern learning experience...|$|E
40|$|The {{representation}} of business process models {{has been a}} continuing research topic for many years now. However, many process model representations have not developed beyond minimally interactive 2 D icon-based representations of directed graphs and networks, {{with little or no}} annotation for <b>information</b> <b>overlays.</b> In addition, very few of these representations have undergone a thorough analysis or design process with reference to psychological theories on data and process visualization. This dearth of visualization research, we believe, has led to problems with BPM uptake in some organizations, as the representations can be difficult for stakeholders to understand, and thus remains an open research question for the BPM community. In addition, business analysts and process modeling experts themselves need visual representations that are able to assist with key BPM life cycle tasks in the process of generating optimal solutions. With the rise of desktop computers and commodity mobile devices capable of supporting rich interactive 3 D environments, we believe that much of the research performed in computer human interaction, virtual reality, games and interactive entertainment have much potential in areas of BPM; to engage, provide insight, and to promote collaboration amongst analysts and stakeholders alike. We believe this is a timely topic, with research emerging in a number of places around the globe, relevant to this workshop. This is the second TAProViz workshop being run at BPM. The intention this year is to consolidate on the results of last year's successful workshop by further developing this important topic, identifying the key research topics of interest to the BPM visualization community...|$|E

40|$|TerraFly is an {{interactive}} tool {{that allows for}} visualization and manipulation of spatial data. Accessed via a standard Web browser or customized CD-ROM versions, and independent of a users' level of expertise, this system allows the integration of remotely sensed data with digital data while a user is seamlessly flying over and viewing the resulting imagery. Data currently available includes land, urban, and coastal imagery collected by satellites, aerial photography, and other remote sensing means covering 97 % of continental US (including Alaska) in high quality. Features that expand the data manipulation capabilities in TerraFly include: a compass control that allows 360 -degree control of flight direction and speed, access to a database of place/street names and their coordinates, complete descriptions of areas of defined interest, zoom in/zoom out capabilities, ability to view specific spectral bands of the imagery, and <b>information</b> <b>overlays</b> that allow users to highlight specific features from the database. TerraFly supports synchronous flight in multiple windows, so imagery taken at different times, with different resolutions or camera-types can easily be compared side-by-side.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new approach to using Augmented Reality for presenting and navigating through information in a scenario involving a board game. Learning the rules and strategies of a new game can be a challenging task for players. In particular, this can be an intimidating task for people who do not regularly play board games. Many board games are complex and new players require several sessions to learn {{them to be able to}} play at a reasonable speed while providing a challenge to experienced players. New players generally prefer not to read the manuals and instead learn to play the game on the fly and by asking experienced players. Several issues arise here for more experienced players who need to explain the game rules on the fly and when explaining strategies. This research therefore has been guided by the following question: How can an Augmented Reality experience be designed for board games to communicate information in an interactive and non-intrusive way? This has been addressed by conducting an ethnographic inspired study on public board game sessions and a research through design methodology. The board game, Settlers of Catan was selected and the Activity Theory framework was used to explore the relationship between the components in a game session. Interactive augmented <b>information</b> <b>overlays</b> were designed using design principles of visual communication and information design. Guided by Flow Theory, the experience was designed to be in-situ and non-intrusive. The research showcases my approach to use Augmented Reality as a medium for information, moving beyond the focus on enabling technology. Innovative approach for video capture and for occlusion-based navigation of augmented content has been demonstrated through the process of design and the subsequent development of a series of software prototypes. I have used Research through Design as the methodology for generating new knowledge through five design iterations of a software prototype for the game Settlers of Catan, and evaluated the prototype through peer-review and user testing...|$|E
40|$|How {{should a}} {{regional}} Geographical Information System look like? This {{ought not to}} be a problem after various authors have pointed out the geographical roots in the development of GIS: the concept of layers of the regional scheme (Kilchenmann), the development of spatial concepts (Kainz) in general or concepts of landscape research (Dollinger). But in reality {{from the point of view}} of geography almost nothing has changed since the establishment of the first region - or country-related Geographical Information Systems. Since the beginning of this development the concept of layers of the regional scheme has proved to be worthwhile both as a basis for the compilation of inventories and a concept for data storage (layer structure). Geometric intersection and verious forms of <b>information</b> <b>overlays</b> have developed as a main methodology of GIS as well as the representation of results in maps, besides data- and methodbases, as an euqal constituent part of GIS as compared with general information systems. Current developments are characterized by an increasing specialization in the structure and application of GIS. More and more, one speaks of land, regional, environmental, channal, or communal information systems. Since geography, owing to its specific subject, can seldom contribute to them the term "Geographical" Information System will survive only as a generic term or will degenerate into a trade name for a group of software products. However, some approaches towards a regional GIS can be seen provided that not a restriction of the subject dealt with but a spatial delimitation of the area concerned, i. e. a region, a landscape or a country, in its complex structure is taken as a basis for the establishment of a concrete GIS. Steps in this direction, beside GIS developed in the 1960 s for Canada, Switzerland and the federal states of the USA, are chiefly GIS for the Laender of Austria currently, being set up or first approaches towards GIS for developing countries. When geography regards and uses the information system bearing its name not only as a mere software package but brings its specific possibilities to bear and develops them further especially in the field of methodology, then the regional GIS in the form of a specific geoinformation system used in institutes, schools and appropriate authorities is not far off...|$|E

Even with the latest hardware and software technologies, achieving both real-time and accurate augmented <b>information</b> <b>overlay</b> in MIS is still a formidable task. In this paper, we present a novel real-time AR framework for MIS that achieves interactive geometric aware augmented reality in endoscopic surgery with stereo views. Our framework tracks {{the movement of the}} endoscopic camera and simultaneously reconstructs a dense geometric mesh of the MIS scene. The movement of the camera is predicted by minimising the re-projection error to achieve a fast tracking performance, while the 3 D mesh is incrementally built by a dense zero mean normalised cross correlation stereo matching method to improve the accuracy of the surface reconstruction. Our proposed system does not require any prior template or pre-operative scan and can infer the geometric information intra-operatively in real-time.
