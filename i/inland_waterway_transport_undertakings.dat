In order to encourage {{further development of}} <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in this paper focus is set on {{the identification of the}} barriers that limit and prevent development of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport.</b> More specifically, emphasis is placed on the barriers that are preventing the cargo shifting from land to <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> system. Research conducted in case of Republic of Serbia investigates several barriers which are classified in four main categories: goods, logistics, infrastructure, framework conditions.

Results indicate that the most significant negative influence on the further development of the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in Serbia comes from the political/legal barriers.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} to analyse {{and compare the}} transport costs of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> and road-only-transport. The influence of the economies of scale in <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> and terminal operations {{are taken into account}} in the analysis. In the model the transport costs are defined and related to different transport operations and conditions (e. g. share of empty kilometres, capacity usage of terminals, etc.) in order to analyse the sensitivity of the cost performance of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport.</b> By doing this it is possible to analyse to what extent intermodal freight transport is competitive with road-only transport in terms of transport costs and specific operations and conditions (both in shipping and terminal). The conclusions prove that roundtrips, drop & pick operations in pre- and end-haulage and smaller containers (20 ft instead of 40 ft) considerably improve the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport,</b> while the relative high cost operations in small terminals reduce the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport...</b>|$|R

40|$|Future {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in most main natural waterways in Europe. For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> vessels have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport prices per tonne will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks. We assess the effect of low water levels on the costs of <b>transport</b> operations for <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in North West Europe under several climate scenarios. It turns out, that {{the effect on the}} modal split is limited. Under the most extreme climate scenario, <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> would lose about 5. 4 % of the quantity that is currently being transported annually in the part of the European <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> market considered.

40|$|Future climate {{conditions}} {{are likely to}} affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in Europe. According to some climate scenarios, in summer, in the river Rhine, periods with low water levels are likely to occur more often and become more serious. Then <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> carriers will experience more severe restrictions on the load factor of their inland ships, which implies a stronger reduction in transport capacity in the market. Transport prices will rise under such conditions. Some studies reviewed in this paper find that at extremely low water levels, the price per tonne for <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in the river Rhine area will almost double. These increased transport prices result in welfare losses. For the dry summer in 2003, the losses for North West Europe are estimated to sum up to around € 480 million. Increased transport prices trigger adaptation. <b>Inland</b> <b>waterway</b> carriers may use smaller vessels, and shippers {{have the opportunity to}} shift from <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> to alternative transport modes in periods with low water levels. This effect is probably rather modest, however, with a modal shift to road and rail smaller than 10 %. Also, changes in transport costs may lead to relocation of certain economic activities in the long run. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change may}} affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> through {{disturbances}} in waterway hydrology: longer periods with strong water swells and drops. To allow fully loaded barges, {{the water level}} must be neither too high (limited air draught) nor too low (limited draught). Therefore, the water level impacts the load factor of barges and thus the transportation costs. Moreover, in winter, ice jams can paralyze <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> traffic on the river. In this paper, the effect of various climatological changes on the capacity of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> in terms of barge transport is examined. The paper focusses {{on the development of}} a methodology for assessing the sensitivity of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> systems to climatological changes and takes into account an experts' opinion survey that provides insight into the perceived likelihood of the different scenarios that are investigated.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that climate change will affect important natural <b>inland</b> <b>waterways</b> in Europe, among others, the Rhine River. <b>Inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> {{is one of the}} main economic activities developed in the Rhine, and the effects of climate change on this activity are of great concern for skippers, the industry and policy-makers. This paper aims to identify whether longer and more frequent dry periods projected in the Rhine River will turn into a physical limitation that prevent <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> companies from guaranteeing reliable transportation to their customers, and – if so – when such a situation might take place. Based on the adaptation turning point approach, we propose a four step method to identify critical time periods for future climate change adaptation. According to our results, the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> sector will start facing insurmountable problems associated with low water levels within the time span 2081 – 2095. The adaptation turning point approach provides analysts with a dynamic appraisal method that allows options to be ranked with timing of period of effectiveness and the time span needed for implementation as criteria. This increases flexibility of planning and allows for uncertainty about changing future conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> is an {{important}} economic activity in the Netherlands and in Europe. Especially in the hinterland transport of containers, inland shipping is expected to form the backbone of a multimodal transport system. To support and strengthen the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> industry in the Netherlands, the Dutch Government conducted a stimulus program called Impuls Dynamic Traffic Management Waterways. As part of this stimulus program, research was carried out into the economic structure of the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> industry, {{and the potential for}} cooperation in certain geographical areas in the hinterland. To support the development of new logistics concepts for <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport,</b> we developed a simulator, in which market parties can develop new transport and logistics concepts, and investigate the impact of implementing these concepts. Several gaming sessions with industry representatives were conducted for six of the main geographical areas in the Dutch waterway system.

40|$|According to {{economic}} theory, imbalances in trade flows affect transport prices because (some) carriers {{have to return}} without cargo from the low demand region to the high demand region.

We study this effect using transport prices for the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> market in north-west Europe.

30|$|A third {{measure of}} {{adjustment}} {{is the use}} of alternative, environmentally more friendly transport modes such as rail and <b>waterway</b> <b>transport.</b> Shifting transport from road to rail or waterways is an old challenge, which until now has been hampered through the inability to fulfil logistic requirements of just-in-time or just-in-sequence <b>transport.</b> <b>Inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> is always exposed to the risk of high or low water. While this may be acceptable for bulk cargo, it is increasingly unacceptable for unitised and container transport. As the market structure is changing towards the latter, the possibility of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> to contribute to the GHG reduction issue will be limited. The railways have the technological potential to compete with road in the market of synchronised freight transport; however, the organisational performance of the railway companies is still limited because of missing commercial orientation.

40|$|Transport {{time and}} cost are decisive factors for shippers when they choose a mode for their <b>transport.</b> For <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in particular, these aspects are more {{uncertain}} and less easy to generalize than for road and rail. This {{is due to}} the highly variable waterway conditions on free-flowing rivers and due to the large variety of inland ships. Today´s transport models, however, do not take these factors into account. This paper shows that dynamic fairway conditions, the ship’s amount of propulsion power, and the captain’s behaviour have a substantial impact on the attainable speed and fuel consumption of inland ships. This in turn has a significant impact on attainable sailing schedules and transportation cost, as we demonstrate through a case study for ships sailing on the Rhine-Danube corridor.
