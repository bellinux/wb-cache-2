5|$|After Morton Mintz {{broke the}} story in July 1962, there was a {{substantial}} public outcry. The Kefauver Harris Amendment was passed unanimously by Congress in October 1962 to strengthen drug regulation.

5|$|Another study {{suggested}} that EFS {{might contribute to}} acute rheumatic fever susceptibility. In this work, {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) <b>from</b> <b>patients</b> with rheumatoid heart disease (RHD) and control subjects that had never experienced acute rheumatoid fever were stimulated with rheumatogenic and non-rheumatogenic group A streptococci (GAS) strains. EFS was one of only four genes with significantly increased expression in both arms of the study: 1) RHD patient versus control PBMCs after stimulation of both groups with rheumatogenic GAS and 2) RHD patient PBMC stimulated with rheumatogenic versus non-rheumatogenic GAS.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} of legal proceedings, {{disability}} rights groups and activists closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, twelve disability rights groups, led by Not Dead Yet, along with four other amici, filed an amicus curiae brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube. They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support <b>from</b> <b>patients</b> unable to give consent.|$|E
5|$|The chapter also {{examines}} celebrity {{endorsement of}} certain drugs, {{the extent to}} which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced, and whether direct-to-consumer advertising (currently permitted in the US and New Zealand) ought to be allowed. It discusses how PR firms promote stories <b>from</b> <b>patients</b> who complain in the media that certain drugs are not made available by the funder, which in the UK is the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Two breast-cancer patients who campaigned in the UK in 2006 for trastuzumab (Herceptin) to be available on the NHS were being handled by a law firm working for Roche, the drug's manufacturer. The historian Lisa Jardine, who was suffering from breast cancer, told the Guardian that she had been approached by a PR firm working for the company.|$|E
