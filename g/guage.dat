40|$|When a shaft is {{measured}} with a plain snap <b>guage,</b> the diameter of <b>guage</b> is usually expanded by a wedge action due to measuring pressure. The authors made single purpose snap guages of several shapes as testing pieces and compared and examined respective allowable expanse with one another. They obtained the following results. 1) The nearer the <b>guage</b> diameter the position to be measured is, the larger is the allowable expanse with increasing measurement errors. 2) The length of a <b>guage</b> arm should be kept within the necessary minimum limit. 3) The expanse results in appearance of fillet of the <b>guage</b> arm and in relief of the <b>guage</b> surface. The expanse is greatly influenced by the shape and size of undercut. 4) As the coefficient of friction varies with different materials and conditions of pieces to be measured, the expanse varies too and the accuracy of measurement becomes changeable. Accordingly {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of measurement, it is essential further to know the relation of the working tolerance with the abrasion allowance and the optimum application scope of snap guages in practical use. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} when {{left and right}} handed neutrinos a have majorana mass matrix, local <b>guage</b> {{invariance}} produces a fifth force acting between chiral charges on neutrinos and quarks. The force is a carried by a massless (or low mass) 1 -spin <b>guage</b> boson, we call an axiphoton. The force {{is caused by a}} U(1) axial <b>guage</b> symmetry in the way as the electromagnetic force. We expect from renormalisation that the force constant, αa is about 1 / 60 of the electromagnetic force constant α. We show that this force can explain dark energy. Our model predicts decaying right handed neutrinos in the eV-MeV range, and explain the heating of the solar corona. Finally we show that the Tajmar [32] experiment detecting a force due to a rotating superconductor, may be detection of our force. ...|$|E

40|$|There are {{at least}} as many {{interesting}} classes of regular tree lan- <b>guages</b> as there are of regular word languages. However, much less is known about the former ones. In particular, very few decidable char- acterizations of tree language classes are known. For words, most known characterizations are obtained using algebra. With this in mind, the present paper proposes an algebraic framework for classi- fying regular languages of ﬁnite unranked labeled trees. If in a transformation semigroup we assume that the set being acted upon has a semigroup structure, then the transformation semi- group can be used to recognize languages of unranked trees. This observation allows us to examine the relationship connecting tree lan- <b>guages</b> with standard algebraic concepts such as aperiodicity idem- potency, or commutativity. The new algebraic setting is used to give several examples of decidable algebraic characterizations...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a structured modeling lan <b>guage</b> (SML) and a relational database frame-work for specification and automated genera tion of causal models. The framework describes a relational database scheme for encoding a li brary of causal network templates modeling the basic components in a modeling domain. SML provides a formal language for specifying mod els as structured components {{that can be}} com posed from the basic components. The lan <b>guage</b> enables specification of models as param eterized relational queries that can be instan tiated for specific model instances. The pa per describes an algorithm that, given a library and a specification, computes a causal model {{in time and space}} linear in the number of ba sic components. The algorithm enables model reuse by combining model fragments from the template library to compose new models. The present automated modeling approach has been implemented using the structured query lan <b>guage</b> (SQL) and a relational database envi ronment. The approach has been successfully used for modeling an automated work-cell in a real-life digital manufacturing application. ...|$|E

40|$|The current {{generation}} of textiles, including technical textiles are passive. However, {{the next generation of}} textiles will have the ability to monitor programmed functionality. One of the solutions for incorporating the above components into a textile structure is to create electrically active zones within the structure, whose electrical characteristics could vary due to an environmental change or whose structural properties could be changed by the application of an electrical signal, for example change of dimensions due to the flow of an electrical current in the electrically active area. Generally textiles are made out of materials of very high electrical resistance and therefore these structures can be considered as materials with good electrical insulating properties.

The Introduction gives rea- sons for choosing the topic and outlines the general {{structure of the}} thesis. Chapter 1 (Lan- <b>guages</b> and Interpreting) delineates theoretical issues pertinent to language typology accord- ing to Skalička, comparing the structures of Czech and Portuguese, and outlines a basic intro- duction to interpreting.
