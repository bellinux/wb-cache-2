For the {{campaign}} against Taliban and Al Qaeda, A-10 squadrons were deployed to Pakistan and Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, beginning in March 2002. These A-10s participated in Operation Anaconda. Afterwards, A-10s remained in-country, fighting Taliban and Al Qaeda remnants.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to the Soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo. Also in 1980, the new embassy under construction in Moscow was found to be so riddled with listening devices that it would be unusable for secure work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the buildup}} to the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> six F-15s and 161 {{personnel}} {{were sent to}} the Persian Gulf region. The wing also patrolled the skies of the Northeastern United States during this time period. The wing though never deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The wing converted from the F-15A/B to the F-15C/D in 2004. These planes came from Kadena Air Base.|$|E

5|$|The United States led {{the boycott}} {{in protest of}} the December 1979 Soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> and were joined by more than 60 other nations. In response, the 1984 Summer Olympics, in Los Angeles, were boycotted by the Soviet Union {{and many of their}} allies, yet a total of 140 nations did participate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E
5000|$|The letter, {{the first}} written {{communication}} between {{the leaders of the}} two countries in 27 years, criticized Bush for the <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> and Iraq, detainee abuse in U.S.-run facilities at Cuba's Guantanamo Bay Naval Base detention center and Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, and his support of Israel.|$|R

50|$|Ann Messner in {{collaboration}} with Carole Ashley, Elaine Angelopoulos, Debra Werblud and Larilyn Sanchez created and directed the documentary, Disarming Images, produced by Artists Against the War. The documentation, covering the years 2001-2005, focused on protest groups who inventively spread their word against the U.S. <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> and Iraq.|$|R
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's first {{foreign policy}} crisis {{came with the}} 1979 Soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> She {{condemned}} the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy, and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. She gave weak support to US President Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties. The Financial Times reported that her government had secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment since 1981.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} was Salim Ahmed Hamdan, {{a citizen}} of Yemen {{who worked as a}} bodyguard and chauffeur for Osama bin Laden. Hamdan had formerly worked in Afghanistan on an agricultural project that Bin Laden had developed. Hamdan was captured by militia forces during the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> in the fall of 2001 and turned over to the United States. In 2002, he was sent by the US to its new Guantanamo Bay detention camp at its naval base in Cuba.|$|E

5|$|After the US {{strikes on}} Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Blair {{released}} a statement supporting the actions; he lent military support to America's 2001 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> In March 2003, the Labour government, fearing Saddam Hussein's alleged access to weapons of mass destruction, participated in the American-led invasion of Iraq. British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002, and again the following spring. On 15th February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated {{against the war in}} Iraq, and 60,000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party Conference, with the demonstrators' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> in December 1979 and {{threatened}} {{boycott of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup. While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament to go ahead regardless of the political situation, he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again postpone the Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott. A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) would participate in such an event.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the {{competition}} initially planned to hold in Mongolia was canceled due to soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> Because the competition was initially founded for Eastern European countries participating in the Warsaw Pact, {{under the influence of}} the Eastern Bloc, the earlier IMOs were hosted only in Eastern European countries, gradually spreading to other nations. Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000 Presidential election, nearly 80 {{percent of}} Muslim Americans {{supported}} Republican candidate George W. Bush over Democratic candidate Al Gore. However, {{due to the}} <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> and Iraq which took place under the Bush Administration, {{as well as what}} some call an increased anti-Muslim rhetoric from the Republican Party after the September 11 attacks, support for the Republican Party among American Muslims has declined sharply.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a speech}} given in April 2008, Ahmadinejad {{described}} the 11 September 2001 attacks as a [...] "suspect event." [...] He minimized the attacks by saying {{all that had}} happened was, [...] "a building collapsed." [...] He claimed that the death toll was never published, that the victims' names were never published, and that the attacks were used subsequently as pretext for the <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> and Iraq.|$|R
5|$|Vietnam relented in 1978, seeking {{economic}} aid {{to fund the}} Second Five-Year Plan. In 1978 Lê Duẩn and Phạm Văn Đồng signed a 25-year Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Cooperation with the USSR. Under Soviet protection, Vietnam invaded Kampuchea. In reaction China invaded Vietnam. Vietnam leased several bases to the Soviet Union to protect its territory from China. It was rumored that one of China's demands for peace was the ending of Soviet assistance to Vietnam. In Asia Vietnam played a role similar to Cuba's in Latin America: it supported local revolutionary groups and was a headquarters for Soviet-style communism. Vietnam supported the Soviet <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> and received $3 million a day in military aid.|$|E
5|$|Chad {{participated in}} 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott {{was because of the}} inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Chad joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> during the Soviet–Afghan War.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{participated in}} nine Summer Olympic Games between its début at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union, the former because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa, and the latter because the country joined the United States-led boycott over the 1979 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> during the Soviet–Afghan War. The highest number of athletes sent by Malawi to a summer Games is 16 to the 1972 Games and the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. No Malawian athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympics. Malawi participated in the London Summer Olympics from 27 July to 12 August 2012.|$|E
50|$|Spiked opposes all {{restrictions}} {{to immigration}} {{and freedom of}} movement, favouring entirely open international borders. It regards policies of multiculturalism as government-sanctioned cultural segregation masquerading as tolerance, which unhealthily overemphasise differences between people. Other notable positions of Spiked are {{their opposition to the}} post-9/11 <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> and Iraq and Western interference in developing nations in general. It seeks to counter what it sees as a recent trend in Western foreign policy: humanitarian intervention.|$|R

5|$|The Vietnam War saw the {{introduction}} of helicopter gunships which could be employed to support ground based forces, and the experience gained in Vietnam would spawn the creation of several aircraft {{during and after the}} war designed specifically to aid ground forces, including the AC-47 Spooky, Fairchild AC-119, Lockheed AC-130, and A-10 Thunderbolt II, all of which are operated by the Air Force, and the F/A-18 Hornet which is operated by the navy. In addition, the army and marine corps operate UH-1 Iroquois, AH-1 Cobra, and AH-64 Apache helicopters for close air support, and these helicopters can be stationed onboard amphibious assault ships to provide ship-to-shore air support for ground forces. These aircraft would later prove instrumental in aiding ground forces from the 1980s onwards, and would be involved in the 1991 Gulf War, the 2001 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E

50|$|Manifest Destiny {{was set in}} London, Palestine, Afghanistan, Washington, D.C. and Guantanamo Bay and {{featured}} a thematic backdrop of the contemporary unrest in the Middle East (including the Second Intifada) and {{the aftermath of the}} Al-Qaeda attacks (including the <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> and Iraq, and the establishment of Guantanamo Bay.) Its central plot element dealt with the plight, motivations and fate of several Palestinians drawn into the world of suicide bombing tactics, which they ultimately rejected in favour of a wounded yet hopeful peace with their neighbours. The opera also heavily satirised the geopolitical landscape.|$|R
