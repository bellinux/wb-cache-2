5000|$|A {{bonded seal}} {{consists}} of an outer annular ring of a hard material, typically steel, and an inner annular ring of an <b>elastomeric</b> <b>material</b> {{that acts as a}} gasket. It is the compression of the elastomeric part between the faces of the parts {{on either side of the}} bonded seal that provides the sealing action. The <b>elastomeric</b> <b>material,</b> typically nitrile rubber, is bonded by heat and pressure to the outer ring, which holds it in place. This structure increases resistance to bursting, increasing the pressure rating of the seal. Because the bonded seal itself acts to retain the gasket material, there is no need for the parts to be sealed to be shaped to retain the gasket. This results in simplified machining and greater ease of use as compared to some other seals, such as O-rings. Some designs come with an additional flap of rubber on the internal diameter to locate the bonded seal at the centre of the hole, these are called self-centring bonded washers ...|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of {{phonograph}} turntable drives being manufactured today: the belt-drive, idler-wheel and direct-drive systems; {{the names are}} based upon the type of coupling used between the platter of the turntable and the motor.

5000|$|... A {{mechanical}} seal {{would most likely}} be created out of an annular <b>elastomeric</b> <b>material</b> through which the nozzle must pass during refueling, preventing vapors from escaping alongside the nozzle.

Since the liquid fills the entire pipe, no emissions can escape during refueling. A liquid seal is usually used for smaller vehicles, while the {{mechanical seal}} is used for larger vehicles.|$|E

50|$|Known as the Papa pump, this utilises the low {{pressure}} generated by high velocity water flow around a curve-shaped elastomeric valve (with {{low pressure}} loss) {{to allow a}} valve design that enables rapid closure and with a relatively small cross sectional area and low weight. The venturi valve is configured as a ring section positioned around the supply inlet of the pump with the delivery outlet of the pump being directly in line. The design allowed the pump structure to be concentric and therefore inherently strong and upon closure of the valve, permits efficient water delivery by acting {{in line with the}} supply via a second smaller venturi effect delivery non return valve. The <b>elastomeric</b> <b>material</b> and operation of these valves also allows them to self-return without weight or spring assistance. A pressure vessel installed on a tee connected to the delivery port of the pump provides the pulsed flow accumulation means. This unique technology and design dramatically reduced the weight, manufacturing cost and number of components required - as well as provided an overall improvement in efficiency.|$|E
50|$|First {{examples}} of processes coming near {{to something that}} could be called ‘microthermoforming’ originate from {{the second half of the}} nineties. So, in 1993, dome shaped polymer microstructures for use in electrical membrane switches were fabricated 9. This was done between a mating upper and lower metal emboss die with a concave and a convex detail, respectively, first in a hot, then in a second cold press. And in 1999, corrugated sheet like polymer microstructures for use e.g. in electrostatic actuators were fabricated 10. This was also done between heated tools and counter tools, namely in discontinuous processes between stamps or in continuous processes between rollers. Partly, the counter tool was a soft one in the form of a thicker, unpatterned film or plate made from an easily deformable, e.g. <b>elastomeric</b> <b>material</b> which is able to assume the shape of the hard, metallic tool. In 2006, at the School of Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering (PTFE) of the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT), the same technology approach was used to fabricate similar corrugated sheet like structures in a so-called ‘rubber-assisted hot embossing process’ 11.|$|E

40|$|The FEM {{analysis}} of hyper elastic, <b>elastomeric</b> <b>materials</b> has been formulated and implemented for various material models (strain energy functions) over the years. More recently, the {{analysis of}} <b>elastomeric</b> <b>materials</b> has been attempted in the boundary element method.

These non-linear domain terms require the evaluation of the displacement derivative components directly from displacement derivative boundary integral equations.
