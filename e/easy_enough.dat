5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine {{in order to keep the}} game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} was handled {{by a team of}} seven people over the course of ten months. It was {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> for even his mother to play. While the original version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was planned to be {{released}} for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team were shown the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of Mega Man Battle Network, Takumi felt that the Game Boy Advance would be perfect for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi wanted it to be <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every sample that was needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E

60|$|The {{rest was}} an <b>easy</b> task <b>enough.</b> First the twine was drawn {{up to and}} over the beam by the thread, then the rope was drawn up by the twine, and last of all the rope ladder by the rope. There it hung like a thin, slender black line against the silent gray walls.|$|R
60|$|But the {{two older}} men had evidently no stomach for the {{situation}} as it now was. It had been <b>easy</b> matter <b>enough</b> to murder the Cæsar treacherously and while his legions were three days' march away. But now everything was very different, the issues very doubtful; no doubt that a safe retreat {{away from the city}} would be by far the wiser course.|$|R
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and {{felt that this was}} a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> {{to design}} {{reliable}} weapons for the stockpile. If the prototype worked, {{it could be}} weaponized and mass-produced.|$|E

5000|$|According to GameRankings, {{the game}} {{received}} the averaged review rating of 57.46%. PlayStation Magazine {{gave it a}} score of 6/10, calling it [...] "quite cool, really, but too <b>easy</b> and not <b>enough</b> variety." ...|$|R

That such degrees are so common, however, is not only because the work is <b>easy,</b> bad <b>enough,</b> but also because the supposed objects of study often cannot be known directly. When they can, in fact, they are obviously trivial." ...|$|R
25|$|All {{adjectives}} end in -i, {{but this}} may be dropped if it is <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun qualified.

25|$|In his 1990 {{edition of}} Animal Liberation, Peter Singer {{said that he}} no longer ate oysters and mussels, because {{although}} the creatures might not suffer, they might, it's not really known, and it's <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to avoid eating them in any case (and this aspect of seeking better alternatives is a prominent part of utilitarianism).|$|E
25|$|Someone {{has played}} a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in {{question}} {{is not one of}} her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979–80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to check out.|$|E
6000|$|His Eminence {{no doubt}} knew all this.

The game was continued in silence, Everingham's state of mind being revealed in the one bitter sigh-- ...|$|R

30|$|The {{scenarios}} are well defined, exciting and attractively built, with clear objectives, and with clear {{instructions and explanations}} given at the beginning.

25|$|Upton et al. (2002) {{responded to}} Skelton and Memon's paper {{by noting that}} the Review Group on the draft {{resource}} management bill had quite intentionally drafted section 5(2) to emphasise biophysical constraints {{to move away from}} the overly broad and unweighted list of socio-economic and environmental objectives in the Town and Country Planning Act. They concluded;In our view, the plain wording of section 5 is <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to understand without recourse to concepts like sustainable development that are not referred to, or the insistence that an anthropogenic reading of the section must necessarily involve weighing up everything against everything else.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{despite the}} German unwillingness {{to buy the}} 75mm variant, the Swedish company decided to start serial {{production}} anyway. There were many notable differences between Krupp's design and the one eventually produced by the Swedish company, but both guns shared a similar layout and a cruciform firing platform, which allowed the gun to traverse full 360 degrees and fire in all directions. The platform was lowered to the ground from two wheeled axles, {{which had to be}} removed before firing. One of major advantages of the Swedish design over the 88 eventually adopted by Germany was its simplicity: it lacked complicated fire-control mechanisms, but was <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to operate by less-well trained crews in poorer countries.|$|E
25|$|The Socialist Party, however, {{refused to}} condemn the McNamara brothers, arguing that their actions were {{justified}} {{in view of the}} supposed employer- and state-sponsored terror their union had faced for the last 25 years. Haywood and Debs echoed that sentiment. Wrote Debs:It is <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> for a gentleman of education and refinement to sit at his typewriter and point out the crimes of the workers. But let him be one of them himself, reared in hard poverty, denied education, thrown into the brute struggle for existence from childhood, oppressed, exploited, forced to strike, clubbed by the police, jailed while his family is evicted, and his wife and children are hungry, and he will hesitate {{to condemn the}}se as criminals who fight against the crimes of which they are the victims of such savage methods as have been forced upon them by their masters.|$|E
25|$|Pellets {{are fine}} for larger snails, but mash {{is better for}} younger ones. Pellets should be {{partially}} crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. <b>Easy</b> access to <b>enough</b> water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.|$|R
60|$|And {{then they}} all {{went back to the}} office, and there was the {{photographer}} waiting with all his apparatus, and astonished enough he was when he found out what the job was that he had to do. However, the task proved an <b>easy</b> one <b>enough,</b> as the light of the room was suitable, and the dark lines of cuttle ink upon Augusta's neck would, the man said, come out perfectly in the photograph. So he took two or three shots at her back and then departed, saying that he would bring a life-sized reproduction to be filed in the Registry in a couple of days.|$|R
50|$|Chartiers Creek {{was named}} after Peter Chartier, a trapper of French and Native American {{parentage}} who established a trading post {{at the mouth of}} Chartiers Creek in 1743. In 1831 the Washington & Pittsburg Railroad was chartered to build a rail link between Pittsburgh and Washington. Chartiers Creek was determined to be the <b>easiest</b> route, but <b>enough</b> financial support was not gathered. The same happened in 1837.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Royal Canadian Air Force’s {{standard}} elementary training aircraft was the de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk. Flight instruction {{was completed by}} student pilots on the DHC-1 before they progressed to the then-brand-new Canadair CT-114 Tutor jet trainer. A decision was made by RCAF HQ to remove the DHC-1s from service and not replace them, as {{it was felt that}} the CT-114 was <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to fly that initial training was not needed. The CT-114 quickly developed a wash-out rate of near 95% amongst student jet pilots and it was clear that an elementary trainer was needed. Due to the RCAF’s previous customer relationship with Beechcraft while operating that company's Expeditor twin-engine aircraft, a hasty purchase of twenty-four B23 Musketeers was made in 1971. The first CT-134 arrived at CFB Portage la Prairie on March 23, 1971.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Sebastião de São Pedro {{arrived at}} Saint Thomas in 1611, but in 1614 was {{promoted}} to the See of Cochin. In 1615 he was succeeded by Luiz de Brito e Menezes, likewise an Augustinian, who was transferred in 1628 to the See of Cochin. His successor was Luiz Paulo Paulo de Estrela, O.S.F., appointed in 1634, who died at Saint Thomas on 9 January 1637. During the next fifty-six years the see continued vacant: though no less than nine personages were selected by the Crown for the honour, they either declined, were promoted or died before their election was confirmed by the Holy See; in the interval the diocese was governed by administrators selected chiefly from the various religious orders and appointed by the archbishops or vicars capitular sede vacante of Goa. As it was only natural {{that the members of}} the religious orders as also secular priests of other nations desired to share in the work of preaching the Gospel to the heathen, in 1622 Gregory XV created the Sacred Congregation de propaganda fide to distribute infidel regions among the religious orders and missionary societies of other nationalities as assistants to the local ordinaries, where there were any, and to supervise their operations. But occasionally the Congregation was misled, which was <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> when geographical knowledge was neither as correct nor as extensive as at the present time and this occasioned trouble.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Hatfield {{considered}} the game's graphics {{average for the}} age. He [...] "loved the neon-lit towering skyscrapers of Steelport" [...] but thought the streets were sometimes [...] "lifeless", as the game may be [...] "open world" [...] but not a [...] "living world". Edge added {{that the city was}} <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to navigate, but that it was missing character. Grimm of GamesRadar said it didn't look bad, but wasn't interesting. Multiple reviewers complained of [...] "pop-in", or of graphical errors. 1UP.com reported the PC version's graphics to be more stable, and Eurogamer Digital Foundry face-off recommended the PlayStation 3 release for its lack of screen tearing.|$|E

The kind-hearted fellow made out to live abroad as well as he could for a day or two--an <b>easy</b> thing <b>enough</b> in Paris, by the way,--and when I so unexpectedly entered, Marie was actually cooking the captain's breakfast in the kitchen while he was nursing the child in the salon! ...|$|R
40|$|I {{found that}} in doing the {{exercise}} with {{a large group of}} students in many classes, the freezer space needed for cups was a little too large, so I used ice cube trays. The students had smaller glaciers but it was <b>easier</b> to freeze <b>enough</b> for numerous classes. I made a larger glacier out of large beaker. I then demonstrated to the students on other surfaces besides just the wood that they had. ...|$|R
60|$|And first, I {{found out}} {{a safe place}} for the ships to ride, and this neither in the river of Tucapel, nor in the river of Baldivia, but in an opening or inlet of water, without a name, about a league to the south of Tucapel, embayed and secured from almost all the winds that could blow. Here the ships lay <b>easy,</b> with water <b>enough,</b> having about eleven fathoms good holding ground, and about half a league from shore.|$|R
500|$|Devers sent a {{cable to}} Marshall on 1 July proposing that an army group be formed, with himself as commander. Eisenhower concurred with this on 12 July. While {{it would have}} been <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to add the Seventh Army to Bradley's 12th Army Group, this would have meant that Eisenhower would {{have to deal with the}} French, and after his {{experience}} in Operation Torch, Eisenhower preferred to let Devers do it. Marshall made the appointment on 16 July. Thus, Devers wore four [...] "hats" [...] for the operation: Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theater; Commanding General NATOUSA; Commander, Advanced Detachment AFHQ, which was activated on 29 July; and Commanding General, 6th Army Group, which Devers activated on 1 August.|$|E
500|$|The image {{analysis}} {{starts with a}} calculation of the input and output impedances (the image impedances) and the transfer function of a section in an infinite chain of identical sections. This can {{be shown to be}} equivalent to the performance of a section terminated in its image impedances.Laplante, p.341. The image method, therefore, relies on each filter section being terminated with the correct image impedance. This is <b>easy</b> <b>enough</b> to do with the internal sections of a multiple section filter, because it is only necessary to ensure that the sections facing the one in question have identical image impedances. However, the end sections are a problem. They will usually be terminated with fixed resistances that the filter cannot match perfectly except at one specific frequency. This mismatch leads to multiple reflections at the filter terminations and at the junctions between sections. [...] These reflections result in the filter response deviating quite sharply from the theoretical, especially near the cut-off frequency.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{describes}} version 1.0 {{having an}} Adventure mode {{that would be}} a regular role-playing game, with changing plots and ordering subordinates to perform various tasks. Fortress mode would have a closer relationship with the outside generated world through war, trade and diplomacy. The world being bigger; he envisions the game to have many more features like magic, a tutorial, and a better interface. According to him, a tutorial is a burden because of the additional need of updating it and interface improvement is not a major priority till then—citing numerous existing fan-made applications for improving the game's interface. He said of version 1.0, [...] "sitting down with a fresh DF world would be like sitting down to read a middling fantasy author you haven't read before, but with all the extras that being a video game provides, including the ability to write your own sequels." [...] Modern in-game technologies and 3D graphics were fan requests Adams said he would never implement, yet showing ambivalence about the latter if the task was <b>easy</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|E
30|$|It is <b>easy</b> {{to obtain}} <b>enough</b> i.i.d. samples for locally flat terrains. However, an imaging terrain in {{practice}} cannot {{be relied upon}} to be so flat that the adjacent pixels have the identical terrain height. If the local terrain slope is available in advance or can be estimated [15], the steering vector (i.e., the interferometric phase) variation due to the different terrain height from pixel-to-pixel can be compensated, which greatly enlarges {{the size of the}} sample window.|$|R
