40|$|Abstract:- Feedback can be {{generated}} by Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) systems to support and enhance learning, self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-improvement. Feedback is more effective when it is personalized to each learner’s state. So, {{there is the question}} what feedback attributes would be adapted to each learner’s state in order to provide personalized feedback. This paper presents the feedback attributes that would be adapted to the learner’s state. In CAT, feedback would {{be generated}} before and after a question, problem or task is presented to the learner. This paper proposes various pre-question and after-the-question <b>feedback</b> <b>types.</b> These <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> would be personalized to specific mind states of the learner. These include cognitive, emotional and conational <b>feedback</b> <b>types.</b> The proposed <b>feedback</b> attributes and personalized <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> would be useful for analysts, designers, developers and evaluators of CAT systems to make appropriate decisions...|$|R
40|$|Design {{teaching}} in many disciplines relies on feedback {{as a primary}} way for students and instructors to communicate. Our work focused on identifying <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> in three different design disciplines (dance choreography, industrial design, and mechanical engineering) and analyzing how those <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> encouraged students to take convergent or divergent paths with their design ideas. We then compared <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> and encouragement of convergence or divergence across the three disciplines. Our findings showed many common <b>types</b> of <b>feedback</b> used across the three disciplines, regardless of variance in context and expectations. However, the findings also revealed a high frequency of feedback suggesting convergence or not pushing in either direction. While design processes aim to identify the most promising solution {{through a series of}} convergence steps, divergence is equally critical throughout the entire process, and this work suggests a consideration of when and how to integrate feedback supporting divergence throughout design processes...|$|R
40|$|Motivation - A key {{function}} of a future self-management support system (SMSS) for renal transplant patients is to provide feedback about their health status. This study investigates patients' understanding, preference, and trust of such feedback. Research approach - Three <b>types</b> of <b>feedback</b> form, namely simplicity, empathy, and empowerment, were designed and tested with 12 non-patients. The task completeness and the participants' preference were compared. Findings - The users did trust the empowerment feedback more than other feedback. Furthermore, the <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> seemed to influence users' ability of reporting their previous days' health status. Research limitations/Implications - This research worked out three <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> and provided insight into their effectiveness and preference. However, {{the number of participants}} was small, and they were non-patients, highly educated and relatively young.

Take away message - The different way of presenting the same information might influence users' trust and understanding of their health status. Copyright 2012 ACM...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedEarly in their career, submarine officers must develop and maintain many skills {{to qualify as}} periscope operators. This critical position comprises complex tasks, requiring precise steps, accurate mental calculations, and celerity of actions and thoughts, while obeying specific rules {{to ensure the safety}} of the submarine and its crew. Currently, gaps in training exist between the professional courses a submarine officer attends over a career to learn and practice these skills. Following an instructional system design process, this thesis developed a 3 D, game-based periscope tactical training prototype. This part-task training solution can provide feedback on predetermined performance measures, either automated, real-time, or post-hoc. The second part of this thesis used the prototype environment to investigate the impact of <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> on performance. Results indicated that participants receiving real-time feedback had significantly better performance than those who received post-hoc feedback during an initial trial. Performance for both groups significantly improved for subsequent trials; by the third trial, however, significant differences were not observed for <b>feedback</b> <b>type.</b> Additionally, results of an exploratory analysis showed <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> affected performance by age, time in service, and gaming experience. Results of this thesis support the use of game-based simulation as training tools and that <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> could be tailored to individuals based on factors such as age and experience to optimize training outcomes.

30|$|Furthermore, much {{research}} has been pursued {{in the field of}} Classroom Response Systems (CRSs), for example: (Bruff 2009; Draper, Cargill, & Cutts, 2002; Kay & LeSage, 2009), which can be defined as a subset of IC platforms. Despite the fact that the CRSs are mostly not connected to the teacher’s slides, they provide wide possibilities to gather learners’ feedback. Over the years two main <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> have been established: learners can post messages to the audience and multiple choice questions answered by learners. Whereas both of these types are widely implemented into learning platforms, only a few platforms, for example: (Vetterick, Schwennigcke, Langfeld, Cap, & Sucharowski, 2014), preserve the feedback, gathered by these <b>feedback</b> <b>types,</b> for later use.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study is to shed new light on the {{inconsistent}} relationship between performance-approach (PAp) goals and feedback reactions by examining <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> as a moderator. Results of a field experiment (N = 939) using a web-based work simulation task showed that the effect of achievement-approach goals was moderated by <b>feedback</b> <b>type.</b> Relative to individuals pursuing mastery-approach goals, individuals pursuing PAp goals responded more negatively to comparative feedback but not to task-referenced feedback. In line with the hypothesized mediated moderation model, the interaction between achievement goals and <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> also indirectly affected task performance through feedback reactions. Providing employees with feedback is a key psychological principle used {{in a wide range of}} human resource and performance management instruments (e. g., developmental assessment centres, multi-source/ 360 degrees feedback, training, selection, performance appraisal, management education, computer-adaptive testing, and coaching). The current study suggests that organizations need to strike a balance between encouraging learning and encouraging performance, as too much emphasis on comparative performance (both in goal inducement and in feedback style) may be detrimental to employees' reactions and rate of performance improvement...|$|E

40|$|Feedback which induces an {{external}} focus of attention, about movement effects, {{has been found}} to promote motor performance in healthy subjects. It is unknown whether this effect transfers to retraining reach-to-grasp after stroke. This thesis first explored the attentional focus of feedback used by therapists and adopted a mixed methods paradigm. Where feedback was used it predominantly induced an internal focus of attention, about body movements. The main experimental study compared feedback which induced either an internal or external focus of attention during the motor performance of reach to grasp after stroke. A counterbalanced design was used and reaching movements were recorded using motion analysis. Support was found for adopting {{an external}} focus of attention compared with an internal focus of attention, although an interaction between <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> and order was also found. Finally, the influence of the level of arm and memory impairment on the <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> was explored.

The asymptotically regulatable region, {{the set of}} all initial conditions of the plant and the exosystem for which output regulation is possible, is characterized {{in terms of the}} null controllable region of the antistable subsystem of the plant. Continuous output regula-tion laws, of both state <b>feedback</b> <b>type</b> and error <b>feedback</b> <b>type,</b> are constructed from a given stabilizing state feedback law. It is shown that a stabilizing feedback law that achieves a larger domain of attraction leads to a feedback law that achieves output regulation on a larger subset of the asymptotically regulatable region. A feedback law that achieves global stabilization on the asymptoti-cally null controllable region leads to a feedback law that achieves output regulation on the entire asymptotically regulatable region.

40|$|The {{progress}} of technology {{has led to}} the increased adoption of energy monitors among household energy consumers. While the monitors available on the market deliver real-time energy usage feedback to the consumer, the form of this data is usually unengaging and mundane. Moreover, it fails to address consumers with different motivations and needs to save and compare energy. This master‟s thesis project presents a study that seeks to inform design guidelines for differently motivated energy consumers. The focus of the research is on comparative feedback supported by a community of energy consumers. In particular, the discussed comparative <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> are explanatory comparison, temporal self-comparison, norm comparison, one-on-one comparison and ranking, whereby the last three support exploring the potential of socialising energy-related feedback in social networking sites, such as Facebook. These <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> were integrated in EnergyWiz – a mobile application that enables users to compare with their past performance, neighbours, contacts from social networking sites and other EnergyWiz users. The application was developed through a theory-driven approach and evaluated in personal, semi-structured interviews which provided insights on how motivation-related comparative feedback should be designed. It was also employed in expert focus group discussions which resulted in defining opportunities and challenges before mobile, social energy monitors. The findings have unequivocally shown that users with different motivations to compare and to conserve energy have different preferences for comparative <b>feedback</b> <b>types</b> and design. It was established {{that one of the most}} influential factors determining design factors is the people users compare to. In addition, the research found that even simple communication strategies in Facebook, such as wall posts and groups can contribute to engagement with energy conservation practices.
