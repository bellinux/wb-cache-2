5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. On one hand, the agencies {{have been accused of}} giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies have a tendency to act conservatively, and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> <b>In</b> the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E
5|$|The next Divine film, Lust in the Dust (1985), reunited {{him with}} Tab Hunter and was Divine's first film not {{directed}} by John Waters. Set in the Wild West {{during the nineteenth}} century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a promiscuous woman {{who works as a}} singer in saloons and competes for the love of Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western Duel in the Sun, the film was a moderate critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of gay male gangster Hilly Blue <b>in</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>in</b> Mind (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the part because he wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind the stereotype of simply being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine's performance.|$|E

25|$|The {{regiment}} {{remained as}} the Hong Kong garrison until 1865, but found themselves <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> autumn 1864, with eleven of their number {{on trial for}} murder and riot following serious altercations, first with a party of Malay seaman, and then the local police. Three days of mayhem left eight men dead, including Private Landale of the regiment, and the 99th Foot were immediately sent to Kowloon and with the local Volunteers taking up picket duties on HKI. In November, the eleven were put on trial but acquitted. However, the 99th were posted out of Hong Kong, and in early February 1865, they were replaced by 9th (the East Norfolks).

25|$|After {{winning the}} toss and electing to bat North Otago {{looked to be}} <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> the first innings being 116-9 but a record {{breaking}} 10th wicket partnership of 91 between Duncan Drew and David Sewell bought some respectability to the score. North Otago all out for 207 with Duncan Drew top scoring with 102, notching up his second century at Hawke Cup level and Sewell 37 not out. Bryan Templeman took 6-56 for the home side. At {{the end of the}} first day, the game was even with Manawatu 61-3 at stumps and just after lunch during the second day North Otago had a 48 run lead when the home side was bowled out for 159. Ben Cant (3-29) and David Sewell (3-50) were the main wicket takers with three wickets each. When stumps was called at the end of the second day North Otago was in a strong position, being 138-3 with a lead of 186. the inning was completed just after lunch on the third day and North Otago had 262 on the board to set Manawatu 311 of 58 overs for an outright victory. Darren Broom scored the second century of the game, combining with Drew for an 83 run partnership for the 4th wicket. For Manawatu J Cunningham took the a five wicket bag, finishing with 5-99 of his 33 overs. Manawatu started aggressively in their innings looking to put North Otago under pressure, however with wickets constantly falling and good partnerships failing to materialize they fell short by 159 runs to retain the Hawke Cup. Once again David Sewell picked up three wickets finishing with 3-31 of 8 overs while captain Chirs Smith took 3-23 including the final wicket. North Otago victors in its fourth Hawke Cup Challenge and for the first time in the 99-year history of the cup, holders of the Hawke Cup.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from a few}} new features, Trouble in Paradise {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to its predecessor, the 2006 Viva Piñata, in gameplay: The player acts as a gardener whose land is visited by piñata creatures. The creatures are stylized like piñatas but have the qualities of animals. Creature types include ladybugs, crabs, geckos, gorillas, and vultures, among others. The player plants seeds, tends to plants, and digs ponds within the garden's boundaries. New types of piñata creatures visit and eventually come to reside in the garden when certain prerequisites are met. For instance, a piñata might be attracted to a garden with a specific plant, type of piñata, or amount of soil. The player uses an in-game encyclopedia to learn each piñata type's preferences, which grow in complexity: advanced creatures require more transformative changes to the garden or many other piñatas to eat. When multiple piñatas are satisfied, the player can [...] "romance" [...] two to make a baby piñata. The player continues to cultivate the garden and the piñata creatures to grow in experience level and unlock upgrades in garden size and gardening tools. An in-game store sells seeds, items, and upgrades. Both games are rendered in the same engine and their supporting casts are the same. The first game's online piñata gifting feature returns <b>in</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>in</b> Paradise.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics upon its release. [...] Duncan Strauss of the Los Angeles Times described the album as [...] "hit-and-miss"; while he praised the [...] "tender tunefulness" [...] of [...] "Behind the Sun", {{he felt that}} the majority of the songs [...] "wear pretty thin pretty fast, further suggesting that this is a band that's in command on stage—but <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> the studio." [...] Bill Meredith of AllMusic observed that [...] "the energy of having these four friends from Los Angeles back together jumps out of the opening anthem 'Fight Like a Brave' and the experimental 'Funky Crime' ... Slovak and Irons brought things to the Chili Peppers that no one else ever has." [...] Blaine Sayers of Consequence of Sound praised Slovak's guitar work on the album, saying that [...] "Slovak proves with these tracks that he was not just a funk guitarist, but he could rock with the best thrash metal bands of the 80s as well." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Greg Kot was less impressed, writing that the album was a minor improvement over the band's last two efforts, but felt that the group's offbeat humor detracted from the album: [...] "The California quartet brings a modicum of structure to The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, but their humor—as their famous 'party on your pussy' chorus demonstrates—wouldn't merit an audience in a high-school locker room." ...|$|E

Joseph's hopes are raised when his brother opens his eyes, and he considers expensive neurology treatment in America to try and rouse Harry from his coma. Shortly thereafter, however, Harry's condition worsens again, and Joseph and his mother allow Harry to die. Following his brother's death, Joseph returns to work to find Jac on trial for Sam's old position. This reignites their feud, and Joseph is unable to block Jac from gaining the position. His relationship with Faye develops slowly, however Joseph's suspicions are raised when she lies to him about her whereabouts on several occasions, leading to the eventual discovery that the police suspect her {{of the murder of}} her second husband, Donald. An exhumation reveals that Donald did not die of cancer, as Faye insisted, but of arsenic poisoning. Joseph remains suspicious, but supports Faye as their relationship continues to develop. When Faye has a pregnancy scare, he proposes to her, and insists that he meant it even after the discovery she is not actually pregnant. Joseph is devastated when Faye appears to have stolen £5,000 from him and left the country, but discovers she is in fact <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> South Africa. After flying out with colleague Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow), Faye reveals she has a ten-year-old son, Archie, who lives in a care home because of a genetic disease.
