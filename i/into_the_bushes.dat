5|$|Originally {{a soccer}} player, Rolle {{did not play}} {{basketball}} until he was 15, when local coach Darrel Sears saw him walking across a basketball court and saw Rolle's great height. Sears asked if {{he knew how to}} play; Rolle said no. Sears asked him to try shooting from the foul line. His first shot, according to Rolle, completely missed the backboard and fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> behind it. At the time Rolle was not interested in the game and only attended Sears' practices because free fried chicken was provided.|$|E
25|$|The feature-length {{theatrical}} documentary Killing Kasztner {{was released}} in Israel and the UK in 2009 and the United States in October 2009. The director {{of the film is}} Gaylen Ross. In the documentary, Ze'ev Eckstein states that after he fired a blank, Kasztner ran in the dark <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> by his apartment. Eckstein fired his two remaining bullets in Kasztner's direction, and then heard a shot by someone else, after which Kasztner cried out in pain.|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} the summer of 1970 with a planned shooting schedule of 60 days. Financial troubles plaguing the studio at the time forced Zanuck to shorten Sarafian's shooting schedule by 22 days. In response, the director decided not to film certain scenes rather than rush {{through the rest of the}} shoot. An average day of filming involved the actors and the crew of 19 men spending many hours traveling to the remote locations, shooting for an extended period of time and then looking for a motel to spend the night. The shoot had a few mishaps, including Newman driving a Challenger equipped with three cameras <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> in order to avoid a head-on collision when a [...] "civilian" [...] driver ignored the traffic blocks installed to ensure the safety of the crew.|$|E

2500|$|Eckstein, then 24, {{stated that}} he tried to kill Kastner to avenge his {{activities}} in conjunction with Nazi figures such as Adolf Eichmann. In a recent film Killing Kasztner by Gaylen Ross Eckstein states that he had three bullets in his gun and missed Kasztner who ran in the dark <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> by his house. Then, per Eckstein, a fourth bullet rang out by someone else who is unnamed and Kasztner cried out, because he was hit. During the trial it turned out that Eckstein had been a paid informer of Shin Bet a few months before the shooting. The idea that the killing was a government conspiracy has been described by Elliott Jager as [...] "absolute nonsense", because the head of the intelligence service was a close personal friend of Kastner. There are others who feel otherwise. At that time Kasztner, a high ranking government official, became a liability to the government and the trial led to collapse of the cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|It {{appeared}} that Gardner got his [...] "break" [...] {{when he was}} accepted into a training program at E.F. Hutton. He subsequently quit his sales job {{so that he could}} dedicate his time exclusively to training as a stockbroker. Then he appeared at the office ready to work, only to discover that his hiring manager had been fired the week before. To make matters worse, Gardner's relationship with Jackie was falling apart. According to Gardner, the police witnessed an incident in which Jackie was running away with Chris Jr. and Gardner attempted to take the child back, but in the process swung Jackie into the garden bushes, which resulted in her being scratched. Gardner was apprehended initially for this incident, but an identity check on his car license plate led them to detain him for non-payment of parking fines. He was taken to jail and a judge ordered that he stay there, for ten days, as punishment for being unable to pay $1,200 in parking tickets. Jackie then took Chris Jr. away to live with her on the East Coast, but she eventually decided not to press charges over the incident in which she was thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Deatrick {{arrived at}} West Point on July 1, 1943 and began {{six weeks of}} {{military}} training known as Beast Barracks due to the verbal abuse and hazing delivered by upper classmen to toughen the cadets. Cadets were grouped according to height, and the six-foot tall Deatrick was assigned to Company C, 1st Regiment known as [...] "C1". Deatrick's interest in aviation was piqued during his freshman or [...] "plebe" [...] year when an AT-6 aircraft simulated a strafing attack on his group that was on field maneuvers sending them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> to escape. As he watched the pilot wave, Deatrick decided he would apply for flight training when the opportunity arrived. A wartime change allowed cadets in their second year (known as [...] "yearlings") to apply to become air cadets who upon graduation would receive both a commission and wings. Deatrick was accepted into the program and received basic flight training in 1945. On June 1, 1946, the air cadets received their wings from the commanding general of the Army Air Forces, Carl Spaatz. Deatrick graduated from USMA on June 4, 1946 with a merit ranking of 252 out of the 875 members of his class.|$|E
