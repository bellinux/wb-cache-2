25|$|Neither Upper Clapton nor {{the wider}} Clapton area {{have ever been}} an {{administrative}} unit and consequently their extent has never been formally determined.

25|$|The Komnenian period, <b>despite</b> <b>almost</b> {{constant}} warfare, {{is notable}} {{for the lack}} of military treatise writing, which seems to have petered out during the 11th century. So, unlike in earlier periods, there are no detailed descriptions of Byzantine tactics and military equipment.

25|$|All Polynesian {{cultures}} are strongly stratified, ranging from somewhat less to even more. Tongan culture is no exception, and <b>despite</b> <b>almost</b> {{two centuries of}} western influence, it is, together with Samoa still the most stratified culture.

Below them the working chiefs (matāpule), in fact attendants to the chiefs to which they belonged, providing services to them, like fishing, tax collection, kavamixing, undertaking and protocol keeping. Below them the ordinary people (tua). Below them, or maybe more or less on the same level, the slaves, prisoners of war (popula).|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} period that the {{economic}} position of Nyasaland's Africans was improving, their political aspirations received a set-back. Agitation by the Southern Rhodesia government led to a Royal Commission (the Bledisloe Commission) on future association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. <b>Despite</b> <b>almost</b> unanimous African opposition, its report in 1939 did not rule-out some form of future association, provided that Southern Rhodesia forms of racial discrimination were not applied north of the Zambezi. The danger of Southern Rhodesian rule made demands for African political rights more urgent, and in 1944 various local associations united into the Nyasaland African Congress. One of its first demands was to have African representation on the Legislative Council, which advised governors on local legislation. Before 1949, African interests were represented on this council by a single white missionary. In 1949, three Africans were nominated by the governor to the Legislative Council.|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{recorded}} {{a time of}} one hour, seven minutes and fifty seconds as he was first to reach the line; his time held for around {{a quarter of an}} hour, as no rider could get within twenty seconds of his time, until his team-mate Luke Durbridge, the prologue winner and incumbent under-23 world time trial champion crossed the finish line in a time of one hour, four minutes and forty-nine seconds, just over three minutes quicker than Meyer. Durbridge's time held top spot for over two hours, as the majority of the field failed to match his time for the [...] course. It was not until Wilco Kelderman of the [...] team– starting 143rd as opposed to Durbridge starting 19th– had set quicker times at each of the intermediate timing points that Durbridge's time came under threat from another rider, and Kelderman ultimately beat Durbridge's time by twelve seconds, <b>despite</b> <b>almost</b> overshooting the final corner, narrowly avoiding the barriers {{on the outside of the}} corner.

If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war." ...|$|E

As the regional champion, Porto qualified for the first edition of the new round-robin competition, winning it with 10 victories in 14 matches.

The club failed to secure a third consecutive title, and after nearly missing again a place in the Primeira Divisão in 1941–42, it would only return to a top-three finish in the 1946–47 season. In 1948, Porto defeated English champions Arsenal 3–2 in a friendly match.
