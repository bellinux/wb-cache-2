40|$|We {{construct}} a nonlinear sigma (NLσ) model description of 2 + 1 d spin systems, by coupling together antiferromagnetic spin chains via interchain exchange terms. Our mapping incorporates methods <b>developed</b> recently <b>by</b> <b>ourselves</b> and <b>by</b> Senthil and Fisher, which aim at describing competition between antiferromagnetic and valence-bond-solid orders in quantum magnets. The resulting 2 + 1 d O(4) NLσ model contains a topological θ-term whose vacuum angle θ varies continuously with δ, the bond-alternation {{strength of the}} interchain interaction. This implies that the θ-vacua structure for this NLσ model can be explored by tuning δ in a suitable 2 d spin system, which is strongly reminiscent of the situation for 1 + 1 AF spin chains with bond-alternation.

40|$|AbstractNumerical {{verification}} methods, so-called Nakao's methods, on existence or {{uniqueness of}} solutions to PDEs have been <b>developed</b> <b>by</b> Nakao {{and his group}} including the authors. They {{are based on the}} error estimation of approximate solutions which are mainly computed by FEM. It is a standard way of the error estimation of FEM to estimate the projection errors by elementwise interpolation errors. There are some constants in the error estimation, which depend on the mesh size parameters h. The explicit values of the constants are necessary in order to use Nakao's method. However, there were not so many researches for the computation of the explicit values of the constants. Then we had to <b>develop</b> the computation <b>by</b> <b>ourselves,</b> especially with guaranteed accuracy. Note that the methods of the computation depend on the dimension, the degree of bases, and the shape of the domain, etc. The present paper shows how we have developed the methods to calculate the constants and describes new results for nonconvex domains...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} client software architecture of different OPC interfaces. OPC is a standard used in industrial process automation to compile high-level software systems with low-level software systems. High-level systems are SCADA supervisory control and data acquisition systems, MES manufacturing execution systems and ERP enterprise resource planning systems. OPC client–server architecture connects them with low-level systems, for instance with PLC programmable logic controller and DCS decentralized systems. The standard of classic OPC: OPC DA and other interfaces, that are mostly implemented in addition to DA. OPC foundation, which provides for this standard, has in 2009 introduced the specification of the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Compared to the classical architecture OPC provides new functions {{with the emphasis on}} the efficiency, safety, platform independance {{as well as on the}} network and internet communications. Since internet communication support was not very useful in the classical architecture, we decided to implement and test new ones. We have built in and tested different OPC architectures in the SCADA system, which we <b>developed</b> entirely <b>by</b> <b>ourselves.</b> The application as a whole was intended to control heating and other installations in the industrial building. Testing of different OPC client–server architectures included the setting up and configuration of OPC server, the configuration of programmable logic controller, the development of clients and their inclusion in the SCADA system as well as the testing of functions, being offered by certain type of architecture...|$|R

The necessity and motivation of the learning process has been studied, discussed, and stimulated for a long time. But it has normally been directed to “normal ” children, while neglecting those with special learning needs. Meanwhile, one finds a growing number of students with special educational needs. Schools are now better equipped (computer wise) than ever before, but are not taking advantage of these equipments to better teach their students. Our aim with this research project is to motivate and teach basic programming skills for students with learning difficulties. Under this context, we compare two different approaches for reaching the proposed goal, one based on LEGO’s Robotics Invention System v 2. 0 (RIS) and another based on an application <b>developed</b> on purpose <b>by</b> <b>ourselves.</b> Keeping in mind that we’re searching for a tool that children can use, even those with learning disabilities, we need an application that is alluring and easy to use.

40|$|In {{looking more}} closely at {{immigrant}} patterns in urban settings, it appears that safety through anonymity or “invisibility” has primarily been an immediate, limited goal, existing alongside a more persistent, broader goal of safety through visibility. There exists a constant tension between hiding, and wanting to create and participate in a collective identity. (Miranne and Young, 2000) A ‘sense of place’, of spatial belonging, a collective spatial identity arises from a defensive position of trying to resist the urban politics and going against exclusionary practices in general, to create an ‘alternative open space’. (Best and Strüver, 2000) Historically, the formation of enclaves was involuntary, with ethnic ‘ghettos’ arising due to housing discrimination preventing ethnic minorities from settling {{in certain parts of}} the city. Ethnic enclaves have since harnessed the potential to contribute positively to urban regeneration with studies showing that, even in the modern contemporary metropolis, members of society still ascribe to ethnic identities, organising themselves spatially into “enclaves” within cities. “Imagining their new surroundings through the memories of their homelands was not merely a means to wrap a cloak of familiarity around a new landscape and thereby re-attain an aura of mastery over the land, but also a means to construct identities for their communities [...] . ” (Ferguson and Gupta, 1997) An architectural identity is <b>developed</b> <b>by</b> understanding <b>ourselves</b> in relation to our environment, and the political and economic processes through which environments and spaces are created inevitably limit design’s capacity to inform social change, (le Roux, 2009) and so focusing on immigrant enclave formation then becomes a way of understanding the socio-architectural interplay in current processes of urban transformation in Johannesburg’s Inner Cit...|$|R
