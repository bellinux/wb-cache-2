This paper investigates power system small-signal stability, considering <b>induction</b> <b>machines</b> as dynamic elements. Linear coefficients are proposed that are convenient for both quantitative and qualitative single machine-infinite bus studies. These coefficients are expanded into matrices in the case of multimachine systems, where the off-diagonal elements represent the interaction between machines. Modal interaction between <b>induction</b> <b>machines,</b> as well as between <b>induction</b> and synchronous <b>machines,</b> is investigated. It is shown that a large proportion of <b>induction</b> <b>machines</b> in a realistic power system significantly affects the interarea electromechanical mode and, consequently, the power system stabilizer design. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>machines</b> play {{a pivotal}} role in {{industry}} and there is a strong demand for their reliable and safe operation. They are generally reliable but eventually do wear out. Faults and failures of <b>induction</b> <b>machines</b> can lead to excessive downtimes and generate large losses in terms of maintenance and lost revenues, and this motivates the examination of on-line condition monitoring. On-line condition monitoring involves taking measurements on a machine while it is operating in order to detect faults with the aim of reducing both unexpected failures and maintenance costs. This paper surveys the current trends in on-line fault detection and diagnosis of <b>induction</b> <b>machines</b> and identifies future research areas. ...|$|R
50|$|As a summary, a doubly-fed <b>induction</b> <b>machine</b> is a wound-rotor doubly-fed {{electric}} machine and has several advantages over a conventional <b>induction</b> <b>machine</b> in wind power applications. First, as the rotor circuit {{is controlled by}} a power electronics converter, the induction generator is able to both import and export reactive power. This has important consequences for power system stability and allows the machine to support the grid during severe voltage disturbances (low voltage ride through, LVRT). Second, {{the control of the}} rotor voltages and currents enables the <b>induction</b> <b>machine</b> to remain synchronized with the grid while the wind turbine speed varies. A variable speed wind turbine utilizes the available wind resource more efficiently than a fixed speed wind turbine, especially during light wind conditions. Third, the cost of the converter is low when compared with other variable speed solutions because {{only a fraction of the}} mechanical power, typically 25-30%, is fed to the grid through the converter, the rest being fed to grid directly from the stator. The efficiency of the DFIG is very good for the same reason.|$|E

50|$|Earlier stock, {{like most}} {{electric}} trains before the 1990s, used DC motors.
