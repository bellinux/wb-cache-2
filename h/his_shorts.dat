5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match {{he was the}} subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have the audacity to then pull a comb from <b>his</b> <b>shorts</b> pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand to wipe his sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 Söderling {{made it to}} {{the round}} of 32 at Wimbledon, where he lost to Rafael Nadal in a five-set match. He caused much {{controversy}} on the court when he exchanged mocking behaviour with Nadal, tugging on <b>his</b> <b>shorts</b> in the manner Nadal is known for after growing tired of Nadal's slow play {{at the beginning of the}} 5th. Söderling did not make it to an ATP final for the first time in five years in 2007, however he turned out consistent results throughout the year. He missed the last 3 months of the main tour due to a left wrist injury. Söderling missed the Australian Open due to injury. The first tournament he entered in 2007 was the Open 13 Marseille, where he reached the quarterfinals. He then reached the final of the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament (Rotterdam), finishing runner-up to Michaël Llodra in the final, 7–6, 2–6, 6–3. The next week he reached another final at the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis, U.S. He beat top seed Andy Roddick in the tournament along the way to the final. However he lost another final in two weeks as he finished runner-up to unseeded Steve Darcis, 3–6, 6–7.|$|E
25|$|With {{the coming}} of 1933, however, Schmeling's image in America began to take a decided turn. In 1932, the Nazi Party became the most {{powerful}} political force in Germany, and its ideologies, voiced by party leader Adolf Hitler, overflowed with anti-Semitic tendencies. Major American cities such as New York had large Jewish populations, who worried over what the party could mean for people of their religion in the future. Schmeling, because he was German, was viewed {{as an extension of}} Hitler's plans for world domination. When he was slated to fight heavy-hitting contender Max Baer on 8 June 1933, he immediately became the 'bad guy' in the eyes of fans. Baer, who did not practice the Jewish religion but had a Jewish father, came into the ring wearing the Star of David on <b>his</b> <b>shorts.</b> Promoter Jack Dempsey played up this angle and suddenly the fight was viewed as Baer defending his faith against the prejudice of the Nazis, represented reluctantly by Schmeling. Thrown off of his game in part by the bad publicity but also because of Baer's wild, brawling style and frequent fouls (including backhand punches and rabbit punches), Schmeling was thrashed after ten rounds before nearly 60,000 onlookers at Yankee Stadium. While the German took a battering against the ropes in the tenth, the referee leapt in to stop the fight. The fight, combined with a follow-up loss to contender Steve Hamas early the next year, left many wondering if Schmeling was still a world top-class fighter.|$|E

500|$|Another crash {{followed}} {{before the}} climb; this crash {{was caused by}} riders' bunching together on a road made narrower by parked cars on either side.

Gilbert got up slowly, with <b>his</b> <b>shorts</b> and jersey ripped. He abandoned shortly afterwards. The next significant crash came with [...] remaining.

500|$|Early in {{the second}} half a third disputed try was scored by the English. The try and its {{aftermath}} caused controversy and a rift between the Natives and the RFU. Ellison attempted to tackle the English player Stoddart, and in the process ripped <b>his</b> <b>shorts</b> off. The Natives quickly formed a circle around Stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen. While this was happening one of the English players, Frank Evershed, picked up the ball and scored a try. The New Zealanders protested, believing that play had stopped after claiming Stoddart had called [...] "dead ball"– but Hill awarded the try, prompting three of the Native players, Dick Taiaroa, Williams, and Sherry Wynyard, to leave the field in protest. The aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return, but not before Hill had restarted play. Ellison was very critical of Hill, particularly because he was also Secretary of the RFU. Ellison wrote after the tour that [...] "gross as these errors were, they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed {{at the outset of the}} game, viz, refereeing at all in that game". The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English, who ultimately won 7–0.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} notable events of the Natives' tour {{occurred}} during the match against England at Blackheath. Owing to a dispute over {{the formation of the}} International Rugby Football Board, England had not played an international in nearly two years. This contributed to at least twelve of their team lacking international experience—however many of their players were from strong club and county sides. The match was notable for a dispute between the New Zealanders and the match referee—Rowland Hill. Early in the second half Ellison attempted to tackle the English player Andrew Stoddart, and in the process managed to rip <b>his</b> <b>shorts</b> off. The Natives' players promptly formed a circle around Stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing without being exposed to the gazes of the crowd. While this was happening one of the English players, Frank Evershed, picked up the ball and scored a try. The New Zealanders protested, believing that play had stopped after claiming Stoddart had called [...] "dead ball". Hill awarded the try however, causing several of the Native players to leave the field in protest. The aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return, but not before Hill had restarted play. Ellison was very critical of Hill; particularly because Hill was also Secretary of England's Rugby Football Union.

When asked whether Geale deserved to sport the Aboriginal flag on his trunks, Mundine responded: [...] "No." [...] Mundine later apologised to Tasmanian Aborigines, adding that he felt many people claimed indigenous heritage {{in order to receive}} government benefits but had no real connection with their Aboriginal roots. He also claimed that Australia was one of [...] "the most racist nations in the world" [...] before calling for the Australian anthem and Australian flag to be changed to be more inclusive of indigenous Australians.|$|E
2500|$|One {{recurring}} {{theme in the}} strip is Charlie Brown's neighborhood baseball team. Charlie Brown is the player-manager of the team and, usually, its pitcher, and Schroeder is the catcher. The other characters of the strip comprise {{the rest of the}} team, including Linus playing as second baseman and Lucy as right fielder. Charlie Brown is a terrible pitcher, often giving up tremendous hits which either knock him off the mound or undresses him, leaving only <b>his</b> <b>shorts</b> on. The team itself is also poor, with only Snoopy, at shortstop, being particularly competent. Because of this, the team consistently loses. However, while the team {{is often referred to as}} [...] "win-less," [...] it does win several games over the course of the strip's run, most of these when Charlie Brown is not playing, a fact that Charlie Brown finds highly dispiriting.|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, {{animation}} pioneer Bill Nolan {{decided to}} bring Krazy to the screen again. [...] Nolan intended to produce the series under Associated Animators, but when it dissolved, he sought distribution from Margaret J. Winkler. Unlike earlier adaptations, Nolan did not base <b>his</b> <b>shorts</b> on the characters and setting of the Herriman comic strip. Instead, the feline in Nolan's cartoons was a male cat whose design and personality both reflected Felix the Cat. [...] This is {{probably due to the}} fact that Nolan himself was a former employee of the Pat Sullivan studio. Other Herriman characters appeared in the Nolan cartoons at first, though similarly altered: Kwakk Wakk was at times Krazy's paramour, with Ignatz often the bully trying to break up the romance. Over time, Nolan's influence waned and new directors, Ben Harrison and Manny Gould, took over the series. By late 1927, they were solely in charge.|$|E
