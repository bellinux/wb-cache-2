It {{achieved}} {{agreement on a}} contentious cereal price accord as well as making a positive impression upon third countries when it made its international debut at the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round</b> of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. Hallstein notably began the consolidation of European law and started to have a notable impact on national legislation. Little heed was taken of his administration at first but, {{with help from the}} European Court of Justice, his Commission stamped its authority solidly enough to allow future Commissions to be taken more seriously. However, in 1965 accumulating differences between the French government of Charles de Gaulle and the other member states (over British entry, direct elections to Parliament, the Fouchet Plan and the budget) triggered the [...] "empty chair" [...] crisis ostensibly over proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy. Although the institutional crisis was solved the following year, it cost Etienne Hirsch his presidency of Euratom and later Walter Hallstein the EEC presidency despite otherwise being viewed as the most 'dynamic' leader until Jacques Delors.|$|E
2500|$|The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 {{authorized}} the President to negotiate tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis {{of up to}} 50 percent with the European Common Market. It provided legislative authority for U.S. participation in multilateral trade negotiations from 1964 to 1967, which {{became known as the}} <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round.</b> The authority expired June 30, 1967, predetermining the concluding date of the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round.</b> U.S. duties below five percent ad valorem, duties on certain agricultural commodities, and duties on tropical products exported by developing countries could be reduced to zero under the act. The 1962 legislation explicitly eliminated the [...] "Peril Point" [...] provision that had limited U.S. negotiating positions in earlier General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rounds, and instead called on the Tariff Commission and other agencies of the U.S. government to provide the president and his negotiators with information regarding the probable economic effects of specific tariff concessions.|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then, the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round</b> in the mid-sixties {{brought about a}} GATT anti-dumping Agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies {{was the first major}} attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on non-tariff barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called [...] "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two. Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to create some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty regime on a provisional basis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} tariff phase-outs in multilateral and preferential agreements. The paper {{finds that}} early GATT rounds primarily were over bindings of existing rates {{and that it}} was not until the 1962 - 67 <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round's</b> 50 % reduction in manufactured goods tariffs that time paths of tariff reductions became a substantive part of GATT agreements. Existing empirical work has demonstrated that U. S. industries with high initial tariffs tended to receive long periods for tariff adjustment or tended to be exempted from agreed reductions in both the <b>Kennedy</b> and Tokyo <b>Rounds.</b> This paper demonstrates that high U. S. tariffs and little intra-industry trade are associated with long NAFTA phase-out periods for U. S. imports from Mexico. Mexico's phase-outs are correlated, on the other hand, with those of the United States but not generally with Mexico's tariffs. ...|$|R

40|$|While the EU is a {{customs union}} in {{merchandise}} trade (goods), {{it has not}} yet reached this stage of integration in service trade. Trade policies between individual Member States and non-Member States vary in services. Given the remaining national sovereignties in regulating service trade against other EU Member States also, the EU is not yet even a free trade area. How far the EU is from a customs union in service trade is very difficult to assess because of the non-quantitative nature of trade restrictions in this sector. This article gives a first hint of the distance from a customs union by calculating frequency indices of trade measures by refining the 1995 Hoekman index. The database is the EU's first offer in service trade in the WTO Doha round in February 2003. It emerges that the deviation from a customs union is not substantial, but still exists because of differences in national policies against non-Member States which are particularly relevant in the mode of supply via labour flows. "Inter alia", policy measures comprise economic needs tests, residence and nationality criteria. The article concludes that there is reason to assume that, {{in the course of the}} Doha round negotiations, some if not most of the national measures will be given up. Therefore, multilateral trade negotiations will be instrumental in bringing the EU to a complete customs union as happened in goods trade between 1958 and 1968 when the Dillon and <b>Kennedy</b> <b>rounds</b> helped to complete the customs union in industrial goods.

40|$|This article reassesses the preparatory {{negotiations}} which {{launched the}} <b>Kennedy</b> Trade <b>Round</b> (KTR) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), {{in search of}} a role for Britain. My purpose is to make two challenges, one theoretical, the other empirical. Theoretically, this study questions the predominant focus on the structural power of major states that characterizes the study of international relations in general, and of the GATT in particular. This is a case-study of middle power influence that focuses on the negotiating skills and experience of state-level actors at the KTR. Empirically, I question the generally accepted view that the Anglo-American special relationship was merely a British myth and had no significance to US foreign policy interests in the 1960...|$|R
50|$|Another {{outcome of}} the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round</b> was the {{adoption}} of an Anti-dumping Code, which gave more precise guidance on the implementation of Article VI of the GATT.

50|$|The <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round</b> was {{the sixth}} session of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) {{multilateral}} trade negotiations held between 1964 and 1967 in Geneva, Switzerland. Congressional passage of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act in 1962 authorized the White House to conduct mutual tariff negotiations, ultimately leading to the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round.</b> Participation greatly increased over previous rounds. Sixty-six nations, representing 80% of world trade, attended the official opening on May 4, 1964, at the Palais des Nations. Despite several disagreements over details, the director general announced the round’s success on May 15, 1967, and the final agreement was signed on June 30, 1967—the very last day permitted under the Trade Expansion Act. The round was named after U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated {{six months before the}} opening negotiations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round</b> {{is a name}} of {{the fourth}} round of GATT talks.

50|$|Kennedy faced Yoel Romero on September 27, 2014, at UFC 178. He {{lost the}} fight via TKO {{in the third}} <b>round.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> nearly {{finished}} Romero {{in the final seconds}} of the second round but Romero was saved by the bell. Yoel Romero, his cornermen, the referee and the UFC cutman have all been criticized for their actions resulting in a 28-second delay after the scheduled start for the third round. Romero later responded to the controversy, stating that Tim Kennedy illegally held his glove during the attack which prevented Romero from being able to block the punches that rocked him. Despite the loss, Kennedy earned a Fight of the Night bonus award.|$|R

At {{the end of each}} round, the team with the lowest total is eliminated and must go to the [...] "Trust Box" [...] to determine the fate of their money. If there is a tie for low score, the team that took more time overall to lock in their answers for that round is eliminated.|$|R

50|$|To an extent, {{this view}} was shared in Europe, {{but the process}} of European {{unification}} created its own stresses under which the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Round</b> at times became a secondary focus for the EEC.

40|$|How has {{the degree}} of {{institutional}} integration in Europe affected the bargaining strength of the European Community (EC) in international negotiations? In other words, does unity bring strength? This paper explores how internal divisions in the EC have impacted the process and outcomes of the <b>Kennedy</b> and Uruguay <b>Rounds</b> of GATT negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization between the European Community and the United States. Contrary to {{the conventional wisdom that}} degree of integration and external bargaining strength are positively correlated, this paper determines the conditions under which regional integration can be used as an asset or a liability in international negotiations. It argues that the EC external bargaining strength depends on the voting rules and practices at the EC level, the amount of flexibility granted to EC negotiators, and the nature of demands in external negotiations. Comparison of the US-EC negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization in the <b>Kennedy</b> and Uruguay <b>Rounds</b> suggests, indeed, that the intensification of integration in Europe has not been accompanied by a similar intensification of the EC bargaining strength vis-à-vis the US. The negotiating processes in the two rounds are examined in detail and it is concluded that it is when acting divided and unable institutionally to negotiate that the EC obtained its most favorable results. The EC bargaining position was enhanced in the earlier years because partially coordinated positions of the EC within a weak supranational polity rendered credible the threat that it would be unable to offer concessions. In a second phase of the intergration process, by contrast, the institutional constraints are fading and internal concessions made for perserving the solidarity of the integrated entity no longer seem necessary. As a result, its negotiating positions are less prone to capture by a radical country and the negotiators for the union may find themselves in a lower bargaining position than in the first period. Policy implications of these findings are examined in the conclusion...|$|R
60|$|It was {{probably}} the suddenness and unexpectedness of it that took Walton aback. Up till now his antagonist had been fighting strictly on the defensive, and was obviously desirous of escaping punishment as far as might be possible. And then the fall {{at the end of}} round one had shaken him up, so that he could hardly fight at all at their second meeting. Walton naturally expected that it would be left to him to do the leading in round three. Instead of this, however, <b>Kennedy</b> opened the <b>round</b> with such a lightning attack that Walton was all abroad in a moment. In his most scientific mood he had never had the remotest notion of how to guard. He was aggressive and nothing else. Attacked by a quick hitter, he was useless. Three times Kennedy got through his guard with his left. The third hit staggered him. Before he could recover, Kennedy had got his right in, and down went Walton in a heap.|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{throughout}} the 1970 's and 80 's protectionist external-trade policies have proliferated {{in both the}} advanced and developing worlds. This new protectionism {{has been attributed to}} a variety of causes: the world recession, intensified by the two oil crises of 1973 and 1979; to the emergence of new economic powers, mainly Japan and other Asian countries; to technological change; and to the introduction of a floating exchange rate regime. More accurately it should be described as renewed protectionism. During the period 1950 to 1970 the most obvious symptoms of protectionism subsided, but by no means disappeared, and {{the last decade or so}} has seen a reversal of this trend. Nonetheless, the tariff reductions painfully negotiated under the aegis of the <b>Kennedy</b> and Tokyo <b>Rounds</b> have been retained, so resort to non-tariff barriers has been greater. In particular new devices have been introduced and foremost amongst them have been voluntary exportrestraint agreements (VER's). In this review I intend to look at the nature of the VER arrangements, the economic effects that appear to accompany their introduction and outline the political economy elements that explain their proliferation...|$|R
