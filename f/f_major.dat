5|$|The Adagio is in sonata {{form and}} {{presents}} a single theme. While the exposition modulates to a re-statement {{of the theme}} in <b>F</b> <b>major,</b> the recapitulation modulates to D major. The movement ends in that key, pianissimo, with a segue (an explicit direction given by Haydn to avoid too long a pause between the movements) to the D-major minuet.|$|E
5|$|The chord pattern differs little {{throughout}} the song. On guitar, {{it consists of}} the chords (played with a capo at the fifth fret) of B minor 7, F minor, A minor 7, F, C, E sus. 7 and E7. A variation from this sequence occurs during the repeated last line of each second verse, {{with the addition of}} the chords D7/F and <b>F</b> <b>major</b> 7.|$|E

5|$|The first {{movement}} is {{longer and more}} complex than any that Mozart had previously composed in the concerto genre. It is in 3/4 time; among Mozart's piano concertos, No. 11 in <b>F</b> <b>major</b> and No. 14 in E-flat major are the only others to commence in triple metre.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the piece is unusually symmetric. It opens and closes with a duet including a chorale text. Harmonically, the piece begins and ends in C major, and the central movement is in D minor. The second movement modulates from A minor to <b>F</b> <b>major,</b> while the fourth movement mirrors this motion.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's qualities as {{a pianist}} and {{composer}} were recognized {{by many of}} his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in <b>F</b> <b>major</b> to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.|$|E

5|$|The minuet is in <b>F</b> <b>major,</b> {{but it is}} {{not until}} well into its second half that a strong chord in the tonic arrives. Once again among the Opus 50 minuets, Haydn is unsettling {{harmonic}} conventions. Haydn also toys with metre {{towards the end of the}} minuet: it moves into, and concludes, essentially in duple time. The trio follows, and its theme almost identical to that of the minuet, albeit in a minor key and played by all four parts in unison.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} national anthem was in the key of G major, but in 1983, schools were issued an educational tape describing common mistakes made in singing the anthem and given the option of singing the anthem in <b>F</b> <b>major.</b> (It was the very version that was first demonstrated to the public during the 1986 Singapore National Day Parade.)

5|$|Fauré's major sets of piano {{works are}} {{thirteen}} nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed across {{the decades of}} his career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, {{by way of a}} turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in <b>F</b> <b>major,</b> Mazurka in B major, Thème et variations in C major, and Huit pièces brèves. For piano duet, Fauré composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.|$|E

5|$|Now {{beginning}} to compose independently, Rachmaninoff's next project {{was a group}} he titled Three Nocturnes, and is regarded as his first serious attempt at writing for the piano. The first nocturne, in F-sharp minor, was written 14-21 November 1887, and has three parts: a beginning and an end in andante cantabile and a central section in allegro. The slower andantes are gentle sections, influenced by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, while the allegro is unnatural and stiff and unusually fast for a nocturne. The second piece, in <b>F</b> <b>major,</b> followed on 22-25 November, also contains a slower portion coupled with a quick section. No. 3, in C minor, {{took more than a}} month to compose, dated from 3 December 1886 to 12 January 1887. With a chordal texture spread over the entire keyboard, it is reminiscent of the music of Robert Schumann. The nocturnes were published posthumously in Moscow in 1949, but were not assigned an opus number.|$|E
5|$|I. Molto moderato. This {{movement}} {{employs a}} three-key exposition. The first theme introduces a G-flat trill that anticipates the following harmonic events – {{a shift to}} G-flat major in the central section of the main theme, and, after {{a return to the}} tonic, an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor {{at the start of the}} second theme. After a colorful harmonic excursion, the third tonal area arrives in the traditional dominant key (<b>F</b> <b>major).</b> In contrast to the previous sonatas, here the development section elaborates on several different themes from the exposition. It reaches a dramatic climax in D minor, in which the first theme is presented, fluctuating between D minor and the home key, in a manner similar to the parallel passage from the previous sonata (see above). In the recapitulation, the bass line in the first theme rises to B-flat instead of descending to F (as in the exposition), and the second theme enters in B minor, instead of F-sharp minor. The rest of the exposition is repeated without alterations, transposed a fourth up, meaning that it returns to the home key, B-flat, for the third tonal area. The coda once again recalls the first theme, although only fragmentarily.|$|E
5|$|I. Allegro. The sonata {{begins with}} a forte, heavily {{textured}} chordal fanfare emphasizing a low A pedal and duple-meter stepwise diatonic ascent in thirds in the middle voices, followed immediately by quiet descending triplet arpeggios punctuated by light chords outlining a chromatic ascent. These highly contrasting phrases provide the motivic material {{for much of the}} sonata. The second theme is a lyrical melody written in four-part harmony. The exposition follows standard classical practice by modulating from tonic (A) to dominant (E) for the second theme, even preparing the latter tonality with its own V – the only first movement {{to do so in the}} mature Schubert. Despite this traditional approach, both exposition themes are built in an innovative ternary form, and in each resulting 'B' section a highly chromatic development-like section based on the exposition's second phrase modulates through the circle of fourths, only to return to the tonic. This novel structure creates a sense of harmonic movement without actually committing to a thematic modulation, and is one of the techniques Schubert uses to achieve a sense of scale in the movement. The development proper is based on a scalar variation of the second theme heard at the end of the exposition. Here, in contrast to the striking modulatory excursions nested in the exposition, the tonal plan is static, shifting constantly between C major and B major (later B minor). After the development theme is finally stated in the tonic minor, the dramatic retransition has the unconventional role of only shifting to the major mode to prepare the recapitulation, rather than fully preparing the tonic key (which in this case has already been established). The recapitulation is traditional – staying in the tonic, and emphasizing the tonic minor and the flat submediant (<b>F</b> <b>major)</b> as subdominant tonalities. The coda restates the first theme, this time in a much more 'hesitant' manner, pianissimo and with further allusions to subdominant tonalities. The movement ends with serene arpeggios; however, for the penultimate chord, Schubert chose a striking Italian sixth on II, instead of the more usual dominant or diminished seventh chords. This choice is not arbitrary – it is a final statement of the chromatically-based ascending minor second motive that pervaded the movement, a motive that will be reversed into a descending minor second in the following movement.|$|E

5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to <b>F</b> <b>major</b> as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E
