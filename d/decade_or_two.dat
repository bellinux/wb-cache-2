40|$|Urban {{areas of}} the central {{activities}} with mixed land use are crucial {{for the development of}} city center, even in small cities. In the last <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> the attention is drawn on the retail and service activities that are usually located outside of cities near main roads. Municipalities had already detected this problem, but they are not implementing any of the measures (Rebernik, 2010). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate that the central activities in small cities in Slovenia are located in freestanding buildings, which is most appropriate in terms of forming the open public space in the city center. In this research we compared ten central activities (Vrišer, 1988, 1990, Kokole, 1971) in 34 small cities. We selected only those small cities (Prosen et al, 2008) which have among other activities a county court. The results showed the differences and commonalities of the central activities in selected small cities according to the indicators. Litija, Domžale and Sevnica are small cities, where activities that could articulate open public space are located in the larger building complexes. The phenomenon is similar to a modern machine, where action in it and indirectly the insight into the functioning of the society is invisible to the observer (Kos, 2008). We found out that in these tree cities the central activities are not forming the open public spaces in front of the public buildings (Vertelj Nared, 2014). The result is problematic image of the city and changed forces of the city life. ...|$|R

To evaluate these competing explanations critically, the authors report on a 2012 UK survey of 595 small business owners. Twenty per cent of these owners {{said that they had}} traded informally when starting up their ventures, and the authors examine and evaluate their reasons for doing so. It was found that 41 % of the entrepreneurs attributed their off-the-books trading to too little state intervention (for example, a lack of government advice and support), 35 % to too much intervention (burdensome red tape, high taxes, etc) and 24 % to a mix of both factors. However, a multivariate analysis displays significant socio-demographic, firm-level and regional variations in the reasons. The outcome is a call to move towards more nuanced context-bound explanations of entrepreneurship in the informal economy...|$|R
40|$|Combinatorial {{optimisation}} problems (COP's) arise naturally when mathematically modelling many practical optimisation {{problems from}} science and engineering. Due to the NP-hard nature of many COP's, heuristics {{are often used}} to provide rapid and near-optimal solutions. Neural networks are a novel and potentially powerful alternative approach to solving such problems. They are also intrinsically parallel, with much potential for rapid hardware implementation. Unfortunately, existing neural techniques are widely considered to be unsuited to optimisation due to their tendency to produce infeasible or poor quality solutions. Over the last <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so, <b>two</b> main types of neural networks have been proposed for solving COP's- in particular, the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The first of these neural approaches is the Hopfield neural network which evolves in such away asto minimise a system energy function.

25|$|Advanced economies {{account for}} the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most {{important}} region in 2010, followed by North America $1.409 trillion and Asia $1.161 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in premium income during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the world's population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace. The country expected to have the biggest impact on the insurance share distribution across the world is China. According to Sam Radwan of ENHANCE International LLC, low premium penetration (insurance premium as a % of GDP), an ageing population and the largest car market in terms of new sales, premium growth has averaged 15–20% in the past five years, and China {{is expected to be the}} largest insurance market in the next <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E

500|$|The eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii) is {{a species}} of vesper bat. It {{can be found in}} Ontario and Quebec in Canada and in the Eastern United States. It is among the {{smallest}} bats in eastern North America and is known for its small feet and black face-mask. Until recently all North American small-footed Myotis were considered to be [...] "Myotis leibii". The western population is now considered to be a separate species, Myotis ciliolabrum. The Eastern small footed bat is rare throughout its range, although the species may be locally abundant where suitable habitat exists. Studies suggest white-nose syndrome has caused declines in their populations. However, most occurrences of this species have only been counted within the past <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> and are not revisited regularly, making their population status difficult to assess. Additionally, bat populations in the Eastern U.S. have typically been monitored using surveys conducted in caves and mines in the winter, but small-footed bats hibernate in places that make them unlikely to be encountered during these surveys. As a result, numbers of small-footed bats counted in winter tend to be low and relatively variable compared to other species of bats. Many biologists believe the species is stable, having declined little in recent times, but that it is vulnerable, especially in its cave hibernacula.|$|E

50|$|Taiwanese men who marry {{women from}} Southeast Asia are {{typically}} {{drawn from a}} less educated and disadvantaged population. While Taiwanese husbands {{tend to have more}} education than their Vietnamese brides, they still fall below the average levels of education in Taiwan. Many times a man can be more than a <b>decade,</b> <b>or</b> possibly <b>two</b> to three decades, older than his migrant bride. Seventy percent of Vietnamese brides are under 23 years of age, while over eighty percent of their Taiwanese grooms are aged over 30. All of these factors (lack of education, disadvantage, and advanced age) typically contribute to trouble in finding a bride locally and thus increase the desire to enter a migrant marriage. For many Taiwanese men, migrant marriages can seem like an easy solution to their household troubles, as a wife can act as a reproductive unit, a housekeeper, and a nurse to his parents. In one study, the percentage of women who reported “housework” as their primary occupation rose from 16.7% while located in Vietnam to 52.4% after being relocated to Taiwan. As can be seen in a woman’s primary motivation for marriage (“To help the family”), the Vietnamese have strong familial ties and practice high subservience to a patriarchal structure. This trait is highly prized by some Taiwanese men who feel that Taiwanese women are beginning to wrest away from the constraints of a patriarchal society.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{synthesis}} and {{properties of}} new silicone-based functional materials having attached cyclam macrocycles have been assessed {{with regard to}} their application as ion-sensitive membranes of chemical sensors. The preparation process of thin films of the sensitive materials has been designed so that each chemical compound is attached by means of chemical bonds: the macrocyclic ionophore was chemically bound to the silicone polymer and the polymer material was attached to the sensitive surface of the electrochemical devices by means of chemical grafting. The properties of such materials have been evaluated for detection of iron(III) species in water using ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) and electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) structures, both sensitized by a coating with the functional polymer materials. Two types of cyclam derivatives and two types of synthesis processes have been compared with that respect. The first material, "PDMS-Cyclam", was prepared by grafting N- 10 undecenyl-cyclam to poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS). The cyclam ionophore of the second material, "PDMS-Naphthyl-Cyclam", bore a naphthyl pendent group that enhanced the complexing properties for Fe 3 + ions. Linear response with respect to the pFe(III) = -Log[Fe 3 +] was observed over three <b>decades</b> (EIS) <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> (ISFET) of concentration.
