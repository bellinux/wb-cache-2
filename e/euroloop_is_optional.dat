50|$|The <b>Euroloop</b> <b>is</b> an {{extension}} for Eurobalises in ETCS Level 1. It {{is a special}} Leaky feeder for transmitting information telegrams to the car.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Euroloop</b> {{frequency}} <b>was</b> {{moved to}} a centre of 13.54750 MHz (exactly half of the Eurobalise power frequency).|$|R
50|$|Germany {{intends to}} use Level 1 only as Limited Supervision - neither Full Supervision nor <b>Euroloops</b> will <b>be</b> installed.|$|R
50|$|Level 1 is a cab {{signalling}} {{system that can}} be superimposed on the existing {{signalling system}}, leaving the fixed signalling system (national signalling and track-release system) in place. Eurobalise radio beacons pick up signal aspects from the trackside signals via signal adapters and telegram coders (Lineside Electronics Unit - LEU) and transmit them to the vehicle as a movement authority together with route data at fixed points. The on-board computer continuously monitors and calculates the maximum speed and the braking curve from these data. Because of the spot transmission of data, the train must travel over the Eurobalise beacon to obtain the next movement authority. In order for a stopped train {{to be able to}} move (when the train is not stopped exactly over a balise), there are optical signals that show permission to proceed. With the installation of additional Eurobalises ("infill balises") or a EuroLoop between the distant signal and main signal, the new proceed aspect is transmitted continuously. The <b>EuroLoop</b> <b>is</b> an extension of the Eurobalise over a particular distance that basically allows data to be transmitted continuously to the vehicle over cables emitting electromagnetic waves. A radio version of the <b>EuroLoop</b> <b>is</b> also possible.|$|R
50|$|A balise transmits telegrams at a {{specific}} site. To allow a continuous transmission the telegrams may be sent along leaky feeder cable being up to 1000 metres long. The <b>Euroloop</b> cable <b>is</b> always connected with a balise at its end which serves as the End of Loop Marker (EOLM). The telegram structure {{is the same as}} for the balise it is connected to. Originally the Euroloop used the same frequency as the Eurobalises but that was changed for specification 2.0.1 in September 2004. <b>Euroloops</b> had <b>been</b> used in Switzerland which completed the change in July 2010.|$|R
