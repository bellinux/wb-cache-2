40|$|The article {{describes}} characteristics and trends of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed {{capital of the}} Northern regions. It singles out phases of rapid pre-crisis growth, crisis, post-crisis growth and stagnation. Stagnation and decline in recent years are caused by completed major investment projects, reduced own funds of enterprises, limited availability of investment resources and increased capital outflow. The article reveals that the growth of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed capital of the North in the post-crisis period {{is provided by the}} regions, carrying out major <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> oil and gas pipeline transport, oil extraction, production and distribution of electricity, gas and water. The changes in the sectoral structure of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed capital of the Northern regions are barely visible; the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the traded sector is still high, especially in mining, due to the Northern regions’ specialization in the extractive industries. The share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the public sector and social services remains low. The specific structure of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed capital has changed: the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> buildings (excluding housing) and structures has increased greatly; the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> machinery, equipment, vehicles has decreased due to insufficient <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> mining enterprises and financial shortages in manufacturing. In most regions the structure of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed capital by directions is characterized by the increase in the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> machinery, equipment, vehicles <b>in</b> new construction, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> buildings and structures and the decline in the proportion of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> machinery, equipment, vehicles modernization and reconstruction and acquisition of new fixed assets.
