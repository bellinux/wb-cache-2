Interest expense stood at around NT$1.3billion per month in April 2008, when THSRC first achieved break-even cash flow, with revenue and cash expenses (which exclude depreciation) both around NT$2.1billion. Interest rates fell in the first half of 2009, reducing interest expenses and contributing to a reduced net loss.|$|E

The investment has an annual <b>interest</b> <b>cost</b> of 6% earning Berkshire $300 {{million in annual}} interest. Alongside the preferred stock investment, Berkshire obtained warrants allowing Berkshire to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 per share any time before September 2, 2021. Based on the share price in June 2017, this position has yielded a profit of more than $10 billion excluding the annual interest earned from the preferred stock.|$|E
25|$|CBO {{reported}} that net {{interest on the}} public debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates. During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $432 billion. GAO {{reported that}} even though the national debt rose in FY2012, the interest rate paid declined. Should interest rates rise to historical averages, the <b>interest</b> <b>cost</b> would increase dramatically.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} efficiency of the UK debt management authorities' (DMA) behaviour from a cost minimisation perspective over the period January 1985 to March 1995. During this period, the maturity structure of the government's bond portfolio was subject to frequent fine-tuning, aimed principally at lowering <b>interest</b> <b>costs.</b> The authors examine {{the efficiency of the}} DMA's behaviour from a cost minimisation perspective. Using a bi-variate version of the recursive modelling procedure applied to forecasting stock returns by Pesaran and Timmermann (1995, 2000), it is shown that bond returns are forecastable but that the predictive power of macroeconomic variables is time-dependent. The impact of adjusting the bond portfolio in response to these forecasts is simulated. The simulated average <b>interest</b> <b>costs</b> are lower than those resulting from the DMA's actual real-time behaviour. However, a substantial reduction in <b>interest</b> <b>costs</b> requires large monthly changes in the portfolio's maturity structure.
