5|$|Early {{plans for}} the Interstate Highway System include a route along roughly the same {{alignment}} as the present I-35 through the Twin Cities area, but are not detailed <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> exactly how the cities would be served. When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955, a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally. South of the Twin Cities, I-35 followed the corridor of old US65, which had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and downtown Minneapolis. I-35E was located parallel to MN13, which cut northeast to Saint Paul from old US65 south of the Minnesota River. North of the metropolitan area, I-35 closely paralleled US61, which passed through Saint Paul; I-35W paralleled old US8 from Minneapolis northeast through New Brighton {{and then to the}} present day I-35E–I-35W split at Columbus near Forest Lake, near where old US8 had joined US61. The Minnesota Legislature defined I-35E as part of unmarked Legislative Route390, which stretched south to the Iowa state line and north to the city of Duluth along I-35.|$|E

25|$|Moore {{appealed the}} COJ's ruling to the Supreme Court of Alabama on December 10, 2003. A special panel of retired judges and justices was {{randomly}} selected {{to hear the}} case. Moore argued that the COJ did not consider the underlying legality of the federal courts' order that the monument {{be removed from the}} courthouse. The Alabama Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying that the COJ did not have the authority to overrule the federal courts, only to determine whether Moore violated the Canons of Judicial Ethics. Therefore, the Court reasoned, it was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that a procedurally-valid order was in place against Moore. Moore also argued that the COJ had imposed a religious test on him to hold his office, and that the COJ's actions had violated his own rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

25|$|The Court's assumptions, some say, {{have made}} the Mackay Radio ruling {{theoretically}} unsupportable {{as a matter of}} equity. Because the Court assumed that employers must hire permanent replacements as a matter of business necessity, the Court did not find it necessary to require the employer to show the need for permanent replacements. This places the burden on either the Board or unions to prove that the employer had an anti-union animus. But the Supreme Court subsequently held that replacement workers cannot be presumed to be anti-union, so their use is not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> animus. Indeed, courts have been reluctant to find support for anti-union animus in any except the most extreme cases. As legal scholars point out, under Mackay Radio, employers can now cloak anti-union animus under the guise of using permanent replacements. They note that it is becoming increasingly common for employers to deunionize using permanent replacements, and nearly impossible for unions to obtain legal redress. This has held to a radical shift in American labor policy which Congress did not intend.|$|E
25|$|David {{soon found}} himself active and {{personally}} {{present in the}} north of Scotland because of the death of his cousin William fitz Duncan. William died sometime between 1147 and 1151, putting the huge lordship of Moray back into David's hands. David was in the north in the year 1150, founding Kinloss Abbey, {{while at the same time}} establishing new and reinforcing old castles which formed a line running from Banff on the borders of the mormaerdom of Buchan to Inverness. At about this time, or perhaps in the following year, David visited Aberdeen. This visit is recorded in the notitiae on the margins of the Book of Deer. All of the witnesses, mormaers, bishops and lower-ranking landlords, were Gaels with interests {{in the north of}} Scotland. The charter in question was a grant to the old monastery of Deer of exemption from all kinds of lay exactions. Later in the year, a charter issued at Dunfermline in favour of the new abbey church there records the presence at David's court of the most notable Gaelic magnates and church officials of the north, namely Gartnait, mormaer of Buchan, Morggán, mormaer of Mar, Aindréas, bishop of Caithness, Symeon, bishop of Ross and Edward, bishop of Aberdeen. These activities and pieces of charter evidence are <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that consolidation of royal authority there was David's biggest priority in the first years of the 1150s.|$|E
500|$|According to Wild, the {{expedition}} ended [...] "quietly", although his biographer Leif Mills writes of enthusiastic crowds in Plymouth Sound. At {{the end of}} his account, Wild expressed the hope that the information they had brought back might [...] "prove of value in helping to solve the great natural problems that still beset us". These results were summarised in five brief appendices to Wild's book. The summaries reflected the efforts of the scientific staff to collect data and specimens at each port of call, and the geological and survey work carried out by Carr and Douglas on South Georgia, before the southern voyage. Eventually a few scientific papers and articles were developed from this material, but it was, in Leif Mills's words, [...] "little <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> for a year's work".|$|E

500|$|The new {{operation}} was initially successful. In Formula One, March cars won {{three of their}} first four races. One of these was a world championship race, the 1970 Spanish Grand Prix, won by reigning world champion Jackie Stewart in a customer car run by Tyrrell Racing. As a result, March {{finished third in the}} 1970 Constructors' Championship. The factory also sold 40 cars to customers in various lower formulae. Despite these successes, the organisation got into financial difficulty almost immediately. The Formula One operation was costing more than the customer car business was making. The March works team's contract with its lead driver, Chris Amon, was expensive, and Mosley, in his own words, [...] "tried at every opportunity to get rid of him". He reasoned that Stewart's highly competitive customer car was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> March in a good light. Amon stayed {{to the end of the}} year, but Mosley succeeded in [...] "restructuring" [...] his contract, saving the company some much-needed money. At the end of the season, Mosley successfully demanded full control of the finances, including the factory run by Coaker, who left shortly afterwards. Mosley and Herd borrowed £20,000 from relatives and friends to support the company into its second year. According to Lovell the money came from Mosley's half-brother, Jonathan Guinness.|$|E
500|$|During {{his short}} life, Ramanujan {{independently}} compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations). Many were completely novel; [...] his original and highly unconventional results, {{such as the}} Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae, and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired {{a vast amount of}} further research. Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct. The Ramanujan Journal, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his notebooks - containing summaries of his published and unpublished results - have been analyzed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas. As late as 2011 and again in 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about [...] "simple properties" [...] and [...] "similar outputs" [...] for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death and which relied on work published in 2006. He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a 'single look' was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> they could only have been written by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to other mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.|$|E
