2500|$|Electrofluidic {{displays}} are {{a variation}} of an <b>electrowetting</b> display. Electrofluidic displays place an aqueous pigment dispersion inside a tiny reservoir. [...] The reservoir comprises <5-10% of the viewable pixel area and therefore the pigment is substantially hidden from view. Voltage is used to electromechanically pull the pigment out of the reservoir and spread it as a film directly behind the viewing substrate. [...] As a result, the display takes on color and brightness {{similar to that of}} conventional pigments printed on paper. When voltage is removed liquid surface tension causes the pigment dispersion to rapidly recoil into the reservoir. [...] As reported in the May 2009 Issue of Nature Photonics, the technology can potentially provide >85 % white state reflectance for electronic paper.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrowetting</b> {{using an}} {{insulating}} layer {{on top of}} a bare electrode was later studied by Bruno Berge in 1993. <b>Electrowetting</b> on this dielectric-coated surface is called electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) to distinguish it from the conventional <b>electrowetting</b> on the bare electrode. <b>Electrowetting</b> can also be demonstrated by replacing the metal electrode in the EWOD system by a semiconductor.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a miniature, tunable, minimally invasive endoscope for {{diagnosis of the}} auditory system. The probe is designed to sharply image anatomical details {{of the middle ear}} without the need for physically adjusting the position of the distal end of the endoscope. This is achieved through the addition of an <b>electrowetted,</b> tunable, electronically-controlled lens to the optical train. Morphological imaging is enabled by scanning light emanating from an optical coherence tomography system. System performance was demonstrated by imaging part of the ossicular chain and wall of the middle ear cavity of a normal mouse. During the experiment, we electronically moved the plane of best focus from the incudo-stapedial joint to the stapedial artery. Repositioning the object plane allowed us to image anatomical details of the middle ear beyond the depth of field of a static optical system. We also demonstrated {{for the first time to}} our best knowledge, that an optical system with an <b>electrowetted,</b> tunable lens may be successfully employed to measure sound-induced vibrations within the auditory system by measuring the vibratory amplitude of the tympanic membrane in a normal mouse in response to pure tone stimuli...|$|R
40|$|So-called “coffee-ring” stains are the {{deposits}} remaining after complete evaporation of droplets containing non-volatile solutes. In {{this paper}} we use Molecular Dynamics {{to simulate the}} evaporation of salt water nanodroplets {{in the presence of}} an applied electric field. We demonstrate, for the first time, that <b>electrowetted</b> nanodroplets can produce various deposit patterns, which vary substantially from the original ring-like deposit that occurs when there is no electric field. If a direct current (DC) electric field with strength greater than 0. 03 V/Å is imposed parallel to the surface, after the water evaporates the salt crystals form a deposit on the substrate in a ribbon pattern along the field direction. However, when an alternating current (AC) electric field is applied the salt deposit patterns can be either ring-like or clump, depending on the strength and frequency of the applied AC field. We find that an AC field of high strength and low frequency facilitates the regulation of the deposit patterns: the threshold electric field strength for the transition from ring-like to clump is approximately 0. 006 V/Å. These findings have potential application in fabricating nanostructures and surface coatings with desired patterns...|$|R
40|$|Electrically induced {{actuation}} {{of liquid}} droplet motion has significant {{applications in the}} field of MEMS and lab-on-a-chip devices. This dissertation presents results on the fundamentals governing the electrical actuation of liquid droplets on smooth and artificially microstructured surfaces. ^ A physics-based analytical model is formulated to predict transient EW-induced motion of an electrically conducting droplet between flat plates. A generic modeling framework for predicting the actuation force on a generic liquid droplet (electrically conducting or insulating) under DC or AC actuation is also developed. It is seen that the electrical actuation force on a droplet depends on the electrical properties of the liquid and the dielectric layer, the dielectric layer thickness, plate spacing and the frequency of the AC actuation voltage. Detailed experiments which involve the measurement of droplet velocities are conducted to benchmark the predictions of the electromechanical model. ^ The present work also studies droplet morphology and state transitions on artificially microstructured <b>electrowetted</b> surfaces. An analytical model which predicts the EW-induced Cassie-Wenzel transition on such surfaces is developed. Extensive experiments to study the EW-induced transition and quantify the reversibility of the transition are presented. It is seen that the presence of an energy barrier and dissipative forces hinder the reversibility of the Cassie-Wenzel transition. The dissertation also presents two novel concepts for enhanced control of droplet morphology on artificially microstructured surfaces. ...|$|R

40|$|Nearly {{half the}} world’s {{population}} lives below the global poverty line of $ 2. 50 per day. This population is disproportionately affected by infectious diseases {{due to a}} lack of regular screenings and early detection and intervention. Optical diagnostics provide a highly sensitive and specific, low-cost method by which to improve access to disease screening and monitoring at the point of care in low-resource settings. Point of care settings range from a patient’s bedside to a hospital, and there is a need for instrumentation that may be used across the point of care setting spectrum. This work describes a platform of miniature fluorescence microscopes designed for use in resource-limited point of care settings ranging from rural communities to hospital laboratories. The prototype units of the platform described here are three miniature microscopes: 1) A monochromatic infinity-corrected 0. 25 NA microscope that was used for optical readout of multiplexed bead-based bioassays. This prototype was validated with a commercially available assay reader (Luminex’s MAGPIX); 2) An achromatic 0. 35 NA finite conjugate objective designed for three-part white blood cell differential counts in rural areas. This unit was validated against a commercially available benchtop hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter Ac T diff 2) and is currently in use in clinical trials at Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospital; and 3) A tunable 0. 25 NA infinity-corrected fluorescence microscope designed for use with a variety multiplexed biological samples. The tunable system does not require manual adjustment by a trained user between emission wavelengths due to the addition of two low-cost, commercially available <b>electrowetted</b> lenses. It was validated by isolating green and red emission signal of blood stained with acridine orange. Each microscope prototype costs at least one order of magnitude less than its commercially available instrumentation counterpart. Additionally, the per-test cost for all devices is <$ 1. 00 since the sample platform used for all three modules is a standard microscope slide with low cost reagents, not a specialized cartridge or cuvette. With the platform of low-cost, high-performance microscopes described in this work, it is possible for diagnostic tests to be performed without expensive equipment or highly-trained clinicians, thereby delivering testing access to low-resources settings...|$|R

50|$|EWOLF. Another <b>electrowetting</b> {{configuration}} is <b>electrowetting</b> on liquid-infused film. The liquid-infused film {{is achieved}} by locking a liquid lubricant in a porous membrane through the delicate control of wetting properties of the liquid and solid phases. Taking advantage of the negligible contact line pinning at the liquid-liquid interface, the droplet response in EWOLF can be electrically addressed with enhanced degree of switchability and reversibility compared to the conventional EWOD. Moreover, the infiltration of liquid lubricant phase in the porous membrane also efficiently enhances the viscous energy dissipation, suppressing the droplet oscillation and leading to fast response without sacrificing the desired <b>electrowetting</b> reversibility. Meanwhile, the damping effect associated with the EWOLF can be tailored by manipulating the viscosity and thickness of liquid lubricant.|$|E

50|$|Optoelectrowetting, and photoelectrowetting {{are both}} optically-induced <b>electrowetting</b> effects. Optoelectrowetting {{involves}} the use of a photoconductor whereas photoelectrowetting use a photocapacitance and can be observed if the conductor in the liquid/insulator/conductor stack used for <b>electrowetting</b> is replaced by a semiconductor. By optically modulating the number of carriers in the space-charge region of the semiconductor, the contact angle of a liquid droplet can be altered in a continuous way. This effect can be explained by a modification of the Young-Lippmann equation.|$|E

5000|$|Microfluidic {{manipulation}} of liquids by <b>electrowetting</b> was demonstrated first with mercury droplets {{in water and}} later with water in air and water in oil. Manipulation of droplets on a two-dimensional path was demonstrated later.If the liquid is discretized and programmably manipulated, the approach is called [...] "Digital Microfluidic Circuits" [...] or [...] "Digital Microfluidics". Discretization by electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) was first demonstrated by Cho, Moon and Kim, completing the four basic digital microfluidic functions of creating, transporting, dividing and merging droplets on chip by <b>electrowetting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Photoelectrowetting is a {{modification}} of the wetting properties of a surface (typically a hydrophobic surface) using incident light. Whereas ordinary <b>electrowetting</b> is observed in surfaces consisting of a liquid/insulator/conductor stack, photoelectrowetting can be observed by replacing the conductor with a semiconductor to form a liquid/insulator/semiconductor stack. This has electrical and optical properties similar to the metal/insulator/semiconductor stack used in metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and charge-coupled devices (CCDs). Replacing the conductor with a semiconductor results in asymmetrical <b>electrowetting</b> behavior (in terms of voltage polarity), depending on the semiconductor doping type and density.|$|E
50|$|Optoelectrowetting (OEW) is {{a method}} of liquid droplet {{manipulation}} used in microfluidics applications. This technique builds {{on the principle of}} <b>electrowetting,</b> which has proven useful in liquid actuation due to fast switching response times and low power consumption. Where traditional <b>electrowetting</b> runs into challenges, however, such as in the simultaneous manipulation of multiple droplets, OEW presents a lucrative alternative that is both simpler and cheaper to produce. OEW surfaces are easy to fabricate, since they require no lithography, and have real-time, reconfigurable, large-scale manipulation control, due to its reaction to light intensity.|$|E
50|$|For {{reasons that}} are still under investigation, only a limited set of {{surfaces}} exhibit the theoretically predicted <b>electrowetting</b> behavior. Because of this, alternative materials {{that can be used}} to coat and functionalize the surface are used to create the expected wetting behavior. For example, amorphous fluoropolymers are widely used <b>electrowetting</b> coating materials, and it has been found that the behavior of these fluoropolymers can be enhanced by the appropriate surface patterning. These fluoropolymers coat the necessary conductive electrode, typically made of aluminum foil or indium tin oxide (ITO), to create the desired <b>electrowetting</b> properties. Three types of such polymers are commercially available: FluoroPel hydrophobic and superhydrophobic V-series polymers are sold by Cytonix, CYTOP is sold by Asahi Glass Co., and Teflon AF is sold by DuPont. Other surface materials such as SiO2 and gold on glass have been used.These materials allow the surfaces themselves to act as the ground electrodes for the electric current.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>electrowetting</b> {{effect has}} been defined as [...] "the change in solid-electrolyte contact angle due to an applied {{potential}} difference between the solid and the electrolyte". The phenomenon of <b>electrowetting</b> can be understood in terms of the forces that result from the applied electric field. [...] The fringing field at the corners of the electrolyte droplet tends to pull the droplet down onto the electrode, lowering the macroscopic contact angle and increasing the droplet contact area. Alternatively, <b>electrowetting</b> can be viewed from a thermodynamic perspective. Since the surface tension of an interface is defined as the Gibbs free energy required to create a certain area of that surface, it contains both chemical and electrical components, and charge becomes a significant term in that equation. The chemical component is just the natural surface tension of the solid/electrolyte interface with no electric field. The electrical component is the energy stored in the capacitor formed between the conductor and the electrolyte.|$|E
50|$|Flexible {{displays}} using {{electronic paper}} technology commonly use Electrophoretic or <b>Electrowetting</b> technologies. However, {{each type of}} flexible electronic paper vary in specification due to different implementation techniques by different companies.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} <b>electrowetting</b> mechanism {{has been}} receiving increasing interest {{due to its}} ability to control tension forces on a liquid droplet. As surface tension acts as the dominant liquid actuation force in nano-scale applications, <b>electrowetting</b> {{has been used to}} modify this tension at the solid-liquid interface through the application of an external voltage. The applied electric field causes a change in the contact angle of the liquid droplet, and in turn changes the surface tensions across the droplet. Precise manipulation of the electric field allows control of the droplets. The droplet is placed on an insulating substrate located in between an electrode.|$|E

50|$|However, {{surface charge}} {{is but one}} {{component}} of surface energy, and other components are certainly perturbed by induced charge. So, a complete explanation of <b>electrowetting</b> is unquantified, but {{it should not be}} surprising that these limits exist.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>electrowetting</b> {{behavior}} of mercury and other liquids on variably charged surfaces was probably first explained by Gabriel Lippmann in 1875 and was certainly observed much earlier. A.N. Frumkin used surface charge {{to change the}} shape of water drops in 1936. The term <b>electrowetting</b> was first introduced in 1981 by G.Beni and S.Hackwood to describe an effect proposed for designing {{a new type of}} display device for which they received a patent. The use of a [...] "fluid transistor" [...] in microfluidic circuits for manipulating chemical and biological fluids was first investigated by J. Brown in 1980 and later funded in 1984-1988 under NSF Grants 8760730 & 8822197, employing insulating dielectric and hydrophobic layer(s) (EWOD), immiscible fluids, DC or RF power; and mass arrays of miniature interleaved (saw tooth) electrodes with large or matching Indium tin oxide (ITO)electrodes to digitally relocate nano droplets in linear, circular and directed paths, pump or mix fluids, fill reservoirs and control fluid flow electronically or optically. Later, in collaboration with J. Silver at the NIH, EWOD-based <b>electrowetting</b> was disclosed for single and immiscible fluids to move, separate, hold and seal arrays of digital PCR sub-samples.|$|E
