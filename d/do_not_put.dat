25|$|Like Tefillin, Karaites {{interpret}} the scripture that mandates inscribing the Law on doorposts and city gates as a metaphorical admonition, specifically, {{to keep the}} Law at home and away. This is because the previous commandment in the same passage is the source for Tefillin for Rabbinic Judaism, and is understood metaphorically due to the language. As a result, the entire passage is understood as a metaphor. Therefore, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> up mezuzot, although many Karaite Jews do have a small plaque with the Ten Commandments on their doorposts.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{a period}} of heavy rain {{followed}} by strong sun, there are signs of distress on the island: fishing boats <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> out to sea, carts do not go to market, people are ascending to the mountains. Then a storm causes a shipwreck and a survivor seeks refuge in Dan’s hut. As he comes in and out of consciousness, the man tells Dan the story of how he is a priest from Ireland come to help stop the “sweating sickness” which grips the island. Before the priest dies, Dan promises that he will take the priest's place and go to the Bishop's to instruct the people how to halt the sickness.|$|E

25|$|Cuckoldry {{occurs in}} many fish species, {{including}} dragonets, parrotfishes and wrasses on tropical reefs and the bluegill sunfish in fresh water. Sneaker males that become {{too large to}} hide effectively become satellite males. With bluegill sunfish, satellite males mimic the behaviour and colouration of the females. They hover over a nest containing a pair of courting sunfish, and gradually descend to reach the pair just as they spawn. Males {{may need to be}} 6 or 7 years old to function capably as parental males, but may be able to function as sneaker or satellite males when they are as young as 2 or 3 years old. The smaller satellite and sneaker males may get mauled by the more powerful parental males, but they spawn when they are younger and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> energy into parental care.|$|E
500|$|An-Nasir Muhammad died in June 1341. His reign {{was marked}} by a {{centralization}} of autocratic power in the Mamluk Sultanate. Shortly before his death, an-Nasir Muhammad discussed his succession with his two senior emirs, Qawsun and Bashtak. The latter supported Ahmad's nomination, but Qawsun supported Ahmad's younger brother Abu Bakr. An-Nasir Muhammad also favored Abu Bakr and believed Ahmad was unfit to rule. He rejected Bashtak's suggestion, stating [...] "As for Ahmad, who is in al-Karak, do not let him cross [...] Egypt; <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> him in charge of anything, because he would cause the ruin of the state!" [...] Following an-Nasir Muhammad's death, In May or June 1341, Abu Bakr was proclaimed sultan, but was virtually a ceremonial ruler, with Qawsun holding the reins of power as mudabbir al-dawla (organizer of the state), in effect the strongman of Egypt. He imprisoned Abu Bakr in the Upper Egyptian city of Qus where he was executed on trumped up charges of frivolity. Qawsun thereafter arranged for an-Nasir Muhammad's five-year-old son, al-Ashraf Kujuk, to be declared sultan, further consolidating Qawsun's power.|$|E

Our women, God bless them, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> up such demands, which would disturb the public peace" [...] They only demand education and instruction". Any change in Egyptian women's position in society was often therefore [...] "legitimised by the needs of society, not by their rights as human individuals". This enabled limits to be established to prevent too much improvement in their position. By improving certain aspects of their rights and situations in Egyptian society such as access to education, meant that the upper and middle classes were satisfied.|$|E

[...] It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to Godto go back to life to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted (...) [...] Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: [...] "Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense." [...] At another place, the Quran urges mankind: [...] "And die not except in a state of Islam" [...] (...) because [...] "Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam" [...] (...) [...] Other verses related with this issue are: [...] "He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving" [...] (...) [...] "Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Régis Debray called de Gaulle [...] "super-lucide" [...] {{and pointed}} out that {{virtually}} all of his predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of 'old' Russia, came true after his death. Debray compared him with Napoleon ('the great political myth of the 19th century'), calling de Gaulle his 20th century equivalent. [...] "The sublime, it seems, appears in France only once a century ... Napoleon left two generations dead on battlefield. De Gaulle was more sparing with other people's blood; even so, he left us, as it were, stranded, alive but dazed... A delusion, perhaps, but one that turns the world upside down: causes events and movements; divides people into supporters and adversaries; leaves traces {{in the form of}} civil and penal codes and railways, factories and institutions (the Fifth Republic has already lasted three times as long as the Empire). A statesman who gets something going, who has followers, escapes the reality of the reports and statistics and become part of imagination. Napoleon and de Gaulle modified the state of things because they modified souls". However, Debray pointed out that {{there is a difference between}} Napoleon and de Gaulle: [...] "How can the exterminator be compared with the liberator? ... The former ran the whole enterprise into the ground, while the latter managed to save it. So that to measure the rebel against the despot, the challenger against the leader, is just glaringly idiotic. You simply <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> an adventurer who worked for himself or his family on the same level as a commander-in-chief serving his country. ... Regrettably, Gaullism and Bonapartism have a number of features in common, but Napoleon and de Gaulle do not have the same moral value. ... the first wanted a Holy French Empire without the faith, a Europe under French occupation. The second wanted to rescue the nation from the emperors and establish a free France in a free Europe".|$|E
