40|$|Hard chrome is {{the most}} {{extensively}} used <b>electroplated</b> <b>coating</b> in the aerospace and automotive industries due to its attractive properties such as high hardness and excellent wear resistance. However, due to the health risks {{associated with the use}} of hexavalent chromium baths during electroplating, there is a need to identify an alternative to this coating.

The coating was characterized for its micro hardness, wear resistance, coefficient of friction and corrosion resistance. The coating was also subjected to heat treatment at temperatures in the range of 200 o - 600 oC. It was observed that the micro hardness of Ni-Mo-Co (730 KHN) alloy coating under optimized conditions is apparently quiet similar to that of the most probable substitute Co-P (745 VHN) and hard chrome (800 VHN) coatings.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Electroplated zinc finishes {{have been widely used}} in the packaging of electronic products for many years {{as a result of their}} excellent corrosion resistance and relatively low cost. However, the spontaneous formation of whiskers on zinc electroplated components, which are capable of resulting in electrical shorting or other damaging effects, can be highly problematic for the reliability of long life electrical and electronic equipment. To date, most research has focused on tin whiskers and much less attention has been paid to zinc whisker research. A number of mechanisms to explain zinc whisker growth have been proposed, but none of them are widely accepted and some are in conflict with each other. This study has investigated the mechanism for whisker growth from three commercial zinc electroplated coatings on mild steel substrates. Firstly, whisker growth from an alkaline cyanide-free zinc electrodeposit was studied. A reduction in deposition current density (from 50 to 5 mA/cm 2) and an increase in deposit thickness (from 2 to 15 μm) both contributed to reduced whisker growth. In terms of the mechanisms of whisker growth, it was observed that the presence of spherical raised surface features (nodules) with cavities beneath, promoted whisker growth by markedly shortening the incubation time from 5 months to 4 weeks. More importantly, the time dependent recrystallisation of the as-deposited columnar structure is closely associated with whisker growth from both nodules and planar regions of the deposit. The formation of Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) was not observed at either the Fe/Zn interface or within the electroplated coatings and does not appear to be associated with Zn whisker growth. Whisker growth from an acid chloride zinc <b>electroplated</b> <b>coating</b> and a Zn-Ni alloy <b>electroplated</b> <b>coating</b> were also investigated. These two coatings were immune to whisker growth after 18 months of storage at room temperature, regardless of deposition current density, deposit thickness and substrate surface modification. Finally, the effect of potential mitigation strategies on whisker growth was evaluated. Exposure to elevated temperatures (50 to 150 °C) for 24 hours promoted whisker growth by reducing the incubation time for whiskers to first appear from less than 4 weeks to less than 10 days, whilst whisker growth was significantly retarded when samples were subjected to a short period of thermal treatment (50 to 150 °C) for 0. 5 hour. More importantly, for a short period of thermal treatment, whisker mitigation became increasingly effective as the treatment temperature was raised. In addition, the formation of a trivalent chromium passive coating on the alkaline cyanide-free zinc electrodeposits immediately after deposition was not an effective mitigation method to retard whisker growth...|$|E

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of the absorber pipe in a parabolic trough collector isessential {{for the performance of}} the solar collector. The desirable propertiesare high absorptance (α) of solar radiation and low emittance (ε) of thermalradiation. A surface with these properties is known as a solar selective surface. There are several techniques used to produce selective surfaces, {{but one of the most}} common ones is electroplating. Research done by Vargas, indicates that {{optical properties}} of α = 0. 98 and ε = 0. 03 [1], which is superior to the best commercial alternatives (α = 0. 95 and ε = 0. 04 [2]), can be achieved by electroplating a Co-Cr coating on a stainless steel substrate. Additionally, Vargas used an electrolyte of trivalent chromium dissolved in a deep eutectic solvent, as opposed to the traditionally used aqueous electrolytes containing hexavalent chromium, which is toxic and carcinogenic. In this project, a coating of Co-Cr was electroplated on a stainless steel substratewith a method similar to that of Vargas in order to obtain a solar selective surface. The electrolyte was composed of ethylene glycol, choline chloride, CrCl 3 • 6 H 2 O and CoCl 2 • 6 H 2 O in a molar ratio of 16 : 1 : 0. 4 : 0. 2. The plating process was conducted using chronoamperometric electrodeposition with an applied potential of - 1. 2 V (against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode) for 15 min. The system was investigated using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The total absorptance was measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy, while the emittance was measured using an IR-thermometer. The microstructure and chemical composition was investigated using Scanning ElectronMicroscopy (SEM), Focused Ion Beam (FIB), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The thermal stability of the coating was investigated by exposingit to 400 °C in air for 24 h.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of hydrogen with metals has great environmental significance in problems {{ranging from the}} catastrophic failure of materials due to hydrogen embrittlement to safe and efficient storage of hydrogen as a metal hydride. Chromium (Cr) is widely used as an alloying agent to produce materials such as stainless steel and as an <b>electroplated</b> <b>coating</b> on materials to prevent corrosion and to minimize wear. Hydrogen which co-deposits with chromium during electroplating forms hexagonal close packed CrH or face centered cubic CrH 2 which cracks the deposit. The behavior of hydrogen in Cr, especially the crystal structure modifications of metal Cr when it is exposed to hot, dense hydrogen gas is not completely understood. In equilibrium study, chromium hydride has been found of hexagonal close packed structure under 400 Â°C with high hydrogen pressure. Experiments at higher temperatures are limited by the equipment and technology. This dissertation describes a novel, non-equilibrium method which was used to synthesize a new chromium hydride phase. Single crystal, body centered cubic Cr thin films were prepared by vacuum evaporation. These films were exposed to high temperature (close to the melting point of Cr), high pressure hydrogen gas in a ballistic compressor. This was followed by rapid cooling (3 ̆e 105 ËšC/s) to room temperature. Using the transmission electron microscope (TEM), second phase particles of superhexagonal structure, which has lattice constant A= 4. 77 Ã… and C/A= 1. 84, {{are found in the}} films. This structure has a volume per Cr atom slightly larger than that of hexagonal closed packed CrH, so that the superhexagonal structure may contain more hydrogen than the hexagonal close packed CrH. The superhexagonal particles have a definite orientation relationship with the matrix: [021][subscript sh] II [OOl][subscript b] and (212) [subscript sh] II (IIO) [subscript]b. The superhexagonal structure is quite stable in air and at room temperature, but decomposes to body centered cubic Cr when heated by the electron beam illumination in the TEM. No such particles were observed in Cr films exposed to pure argon under similar conditions in the ballistic compressor. Positive identification of hydrogen content was obtained by high-temperature vacuum extraction in a discharge tube. After vacuum extraction, hydrogen spectrum was observed, and the intensity of electron diffraction from superhexagonal structure decreased. Using an energy dispersive spectrometer with the capability of detecting elements down to atomic number six (carbon), no changes in composition of the films were found by comparing the characteristic x-ray spectra of the same film before and after exposure to hot, dense hydrogen in the ballistic compressor. This result suggests that this non-equilibrium method may be used for other metal-hydrogen systems to obtain new structural phases that are of scientific or technological interest...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: The platinum coatings with thickness of 3 mm and 7 mm were deposited by electroplating process on Inconel 713 LC Ni-base superalloy. The heat treatment of electroplating coatings at the temperature 1050 °C during 2 h under argon atmosphere was performed. The microstructure investigations of the heat treated coatings were conducted by the use of optical microscope (Nikon Epiphot 300) and a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S- 3400 N) equipped with an X-radiation detector EDS (VOYAGER of NORAN INSTRUMENTS). The phase composition was identified by X-ray (ARL X’TRAX) diffractometer. The surface roughness parameter - Ra was evaluated by Perthometer S 2 MAHR equipment. Findings: The microstructure of platinum <b>electroplating</b> <b>coating</b> with thickness of 3 µm after diffusion treatment consists of two phases: γ-Ni and (Al 0. 25 Pt 0. 75) Ni 3. The increase of platinum thickness from 3 µm to 7 µm does not influence the phase composition of heat treated coatings. Heat treatment of platinum electroplating coatings causes the increase of surface roughness parameter as a result of unequal mass flow of platinum and nickel. Research limitations/implications: The results will be used in the future investigations to explain the mechanism of reaction of platinum as a modifier in aluminide coatings. Practical implications: The platinum electroplating coatings after diffusion treatment and aluminizing process are widely used as coatings for turbine blades of aircraft engines.

Selection of final metals for trial in experimental alloys related to their considered contribution towards bright finish and their physical and corrosion properties. Based {{on the concept of}} using a large organic delivery molecule to produce nano-metallic plate structures, two ligands were employed, Gluconate (G) and Dithizone (D).

Decisions about future work are reported, based on fmdings and progress to date. These findings indicate coating thickness in the range 3. 58 IlID to 69. 45 urn and relate them to plating conditions and methodology.

This type of duplex treatments combine the benefits of each individual treatment in order to obtain, with this synergic effect, compounds type CrxN more economic than those obtained by other kind of treatments e. g. physical vapor deposition (PVD). The results obtained by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) indicate the surface and subsurface transformation of the electrolytic hard chromium coating by formation of CrN and Cr 2 N phases. Likewise, potentiodynamic polarization tests indicate an increase in corrosion resistance of such kind of compounds {{in comparison with the}} obtained results with electroplated hard chromium...|$|R
40|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} (CSP) is a fast {{forwarding}} technology {{in power generation}} sector because of its’ competitive price, abundance in nature {{and the most important}} fact is its’ energy storage capability. Among the four types of available CSP technology, central receiver has more potential concerning with high temperature, power block efficiency and levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Other than conventional type of receiver design, the concept of this work is very particular in a sense of its design novelty. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) {{come up with a new}} concept of high temperature solar receiver called near black body (NBB) receiver. This receiver design requires high specular reflective surface in its’ front section at operating temperature 150 C. High specular reflective surface refers to mirror finished surface. However, this specular reflective surface application is for high temperature solar receiver, the surface needs to be durable from thermal cycling, oxidation and environmental effect. This mirror finished specular surface helps to penetrate the sunlight inside the hollow tube and hence increase receiver’s efficiency. But at such operating temperature and environmental condition, optical properties degradation rate is high. So to protect this mirror surface a thin layer of SiO 2 has been deposited by sol-gel method on top of <b>electroplated</b> silver <b>coating.</b> To obtain a rigid thin film structure, sol-gel procedure has been tested extensively by varying most dominant sol-gel parameters. Endurance test has been performed in the furnace at 150 C for 1000 hours. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} post-supercritical CO 2 {{electroplating}} uses the electrolyte solution after being mixed with supercritical CO 2 and released to atmospheric pressure. It utilizes the microbubbles that form when oversaturated CO 2 in the electrolyte returns to gaseous state, {{which gives the}} similar effect of pulsed electroplating. Under atmospheric pressure, the CO 2 bubbles gradually diffuse. Therefore, the introduction of ultrasound and/or other agitation can potentially excite the CO 2 microbubbles to achieve an electroplated surface of even higher quality. In this study, during the electroplating process, three different modes of agitation: magnetic stirrer agitation, ultrasonic agitation and a combined mode (magnetic + ultrasonic) were applied, respectively, {{in order to obtain}} an optimal surface morphology and mechanical properties for the <b>electroplated</b> Ni <b>coating.</b> It is found that the combined agitation mode at a current density of 40 A/dm 2 achieved the smallest grain size, lower surface roughness, and produced an electroplated Ni layer that achieved hardness of 320 HV, much higher when compared with conventional method, which were usually in the range of 160 to 300 HV. However, at the same time, the electroplating with combined agitation developed a higher internal stress of 320 MPa due to the lower current efficiency of the process and finer grain in the coating. Moreover, a new control methodology for tailoring the coating’s mechanical property through its thickness was demonstrated by the timely introduction of ultrasonic agitation during the electroplating process with post supercritical CO 2 mixed electrolyte...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{corrosion}} resistance of an <b>electroplated</b> (EP) Zn <b>coating</b> whose surface was chemically etched to produce surface defects (pores) is investigated in this work. Impedance and DC polarisation measururements {{were employed to}} study the behaviour of such coating in various corrosive media (NaCl, NaOH and rain water). Four different faradaic relaxation processes were clearly revealed in different NaCl concentrations (from 0. 1 M to 1 M). In the most concentrated solutions at least three relaxation processes at low frequencies (LF) appeared and were related to zinc deposition and dissolution. At lower concentrations and depending on the pH, only one process was observed. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corrosion current (Icorr) were practically stable in the pH range 5 to 10. In deaerated NaCl 0. 1 M, the EIS diagrams showed two time-constants at very close frequencies. From the EIS diagrams the porous nature of the coating was highlighted and showed that the dissolution mechanisms occurred {{at the base of}} the pores...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{phenomenon known as}} Zinc Whiskers, their potential and historic impact in modern computer data centers and the appropriate methods for reducing exposure to this fault vector. Experiential data is described (but not presented) and Compaq’s position with respect to incidents involving Zinc Whiskers is stated. Phenomenon Zinc Whiskers were first discovered in 1948 by Bell Labs in which a whisker on a zinc-plated bracket caused increased losses in quartz filters used in a telephone transmission system (1). The whiskers constitute a very serious anomaly that is causing problems ranging from inconvenience to complete havoc in today’s computer rooms. Zinc Whiskers originate from zinc electroplated products commonly used in computer rooms. Zinc (Zn) is an element used to prevent rusting or oxidation of steel. Steel pieces are coated (passivated) with zinc. This coating can either be zinc Hot Dipped Galvanized (HDG) or <b>electroplated.</b> The HDG <b>coating</b> is not associated with the Zinc Whisker contaminate and can be easily recognized by the irregular triangular (spangled...|$|R
