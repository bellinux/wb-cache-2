5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate during the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life was 130% to 173%, slightly {{faster than the}} growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E

5|$|Use {{of the era}} {{name was}} {{formally}} adopted {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC), yet its origins can be traced back further. The oldest method of recording years—which had existed since the Shang—set the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> a ruler's reign as year one. When an emperor died, the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> a new reign period would begin. This system was changed by the 4th century BC when the <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> a new reign period did not begin until {{the first day of the}} lunar New Year following a ruler's death. When Duke Huiwen of Qin assumed the title of king in 324 BC, he changed the year count of his reign back to the first year. For his newly adopted calendar established in 163 BC, Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC) also set the year count of his reign back to the beginning.|$|E
