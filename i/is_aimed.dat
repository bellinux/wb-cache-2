5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result <b>is</b> <b>aimed</b> to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool pH of <6.0.

5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest.

Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment <b>is</b> <b>aimed</b> at relieving the local effects.|$|E
