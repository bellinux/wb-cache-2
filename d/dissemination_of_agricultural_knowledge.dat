40|$|Agricultural {{colleges have}} three main objectives: training, research, and {{offering}} public services. Transfer and <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> and {{technology is the}} best example of universities’ services. In this regard, agricultural extension has the important role of linking agricultural colleges with agricultural industry. The linkage between extension and agricultural colleges is effective in promoting the two organizations and ultimately enhancing the development of agriculture. Therefore, the significance of this linkage has been emphasized by many program planners as well as researchers. This descriptive research was conducted to analyze the perception of the faculty members at Agricultural College of Shiraz University and the extension agents and specialists of Fars Province. A theoretical framework was developed based on a “communication model”, and forty-seven factors effective in establishing and promoting the linkage between research and extension were recognized. The results revealed that {{the most important factor in}} research-extension linkage is “the degree of contact and knowledge of local agricultural affairs by researchers”.

40|$|For {{several decades}} the {{effective}} and efficient <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> new <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> among farmers in developing countries has been problematic. Two major programs were implemented in Indonesia, namely The Training and Visit (T&V) Extension Program or The Massive Guidance (BIMAS) Program, from the mid 1960 s {{until the end of}} the 1980 s, and the Farmer Field School (FFS) Program, during the 1990 s. The main difference between these two programs is that, while farmers were instructed what to do under the T&V program, the FFS program encouraged and stimulated farmers to make their own decisions. This paper aims to discuss and compare the effectiveness of these two programs with reference to rice production in Indonesia. The findings suggest that, for regions where the level of development is still very low, implementing a T&V program instructing farmers what to do is probably more appropriate than an FFS. As for regions where agriculture is relatively developed, an effective FFS program seems more appropriate. Food policy, agricultural economics and policy, development policy, public policy...|$|R
40|$|While the {{literature}} on food has somewhat addressed rudimentary food skills and their importance in the creation and maintenance of a healthy population, there remains {{a serious lack of}} research into the importance <b>of</b> food and <b>agricultural</b> skills and <b>knowledge</b> transference to children, especially given the rise in diet-related illnesses. This study focuses on the perceived importance <b>of</b> food and <b>agricultural</b> education initiatives, as well as the opportunities and barriers that exist within the elementary school classroom to incorporate food and agricultural topics, in the context of southern Ontario, specifically Wellington County. Drawing on Wilkin 2 ̆ 7 s concept of ‘food citizenship’ as a desirable end goal of alternative food movements, food and agricultural education presence in the curriculum is researched for its potential contribution to healthy, active communities. This study highlights experiences and insights through key informant interviews with teachers, parents, Upper Grand District School Board employees, nutritionists, and people involved in relevant community organizations, to determine the current role that formal secondary-level public educational institutions, and the educators within them, play in the <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> and skill. More specifically, the questions asked focus on what opportunities exist for teachers to enable and assist their students in becoming food citizens, and specifically: in what ways does the provincial curriculum as it currently exists, lend support to teachers, who can then enable students to become food citizens? And perhaps most importantly, do food skills and knowledge contribute to the holistic development of young people? This study uses a qualitative approach, through the use of key informant interviews and curriculum analysis. Research findings indicate that food and agricultural education is seen as important to respondents, and {{that there are a number}} of complex opportunities for and barriers to including these topics in classrooms and encouraging greater food citizenship in young people...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture is {{a crucial}} sector for most of sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya for {{instance}} agriculture is the largest sector in the Kenyan economy, generating {{a quarter of the}} gross domestic product and two-fifths of export earnings. Indeed reports have shown that efficient and effective <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> and information can help governments meet six of the eight millennium development goals. But for this to happen, transforming structures (policies and strategies) that encourage digital documentation of agricultural indigenous knowledge and digitization of valuable information emanating from agricultural research in Kenyan institutions of higher learning and research centres must be formulated, publicized and implemented. The Kenya Agricultural Information Network (KAINet) was established in 2006 in response to a need for coherence in the management of agricultural information and to enhance exchange and access to agricultural knowledge and information through a digital collaborative institutional repository. From a national perspective, KAINet is enshrined in the Kenya government Strategy for Revitalizing Agriculture (SRA). The SRA, launched in March 2004, aims at achieving a reduction in unemployment and poverty through application of, among other things, new technologies and information as the basis for a thriving agricultural system. Besides the SRA, another policy that has been launched to create an enabling environment for projects such as the KAINet initiative, is the National Information and Communication Technology Policy. The paper will look at the KAINet progress in the light of these policies and at what lessons can be learnt from them. In addition, suggestions will also be discussed about the additional digital agricultural content that Kenya and Africa at large can develop to have Africanized open access repositories available on the World Wide Web, which will ensure that Africa establishes her niche in the information and knowledge age...|$|E
40|$|Th e International Potash Institute (IPI) has {{initiated}} {{the distribution of}} a questionnaire to several hundred farmers in villages and locations across India and in two locations in East China, and to approximately a hundred fertilizer dealers in India. Th e results were compiled and compared {{between the two countries}} and, in some cases, between villages of the same country. Th e results show that Chinese farmers rarely avoid the annual application of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), potash (K) and organic matter (OM), when compared with farmers in India. About 40 % of farmers asked in India add K ‘sometimes ’ or ‘never’, while 10 % only apply ‘sometimes ’ in China. Th e use of a soil test was highly varied between the various locations in India, but was very low in the two locations surveyed in China. Dependence on precipitation and the socio-economic level of farmers strongly aff ects the use of nutrients and consumption of services such as soil testing. Regular contacts with extension services also varied greatly between locations in In-dia and were quite high in China. Indian farmers appear to appreciate less the knowled-ge of the fertilizer dealers, mostly ranking their knowledge as poor to medium, but Chinese farmers tend to rank the dealers ’ knowledge as “good ” and “very good”. Most farmers in the survey appreciate workshops and meetings as the best channels for receiving agronomic information, followed by TV and information sheets. It is concluded that, {{in order to make the}} most effi cient <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge,</b> a site-specifi c knowledge transfer policy has to be tailored according to the local agronomic, social, economic and societal parameters and the needs of the region...|$|E

40|$|Background: Access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> is {{important}} in transforming livelihoods of those relying on agriculture for a living and in enhancing food security. This access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> is influenced by infrastructure needed for information dissemination. However, information infrastructure is not uniform by distributed within and between countries. It is because of this {{that some of the}} farming communities are information rich while others are information poor. In Tanzania, the agricultural sector is characterised by poor research-extension-farmers linkage and inaccessibility <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> at farm level Objective: The study investigated the factors influencing access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> among smallholder rice farmers in the Kilombero district of Tanzania. Specifically, the study identified categories <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> needed by farmers, determined how farmers access <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and assessed the factors limiting the accessibility <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> among rice farmers in the Kilombero district. Method: Quantitative data were collected via semi-structured questionnaires administered face-to-face with rice farmers, community leaders, and agricultural agents in four villages at the Kilombero district of the Morogoro region in Tanzania. Results: The key finding indicates that farmers accessed and used <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> in undertaking <b>agricultural</b> activities. It was further revealed that the level <b>of</b> acquisition <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> increased with an increase in age. Farmers needed <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> on land preparation, seed selection, and rice planting, while few acquired <b>knowledge</b> on <b>agricultural</b> markets. Among the <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> sources used, demonstration plots and agricultural extension agents were found to be used by the majority of the farmers. It was also found that a limited number of demonstration plots, late delivery of information services, a limited number <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> extension agents, and poor information and communication technologies infrastructure hindered access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> among rice farmers in the district. Conclusion: A strong public–private partnership is needed to enhance access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> in rural areas. In this regard, the government should set up policies and strategies that motivate private sector investment and involvement in provision <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> in rural areas. The private sector should extend their agricultural-related activities to most rural areas so that more people can have access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Information Scienc...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> systems (AKS) {{especially in}} rural communities cannot be overemphasized. AKS are important for creation, sharing and enhancing access and usage <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge.</b> They link <b>agricultural</b> research and farms; increase adoption <b>of</b> good <b>agricultural</b> practices; improve the performance <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> marketing systems; and enhance effective post-harvest management. Despite the importance of agriculture {{to the economy and}} livelihoods of majority of Tanzanians, there is a consensus from scholars that the sector has been performing poorly. This is partially due to limited access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> resulting into irrational decisions on agricultural activities thus dwarfing the sector. The modified Knowledge Management Processes Model guided the study in investigating how AKS can be strengthened to enhance access and usage <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> among stakeholders. The study adopted a pragmatic paradigm and used mixed method research by applying a survey, key informant interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) and document reviews. Structured questionnaires were administered to 314 farmers while key informant interviews involved 57 respondents among village executives, councillors, input-suppliers, information providers, buyers, agricultural extension officers and researchers. Moreover, three FGDs involving 24 farmers were conducted. Qualitative data were analysed through classical content and constant comparison analysis, while SPSS software was used to analyse quantitative data. Quantitative and qualitative data were mixed during analysis, interpretation and discussion of results. The study identified farmers, the private sector and the government as major actors, but not working in unison. Most actors used human based systems while few used ICT and paper based systems. Actors needed <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> on weather, farm preparation, seeds, crop maintenance, post-harvest practices, agricultural marketing and credits. Most actors shared <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge</b> through face-to-face interactions and mobile phones, few through internet. It was concluded that poor linkage among actors limited accessibility <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge.</b> To improve accessibility to <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge,</b> a model for strengthening AKS usage is proposed. It is recommended that actors should be linked together and involved in enhancing access and usage <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Moreover, the proposed model should be validated before applying it.

Specific objectives are to examine the socio – economic characteristics of the farmers, their sources <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> information and effectiveness of radio in the <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> information as well as the related problems. The study was carried out in Edu local government area of Kwara state, Nigeria. A total of 150 farmers were randomly selected from different villages within the ten political wards of the local government. Interview schedule was used to collect relevant data from the respondents. The instrument for data collection was validated and subjected to reliability test. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analysed data collected. Results showed that majority of the farmers were males, mostly 50 years and below in age with little formal education. Though most of the farmers got agricultural information through radio but some had to depend on friends / relations and Extension Agents(EAs) for agricultural information. Despite the advantages of the use of radio on this issue, 47. 9 % of the farmers considered it ineffective and some of the problems identified include language barrier, clarity of messages and improper interpretation of scientific terms / units of measurement as contained in the messages to be disseminated. In view of all these, more than one – half of the respondents did not record significant improvement in their farming activities. Furthermore, Chi Square analysis showed that only gender and level of improvement in farming had positive and significant relationship with the effectiveness of radio in the <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> information to targeted farmers. It can be concluded that radio is a useful source <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> information but it needs improvement in the areas of service delivery with a view to overcoming language barrier, poor presentation of key points and improper interpretation of scientific terms / units of measurements.
