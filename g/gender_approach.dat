40|$|Notwithstanding all the {{corporeal}} and gendered {{language in}} the Pauline letters, the apostle’s bodiliness and masculinity so far has received little attention. In the 1 st-century context masculinity reigned by default and provides the contemporary context for teasing out the corporeal and gendered overtones in the Pauline letters, especially in Paul’s self-presentation. Recent and intersecting masculinity studies, body theology and queer theory provide useful tools for engaging Paul as man and his bodily-focussed, <b>gendered</b> <b>approach</b> in his letters. A focus on both Paul as embodied man and his corporeal, <b>gendered</b> <b>approach</b> enable alternative readings of his letters’ concern with corporeality and the related relationships between bodies, power and life in the communities he addressed...|$|R
40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{the characterization of}} Roman artifacts {{so that they can}} play a greater role in <b>gendered</b> <b>approaches</b> to Roman sites—sites that constitute lived spaces but lack actual references to sexed bodies. It commences with a brief discussion on <b>gendered</b> <b>approaches</b> in the two main strands of Roman archaeology—classical and provincial. Within the differing frameworks of the wider disciplines of classics and archaeology, both strands focus on contexts with sexed bodies—burials, figurative representation, and inscriptions. The discussion serves as a background for more integrated and more interrogative approaches to relationships between Roman artifacts and <b>gendered</b> practices, <b>approaches</b> that aim to develop interpretative tools for investigating social practice in contexts where no representational or biologically sexed bodies are evident. Three types of artifacts—brooches, glass bottles, and needles—are used to demonstrate how differing degrees of gender associations of artifacts and artifact assemblages can provide insights into gender relationships in settlement contexts. These insights in turn contribute to better understandings of gendered sociospatial practices across the Roman world. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> means {{ensuring}} that climate actions are gender-responsive and promote women’s participation in decision-making. While {{women make up}} approximately 50% of the world population, in many countries women are less {{able to cope with}} - and are more exposed to - the adverse effects of climate change because they have lesser economic, political and legal clout. Therefore, supporting women’s empowerment and drawing on their experiences, knowledge and skills will make climate change responses more effective.|$|E

30|$|Cognizant of {{the gendered}} {{nature of the}} issue of climate change, it is now {{recognized}} that successful adaptation to climate change will require an acknowledgement of the gender dimension of climate change (Gurung and Mwanundu 2006). A <b>gendered</b> <b>approach</b> to climate change requires more than a set of disaggregated data showing that climate change has differential impact on women and men; also required is an understanding of existing inequalities between men and women and {{of the ways in which}} climate change can exacerbate these inequalities (Alyson et al. 2008). A <b>gendered</b> <b>approach</b> also requires taking into consideration such inequalities in developing climate change adaptation and mitigation policies (Homewood 2008), identifying the gendered inequality in vulnerability to climate (Carvajal-Escobar et al. 2008), and gender mainstreaming of any strategy or plan of action implemented to improve adaptation to climate change.|$|R

5000|$|GAD {{has been}} criticized for {{emphasizing}} the social {{differences between men and women}} while neglecting the bonds between them and also the potential for changes in roles. Another criticism is that GAD does not dig deeply enough into social relations and so may not explain how these relations can undermine programs directed at women. It also does not uncover the types of trade-offs that women are prepared to make for the sake of achieving their ideals of marriage or motherhood. Another criticism is that the GAD perspective is theoretically distinct from WID, but in practice, a program seem to have the element of the two. Whilst many development agencies are now committed to a <b>gender</b> <b>approach,</b> in practice, the primary institutional perspective remain focused on a WID approach. There is a slippage in reality where gender mainstreaming is often based in a single normative perspective as synonymous to women. [...] Development agencies still advance gender transformation to mean economic betterment for women.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} a discursive–sociological {{approach}} to study Europeanization is particularly apt for understanding the dynamics of policy change in Europe.

Challenging the limitations of Europeanization studies that only focus on convergence, the article explores the contribution that both Schmidt’s DI and discursive <b>gender</b> <b>approaches</b> make to the understanding of policy change in Europe. While seeing the two approaches as complementary in the study of Europeanization, the article discusses the added value of <b>gender</b> <b>approaches</b> for improving our understanding of policy change in Europe...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between religion and}} development remains a contentious issue, {{especially when it comes}} to the position of women in the Muslim world. Western and international <b>gender</b> <b>approaches</b> encounter the limits of their effectiveness and legitimacy for reasons that have as much to do with global political factors as well as contextual issues. Adequate <b>gender</b> <b>approaches</b> often require engagement with social actors and with the culture 'as they are', including religious actors, even if the values they espouse are often considered incompatible with international standards, or they do not correspond to the kinds of partners that many Western actors and local secular elites desire.

Through three case studies set in majority Muslim contexts characterised by a high degree of social mobility, this article looks into the question of how and to what extent Islamic faith-based aid organisations anticipate or tackle such challenges...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{competing}} appropriations of international women’s rights {{standards in the}} framework of the Moroccan Equity and Reconciliation Commission (ERC) and its follow-up projects. I argue that, even if the ERC’s <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> has been introduced as part of international models of transitional justice, it is geared toward earlier women’s rights and human rights activism, as well as to established state practices of at least selectively supporting women’s rights. Like political reform in general, the ERC and its <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> are an outcome of internal, long-time dynamics of change. Within the ERC’s politics of gender, there exists a tendency to depoliticize women’s rights activism in the process of reconciliation by making women a target for welfare measures and “human development. ” Yet, at the same time, the officially recognized <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> also allows for strategies to broaden the basis for women’s rights activism by making women’s experiences of violence during the “Years of Lead” (the period of fierce repression under the rule of Hassan II), an issue of concern {{in the framework of}} its new politics of memory.

40|$|In the Andean {{region of}} Latin America {{over one million}} {{adolescent}} girls get pregnant every year. Adolescent pregnancy (AP) {{has been associated with}} adverse health and social outcomes, but it has also been favorably viewed as a pathway to adulthood. AP can also be conceptualized as a marker of inequity, since it disproportionately affects girls from the poorest households and those who {{have not been able to}} attend school. Using results from a study carried out in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador, this paper explores APs and adolescents' sexual and reproductive health from a rights and <b>gender</b> <b>approach.</b> The paper points out the main features of a rights and <b>gender</b> <b>approach,</b> and how it can be applied to explore APs. Afterward it describes the methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) and main results of the study, framing the findings within the rights and <b>gender</b> <b>approach.</b> Finally, some implications that could be generalizable to global research on APs are highlighted. The application of the rights and gender framework to explore APs contributes to a more integral view of the issue. The rights and gender framework stresses the importance of the interaction between rights-holders and duty-bearers on the realization of sexual and reproductive rights, and acknowledges the importance of gender-power relations on sexual and reproductive decisions. A rights and <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> could lead to more integral and constructive interventions, and it could also be useful when exploring other sexual and reproductive health matters...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to consider genesis contradictions of <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> in modern education and training of children and possibilities of its application in an educational system during the newest period of the society development. Methods, results and scientific novelty. The retrospective analysis of the sources has shown that <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> isn’t new and not studied: on the contrary, separate education and training {{of boys and girls}} in the past was a norm and a duty of parents and teachers. However, the reflection of social processes shows the demolition of traditional system of gender stratification; weakening of women’s and men’s polarization of social roles; change of cultural stereotypes of masculinity and femininity; objective changes in the matrimonial relations. Everything listed above brings into focus an investigative search of new approaches to gender education. The essence of the terms «gender», «gender approach» is specified.

The {{aim is to}} assess the options and limitations of gender mainstreaming and the links with changing governance in healthcare in western countries. From the late 1960 s, the women's health movement was a forerunner of today's commonplaces of successful models of health reform. Women significantly advanced new policy approaches on user participation, a collaborative health workforce and better and safer information. This article traces these trajectories and the dynamics in healthcare systems.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to bridge the socio-technical divide in {{agricultural}} systems research by providing an approach that addresses marginalized groups, particularly rural women, and their access to and ownership of agricultural intensification processes. By revisiting social systems theory and the evolution of <b>gender</b> <b>approaches</b> in the CGIAR, the paper provides socio-spatial perspectives on gender supported by a landscape approach to innovation, agency and empowerment.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{formation}} of methodological tools for the study of social and political participation of women through a combination of conventional political analysis and <b>gender</b> <b>approach.</b> The analysis of Western scientific literature showed that the traditional political theory usually excluded women from the group of political subjects and attributed them to apolitical clusters. Consequently, the low level of women’s political participation and interest in politics were not considered a problem of scientific research. It is revealed that this problem has became the subject of scientific analysis of political science after the appearance of Gender Studies. Therefore, this methodological combination is determined by the subject of research because of two reasons: first of all, the issue of civil and political participation is the traditional problem of modern political science; secondly, in domestic political science in the analysis of social and political participation and representation there is almost no quantitative calculations based on sex. The use of <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> makes it possible to rethink and expand the traditional concept of political science to cover personal, subjective experience, along with the public, political activity and to offer the solution of social problems from the equality standpoint. The <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> is recognized as the most promising in combination with the traditional political analysis for further study of women’s social and political participation...|$|E

40|$|Early pregnancies, abortions, {{and sexually}} {{transmitted}} infections, including HIV/AIDS, result from risk behaviors {{that in the}} adolescents limit their opportunities {{for the development of}} an adequate life project and produce health affectations that on occasions vary according to the <b>gender</b> <b>approach.</b> A review of the researches on sexuality and its risks was made. The results showed that the sexual activity begins early in Cuba, at the ages of 14 - 15 years old, and that most of the adolescents do it without protection. There are gender differences in the perception of risks. Women consider that undesired pregnancy only concerns them. There is still a machista approach among male adolescents regarding sex, and they do not recognize abortion as a risky method to interrupt pregnancy. Although they are informed about the diverse topics of sexuality and their risks, the behaviors they follow do not correspond to it. It is concluded that in the strategies directed to improve their perceptions on the risks existing in sexual practices, it is necessary to strengthen those aspects connected with a responsible sexual behavior and, from a comprehensive perspective, to achieve the participation of both sexes in the design, planning and evaluation of the health actions directed with a <b>gender</b> <b>approach</b> and in the different setting...|$|E
