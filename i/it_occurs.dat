5|$|B.brownii occurs {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the Stirling Range <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is rare and endangered {{in its natural}} habitat, with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.|$|E

5|$|Some {{uncertainty}} {{exists in}} the distribution data for the spinner shark due to confusion with the blacktip shark. In the western Atlantic Ocean, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> from North Carolina to the northern Gulf of Mexico, including the Bahamas and Cuba, and from southern Brazil to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> from off North Africa to Namibia. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from South Africa and Madagascar, to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, to India and nearby islands, to Java and Sumatra. In the Pacific Ocean, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> off Japan, Vietnam, Australia, and possibly the Philippines. Parasitological evidence suggests that Indian Ocean spinner sharks have passed through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, becoming Lessepsian migrants.|$|E

It had been thought to occur in Western Australia, but these collections have been now referred to Ficus brachypoda.

5|$|Since 1996, the Yunnan hare {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.

Although the current state of its population trend is unclear, the Yunnan hare population is likely to be secure as <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> in remote areas in southwestern China. However, agricultural activities on mountainous regions may pose a threat to the species by isolating its mountain populations. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, nearly meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> in protected areas and also in the Changshanerhai, Daweishan, Gaoligongshan, Jinpingfenshuiling, Nujiang, Shilin, and Tongbiguan Nature Reserves.|$|E
