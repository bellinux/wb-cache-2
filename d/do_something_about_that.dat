25|$|Maynard {{joined in}} the logging {{activity}} at New York-Alki (later Seattle), {{near the mouth of}} the Duwamish River on Puget Sound. Instead of selling his wood to shippers at $4 a cord, he leased a vessel from Captain Felker, using the wood itself as security, and sold the load in San Francisco at ten times the price. With that money, he bought the fixings for a general store and briefly set up in competition to the only other such store on Puget Sound, which was in Olympia and owned by Catherine's brother. Mike soon agreed to his sister marrying Maynard, apparently on condition that they move the store to Duwamps and <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> prior marriage.|$|E

I warned him once that, if he did it again, awful things would happen to him, but he didn't believe me. I suppose, Jerry--what sort of a man is your friend, Mr. Smethurst?" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{plan to go}} {{to college}} thought, and I try to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> action, because I cannot simply command myself not to be afraid anymore (by means of {{rational}} decision). This is a direct relation between thought and action.|$|E

5000|$|Starr {{has spoken}} freely {{about the subject}} with the press. He told a reporter, [...] "I have notes from the Winter Meetings where the owners group and the players' {{association}} sat in meetings with the team physicians and team trainers. I was there. And team physicians stood up and said, 'Look, we need to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> this.

50|$|South America was an {{important}} neutral source of trade for the Axis forces; its importance would increase after the US entered the war. The Italian airline LATI operated a transatlantic service between Rome and Rio de Janeiro, which was a conduit for high value goods (platinum, mica, diamonds etc.), agents and diplomatic bags. London instructed BSC to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 1943 through 1945 Rowland {{served in}} World War II in the United States Army Air Corps, the 8th Air Force, 94th Bomb Group, 333rd Squadron, as a 1st Lieutenant, B17 (“Flying Fortress”) pilot. He was {{stationed}} in Bury St. Edmunds, England and made 22 combat missions over Nazi occupied territory. During that time {{he was awarded the}} Air Medal and several clusters. It was during those long, sometimes 12 hour missions, sitting in beastly uncomfortable seats, Rowland said, that “I resolved to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> if I ever returned home safely”.|$|E

50|$|Finally, the piper goes {{to collect}} his promised payment. The town leaders (who {{are in the middle}} of gorging {{themselves}} on food and wine) give him only a black button. The piper leaves angrily. Meanwhile, the jeweller is seen drinking and telling his sad tale of rejection to his friends, who decide to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That</b> night, they break into the woman's house as she is praying, rape and kill her (this is implied rather than shown). The piper comes, but this time he is too late - all that he can do is close the eyes of her horrified face.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} reasons Smeal {{decided to run for}} yet another term as President was not only due to the support of many other NOW members, but from her wish that NOW could be more outspoken, assertive, and {{publicly}} active on multiple different issues. These issues included abortion rights, on {{the role of women in}} the church, and the Vatican’s policy on reproduction. Smeal also noted that while Goldsmith was in power the organization lost its focus and membership declined and she wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Donaldson {{stated in}} Richard English's book, Armed Struggle: [...] "A {{big part of}} the {{motivation}} for me in becoming actively involved in politics was the deep sense of injustice that I felt had been perpetrated against my people and specifically against my family and I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> And that's why, at the age of 18, I did two things, I joined the Ulster Defence Regiment and I joined the Ulster Unionist Party, because I wanted to pursue, through the forces {{of the state and the}} forces of law and order, the IRA and to oppose their campaign. But I also wanted to be involved politically in opposing that campaign as well".|$|E

I think the first line might be about that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Klein {{notes that}} {{children}} are learning about sex {{no matter how hard}} the anti-sex crusaders try to keep it from them. [...] "The truth is children think about sex whether we want them to or not. Children don't need our help to think about sex ...There are groups {{of people out there who}} are devoted to scaring the heck out of Americans about sexuality ...It makes some people feel good because they say, 'Aha, there's the enemy and if only we could <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> everything would be better.' [...] " [...] It's a parenting issue, Klein told NPR, when children are viewing something that is made for adults. Parents need to educate their children and increase their sexual literacy, so that they understand that what they are seeing on the Internet is fantasy.|$|E
5000|$|Toby Kebbell stated {{he would}} only be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Doctor Doom if he joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Kebbell added [...] "Truth is, Doom is an incredible bad guy. They just keep trying to force him into the Fantastic Four...Doom is a monster, but you know my Doom was not, so theres that". Stan Lee (co-creator of the Fantastic Four) also expressed interest in the Fantastic Four, as well as the X-Men, returning to Marvel Studios stating, [...] "We should have all of our characters under Marvel. Remind me on my way home to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Well do our best." [...] However, Marvel Studios Kevin Feige stated in June 2017 that there were no plans of adding the Fantastic Four to the Marvel Cinematic Universe at that time.|$|E
5000|$|... "A lot of TV {{networks}} have realised that qualifying {{can be a}} highlight of the weekend. We had 30 countries taking live feed from Silverstone and the viewers were sitting there watching nothing. We have to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{and it will be}} discussed by the F1 commission.There are two potential solutions. One is to have an aggregate of the Friday and Saturday times, meaning that teams have to perform regardless, and the second is to have qualifying on Saturday only. It is just my opinion, but I'd prefer the second option. You could have timed sessions on Friday which did not count for the grid because, to me, Friday is a huge waste of time." [...] FIA President Max Mosley, commenting on problems with the existing qualifying format that were highlighted by the wet conditions on Saturday.|$|E
50|$|Moved by the concert’s message, {{the musicians}} {{began talking about}} using the {{connecting}} power of music not only to express the tragedy of war, but also to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That</b> summer, they visited Kosovo refugees in the Netherlands, singing and playing songs people knew and loved, making music with the children, providing musicians who had lost their instruments with replacements. A few months later, the group was in Sarajevo, Bosnia, performing and running music workshops with children in a refugee camp. In January 2000, they registered as a charitable foundation, under the name Musicians without Borders. Laura coordinated a small office, gradually reaching out to peace and human rights organizations and building a network of musicians, while raising funds and support for a new, innovative approach to peace building through music.|$|R
5000|$|I {{admire the}} rap and the break dancing {{and all the}} stuff coming out of hip hop. A lot of the records are {{messages}} that express community problems. Used right, those records could help prevent the riots of the sixties from happening again. If you know how a community feels about things, then you can <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it... <b>Thats</b> what my song [...] "Brother Rapp" [...] is all about. A fella is calling on his lady and protesting at the same time: [...] "Dont put me in jail before I {{get a chance to}} rap. Here what Im saying. When you see me on a soapbox out there complaining, dont lock me up. Sit down and join me." [...] And thats what Im saying about these records. Let em testify. Let the brothers rap.|$|R
50|$|After Gaugamela {{there is}} the first {{indication}} that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance {{as part of the}} entertainment. Curtius explains:"The following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them."Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That</b> he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion's tact and sympathy.Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.|$|R
50|$|After Yoshiharu informs to her, Goemon and Hanbei {{about the}} Incident at Hannon-ji, {{she begins to}} {{understand}} the truth about why Nobuna's plans were doomed and comes to admire Yoshiharu's resolve, noticing that he's got too much on his plate as it is, she decides to avoid telling him about Hanbei's illness and resolves to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> herself instead. She becomes so strong in this resolve that she ignores all warnings and goes to meet with Ukita Naoie {{in the hopes of}} bringing him to their side to relieve Hanbei's stress, as their plan involved forcing him to surrender anyway. This fails, of course, and she is imprisoned for several days with the condition of her freedom being Yamanaka Shikanosuke's surrender before the Mōri Clan's arrival or she will be executed. She's rescued by Yoshiharu and after she and Hanbei begin to recover from their respective conditions, they become nearly as close as sisters.|$|E
5000|$|Fitzcairn is {{introduced}} in the season one finale episode [...] "The Hunters" [...] (1993) as a ladies' man and bon vivant; he is first seen entering MacLeod's barge while MacLeod and his girlfriend Tessa Noël are sleeping together, and tells Tessa, [...] "Forgive me, my Lady... Hugh Fitzcairn... I was so taken with your loveliness." [...] Fitzcairn is actually worried about fellow Immortals disappearing unexpectedly. Darius is the next one, found beheaded in his chapel by MacLeod and Fitzcairn. While investigating, Fitzcairn is abducted by Darius' killers, the Hunters, led by James Horton, who tells him, [...] "you are an abomination before nature and {{in the eyes of}} man." [...] Even prisoner, Fitzcairn retorts, [...] "You know, you really should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> temper of yours. One of these days it's going to get you in terrible trouble." [...] Fitzcairn is fastened to a guillotine but MacLeod saves him at the last minute and Fitzcairn tells him, [...] "The women of the world thank you, my friend." [...] This episode also reveals that while Fitzcairn and MacLeod were in service to Duke diMilano in Italy in 1639, they first noticed the Watcher symbol that a Watcher disguised as a beggar wore on a pendant.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Adams {{began the}} new decade with roles in two films: the romantic comedy Leap Year and The Fighter, {{in which she}} portrayed Charlene Fleming, the {{aggressive}} and gritty girlfriend of boxer [...] "Irish" [...] Micky Ward. The Best Picture nominated film received critical praise for its actors in which Adams starred alongside Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Melissa Leo. Adams later said about being cast in The Fighter that the director, David O. Russell, said, [...] "'Oh you are so not a princess type - we'll have to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that!</b> I just want to expose that side of you, and give {{you the opportunity to}} shed the whole princess thing, because that isn't who you are - it's just one aspect of the work you've done." [...] She won acclaim for her work. Joe Morgenstern of Wall Street Journal wrote that she's [...] "as tough, tender, smart, and funny as she was ethereal and delightful in Enchanted. What an actress, and what range!" [...] For her role in The Fighter, Adams was nominated for the BAFTA Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, Golden Globe Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress losing the latter three awards to her co-star Leo. In 2011, she again worked with Disney, starring in the acclaimed film The Muppets alongside Jason Segel and The Muppets; in the film, she returned to singing.|$|E
40|$|Do {{you have}} an idea that could benefit your {{community}}? Is there a concern {{in the back of your}} mind that keeps nagging at you? Is there a law that needs updating, or a community problem <b>that</b> someone should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about?</b> Could <b>that</b> someone be you? Public concern about a policy issue develops over a period of time. Frequently, people become disturbed by a particular situation, which results in discussion, tension, and conflict that leads to a search for solutions. Many issues often surround a problem or concern. The terms “public issue ” and “public policy ” can be defined in several ways. A private problem or issue becomes public when consequences of individual or group action go beyond those directly involved. An effort by others to influence those consequences is also present. As more people become involved, leaders and interested citizens become aware of the concern. Discussion clarifies and defines the problem or opportunity—the gap between “what is ” and “what could be. ” The issue then emerges as differen...|$|R

5000|$|According to Clowes in a 2006 interview, [...] "Art School Confidential" [...] was {{literally}} something where I had four pages left (in Eightball 7) and I {{had to turn}} the issue in. I said, [...] "Well, I'll <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> art school <b>that</b> will amuse my 10 friends who went." [...] I really thought nobody else would comment on it or even notice. As it turned out, {{every single one of}} my readers was either in art school or had some affiliation with it. They all responded overwhelmingly (and) were all certain I had gone to the same art school they had. The story took {{on a life of its}} own for a while.… People would Xerox it and put it up on the bulletin board at school. Somebody else would take it from there and Xerox it again. There were rumors that it had been Xeroxed so many times that nobody could discern the art style anymore. It became a kind of folk art.|$|R
40|$|Arts {{agencies}} do see a {{role for}} themselves in the rejuvenation process. With good reason. The impact of the arts can be far-reaching - where governments {{tend to focus on}} infrastructure issues, the arts are more concerned about how people in communities connect - or, in some cases, why they fail to connect. We aim to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> by promoting social cohesion and reconciliation; as a window onto deep-seated problems and how communities can start to resolve them; in boosting economies; and especially, and critically, in helping sustain local and regional identity. For the past decade, the Australia Council has worked closely with the Australian Local Government Association, promoting community arts and cultural development as a core function of local government. That dialogue is critical in determining the issues we are dealing with, in getting the disenfranchised involved, animating democracy, helping to create new identities from people and cultures who have come in from elsewhere - often {{from the other side of}} the planet...|$|E
40|$|Extract] The {{old world}} of the Atlantic seaboard is attrophying and the {{countries}} of the Pacific rim signal the dynamics of the future. That is the qualified hypothesis underlying People of the Pacific Century, a series of six programmes originally broadcast by the BBC on its domestic Radio 4 and later in the World Service. The first programme begins with former Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, alleging a lack of understanding by Europe of his part of the world whereupon Mary Goldring, the series presenter, informs listeners that the six programmes "attempt to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> lack of understanding; to face the real possibility that the world's axis has shifted from the old west centred on the Atlantic to the new world centred on the Pacific. " Lest there be doubts of the shift, listeners are told by Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister that the old world looks "tired" and "directionless", by an American aircraft salesman that the former beneficent "Dad" of Europe is "a little senile now" and by a Harvard Business School don that the Japanese believe "Europe is dead" and see the United States as less vigorous now that Japan sells the most and best automobiles. Thus, through the series, does Mary Goldring alternate with the edited contributions of public and not-so-public Pacific people to develop the theme of the first programme, aptly titled "Seeds of Change"...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} soften the coming blow of a credit collapse, a group of {{concerned}} citizens has decided to establish, in the year 2007, the Gold Standard University Live, home {{for the study of}} monetary issues placed under taboo by other institutions of higher learning. Here is a partial list of forbidden research topics. 1. What is a gold standard? A gold standard is a mechanism whereby people exercise their God-given right to create or extinguish money, while denying monopoly power of money-creation to would-be crooks. The individual, if he thinks that money is scarce, or the rate of interest is too high, can do something about it. He can take old jewelry or newly mined gold to the Mint and convert it into the coin of the realm free of seigniorage charges. If the individual thinks that money is too plentiful, or the rate of interest is too low, he can <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> too. He can melt down his coins or export them, and he can divert the flow of new gold from the mines away from the Mint, say, into jewelrymaking. Note carefully that in establishing a monetary system for the new country the U. S. Constitution did not make provisions for a central bank. It made provisions for a Mint. 2. Why is there no bond speculation under a gold standard...|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Ham began {{teaching}} {{at a high}} school in Brisbane where he met John Mackay, another teacher who believed in young Earth creationism. According to Susan and William Trollinger, Ham was [...] "appalled by {{the fact that some of}} his students assumed their textbooks that taught evolutionary science successfully proved the Bible to be untrue," [...] and he said the experience [...] "put a fire in my bones to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the influence <b>that</b> evolutionary thinking was having on students and the public as a whole." [...] In 1979, he resigned his teaching position and, with his wife, founded Creation Science Supplies and Creation Science Educational Media Services, which provided resources related to creationism to the public schools of Queensland, which were legally required to teach both creationism and evolution. In 1980, the Hams and Mackay merged the two organizations with Carl Wielands Creation Science Association to form the Creation Science Foundation (CSF).|$|R
500|$|Uhls {{described}} {{the film as}} a [...] "romantic comedy", explaining, [...] "It {{has to do with}} the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them—because both characters are out on the edge psychologically." [...] The Narrator seeks intimacy, but he avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her. While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he instead embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler Durden. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler Durden, but he becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring. Tyler also suggests <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Marla, implying <b>that</b> she is a risk to be removed. When Tyler says this, the Narrator realizes that his desires should have been focused on Marla and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.|$|R

Díaz had a suspended arrest warrant, had freedom benefits for supposedly being ill, but he wasn't detained. Then they have to be clear on that, we should not be tricked: nothing is going to happen to Mr. Diomedes for his prison escape because basically it never existed... Also, besides that Diomedes has a process for narcotics (Law 30) that he is supposed to follow and be strong, because it is said that the death of Doris Adriana was because of drugs overdose.
