5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E
5|$|The Einstein field {{equations}} are nonlinear {{and very}} difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution {{laid the groundwork for}} the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner–Nordström solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.|$|E

Today's {{view of the}} gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms {{part of what is}} referred to as behavioural genetics. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> bodies can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of our minds and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.|$|E

On the domestic scene, Argentina has an U15 league and an U19 league. There is also the Development Cup and Third Division, which is largely made up of junior players. The winter months include U13 and U11 leagues for boys and girls. Argentina also has an annual international competition called the Pampero Festival <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> U17s compete against teams from South Africa, Australia and England. There are also an annual U15 series against Chile, while the first South American U13 championship took place in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis {{represents}} an excellent therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.|$|E

The commentary for the Our Friends in the North entry on the BFI website {{described it as a}} [...] "powerful and evocative drama series... The series impressed with its ambition, humanity and willingness to see the ambiguities beyond the rhetoric." [...] The serial was also included in an alphabetical list of the 40 greatest TV shows published by the Radio Times magazine in August 2003, chosen by their television editor Alison Graham.

W.T.R. Martin wrote in the American Journal of Numismatics, [...] "The general effect is pleasing, of the three the Dime is to many the most attractive piece. The head of Liberty is dignified, but although the silly story has been started that the profile is that of a 'reigning belle' of New York, she can hardly be called a beauty; there is a suggestion... of the classic heads on some of the Roman coins, and a much stronger suggestion of the head on the French Francs of 1871 and onward... these coins are an advance on what has hitherto been accomplished, but there is yet a long distance between them and the ideal National coin." ...|$|E

[...] This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government's concerns with the XXL sandwich line. The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich. In response to the government's claims, Burger King replied in a statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> customers' taste trumps all."

500|$|According to Jewish Law, one is {{obligated to}} grieve and rend one's garment upon visiting the Western Wall {{and seeing the}} desolate site of the Temple. Bach (17th century) instructs that [...] "when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are {{situated}} in the Western Wall, which is the wall King David built, he should recite: Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord". Some scholars write that rending one's garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control. Others disagree, pointing {{to the fact that}} the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim waqf and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress. If one hasn't seen the Wall for over 30 days, the prevailing custom is to rend one's garments, but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals. According to Donneal Epstein, a person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite: [...] "Our Holy Temple, which was our glory, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> forefathers praised You, was burned and all of our delights were destroyed".|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the 2006 introduction of the BK XXL product line in Spain, the Spanish Health Ministry publicly claimed {{that the company had}} violated a voluntary agreement between the company and the Spanish Federation of Hoteliers and Restaurateurs, a group to which Burger King belongs, that called on its members to refrain from advertising large portions of food. The Minister of Health, Elena Salgado, claimed that the new promotion and the new sandwiches, averaging over 970 calories each, violated the accord. The head of Spain's food regulatory body, Felix Lobo, stated a legal case could be made against Burger King for [...] "illegally failing to comply with a contract". In a {{response to}} the Government's allegations, the European offices of Burger King released this statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company also explained that it had always worked [...] "to reduce the risk of illness provoked by an inadequate diet and to promote a balanced... diet." [...] A spokesperson for the company stated that customers have the choice of salads versus a Whopper, that they have the option to modify their sandwiches as they please, and that the company was going to continue to advertising the products.|$|E
500|$|Immanuel Kant, {{a central}} figure of the Age of Enlightenment, {{likewise}} claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: [...] "the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection." [...] The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's categorical imperative: [...] "act only according to that maxim by which you can {{at the same time}} will that it should become a universal law." [...] Kant considered critical conscience to be an internal court <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss. Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical examination of Rousseau's work considered that conscience was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; [...] "the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{objection}} {{seems to}} rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon {{the concept of a}} rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). [...] It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is no sense in which Kant makes ethics [...] "dependent" [...] upon anything which has not always existed. [...] Furthermore, the sense <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>our</b> wills are subject to the law is precisely that if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to moral judgments we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term [...] "autonomy" [...] into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is precisely the kind of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God {{has no choice but to}} conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but do not determine their content through contingent acts of will.|$|E
