25|$|ESC {{incorporates}} {{yaw rate}} control into the {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS). Yaw is a rotation around the vertical axis; i.e. spinning left or right. Anti-lock brakes enable ESC to brake individual wheels. Many ESC systems also incorporate a traction control system (TCS or ASR), which senses <b>drive-wheel</b> slip under acceleration and individually brakes the slipping wheel or wheels and/or reduces excess engine power until control is regained. However, ESC serves a different purpose from that of ABS or Traction Control.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the other bicyclist is revealed by the rear wheel {{to the left of}} the canvas. Metzinger's painting appears to show the handlebars in two positions, but the handlebars along with sections of the bicycle frame are actually superimposed as a transparency (over the left hand, left foot of the cyclist and over the <b>drive-wheel),</b> representing two consecutive frames, one subtracted from the other, i.e., the road is visible 'through' the racer where the bicycle had been a fraction of a second earlier, as if to show motion through absence. With this type of game playing with contradictory visual codes (positive and negative space), Metzinger discerns the past and the present infinitesimally separated in time; while the perception of the future is left to the intellectual discretion of the observer to contemplate.|$|E
5000|$|Bicycle chain, {{transfers}} {{power from}} the pedals to the <b>drive-wheel</b> of a bicycle, thus propelling it ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason is}} to {{intentionally}} reduce power and/or torque to improve traction in sub-optimal road conditions. For example, applying full engine {{power to the}} <b>drive-wheels</b> on wet or icy roads may cause the wheels to slip. Likewise, short shifting can help maintain vehicle stability through bends by avoiding an unsettling shift in balance mid-corner.|$|R
50|$|Charles B. Brooks, an African American {{man from}} Newark, New Jersey, invented the U.S.' first {{self-propelled}} street sweeper truck. Brooks' patent was approved on March 17, 1896; his application for the patent had been filed on April 20, 1895. His street sweeper had a truck-like frame mounted on axles supported by wheels. There are <b>drive-wheels</b> for the sweeping, elevator mechanisms, and an endless chain that travels around a sprocket-wheel and travels {{up to an}} additional sprocket-wheel. The patent drawings go on to explain the complete composition of the invention. The truck had brushes attached to the front fender which would revolve. These revolving brushes could interchange with a flat scraper for use on snow and ice.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acceleration slip regulation (ASR) system for four-wheel drive (4 WD) electric vehicles, which {{are driven by}} {{the front and rear}} axles simultaneously. The ASR control strategy includes three control modes: average distribution of inter-axle torque, optimal distribution of inter-axle torque and independent control of optimal slip rate, respectively, which are designed based on the torque adaptive principle of inter-axle differential and sliding mode control theory. Furthermore, in order to accurately describe the longitudinal tyre force characteristic, a slip rate calculation formula {{in the form of a}} state equation was used for solving the numerical problem posed by the traditional way. A simulation was carried out with the MATLAB/Simulink software. The simulation results show that the proposed ASR system can fully use the road friction condition, inhibit the <b>drive-wheels</b> from slipping, and improve the vehicle longitudinal driving stability...|$|R
50|$|During a turn, {{the weight}} of the vehicle shifts away from the inner radius and to the outer radius, {{therefore}} the inner <b>drive-wheel</b> will often lose traction on hard cornering, and especially when accelerating through a curve. Locking differentials and limited slip differentials modify the manner in which torque is distributed to the wheels to reduce wheelspin and improve traction in situations where it is limited.|$|E
50|$|The {{running gear}} {{consisted}} of two bogies. In both bogies three drive-axles and a jackshaft were installed. The center <b>drive-wheel</b> had a side play of 2x25 mm. At the outer side of each bogie an idle-axle was mounted. This idle-axle was designed as an Adams axle and had a side-play of 2x31 mm relative to the bogie. Small cabinets were mounted on the outer part of the bogie frames.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were several}} {{mechanisms}} {{available to him}} for converting rotary motion into sinusoidal motion. One of them {{is shown in the}} schematic (right). A rotating <b>drive-wheel</b> is fitted with an off-center peg. A shaft with a horizontally-slotted section is free to move vertically up and down. The wheel's off-center peg is located in the slot. As a result, when the peg moves around with the wheel, it can make the shaft move up and down within limits. This arrangement shows that when the <b>drive-wheel</b> rotates uniformly, say clockwise, the shaft moves sinusoidally up and down. The vertical position of the center of the slot, at any time , can then be expressed as, where [...] is the radial distance from the wheel's center to the peg, [...] is {{the rate at which the}} wheel turns (in radians per unit of time), and [...] is the starting phase angle of the peg, measured in radians from the 12 o'clock position to the angular position where the peg was at time zero.|$|E

Anti-lock brakes enable ESC to brake individual wheels.

5000|$|A {{screw press}} {{is a type}} of machine press in which the ram is driven up and down by a screw. The screw shaft can be driven by a handle or a wheel. It works by using a coarse screw to convert the {{rotation}} of the handle or <b>drive-wheel</b> into a small downward movement of greater force. The overhead handle usually incorporates balls as flyweights. The weights helps to maintain the momentum and thrust of the tool {{to make it easier to}} operate.|$|E
50|$|In {{off road}} and low-traction situations, the RR layout has some {{advantages}} {{compared to other}} 2WD layouts. The weight is biased towards the driven wheels- as with FF vehicles. This both improves <b>drive-wheel</b> traction and reduces the tendency for the undriven wheels to dig in. In addition, the driving and steering requirements are split between front and rear- as with FR vehicles- making it less likely for either to lose traction. Many dune buggies successfully use a Volkswagen beetle as the donor car for this reason. The relative simplicity and light weight compared to 4WD can therefore sometimes outweigh the disadvantage of only having two driven wheels.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the safety}} bicycle, {{bicycles}} {{did not have}} chains and the pedals were typically attached directly to the <b>drive-wheel,</b> thus limiting top speed by {{the diameter of the}} wheel and resulting in designs with front wheels as large as possible. Various linkage mechanisms were invented to raise the effective gear ratio, but with limited success. Using chain drive allowed the mechanical advantage between the drive and driven sprockets to determine the maximum speed, thereby enabling manufacturers {{to reduce the size of}} the driving wheel for safety. It also allowed for the development of variable gearing, allowing cyclists to adjust their gearing on the fly, to terrain or road inclination and their strength, obtaining an efficient and workable cadence at various speeds.|$|E
5000|$|To compute {{those terms}} the USCGS {{designers}} incorporated the same [...] "slotted yoke crank" [...] approach for mechanically computing cosines as Thomson used, {{shown in the}} schematic (right). A rotating <b>drive-wheel</b> ("crank") is fitted with an off-center peg. A shaft with a horizontally-slotted section is free to move vertically up and down. The wheel's off-center peg {{is located in the}} slot. As a result, when the peg moves around with the wheel, it makes the shaft move up and down within limits. As a result of this arrangement when the <b>drive-wheel</b> rotates uniformly, say clockwise, the shaft moves sinusoidally up and down. The vertical position of the center of the slot, at any time , can then be expressed as , where [...] is the radial distance from the wheel's center to the peg, [...] is {{the rate at which the}} wheel turns (in radians per unit of time) and is determined by gears, and [...] is the starting phase angle of the peg, measured in radians from the 12 o'clock position to the angular position where the peg was at time zero. An operator adjusted the location of each pin based on the empirically computed parameters for a portâ€™s tides. This arrangement makes a physical analog of just one term in the tide equation. Old Brass Brains computes 37 such terms.The USCGS designers also adopted from the earlier British machines the approach of summing terms by passing a chain over and under pulleys attached to the vertically oscillating yokes. The amount of chain remaining after passing over and under pulleys indicated the sum of the terms. For example, a large value for a term would move its pulley further from a neutral position, deflecting the chain, and reducing the amount of excess chain remaining in system.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of the other bicyclist is revealed by the rear wheel {{to the left of}} the canvas. Metzinger's painting appears to show the handlebars in two positions, but the handlebars along with sections of the bicycle frame are actually superimposed as a transparency (over the left hand, left foot of the cyclist and over the <b>drive-wheel),</b> representing two consecutive frames, one subtracted from the other, i.e., the road is visible 'through' the racer where the bicycle had been a fraction of a second earlier, as if to show motion through absence. With this type of game playing with contradictory visual codes (positive and negative space), Metzinger discerns the past and the present infinitesimally separated in time; while the perception of the future is left to the intellectual discretion of the observer to contemplate.|$|E
