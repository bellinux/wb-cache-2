25|$|The {{main engines}} are {{connected}} to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear manufactured in Finland by Valmet Rautpohja Works in co-operation with Renk AG. The gearbox is equipped with separate Renk multi disc clutches and Voith fluid couplings for the main engines. The hydrodynamic couplings that allow over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} are used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The gearbox itself is also designed to withstand the <b>high</b> <b>thrust</b> and torque loads caused by an open propeller operating in ice — the gear teeth are dimensioned to withstand loads up to five times the nominal value. The fully locking mechanical clutches are used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship is operating in open water or light ice conditions.|$|E
25|$|F-106A : (Convair Model 8-24) Improved {{version of}} the F-102. Fitted with the MA-1 Integrated Fire Control System with SAGE datalink, J-75 {{afterburning}} turbojet, enlarged intake, variable-geometry inlet ramps and shortened intake ducts, refined fuselage shape, modified wings and redesigned tailfin; tailpipe fitted with a device to reduce the tendency of the jet exhaust to blow unsecured objects around while taxiing, yet allowing virtually maximum performance at <b>high</b> <b>thrust</b> settings including afterburner. Performance was deemed unsatisfactory and modifications were made. The aircraft was capable of low supersonic speeds without afterburner (but with a significant range penalty) and had a maximum altitude at least 57,000ft. Many were fitted with a conically-cambered wing for improved takeoff, supersonic and high-altitude flight. To improve the aircraft's range the aircraft was fitted with two streamlined external supersonic tanks that still kept the aircraft capable of sustained roll rates of 100 degrees per second. Since these tanks produced virtually no significant performance degradation they were rarely jettisoned and were routinely carried around. After 1972, many F-106s were refitted with a new canopy featuring improved visibility, improved optic sights and provision for a gunpack in the center weapons bay.|$|E

25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, <b>high</b> <b>thrust</b> engines.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, CFMI {{began work}} on a new, double-annular combustor. Instead of having just one {{combustion}} zone, the double-annular combustor has a second combustion zone that is used at <b>high</b> <b>thrust</b> levels. This design lowers the emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The first CFM56 engine with the double-annular combustor entered service in 1995, and the combustor is used on [...] "Tech Insertion" [...] CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B variants.|$|E
500|$|The SEPECAT Jaguar {{is powered}} by the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour {{turbofan}} engine, which was developed in parallel and primarily for the Jaguar. A separate partnership was formed between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca to develop the Adour, a two-shaft turbofan engine equipped with afterburners. Twin engines were selected for survivability; ease of maintenance was a major consideration, an engine change being possible within 30 minutes. For the Jaguars it needed a high bypass capable of <b>high</b> <b>thrust</b> for take off, supersonic flight and low level [...] "dashes".|$|E

500|$|The {{aircraft}} used reheat (afterburners) at take-off and to {{pass through}} the upper transonic regime and to supersonic speeds, between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7. The afterburners were switched off at all other times. Due to jet engines being highly inefficient at low speeds, Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel (almost 2% of the maximum fuel load) taxiing to the runway. Fuel used is Jet A-1. Due to the <b>high</b> <b>thrust</b> produced even with the engines at idle, only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing and less brake pad wear - at low weights after landing, the aircraft would not remain stationary with all four engines idling [...] requiring the brakes to be continuously applied to prevent the aircraft from rolling.|$|E
500|$|Airlines have {{reported}} 32 events involving sudden instability of thrust, {{at various points}} during flight, including <b>high</b> <b>thrust</b> settings during climb to altitude. The problem has been long-standing. In 1998, two 737 pilots reported that their engine throttles suddenly increased to full thrust during flight. A very recent investigation {{has led to the}} tentative conclusion that the problem originates in the Hydromechanical unit, and may involve an unacceptable level of fuel contamination (with water, or particulate matter, including biodegradable material that create solids in the fuel), or overuse of biocides to reduce bacterial growth. Boeing told Aviation Week and Space Technology that CFM International had revised its FADEC software. The new software [...] "...'reduces the duration and degree of thrust-instability events' by cycling the fuel monitoring valve (FMV) and the EHSV (electrohydraulic servo unit) to clean the EHSV spool." [...] This software fix is not intended to be a definitive solution to the problem; CFM claimed that no further reports have reached it after this change was made.|$|E

50|$|Compared to propellers, {{jet engines}} can provide much <b>higher</b> <b>thrust,</b> <b>higher</b> speeds and, above about 40000 ft, greater efficiency. They are also much more {{fuel-efficient}} than rockets. As a consequence nearly all large, high-speed or high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.|$|R
2500|$|Thus jet engines, with {{a better}} match between speed and jet exhaust speed (such as turbofans—in spite of their worse [...] )—dominate for subsonic and {{supersonic}} atmospheric use, while rockets work best at hypersonic speeds.

6000|$|Take as {{an example}} that into which we rowed that day in Monos, as the old Spaniards named it, from monkeys long since extinct; a curved shingle beach some fifty yards across, shut in right and left by steep rocks wooded down almost to the sea, and worn into black caves and crannies, festooned with the night-blowing Cereus, which crawls about with hairy green legs, like a tangle of giant spiders. [...] Among it, in the cracks, upright Cerei, like {{candelabra}} twenty and thirty feet <b>high,</b> <b>thrust</b> themselves aloft into the brushwood.

Tufts of Karatas, top, spread their long prickly leaves among the bush of 'rastrajo,' or second growth after the primeval forest has been cleared, which dips suddenly right and left to the beach. [...] It, and the little strip of flat ground behind it, hold a three- roomed cottage--of course on stilts; a shed {{which serves as a}} kitchen; a third ruined building, which is tenanted mostly by lizards and creeping flowers; some twenty or thirty coconut trees; and on {{the very edge of the}} sea an almond-tree, its roots built up to seaward with great stones, its trunk hung with fishing lines; and around it, scattered on the shingle, strange shells, bits of coral, coconuts and their fragments; almonds from the tree; the round scaly fruit of the Mauritia palm, which has probably floated across the gulf from the forests of the Orinoco or the Caroni; and the long seeds of the mangrove, in shape like a roach-fisher's float, and already germinating, their leaves showing at the upper end, a tiny root at the lower. In that shingle they will not take root: but they are quite ready to go to sea again next tide, and wander on for weeks, and for hundreds of miles, till they run ashore at last on a congenial bed of mud, throw out spider legs right and left, and hide the foul mire with their gay green leaves.|$|E
