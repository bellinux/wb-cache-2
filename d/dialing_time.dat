40|$|Interface {{design has}} an {{important}} impact on user performance. While some features of telephone interfaces have become relatively standardized (such as {{the layout of the}} keypad), there are other design features that can affect the way users interact with these interfaces. These features include the overall size of the interface and the size and labels of buttons. We look at several prototype telephone interfaces with a variety of tools for automatic testing. Several analyses are presented. The first analysis uses Fitts ’ Law to determine the minimum possible usage time. Fitts ’ Law provided a quick analysis of the telephones but did not consider any factors other than target sizes and distances. The second analysis uses a cognitive model to make predictions about other factors such as visual search. The model used an organized search strategy that produced similar behavior to the experiment subjects but failed for a few extreme interfaces. Although the model <b>dialing</b> <b>time</b> predictions are too high, we propose that this model is worth paying attention to because the <b>dialing</b> <b>time</b> orderings among phones and number of fixations closely follows the observed data. The third analysis uses a human experiment to test the predictions with reaction times and eye-tracking data. The experiment subjects were able to easily cope with these differences and retain an organized strategy, but the mode...|$|E
40|$|The Problem. The driving task {{involves}} {{a host of}} relevant cognitive, perceptual, and motor abilities. Cognitive architectures—frameworks for modeling human cognition and behavior—have evolved to integrate known theories of human cognition into unified theories that account {{for a wide range}} of cognitive phenomena. Role of Driving Simulators. Models of driver behavior based on cognitive architectures can be linked into driving simulators to act as virtual drivers, using simulated perceptual and motor processes to drive in the simulator environment. Typically, the output of these virtual drivers is analogous to that for human drivers, thus facilitating comparison between model and human data. Key Results of Driving Simulator Studies. This chapter highlights one model in particular developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. This driver model has been shown to account for several important aspects of driver behavior, particularly in the context of curve negotiation and lane changing. Scenarios and Dependent Variables. The ACT-R driver model can be placed in various environments with driving as the only task or with driving while performing another secondary task (such as dialing a cellular phone). The model’s simulation output includes predictions of both driver behavior as well as behavior on the secondary task (e. g., total <b>dialing</b> <b>time).</b> Platform Specificity and Equipment Limitations. The ACT-R driver model currently runs on a Macintosh platform and LISP environment. However, a recent Java re-implementation of the model within the Distract-R prototyping system has made the model more widely available on a range of platforms, in addition to facilitating its use by non-modeling designers and practitioners. 1.

40|$|Legislators, journalists, and {{researchers}} alike have recently directed {{a great deal}} of attention to the effects of cellular telephone (&quot;cell phone&quot;) use on driver behavior and performance. This paper demonstrates how cognitive modeling can aid in understanding these effects by predicting the impact of cell-phone dialing in a naturalistic driving task. We developed models of four methods of cell-phone dialing and integrated these models with an existing driver model of steering and speed control. By running this integrated model, we generated a priori predictions for how each dialing method affects the accuracy of steering and speed control with respect to an accelerating and braking lead vehicle. The model predicted that the largest effects on driver performance arose for dialing methods with high visual demand rather than methods with long <b>dialing</b> <b>times.</b> We validated several of the model's predictions with an empirical study in a fixed-based driving simulator...|$|R

The flux instrumental errors decrease linearly with the standard deviation of the CO 2 data, as expected. Although turbulent fluctuations of CO 2 are negligible {{with respect to the}} mean (0. 1 %), we show that the eddy-covariance method can provide 2 -h, 150 -m range resolved CO 2 flux estimates as long as the CO 2 mixing ratio instrumental error is no greater than 10 ppm and the vertical velocity error is lower than the natural fluctuations over a time resolution of 10 s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to compare the {{fundamental}} operative provisions of the U. S.

The specific provisions being compared relate to the ability to monitor the content of individual communications within the nation state or citizens outside territorial borders. The author is not greatly concerned at this point with the procedure required before interceptions of noncitizens outside the country as under U. S. law this is not limited in a manner that endangers the nation. Foreign residents outside the country are not protected by the Fourth Amendment and thus there are less obstructive regulations.

Metadata does not include content. Although the provisions of the USA Freedom Act will increase the burden on the government by directing that this data be stored with the separate telecommunications providers instead of NSA, the threat posed by these provisions is minor compared to the dangers created by the restraints of the FISA statute on the ability of the government to intercept citizens and communications domestically.
