Hence, it is a common practice to install Feed-Effluent Heat Exchangers (FEHEs) around reactors and distillation columns to recover energy. The bypass control for process to process exchanger is common used for heat recovery within a process and it is essential to design a control strategy for process associate with energy integration. However, the control performance will be degraded in real applications as the existence of external disturbances. Thus, the dynamic responses of the bypass location and control point under disturbances should be considered.

40|$|Control {{structure}} design traditionally involves two steps of selections, namely {{the selection of}} controlled and manipulated variables and the selection of pairings interconnecting these variables.

40|$|Abstract The <b>hydrodealkylation</b> {{process of}} toluene (HDA) {{has been used}} as a case study in a large number of control studies.

Therefore {{it is essential}} to evaluate occupational health aspect during the process design. Early evaluation of safety, health, and environmental (SHE) performance is advantageous, since the opportunities to make the process inherently benign are greater and the cost therefore lower.

40|$|The {{well-known}} benchmark {{process for}} <b>hydrodealkylation</b> of toluene (HDA) to produce benzene is revisited in a multi-objective approach for identifying environmentally friendly and cost-effective operation solutions. The paper {{begins with the}} presentation of the numerical tools used in this work, i. e., a multi-objective genetic algorithm and a Multiple Choice Decision Making procedure. Then, two studies related to the energy source involved in the utility production system (UPS), either fuel oil or natural gas, of the HDA process are carried out. In each case, a multi-objective optimization problem based on the minimization of the total annual cost of the process and of five environmental burdens, that are Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential, Human Toxicity Potential and Eutrophication Potential, is solved and the best solution is identified by use of Multiple Choice Decision Making procedures. An assessment of the respective contribution of the HDA process and the UPS towards environmental impacts on the one hand, and of the environmental impacts generated by the main equipment items of the HDA process on the other hand is then performed to compare both solutions. This ‘‘gate-to-gate’’ environmental study is then enlarged by implementing a ‘‘cradle-togate’’ Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), for accounting of emission inventory and extraction.

The environmental aspect at the preliminary design phase of chemical processes is quantified by using a set of metrics or indicators following the guidelines of sustainability concepts proposed by. The resulting multiobjective problem is solved by a genetic algorithm following an improved variant of the so-called NSGA II algorithm. A key point for evaluating environmental burdens {{is the use of}} the package ARIANE™, a decision support tool dedicated to the management of plants utilities (steam, electricity, hot water, etc.) and pollutants (CO 2, SO 2, NO, etc.), implemented here both to compute the primary energy requirements of the process and to quantify its pollutant emissions.

40|$|Many {{reactions}} {{carried out}} in the chemical industry are exothermic. The heat liberated by the reaction is often transferred to another medium such as steam by heat exchange. This heat can then be used elsewhere or be used to generate power via a steam cycle. In this work the focus is on another method of reaction heat recovery. When an exothermic reaction is conducted at elevated pressures, a turbine expander can be placed directly behind the reactor. The hot, high-pressure product gas from the reactor can then be expanded in the turbine. During the expansion process the physical energy of the product gas is converted to kinetic energy (or electricity if the turbine is connected to a generator). Three chemical processes were studied to determine the feasibility of turbine integration into the processes. They are ethylene oxide production, phthalic anhydride production and the <b>hydrodealkylation</b> of alkylaromatic compounds. The chosen processes differ in terms of reactor operation, reactant conversion as well as {{the presence or absence of}} recycle loops. Simulation models were developed for the mentioned processes with the process simulator Aspen Plus®. Results from the simulations show that, without the turbine, the processes require power from external sources. They can however operate independently from external power sources when a turbine is present. Excess power can be exported or used for electricity generation. It is therefore feasible• to incorporate turbine expansion units in all the processes considered. The operating conditions of some unit operations have to be changed to accommodate the turbine expander. With the additional product namely power, a re-evaluation of all the operating conditions and tradeoffs in the process is necessary. Further investigation into the impact of turbine integration on the optimal operating conditions of the process is therefore recommended. Traditional definitions used to evaluate the performance of a process generating or consuming power, were found to be inadequate for use in processes where power and chemicals are produced together. New performance parameters are required for the evaluation of processes where power and chemicals are produced simultaneously. An exergy analysis was performed for one of the cases. This analysis method provides insight as to where thermodynamic losses occur in a process. The exergy analysis was useful to quantify the losses occurring in an isenthalpic expansion valve, and the savings obtained by replacing such a valve with an expansion turbine.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{progress}} in chemical reaction engineering and highly active, multi-functional catalysts, the activation of relatively inert alkanes may be achieved. The direct use of short-chain alkanes, especially methane and ethane, as basic chemical feedstocks represents an attractive alternative to alkenes. Significant reserves of alkanes {{are found in}} nature {{in the form of}} wet natural gas, whereas alkenes have to be synthesized via other chemical reactions. The activation of alkanes can be achieved by oxidative and non-oxidative methods. Reactions of oxidative activation are often thermodynamically favored, e. g., due to formation of the stable but economically unattractive by-products water and/or carbon dioxide. In contrast, reactions of non-oxidative activation may produce hydrogen as a valuable by-product, but the equilibrium conversions of such reactions are generally low, and thus, measures have been taken to improve this situation, e. g., shifting equilibrium by removing a product. The alkylation of aromatics with alkanes, in particular, represents a potential new route for the synthesis of important feedstock chemicals such as n-propylbenzene and cumene, ethyltoluenes, and ethylbenzene. Estimates for current worldwide annual production capacities of ethylbenzene and cumene, the two most important chemicals produced by alkylation of aromatics, amount to 25 · 106 t·a- 1 and 10 · 106 t·a- 1, respectively. Conventional alkylating agents, including alkenes, alcohols and alkyl halides, have to be pre-synthesized via other processes, typically from an alkane feedstock. Alternatively, the direct alkylation of aromatics with alkanes may result in reduced costs and process intensification, since alkanes are much cheaper than other typical alkylating agents, abundantly available and pre-synthesis steps can be avoided. Therefore, the focus of the present work has been the heterogeneously catalyzed activation of ethane by direct application of ethane as an alkylating agent during toluene dehydroalkylation to ethyltoluenes on noble metal-loaded zeolite catalysts. Due to the thermodynamic stability of ethane, the desired reaction is strongly limited by equilibrium. Therefore, during the present work efforts were concentrated on experimental work in conjunction with theoretical modeling in order to better understand and hence improve the yield to the title reaction. The effect of pressure was investigated by a non-ideal gas model complemented by kinetic assumptions. At 300 °C, the thermodynamic model is in agreement with experimental results. However, at 350 °C conversions are well over the expected values calculated from the same model. The “supra-equilibrium” {{may be due to the}} formation of hydrogen-rich methane, acting as a hydrogen sink, hence shifting equilibrium towards the formation of ethyltoluenes. This was attributed to the consumption of hydrogen as a result of methane formation. Since methane is mainly formed by consumption of hydrogen, i. e., it is a secondary reaction, the space velocity was varied to improve selectivity to the title reaction. At a high space velocity, the formation of methane can be entirely avoided. Furthermore, the disproportionation of toluene is also absent, resulting in 100 % selectivity to ethyltoluenes and hydrogen. Decreasing the space velocity results in an increase in conversions as well as the yield of ethyltoluenes. However, at space velocities lower than about 3. 0 h- 1, the selectivity to ethyltoluenes decreases since the toluene disproportionation reaction can compete with the dehydroalkylation reaction. With increasing conversion, C 1 to C 4 alkanes are also formed to a larger extent, as well as other aromatics including benzene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene. A maximum yield of ethyltoluenes is observed at a conversion of 13 % at 90 h on stream and medium space velocities. It is suggested that this maximum is a result of secondary reactions of ethyltoluenes. Hydrocracking experiments confirm that methane forms mainly from secondary reactions of products or reactants. A noble metal is required for a dehydroalkylation catalyst with good activity. However, the noble metal can also promote undesired side reactions including hydrocracking or hydrogenolysis and, mainly, the <b>hydrodealkylation</b> of the reactants and products. Although on Pt/H-ZSM- 5 catalysts the highest toluene conversion is observed, on Pd/H-ZSM- 5 the highest yields to ethyltoluenes can be achieved. This is as a result of Pd being less active for <b>hydrodealkylation.</b> Hence, further experiments in the membrane reactor were carried out using a Pd/H-ZSM- 5 catalyst. Since high selectivity to the desired products can be achieved, the ultimate goal of increased yields can be achieved by improving conversion. This was attempted by application of a membrane reactor, which may improve yields by selectively removing a product and hence shifting equilibrium. Prior to catalytic experiments in a membrane reactor, a model was developed applying fundamental thermodynamics in order to gauge the maximum attainable shift in equilibrium by the selective removal of hydrogen in a membrane reactor. The model considers chemical reaction equilibrium and simultaneously the hydrogen partial pressure equilibrium across the membrane. From the viewpoint of hydrogen recovery, the molar flow of the sweep gas must be about 10 times higher than the molar flow of the alkane to ensure a high hydrogen recovery from the reactor. Under these conditions, an optimum shift in equilibrium can be achieved with a minimum dilution of the hydrogen on the sweep side. Dehydroalkylation reactions show interesting advantages in comparison to, more widely studied, dehydrogenation reactions. Since dehydrogenation reactions typically result in a net increase in the number of moles, low pressure is favored. However, for the membrane reactor, removal of hydrogen means that high conversions can still be maintained at high pressure. However, in the case of dehydroalkylation of toluene with ethane, the number of moles does not change. Thus, in a membrane reactor an increase in conversion can be achieved at higher pressures since more hydrogen can permeate at higher pressure. However, there is a limit to which the equilibrium can be shifted, depending on the thermodynamics of the given reaction. The model suggested here may be applied to simply estimate optimum conditions for specific reactions in order to achieve the highest attainable conversions when applying membrane reactors. The modeling results are confirmed by experimental results. Experiments show that the dehydroalkylation of toluene with ethane can be successfully performed in a membrane reactor. Since the reaction is taking place under mild conditions, the catalytic performance of the bifunctional zeolite in the membrane reactor is stable with time on stream. Experiments demonstrate large improvements with tripled conversion and almost tripled yield to the desired ethyltoluenes by increasing the sweep gas flow rate and the pressure on the reaction side. Selectivity to methane and ethylbenzene, formed from <b>hydrodealkylation</b> reactions that consume hydrogen, is reduced. Increasing pressure has a positive effect on conversion since the net number of moles does not change during this reaction. However, at high pressure, the toluene disproportionation reaction is dominant. Unfortunately, choosing a low contact time to successfully eliminate the toluene disproportionation is not possible here, since under such conditions the produced hydrogen is swept out of the reaction zone before it can permeate. Hence, a careful optimization of the catalyst and the reaction conditions in the membrane reactor is needed in order to achieve industrially relevant yields. Jüngste Fortschritte in der Reaktortechnik sowie die Entwicklung aktiver, multifunktionaler Katalysatoren ermöglichten die Aktivierung der relativ inerten leichten Alkane. Die Nutzung von kurzkettigen Alkanen, insbesondere von Methan und Ethan, als Ausgangsstoffe für die chemische Industrie bietet eine attraktive Alternative zu den herkömmlich verwendeten Alkenen. Beträchtliche Mengen an Alkanen findet man in Form von Erdgas, wogegen Alkene ausschließlich durch chemische Umsetzung gewonnen werden können. Die Aktivierung von Alkanen kann entweder oxidativ oder nicht oxidativ erfolgen. Die oxidative Aktivierung ist thermodynamisch begünstigt, führt jedoch zur Bildung der wertlosen und unerwünschten Nebenprodukte Wasser und Kohlendioxid. Dagegen kann bei der nicht oxidativen Aktivierung Wasserstoff als wertvolles Nebenprodukt gewonnen werden. Die Umsätze nicht oxidativer Reaktionen sind jedoch sehr gering. Durch das Verschieben des Gleichgewichts der Reaktion, z. B. durch Entfernen eines Reaktionsproduktes, können diese Nachteile abgemildert werden. Die Alkylierung von Aromaten mit Alkanen bietet eine neuartige Möglichkeit zur Herstellung wichtiger Grundchemikalien wie n-Propylbenzol, Cumol, Ethyltoluol und Ethylbenzol. Laut aktuellen Schätzungen beläuft sich die derzeitige Produktionskapazität von Ethylbenzol und Cumol, den beiden wichtigsten durch Alkylierung von Aromaten hergestellten Chemikalien, auf 25 · 106 t·a- 1 bzw. 10 · 106 t·a- 1. Herkömmliche Alkylierungsmittel, wie Alkene, Alkohole und Alkylhalogenide, müssen dabei in einem zusätzlichen Prozessschritt synthetisiert werden. Die direkte Alkylierung von Aromaten mit Alkanen würde daher zu einer erheblichen Kostensenkung und Prozessintensivierung führen, da Alkane preiswerter und leicht verfügbar sind und dadurch ein zusätzlicher Syntheseschritt vermieden werden kann. Aus diesem Grund wurde in der hier vorliegenden Arbeit die direkte Anwendung von Ethan als Alkylierungsmittel in der Dehydroalkylierung von Toluol zu Ethyltoluol an edelmetallhaltigen Zeolithen untersucht. Ethan befindet sich in einer thermodynamischen Senke. Die gewünschte Reaktion ist daher stark thermodynamisch limitiert. Experimentelle Untersuchungen verbunden mit theoretischen Berechnungen wurden durchgeführt, um die Reaktion besser zu verstehen und folglich die Ausbeuten in der untersuchten Reaktion zu verbessern. Die Druckabhängigkeit wurde anhand eines Modells mit thermodynamischen Berechnungen und kinetischen Annahmen simuliert. Die Werte des Modells stimmen bei 300 °C mit den experimentellen Daten überein. Bei 350 °C erhält man jedoch Umsätze, die weit über den berechneten Werten liegen. Dies wird vermutlich durch die Bildung von wasserstoffreichem Methan hervorgerufen, welches als „Wasserstoffsenke“ fungiert. Dadurch wird das Gleichgewicht in Richtung der Ethyltoluole verschoben. Da Methan hauptsächlich aus Wasserstoff in einer Folgereaktion gebildet wird, wurde die Raumgeschwindigkeit verändert, um die Selektivität zur Wunschreaktion zu verbessern. Bei hohen Raumgeschwindigkeiten kann die Bildung von Methan vermieden werden. Auch die Disproportionierung von Toluol wird in diesem Fall nicht beobachtet, was zu einer 100 %-igen Selektivität zu Ethyltoluolen und Wasserstoff führt. Das Absenken der Raumgeschwindigkeit resultiert in einem Anstieg des Umsatzes sowie der Ausbeute an Ethyltoluolen. Erhöhte Umsätze führen jedoch zu schlechteren Selektivitäten zu den Ethyltoluolen, da die Disproportionierung von Toluol parallel zur Dehydroalkylierung ablaufen kann. Mit steigendem Umsatz wird zudem die Bildung von C 1 - bis C 4 -Alkanen und anderen Aromaten, wie z. B. Benzol, Xylolen und Ethylbenzol, beobachtet. Die größte Ausbeute an Ethyltoluolen erhält man bei einem Umsatz von 13 % bei 90 h Laufzeit und einer mittleren Raumgeschwindigkeit. Dieses Maximum könnte durch Folgereaktionen der Ethyltoluole bedingt sein. Hydrocracking-Experimente haben bestätigt, dass Methan vornehmlich aus Folgereaktionen der Edukte und Produkte gebildet wird. Ein Dehydroalkylierungskatalysator mit guter Aktivität enthält ein Edelmetall als aktives Zentrum. Dieses Edelmetall kann jedoch zu unerwünschten Folgereaktionen führen, wie Hydrocracking/Hydrogenolyse sowie zu Hydrodealkylierung von Edukten und Produkten. Obwohl Pt/H-ZSM- 5 als Katalysator den höchsten Umsatz an Toluol aufweist, besitzt Pd/H-ZSM- 5 die höchste Aktivität für die Dehydroalkylierung von Toluol und führt zu den größten Ausbeuten an Ethyltoluolen, hervorgerufen durch die geringere Aktivität von Pd gegenüber Hydrodealkylierungsreaktionen. Neben der hohen Selektivität zu den gewünschten Produkten standen die Erhöhung des Umsatzes an Toluol und damit bessere Ausbeuten im Mittelpunkt weiterer Untersuchungen. Diese Ziele können durch Verwendung eines Membranreaktors erreicht werden, da das Produkt Wasserstoff selektiv entfernt und damit das Gleichgewicht in Richtung der Produkte verschoben wird. Vor der Durchführung katalytischer Experimente wurde ein thermodynamisches Modell entwickelt, welches unter Berücksichtigung der selektiven Entfernung des Wasserstoffs im Membranreaktor die maximal erreichbare Verschiebung des chemischen Gleichgewichts simuliert. Dem Modell liegen sowohl das chemische Gleichgewicht der Reaktion als auch der Wasserstoffgradient innerhalb des Reaktors zugrunde. Der Stoffmengenstrom des Trägergases muss 10 -mal größer sein als der Stoffmengenstrom des Alkans, um ausreichend Wasserstoff gewinnen zu können. Die optimale Verschiebung des chemischen Gleichgewichts wird durch maximale Verdünnung des Wasserstoffs an der Permeatseite erreicht. Im Membranreaktor zeigen Dehydroalkylierungsreaktionen gegenüber Dehydrierungen Vorteile. Da Dehydrierungsreaktionen einen Anstieg der Stoffmenge zur Folge haben, begünstigt ein niedriger Druck die Reaktion. Bei Dehydroalkylierungsreaktionen bleibt die Stoffmenge jedoch gleich. In einem Membranreaktor beobachtet man daher höhere Ausbeuten bei erhöhtem Druck, da mehr Wasserstoff durch die Membran permeieren kann. Es gibt jedoch einen Grenzwert, bis zu welchem das chemische Gleichgewicht verschoben werden kann, abhängig von der Thermodynamik der untersuchten Reaktion. Das hier entwickelte Modell kann daher angewendet werden, um die optimalen Bedingungen zur Verschiebung des chemischen Gleichgewichts für Reaktionen im Membranreaktor zu berechnen. Die Modellrechnungen wurden durch experimentelle Untersuchungen bestätigt. Dabei wurde gezeigt, dass die Dehydroalkylierung von Toluol mit Ethan in einem Membranreaktor erfolgreich durchgeführt werden kann. Da die Reaktionsbedingungen sehr mild gehalten werden können, ist das Laufzeitverhalten des Katalysators während der Reaktion stabil. Eine Erhöhung des Druckes während der Reaktion hat einen positiven Einfluss auf die Umsätze, da sich die Fugazitätfaktoren während der Reaktion nicht ändern. Bei erhöhtem Druck ist jedoch die Disproportionierung von Toluol vorherrschend. Kurze Kontaktzeiten - um die Toluoldisproportionierung zu vermeiden - wären jedoch hier nicht möglich, da der entstehende Wasserstoff aus dem Reaktionsraum herausgetragen würde, bevor er durch die Membran diffundieren kann. Eine weitere Optimierung des Katalysators und der Reaktionsbedingungen im Membranreaktor sind daher notwendig, bevor industriell bedeutsame Ausbeuten erreicht werden können...|$|E
