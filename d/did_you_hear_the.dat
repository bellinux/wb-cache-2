You will say that isn't much! Yes; they have been very shabby; I am not a bit afraid to say it; I assure you every one thinks so. We are not all like that. I am sorry I am not going to see you again; you know I think you very good company. I would prove it by asking you to get into the carriage and drive with me for a quarter of an hour, while I wait for my mother-in-law. Only if we were seen--considering what has passed, and every one knows you have been turned away--it might be thought I was going a little too far, even for me. But I shall see you sometimes--somewhere, eh? You know"--this was said in English--"we have a plan for a little amusement." ...|$|E
