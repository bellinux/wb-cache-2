5|$|Lethbridge's heart {{condition}} worsened, {{to the extent}} that he was unable to attend his mother's funeral in 1970. He eventually required 24-hour care, and was transferred to Nuffield Hospital in Exeter, where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971. His body was interned at the family plot in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge <b>Family</b> <b>Trust,</b> Mina was obliged to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity. Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book with the help of writer Colin Wilson; together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by Routledge in 1976 as The Power of the Pendulum.|$|E
40|$|Individuals, endowments and trusts face {{uncertain}} lifetimes. When {{the planning}} horizon of an entity is stochastic and Pareto distributed, hyperbolic discounting and time-varying consumption rates are optimal. We derive expressions for the optimal rate of consumption (draw-down) from wealth for <b>family</b> <b>trusts</b> facing positive probabilities of extinction at each generation. Using birth {{statistics for the}} UK, we compute family extinction probabilities and {{show that they are}} well-approximated by a Pareto distribution, hence <b>family</b> <b>trusts</b> will discount hyperbolically.

5|$|As Lucan's {{bankruptcy}} proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors {{were informed}} that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326. His assets were estimated at £22,632. The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around £30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan <b>family</b> <b>trust</b> {{in the years immediately}} following his disappearance. His family was granted probate over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, George Bingham, Lord Bingham, was refused permission to take his father's title and seat in the House of Lords. Following the passage of the Presumption of Death Act 2013, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful in a High Court hearing at the Rolls Building on 3 February 2016.

40|$|The {{number of}} <b>family</b> <b>trusts</b> has {{increased}} markedly in New Zealand {{over the last}} 15 years. This increase has implications for the measurement of household wealth and home ownership, since {{a significant proportion of}} dwellings are now held in <b>family</b> <b>trusts.</b> The Household Savings Survey (HSS), which was undertaken by Statistics New Zealand in 2001, collected data on household wealth, including the assets and liabilities of <b>family</b> <b>trusts.</b> HSS data is re-examined, with an emphasis on looking at the types of households that have <b>family</b> <b>trusts,</b> and also at the assets held in these trusts. The 2001 census, which included {{for the first time a}} question on whether a dwelling was held in a private trust, is also re-examined. It seems that many census respondents were confused by the census question, and results from the HSS suggest that the census total for trust dwellings is an undercount. HSS data, together with data on the number of tax returns from private trusts, is used to adjust the 2001 census tenure table. It was found that after adjustment for trust ownership, the home ownership rate still fell between 1991 and 2001. Furthermore, ownership rates fell for all age groups. Some of the difficulties that trusts pose when analysing surveys like the HSS at the unit record level are outlined, as are some suggestions for dealing with these difficulties. ...|$|R
