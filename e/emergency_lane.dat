5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. All intersections of the A5 motorway are grade separated. There are four exits and four rest areas operating along the route. The motorway is tolled using a ticket system, integrated with the A3, and each exit includes a toll plaza.|$|E
5|$|The A3 {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each driving direction along its entire length. As of September 2010, the motorway has 21 interchanges, providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network. Almost all of the existing interchanges are trumpet interchanges, except for Lučko, which is a stack interchange, and Jankomir, Kosnica, Ivanja Reka and Sredanci, which are cloverleaf interchanges. The motorway follows Pan-European Corridor X, and forms junctions with Pan-European Corridors Vb and Vc within Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each driving direction, separated by a central reservation, except at the two bridges. All intersections of the A9 motorway are grade separated, and as of September 2011, there are 10exits and 6rest areas along the route. Since the motorway is tolled, using a ticket system, each exit includes a toll plaza; and the A9 motorway and the A8 motorway have an integrated toll system in place.|$|E
25|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>lanes</b> are for <b>emergency</b> {{vehicles}} {{only and}} for stopping area if breakdown. However, most Malaysians {{are still not}} aware about the safety by using the <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes</b> as an alternative route during traffic jam.|$|R
2500|$|Dual carriageways or expressways in Croatia (...) are non-tolled roads with 2 or more lanes in each direction, {{but without}} <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes.</b> The main highways/motorways in Croatia are also dual carriageways, {{but they have}} <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes</b> and tolls.|$|R

5|$|As {{the route}} {{traverses}} hilly terrain, {{it requires a}} substantial number of viaducts and tunnels, as well as two major bridges to span the Drava and Mura rivers. The motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. There are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A4 motorway are grade separated. As of October 2010, there are 12exits and 3rest areas operating along the route. As the motorway is tolled using a ticket system, each exit includes a toll plaza. Exits south of the Sveta Helena mainline toll plaza have no toll plazas, as that part of the A4 route is not tolled. The same applies to the northernmost section between the Goričan exit and the Hungarian border.|$|E
5|$|The A2 {{motorway}} has {{at least}} two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each direction along its entire length, except in tunnels, where there are emergency bays instead. All of the interchanges are trumpet interchanges, except the Jankomir interchange, which is a cloverleaf interchange. There {{are a number of}} rest areas along the motorway providing various types of services, ranging from simple parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations, restaurants and hotels. As of July 2011, the motorway has seven interchanges providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network. The motorway is operated by the Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj company.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities and}} towns with an {{immediate}} connection to the A5 include Đakovo via the D7 and Čepin via the Ž4105 county road. The A5 motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each driving direction, with carriageways separated by the median. All existing interchanges are trumpet interchanges, except for Sredanci, which is a cloverleaf. The A5 features a number of rest areas which provide various services including restrooms, filling stations and restaurants. The motorway has four interchanges, providing access to several towns and cities and the Croatian state road network. The motorway is maintained and operated by the state-owned management company Hrvatske autoceste.|$|E

More than 100 km are planned. Also, several expressways are planned.|$|R
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} designed to carry approximately 9,000 vehicles per day, and the original construction plans provided for subsequent conversion of the road into a four-lane motorway. In 1971, as the road gradually became congested, the plans to build the motorway on the route were approved by the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia. Unlike the other two motorway plans approved by the Croatian government, ZagrebSplit and ZagrebRijeka, which were cancelled after {{the suppression of the}} Croatian Spring, the ZagrebBelgrade motorway plans remained in place and an expansion of the existing motorway into a dual-carriageway, six-lane motorway with exclusively grade-separated intersections proceeded. The additional carriageway was to be built south of the existing road, which was in turn to be widened to accommodate two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|E
5|$|The A9 {{motorway}} has {{at least}} two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each direction along its entire length, except at the Mirna Bridge and the Limska Draga Viaduct where there are two traffic lanes instead. The motorway comprises several types of interchanges at the motorway exits: At Kanfanar and Pula there are cloverleaf interchanges; Višnjan and both Vodnjan exits are trumpet interchanges; Buje exit is a diamond interchange; and the rest are partial cloverleaf interchanges. There {{are a number of}} rest areas along the motorway providing various types of services, ranging from simple parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations and other facilities. As of September 2011 the motorway has ten interchanges, in addition to the roundabout at the northern terminus, providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. Sections of the motorway that have a gradient greater than 4% are divided into three lanes to prevent traffic problems caused by slower vehicles. These sections have no emergency lanes. Similarly, there are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A6 motorway are grade separated. As the route traverses rugged mountains it requires numerous long bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and other structures. As of 2010 there are nine exits and three rest areas situated along the route. The majority of the motorway is a ticket system toll road with pricing tied to vehicle classification. Each exit between Grobnik mainline toll plaza and Bosiljevo2 interchage has a toll plaza. No toll is charged at Bosiljevo2 where the traffic switches to the A1 motorway; traffic is tolled upon leaving the A1 motorway. Exits between the mainline toll plaza and Orehovica interchange have no toll plazas, as {{that part of the}} A6 route is not tolled.|$|E
50|$|The main {{differences}} are that motorways have <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes</b> and the maximum allowed speed limit is 130 km/h, while expressways do not {{and the speed}} limit is 120 km/h.|$|R

50|$|The Dobra Bridge {{is located}} between Karlovac and Novigrad {{interchanges}} of the A1 motorway in Croatia, spanning Dobra River. It is 546 m long, and it comprises four traffic <b>lanes</b> and two <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each driving direction, separated by a central reservation. All intersections of the A3 motorway are grade separated, and the motorway comprises several large stack and cloverleaf interchanges at junctions with four other motorways in Croatia: A1, A2, A4 and A5. As of October 2010, another cloverleaf interchange is under construction on the A3 route, where the A11 motorway is scheduled to branch off. The route comprises {{a large number of}} bridges and culverts, but has no tunnels because it runs through plains. The Sava River Bridge is the most significant structure on the A3. Currently, there are 21exits and 18rest areas operating along the route. A large part of the motorway is tolled using a ticket system; one section uses an open toll collection system. The Zagreb bypass sections are not tolled. The toll is charged according to vehicle classification in Croatia. The A3 motorway is operated by Hrvatske autoceste.|$|E
25|$|Most {{sections}} of Germany's autobahns are modern, containing two or three, sometimes four lanes {{in addition to}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> (hard shoulder). A few other sections remain in an old state, with two lanes, no <b>emergency</b> <b>lane,</b> and short slip-roads and ramps.|$|E
25|$|In {{a traffic}} jam, drivers must form an <b>{{emergency}}</b> <b>lane</b> (Rettungsgasse) to allow emergency services {{to reach the}} scene of an accident. This improvised alley is to be created on the dividing line between the two leftmost lanes.|$|E
50|$|The 2-lane single-carriageway section between Bandar Baru Selayang and Templer's Park was {{upgraded}} to 4-lane dual-carriageway with <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes</b> and several U-turns. Construction started in 2006 and {{was expected to}} be completed in 2009.|$|R
50|$|The term brza cesta or {{expressway}} {{refers to}} limited-access roads specifically designated as such by legislation and marked with appropriate limited-access road traffic signs.

50|$|The Gacka Bridge {{is located}} between Žuta Lokva and Ličko Lešće. It is 466 m long, and it {{comprises}} four traffic <b>lanes</b> and two <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes.</b> Speed limit enforced {{on the bridge}} is 130 km/h. The contract value of the bridge was 94.3 million Croatian kuna (c. €12.7 million) without VAT.|$|R
25|$|The bridge {{highway is}} eight lanes wide. Three {{standard}} lanes, one <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> and one pedestrian lane serve each direction. On weekday mornings, most commuter traffic flows westbound to Europe, so {{four of the}} six lanes run westbound and only two eastbound. Conversely, on weekday evenings, four lanes are dedicated to eastbound traffic and two lanes, to westbound traffic.|$|E
25|$|The A11 {{motorway}} has {{at least}} two traffic lanes and an <b>emergency</b> <b>lane</b> in each direction along its entire length. The Velika Gorica interchange is a cloverleaf interchange. The A11 route is not tolled from Jakuševec up to the Mraclin mainline toll plaza, after which point it is tolled at the Buševec and Lekenik exits, which comprise trumpet interchanges.|$|E
25|$|The Tollway is patrolled by both {{police and}} non-police fleets. The Tollway {{comprises}} a separate Illinois State Police District 15, one of 21 districts of the Illinois State Police.

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{discusses}} {{the safety of}} motorway tunnels in the Netherlands. Broadly speaking, it is not certain whether crashes in the Netherlands are relatively more frequent in tunnels than on open road stretches. However, there are certain factors that increase the risk in tunnels, such as {{the proximity of the}} tunnel wall, limited sight distance, merging or exit lanes in or near the tunnel and great differences in lighting at the entrance and exit. Road safety in tunnels can be improved by creating <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes</b> which increase the distance to the tunnel wall, by limiting the gradient percentage, thus minimizing speed differences (separate lanes for heavy traffic are an alternative), and creating wide layouts in horizontal bends where these cannot be avoided. In addition, tunnel entrances and exits must be carefully designed: the lighting must be of a high quality, and, if there are no <b>emergency</b> <b>lanes,</b> exit lanes and weaving sections should be avoided {{in the vicinity of the}} tunnel as well as inside the tunnel. Furthermore, tunnels should be equipped with high-quality outlet systems for fluids...|$|R
