Dark object Subtraction is a very simple image-based method of atmospheric haze which assumes that there are at least a few pixels within an image which should be black (% reflectance) and such black reflectance termed as dark object which are clear water body and shadows whose DN values zero (0) or Close to zero in the image. Simple Dark Object Subtraction method is a first order atmospheric correction but Improved Dark Object Subtraction method which tends to correct the Haze in terms of atmospheric scattering and path radiance based on the power law of relative scattering effect of atmosphere.

In this paper we report on the surface texturing of aluminium-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al or AZO) films for improved light trapping in thin-film Si solar cells. The AZO films are deposited onto soda-lime glass sheets via pulsed DC magnetron sputtering. Several promising AZO texturing methods are investigated using diluted hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), through a two-step etching process. The developed texturing procedure combines the advantages of the HCl-induced craters and the smaller and jagged—but laterally more uniform—features created by HF etching. In the two-step process, the second etching step further enhances the optical haze, while simultaneously improving the uniformity of the texture features created by the HCl etch.

An efficient light trapping scheme is required to increase the optical light path and thus enhance the photon absorption within the solar cells. Improved photon absorption is necessary to increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and thus the efficiency of cells. In this paper we report the results of the texturing of aluminium-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al or AZO) thin films for enhanced light scattering. AZO films were deposited onto soda-lime glass sheets by in-line DC magnetron sputtering. An effective AZO texturing method was developed using diluted hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) acids through either a two-step etching or a mixed etching process, which significantly improves the uniformity of the textured surface. Texturing based on HCl and HF combines the advantages of the large craters created by HCl etching and smaller jagged but uniform features resulting from HF etching. In this work, we demonstrate that by adopting the two-step or the mixed texturing method, it is possible to achieve high <b>haze</b> <b>values</b> of above 40 % with very low surface roughness values.

Mica nanolayers {{have a very}} high aspect ratio (α), at levels much greater than that of conventional exfoliated clay layers (e. g., montmorillonite). A very small amount of mica (0. 02 wt %, which is ϕ ≈ 0. 00008) in pullulan coatings dramatically improved the oxygen barrier performance of the nanocomposite films under dry conditions, however, this performance was partly lost as the environmental relative humidity (RH) increased. This outcome was explained in terms of the perturbation of the spatial ordering of mica sheets within the main pullulan phase, because of RH fluctuations. This was confirmed by modelling of the experimental oxygen transmission rate (OTR) data according to Cussler’s model. The presence of the synthetic nanobuilding block (NBB) led to a decrease in both static and kinetic coefficients of friction, compared with neat PET (≈ 12 % and 23 %, respectively) and PET coated with unloaded pullulan (≈ 26 % reduction in both coefficients).

METHODS:A prospective analysis for 16 consecutive patients(30 eyes) with myopia and myopic astigmatism from July 2012 to July 2014 in our hospital underwent transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy(T-PRK, PRK with epithelial removal by PTK). Uncorrected distant visual acuity(UCVA), haze formation and remaining manifest refractive spherical equivalent(MRSE) were recorded before and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 mo after operations. RESULTS:There {{were no significant}} differences(P > 0. 05) in patients had an postoperative UCVA≥ 0. 5 at 1, 3, 6 and 12 mo compared with preoperative best corrected visual acuity(BCVA), and {{the same as the}} patients had an UCVA≥ 1. 0 (P > 0. 006). There were significant differences in haze values between different postoperative times(F = 16. 751, P = 0. 000). The <b>haze</b> <b>value</b> at 1 mo was 0. 71 ± 0. 25, which was gradually reduced with the time, and no more than 2 grades. Postoperative MRSE at 1 mo was 0. 9 ± 0. 87 D, compared with 0. 5 ± 0. 65 D at 3 mo, the difference was statistically significant(t = 2. 017, P = 0. 048). While the difference was not statistically significant(F = 2. 389, P = 0. 098) among MRSE at 3, 6 (0. 5 ± 0. 45 D) and 12 mo(0. 25 ± 0. 4 D). CONCLUSION:The study obtained good clinical visual acuity. It shows slightly hyperopic shift and corneal haze at 1 mo postoperatively. Large sample and grouped clinical research should be taken for the long-term stability of refraction and visual quality...|$|E
40|$|Transparent {{conducting}} {{thin films}} of metal oxides, doped metal oxides, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), {{have been produced}} using various deposition techniques, including: Aerosol Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition (AACVD), Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (APCVD), and Spray Coating. The resultant thin films were tested for their performance {{in a number of}} applications, including: Low emissivity (‘Low-E’) glazing, photovoltaic electrode materials, gas sensing and photocatalysis. AACVD was shown as a viable, and attractive, deposition technique for the synthesis of tin oxide, and doped tin oxide thin films, which allows for controllable doping levels, crystallinity, and surface structure. The tailoring of these physical attributes allows for enhanced performance of the functional properties of the films, whereby, a lower growth temperature produced highly transparent, highly conductive coatings with a low <b>haze</b> <b>value</b> for ‘Low-E’ applications, whereas, higher growth temperatures produced the high electrical conductivity, transparency, and light scattering properties required for high performance electrodes in thin film photovoltaics. In addition, a dual coating methodology was developed using both AACVD, and APCVD, to grow tin oxide thin films in a rapid timescale, but with modified surface structures showing changes to the short range waviness, kurtosis, and the surface area. Growth of carbon nanotubes, using CVD, was investigated over a range of metal catalysts, with varying Pauling electronegativity values, and over a range of temperature, methane, and hydrogen conditions. A growth mechanism has been postulated, whereby, the electronegativity of the metal catalyst, and the solubility and diffusion of the carbon through that catalyst, affects the type and properties of the carbon structure produced. To the authors knowledge, this is the first reported growth of MWCNTs using a chromium solo-metal catalyst, and the first reported growth of the unique ‘carbon nanofibres’ which were produced using gold and silver metal catalysts. Functionalisation of SWCNTs using a microwave reflux process was shown to yield sulphonate and sulphone modified nanotubes, which are highly soluble in water and able to undergo spray coating to produce carbon nanotube, nanonet transparent conducting thin films. The functionalisation process was shown to be reversible upon heating of the modified nanotubes. AACVD has been deemed unable to produced doped zinc oxide transparent conducting films. However, undoped zinc oxide films were produced. They displayed a high photocatalytic action in the degredation of stearic acid, and a UV light induced superhydrophilicity. The modification and deposition techniques, established throughout this work, were utilised to form transparent, hybrid, metal oxide-CNT coatings, for gas sensing. The hybrid materials displayed enhanced response times to combustible target gases, which has been attributed to the catalytic effects of the exposed carbon nanotube surfaces; and to the spillover of adsorbed oxygen from the active nanotubes to the metal oxide surface...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} for {{alternative}} materials to replace indium-tinoxide in transparent electrodes we have structured copper and aluminum thin films (between 5 an 40 nm) for tailoring their optical properties. Micrometer scaled holes were produced using the direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) technique. We compared the optical and electrical parameters of nanosecond and picosecond processed thin films. It {{was found that the}} optical transmittance of the structured layers was relatively increased between 25 to 125 % while the electrical resistance was marginally influenced. In addition, the laser treatment enhanced the diffuse to total transmission ratio (<b>HAZE)</b> by <b>values</b> ranging from 30 to 82 % (relative) as a potential advantage of μm structuring. The results also show that both of the studied metals succeed to match the target which is set by typical applications of indium thin oxide (ITO) films. Furthermore, numerical simulations are performed {{in order to understand the}} ablation process of thin film material for ps and ns pulses...|$|R
50|$|Both ISO 13803 and ASTM E430 method B {{require a}} {{separate}} measurement of luminous reﬂectance, Y, to calculate compensated <b>haze.</b> The tri-stimulus <b>value</b> Y gives {{a measure of}} the lightness of the material as defined in ISO 7724-2 requiring a 45°/0° geometry to be used with standard illuminant C and 2° observer (although it is mentioned that slightly different conditions will not result in significant errors). Luminous reflectance measurements, Y, are required on both the sample material and a reference white; ISO 13803 details the use of a BaSO4 standard - Barium sulphate, a white crystalline solid having a white opaque appearance and high density as this material is a good substitute for a perfectly reflecting diffusor as defined under ISO 7724-2.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} and confocal microscopic results of transepithelial PRK versus LASEK for correction of myopia. Materials and Methods. Twelve patients with myopia received transepithelial PRK {{in one eye}} and LASEK in the other. In transepithelial PRK-treated eyes, the corneal epithelium was removed with 40 microns of excimer laser ablation and in LASEK-treated eyes with 25 -second application of 18 % ethanol. Time to epithelial healing, ocular discomfort, uncorrected and best corrected visual acuities, manifest refraction, <b>haze,</b> greyscale <b>value,</b> and keratocyte apoptosis in confocal microscopy were recorded. Results. The mean time to epithelial healing was significantly longer after LASEK (4. 00 [*]±[*] 0. 43 versus 3. 17 [*]±[*] 0. 6 days). On day 1, ocular discomfort was significantly higher after transepithelial PRK. The grade of haze, keratocyte apoptosis, and greyscale value in confocal microscopy were significantly higher in transepithelial PRK-treated eyes at 1 month. All transepithelial PRK- and LASEK-treated eyes achieved 20 / 25 or better UCVA and were within ± 1. 00 [*]D of emmetropia at final visits. Conclusions. Both transepithelial PRK and LASEK offer effective correction of myopia at 1 year. However, LASEK appeared to induce less discomfort and less intense wound healing in the early postoperative period...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study two different light management approaches to enhance the efficiency of thin film Si solar cells and these were the manipulation of the light path (light trapping) and changing the incoming photon energy (upconversion). In the first approach the light path was manipulated by creating either periodic or random textured interfaces. Periodic patterns were created at the front AZO by means of direct laser ablation. Amongst all the patterns assessed, the best result was achieved with a linear pattern of 10 lam of pitch and 360 nm of groove depth, that yielded to an Rs of 11 SI/sq and a haze of 12. 7 % at 600 nm. However structures in the sub-micrometer range cannot be created because the minimum period {{is limited by the}} laser spot. By means of the Aluminum Induced Texturing method (AIT) random textures were performed on glass substrates. In this method, a thin Al film is deposited onto a glass substrate and a redox reaction between the Al and the SiO 2 of the glass is induced by high temperature annealing. The reaction products are wet-etched and the result is a uniform and rough glass surface. The process parameters were varied in order to control the resultant glass roughness and {{it was found that the}} most critical was the Al deposition method. By using evaporation smooth U-shaped craters morphology and roughness up to 90 nm were created, whereas the sputtered films resulted in rough and porous textures with roughness until 145 nm. AZO grown over the U-shape crater morphology led to a double texture with <b>haze</b> <b>values</b> above 10 % at 600 nm, transparency above 84 %, and Rs- 7 SI/sq whereas AZO over very rough glass resulted in a cauliflower-like surface with <b>haze</b> <b>values</b> > 32 % at 600 nm, Rs around 9. 5 SI/sq and transmittance of 74 %. A-Si:H solar cells were deposited on different AIT textures and an improvement of the short circuit current, as well as a reduction of the device reflectivity was achieved in all cases in comparison to the cells deposited on smooth glass textures. The second approach was to create a transparent and conducting upconverter to be used on top of the rear reflector of a thin film Si solar cell. For that purpose, ZnO was doped with Er and Yb ions and was post-annealed under different treatments. The unique spectral properties of rare earth (RE) elements due to their electronic configuration occur as a result of their intra 4 f- 4 f shell transitions. In the case of Er, its excitation takes places at 1500 nm and 980 nm and the upconverted photons are emitted within the Si absorption range. Moreover, codoping with Yb can enhance the Er visible emission because they cooperate together due to the matching of their energy levels for k= 980 nm. As deposited ZnO doped with rare earths (RE) was found to be transparent and conducting but not luminescent. RE ions need to be surrounded by 6 oxygen in a distorted octahedron to be optically active and REs replacing zinc in the ZnO lattice do not present this symmetry; hence, a post deposition treatment is needed. When the films were post-annealed in air, visible upconversion (UC) was seen at 660 nm under 980 nm laser excitation, however, the films become almost insulating. When the films were annealed in vacuum, lower UC luminescence was achieved, and the resistivity increased 1 order of magnitude. By using CW laser radiation, the electrical properties were maintained and high UC was observed. UC came from clusters of RE 06 as well as from RE 203 inside or outside the matrix. When annealing in air, in vacuum or by laser radiation, oxygen from the atmosphere bound to the RE to form RE oxides and/or RE 06 complexes but just laser annealing was able to preserve the conductivity while producing optically active centers. L'objectiu d'aquesta tesi és la millora de l'eficiència de les cèl•lules solars de silici en capa prima mitjançant l'estudi de nous mètodes per a l'aprofitament de la llum solar al dispositiu. El primer mètode consisteix en texturar el substrat de vidre per dispersar la llum incident i així incrementar l'absorció en la capa activa. El mètode emprat es la texturització induïda per alumini (AIT); que es basa en una reacció de reducció no uniforme entre el vidre i una capa prima d'alumini gràcies a un tractament tèrmic. Posteriorment els productes de la reacció s'eliminen mitjançant una solució basada en àcid i el resultat és un vidre transparent i texturat. S'ha fet un estudi de la rugositat en funció dels paràmetres del procés i s'ha aconseguit obtenir rugositats controlades i uniformes en superfícies de fins a 10 x 10 cm 2. Diferents textures s'han provat en cèl. lules solars de silici amorf i s'ha demostrat l'eficàcia d'aquestes en la millora del corrent respecte a les mateixes cèl•lules dipositades sobre vidre pla. El segon mètode estudiat és el fenomen de l'up-conversion que consisteix en la conversió de fotons de baixa energia (E Eg) que podran ser absorbits en la zona activa; així doncs s'ha intentat fer una capa conductora, transparent i amb propietats d'up-conversion per utilitzar com a contacte per a cèl• lules solars. Per aquest propòsit s'han estudiat capes conductores i transparents d'òxid de zinc dopat amb erbi i iterbi dipositades per polvorització catòdica sobre vidre. Com que les terres rares han d'estar envoltades d'oxigen per actuar com a centres òptics actius, i en les capes de ZnO:Er:Yb no es dóna aquesta configuració, les capes s'han hagut de sotmetre a diferents tractaments tèrmics, com escalfament en aire, en buit o escalfament amb làser. Escalfant en aire o en buit s'aconsegueix obtenir up-conversion però la conductivitat disminueix notablement, en canvi, escalfant amb radiació làser es possible de mantenir les propietats elèctriques i a més, activar òpticament les terres rares...|$|R
