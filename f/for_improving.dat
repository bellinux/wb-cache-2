40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} {{the willingness to}} pay <b>for</b> an <b>improved</b> water quality and reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households {{are willing to pay}} <b>for</b> <b>improved</b> water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as they {{are willing to pay for}} its provision.

Larger families are not willing to pay <b>for</b> an <b>improved</b> provision of water services. Also, educated people are lesser willing to pay <b>for</b> <b>improved</b> water quality and reliability...|$|R
