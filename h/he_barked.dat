Buster and other dogs present {{joined in the}} Last Post. Buster has attended several memorial events before, but never before had <b>he</b> <b>barked</b> or howled at one.|$|E
500|$|As the {{examination}} continued, Aylmer considered {{the ability of}} the Anglican Church to put trained ministers in every parish. [...] <b>He</b> <b>barked,</b> [...] "This fellow would have a preacher in every parish church!" [...] to which Marbury replied, [...] "so would St. Paul." [...] Then Aylmer asked, [...] "But where is the living for them?" [...] To this Marbury answered, [...] "A man might cut a large thong out of your hide, and that of the other prelates, and it would never be missed." [...] Having lost his patience, the bishop retorted, [...] "Thou are an overthwart, proud, puritan knave." [...] Marbury answered, [...] "I am no puritan. [...] I beseech you to be good to me. [...] I have been twice in prison already, but I know not why. [...] To this, Aylmer was unsympathetic, and he rendered the sentence, [...] "Have him to the Marshalsea. [...] There he shall cope with the papists." [...] Marbury then actually threatened divine retribution upon the bishop by warning him to beware the judgements of God. [...] His daughter Anne would make a similar threat towards the magistrates and ministers at her civil trial before the Massachusetts Court, nearly 60 years later.|$|E

60|$|And Michael's loquacity {{never went}} farther. Only {{on these two}} occasions, when his master-god {{seemed to be in}} peril, was <b>he</b> known to <b>bark.</b> <b>He</b> never <b>barked</b> at the moon, nor at {{hillside}} echoes, nor at any prowling thing. A particular echo, to be heard directly from the ranch-house, was an unfailing source of exercise for Jerry's lungs. At such times that Jerry barked, Michael, with a bored expression, would lie down and wait until the duet was over. Nor did <b>he</b> <b>bark</b> when <b>he</b> attacked strange dogs that strayed upon the ranch.|$|R
5000|$|Draakje is {{a little}} dragon that doesn't talk and has a {{tendency}} of breathing fire at inconvenient moments. <b>He</b> <b>barks</b> just like a dog.|$|R
6000|$|COLONEL. 'I--I--I----' He {{looks for}} help from Alice, but she gives him only a twinkle of triumph. <b>He</b> <b>barks,</b> 'Child, go to your room.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Livens {{continued}} {{to improve his}} projector and to design other weapons for trench warfare, {{some of which were}} useful, others not. For example, he experimented with attempts to cut barbed wire using large quantities of explosives. A witness to one trial described orange boxes filled with explosives and fired from {{a hole in the ground}} in the manner of a shell fougasse. This system failed because the explosives tended to detonate ineffectually in mid-air – a sight that was described as being: [...] "A most impressive picture of the Day of Judgement". A variation of the Livens Projector prototype was also tested with a view to cutting wire; Major-General Foulkes later recalled: [...] "After the shoot, as the spectators approached the target area to observe the effect that had been produced Livens noticed that one drum containing 100lb of ammonal had failed to explode, and he called out [...] "Back everybody" [...] as he led a hasty retreat. I think he considered this the highlight of his military career—the occasion when <b>he</b> <b>barked</b> out an order to an Army Commander (Gough) and was promptly obeyed!" ...|$|E
60|$|Pickles nearly had a fit, <b>he</b> <b>barked</b> and <b>he</b> <b>barked</b> {{and made}} little rushes.|$|E

50|$|Neville is Suzy's loyal canine companion. He {{begins as}} a very small puppy, but due to his fondness of eating he grows into a very big dog. He also enjoys sleeping, and has a {{magnificent}} <b>bark.</b> <b>He</b> <b>barks</b> at everything, under the belief that he is protecting the sleeping Suzy and her mother (Although due to the constant barking, not very much sleeping takes place). <b>He</b> <b>barks</b> at moths, bats, owls, cats, and especially people coming home late from the pub.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What can be {{the matter}} with the beast?' said the merchant. 'Why should <b>he</b> <b>bark</b> at me like that, when he knows me quite well?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A man {{sold him}} to me this morning. Poor old Bob got poisoned. This one ought {{to be just as}} good a watch-dog. <b>He</b> <b>barks</b> loud enough.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>barked</b> raspingly, {{as if he}} {{were having}} trouble with the tonsils of the soul.|$|E
60|$|And Jerry's hair {{bristled}} as <b>he</b> <b>barked</b> at the mangrove wall, for truly his keen scent {{informed him}} of lurking niggers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, why?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>barked.</b> [...] "Why {{should it}} {{have had to}} have been or (more hopefully) even be to be? Surely you don't mean because of MONEY?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poh! {{quarrel with}} him? whom did I ever quarrel with? If <b>he</b> <b>barks,</b> I'll stop {{his mouth with}} a good dinner. I suppose he's gentleman enough, to invite?" ...|$|R
6000|$|COLONEL. 'No, no, darling, it isn't you {{who have}} made her cry. She--she is teething. It's her teeth, isn't it?' <b>he</b> <b>barks</b> at the nurse, who emerges looking not {{altogether}} woeful. 'Say it's her teeth, woman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't, Mr. Mool! That dog's temper {{is not to}} be trusted. He {{shows it}} with Miss Minerva, my governess--growls just in that way {{whenever}} he sees her. I dare say he smells you. There! Now <b>he</b> <b>barks!</b> You are only making him worse. Come back!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't Mrs. Fletcher {{satisfied}} with me?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>barked.</b> [...] "I've attended Mrs. Fletcher {{since she was}} born. Why aren't I good enough to attend her filthy brat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yours {{is a bad}} illness for a Snow-man!' {{said the}} yard-dog. 'I also {{suffered}} from it, but I have got over it. Bow-wow!' <b>he</b> <b>barked.</b> 'The weather is going to change!' he added.|$|E
6000|$|... "Zut!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>barked,</b> and instantaneously Jules {{turned himself}} {{off at the}} main. There {{was a moment of}} dazed silence, such as might occur in a boiler-factory if the works {{suddenly}} shut down.|$|E
60|$|You cannot {{lean out}} of a German bed to pick up {{anything}} off the floor, owing to its box-like formation; {{so he has to}} scramble out after it, and of course every time he does this <b>he</b> <b>barks</b> both his shins twice against the sides of the bed.|$|R
50|$|There's tugging for a mastery, and buffetting for the breeches. <b>He</b> <b>barks</b> at her, she snaps at him; {{she breaks}} his wine glass, he her looking glass; she puts away his servants, {{he turns away}} hers; she locks her chamber door, he bolts his, begetting nothing but a world of strife and disorder.|$|R
5000|$|Moseley {{later wrote}} in his book [...] "In {{addition}} to showing the film on New York-area television and {{at one of the}} Saucer News monthly lectures, I incorporated it and the story behind it into my American Program Bureau talk. I had decided I needed a 'prop' for my lectures", then describes how <b>he,</b> <b>Barker</b> and Sheets made it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] <b>he</b> <b>barked</b> suddenly, like {{an excited}} terrier, [...] "the chart gives a whole mess of islands {{off to the}} nor'west. What about them? What one has an {{entrance}} where I can lay my ship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{gave the}} grasp of {{partnership}} [...] To one of other race-- A plane: <b>he</b> <b>barked</b> him strip by strip [...] From upper bough to base; And me therewith; for gone my grip, [...] My arms could not enlace.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} did not move. Bowser {{backed away}} {{and began to}} circle around again, sniffing and snuffing. Once in a while <b>he</b> <b>barked.</b> Still the stranger did not move. For all the sign of life he made he might in truth have been a giant chestnut burr.|$|E
60|$|In {{token of}} his content, <b>he</b> gave <b>Barker</b> {{his hand and}} asked him to be seated.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} puppies are {{stolen from a}} pet store by two thieves. The St. Bernard escapes and sneaks into the Newton's home. The {{workaholic}} father, George Newton, doesn't want the responsibility of owning a dog, but his wife, Alice, and their children, Ryce, Ted and Emily, convince him. Emily plays a portion of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, <b>he</b> <b>barks</b> along and they name him Beethoven.|$|R
6000|$|Now it {{happened}} that they had floated close in to the shore, where a poor old man lived all alone in a little cottage. When <b>he</b> heard Frisk's <b>barking</b> <b>he</b> thought to himself: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wolf, old fellow!" [...] cried Hare. [...] "Where's Mescal? Wolf, {{where is}} she?" [...] He threw {{his arms around}} the dog. Wolf whined, licked Hare's face, and {{breaking}} away, ran up the sandy trail, and back again. But <b>he</b> <b>barked</b> no more; he waited to see if Hare was following.|$|E
60|$|He sprang at the horse's head as it {{came down}} with forefeet to earth, and as he sprang <b>he</b> <b>barked.</b> In his bark was censure and menace, and, as the horse reared again, he leaped into the air after it, his teeth {{clipping}} together as he just barely missed its nose.|$|E
60|$|But Johnny didn't run. Oh, my, no! Johnny didn't run. He drew himself {{together}} {{ready to}} spring. He showed all his sharp teeth and ground them savagely. Little sparks of fire seemed to {{snap out of}} his eyes. There {{was no sign of}} fear in Johnny Chuck then, not the least little bit. Just in front of him the dog stopped and barked. He was a little dog, a young and foolish dog, and he was terribly excited. <b>He</b> <b>barked</b> until he almost lost his breath. He didn't like the looks of Johnny Chuck's sharp teeth. So he circled around Johnny, trying to get behind him. But Johnny turned as the dog circled, and always the little dog found those sharp teeth directly in front of him. <b>He</b> <b>barked</b> and barked, until it seemed as if he would bark his head off.|$|E
