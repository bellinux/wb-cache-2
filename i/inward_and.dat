5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both <b>inward</b> <b>and</b> outward. The area had a strong pull on the rural poor {{from other parts of}} England and {{attracted}} waves of migration from further afield: notably Huguenot refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century., Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Sylheti Bangladeshis.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck <b>inward</b> <b>and</b> leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|While he was {{a student}} at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay and elsewhere in the novel include the split between <b>inward</b> <b>and</b> outward existence; the presence of angels and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.|$|E
40|$|We {{employ a}} {{sequence}} of Doppler images obtained with the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) instrument to perform time-distance seismology of the solar corona. We construct the first k − ω diagrams of the region. These allow us to separate outward <b>and</b> <b>inward</b> propagating waves <b>and</b> estimate the spatial variation of the plane-of-sky projected phase speed, and the relative amount of outward <b>and</b> <b>inward</b> directed wave power. The disparity between outward <b>and</b> <b>inward</b> wave power <b>and</b> {{the slope of the}} observed power law spectrum indicate that low-frequency Alfvénic motions suffer significant attenuation as they propagate, consistent with isotropic MHD turbulence...|$|R

5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries <b>inward,</b> <b>and</b> the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|Round Hill's elevated, fairly central {{position}} gives excellent <b>inward</b> <b>and</b> outward views. To the northeast, the South Downs can be seen; long {{views of}} the English Channel are possible to the south, beyond the city centre and St Peter's Church; to the southeast, Elm Grove, Race Hill and Brighton General Hospital {{can be seen on}} high ground beyond the Lewes Road valley; and to the west, Preston Park (the city's oldest and largest public park) can be seen. Crescent and Wakefield Roads have long southward views towards the city centre, as do the small blocks of flats which replaced some large villas {{in the middle of the}} suburb. The tall viaduct is the main landmark to the west and north. There are clear views into Round Hill from many parts of Brighton, especially areas to the east and southeast such as Race Hill.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Kir 3. 1 /Kir 3. 4 {{channel is}} an inward rectifier, agonist-activated K+ channel. The {{location}} of the binding site within the channel pore that coordinates polyamines (and is thus responsible for <b>inward</b> rectification) <b>and</b> the {{location of the}} gate that opens the channel in response to agonist activation is unclear. In this study, we show, not surprisingly, that mutation of residues {{at the base of the}} selectivity filter in the pore loop and second transmembrane domain weakens Cs+ block and decreases selectivity (as measured by Rb+ and spermine permeation). However, unexpectedly, the mutations also weaken <b>inward</b> rectification <b>and</b> abolish agonist activation of the channel. In the wild-type channel and 34 mutant channels, there are significant (p< 0. 05) correlations among the KD for Cs+ block, Rb+ <b>and</b> spermine permeation, <b>inward</b> rectification, <b>and</b> agonist activation. The significance of these findings is discussed. One possible conclusion is that the selectivity filter is responsible for <b>inward</b> rectification <b>and</b> agonist activation as well as permeation and block...|$|R

25|$|Because snails usually {{will not}} cross a copper band, another {{solution}} is to top the fence with 3-inch-wide (or wider) copper band. The band can be bent so {{that part of it}} faces <b>inward</b> <b>and</b> is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.|$|E
