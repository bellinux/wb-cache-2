5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E

5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Arbroath's economy {{expanded}} {{and the population}} of the town expanded, with new housing <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed to house the influx of workers. Arbroath became moderately well known for jute and sailcloth production, with 34 mills employing 1,400 looms and producing over one million yards of osnaburg cloth and 450,000yards of sailcloth in 1875. Arbroath {{is believed to be the}} source of the sails used on the Cutty Sark. In 1867, the mills in Arbroath employed 4,620 people. Arbroath was also prominent in the manufacture of shoes and lawnmowers; local firm Alexander Shanks supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17weeks. Photography {{then moved to}} the Sahara desert outside {{the small town of}} Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before {{completion}} of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E

5|$|In late 2015, as a {{testament}} of its leadership in agricultural education and development studies, the university signed a {{memorandum of agreement}} with Nagoya University to host the Nagoya University Asian Satellite Campus (NUASC) through the UPLB Graduate School. The agreement makes the Philippines the eighth country to host the NUASC through which the Transnational Doctoral Programs for Leading Professionals in Asian Countries will be implemented. It will enable Filipino doctoral candidates to enroll in NU doctoral programs without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically present in Nagoya for the whole duration of the course. Nagoya's Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences and Graduate School of International Development will offer the doctorates in bioagricultural sciences and international development, respectively, through the said facility.|$|E
5|$|Petry's wounds {{resulted}} {{in his right}} arm <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> amputated below the elbow. He was evacuated to an American hospital in Germany, where he spent several weeks in recovery before being transferred to Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Texas. He now uses an advanced prosthetic in place of his right hand. On the prosthetic is a small plaque listing {{the names of the}} fallen Rangers of his regiment. After recovering, Petry did not seek a medical discharge; instead, he deployed to Afghanistan between recovering and receiving the Medal of Honor. He was later promoted to the rank of sergeant first class.|$|E
5|$|Riley and Nye made {{arrangements}} with James Pond {{to make two}} national tours during 1888 and 1889. The tours were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> turned away. The shows were usually forty-five {{minutes to an hour}} long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal and the two men adjusted their performances based on their audiences reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility. Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, Augustin Daly was so enthralled by the show he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theatre actors.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{system that}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved {{is of the}} form Ax=b, where A R nxn is symmetric, {{positive}} definite and diagonal dominant. In addition, A is very sparse. Less than 1 % of its elements are non-zero. For larger dimensions A becomes even more sparse. No assumptions can {{be made on the}} distribution of the non-zero elements. This special class of linear equation systems <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved in a subtask of an automatic placement program for VLSI design where total interconnection length between modules <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> minimized. See [4] for more details. There were two basic requirements that <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> met. First, computation time <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reduced, i. e. computations <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed in parallel.

5|$|They have {{naturally}} short tails, {{which do}} not require docking. They also moult their fleece naturally, rather than <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shorn annually, though older individuals do not moult as easily and may require additional shearing. Fleeces are grey or creamy white on the body, though darker individuals occur whose colouring {{is similar to the}} Soay sheep. Rough in quality, the wool is mostly used in the creation of tweeds or carpet yarns. A tweed is a rough-surfaced coarse cloth, typically made in Scotland. Its colour is a mix of flecked colours. The face and legs are wool-free and black and white, with the proportions varying between individuals.|$|E
5|$|This unorthodox {{deployment}} {{gave the}} Smith Gun 360 degrees of rotation which, {{combined with a}} maximum 40-degree elevation, produced a basic firing-plate-mounted field weapon light enough to be towed behind a civilian vehicle, despite not being designed for this. (Home Guard units quickly discovered this fact, <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prohibited from doing so as it would damage the weapon's wheels (and possibly the axle), inhibiting or even preventing traverse.) Happily, ammunition shortages made the similarly-constructed limber redundant and so a source of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia grossed over $300,000 in {{the first}} sixteen weeks in New York; over $20,000 in the opening five weeks in San Francisco; and almost the same amount {{in the first}} ten weeks both in Los Angeles and Boston. The first eleven roadshows earned a total of $1.3 million by April 1941, but the $85,000 in {{production}} and installation costs of a single Fantasound setup, along with theatres <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leased, forced Disney to exceed their loan limits. The onset of the Second World War prevented plans for a potential release in Europe, normally the source {{of as much as}} forty-five per cent of the studio's income. Up to eighty-eight engagements were outlined across five years, but wartime demands for material limited the number of Fantasound prints to sixteen. All but one of the Fantasound setups were dismantled and given to the war effort. Upon acquiring the film's distribution rights in April 1941, RKO initially continued the roadshow booking policy but presented the film in mono, which was easier to exhibit. The combined average receipts from each roadshow was around $325,000, which placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May, {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} deficiency of the Dutch Army lay in its shortage of armour. Whereas the other major participants all had a considerable armoured force, the Netherlands {{had not been able}} to obtain the minimum of 146 modern tanks (110 light, 36 medium) they had already considered necessary in 1937. A single Renault FT tank, for which just one driver had been trained and which had the sole task of testing antitank obstacles, had remained the only example of its kind and was no longer in service by 1940. There were two squadrons of armoured cars, each with a dozen Landsverk M36 or M38 vehicles. Another dozen DAF M39 cars were in the process of being taken into service, some still <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fitted with their main armament. A single platoon of five Carden-Loyd Mark VI tankettes used by the Artillery completed the list of Dutch armour.|$|E
5|$|On 27 March, {{the entire}} brigade {{participated in a}} general Allied {{offensive}} aimed at {{taking control of the}} area around Tamera. 1st and 2nd Parachute Battalions launched an attack at 23:00 the same day, taking numerous prisoners and securing their objectives and then repulsed a German counterattack, albeit with heavy losses. Further heavy and often confusing fighting continued, with several companies of 3rd Parachute Battalion <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attached to 2nd Parachute Battalion to reinforce it. 1st Parachute Battalion also seized its own objectives, {{and by the end of}} 29 March the brigade had secured all of its objectives and taken 770 German and Italian troops as prisoners. On 31 March the brigade then took up positions covering the left flank of 46th Division, and for the next two weeks it remained in the area, conducting numerous patrols but encountering little opposition. On 15 March the brigade was relieved by 39 US Regimental Combat Team and moved to the rear. It then travelled to Algiers on 18 April and remained there; Brigadier Flavell left for England to take up a new command, and was replaced by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury. Shortly afterwards the brigade rejoined 1st Airborne Division and began training for the airborne landings that would take place during Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|The Normans and French {{who arrived}} after the conquest saw {{themselves}} as different from the English. They had close family and economic links to the Duchy of Normandy, spoke Norman French and had their own distinctive culture. For many years, to be English was {{to be associated with}} military failure and serfdom. During the 12th century, the divisions between the English and Normans began to dissolve as a result of intermarriage and cohabitation. By the end of the 12th century, and possibly as early as the 1150, contemporary commentators believed the two peoples to be blending, and the loss of the Duchy in 1204 reinforced this trend. The resulting society still prized wider French cultural values, however, and French remained the language of the court, business and international affairs, even if Parisians mocked the English for their poor pronunciation. By the 14th century, however, French was increasingly <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> formally taught, rather than being learnt naturally in the home, although the aristocracy would typically spend many years of their lives in France and remained entirely comfortable working in French.|$|E

5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The tracking shot of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a cherry picker from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a camera crane. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk— the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E
