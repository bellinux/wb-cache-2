5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures is the {{eleventh}} installment in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. It was released for the Nintendo GameCube home video game console in Japan on March 18, 2004; in North America on June 7, 2004; in Europe on January 7, 2005; and in Australia on April 7, 2005. The Game Boy Advance handheld game console {{can be used}} as a controller when using the Nintendo GameCube– Game Boy Advance link cable bundled with the game in North America and Europe. The game is <b>fully</b> <b>compatible</b> with the Nintendo Wii including the use of the Game Boy Advance Link Cables.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{releases}} of System 6 were unstable; many third party software developers {{did not receive}} copies before its release, resulting in widespread compatibility problems. At first, many common software programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works and 4th Dimension were not <b>fully</b> <b>compatible</b> with System 6. There were also software bugs in the Color Manager, Script Manager, and Sound Manager extension files. Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed when the 6.0.1 update was released in September 1988. However, a major bug involving text spacing of screen fonts was found in 6.0.1 after distribution began. This led to the quick release of 6.0.2, which solved this problem. Some customers waited longer until moving to System 6 because of the poor reputation already gained.|$|E
5|$|The two {{companies}} made some basic {{changes to the}} design {{to make it easier}} to produce and a final design was ready in May 1942. The Sperry T-1 was <b>fully</b> <b>compatible</b> with UK-built versions and a T-1 computer could be used with a Mk. XIV sight head or vice versa. Full production commenced at the AC plant in Flint, Michigan, in November and T-1s arrived in the UK from March 1943. The sights were sent to medium bombers like the Wellington, while UK-built versions were sent to the heavy bombers. In August 1943, George Mann of AC Spark Plug visited the UK for a period of about a year, liaising with RAE Farnborough, Boscombe Down and the Ministry of Aircraft Production.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to remake}} the {{original}} game in high-definition first began to form when Ed Fear, a writer and creative producer at game developer Mediatonic, contacted Hato Moa {{about the possibility of}} translating any projects she was involved in to English. According to the remake's creative director Jeff Tanton, the decision was made {{to remake the}} game following several e-mail conversations between Fear and Hato, with Fear's positive experience with the Japanese version of the game and the incompatibility of FamousWriter-made games with newer operating systems—which had rendered the original game effectively unplayable on newer PCs—being major factors in the decision. An international remake of Hatoful developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital made using the Unity game engine—allowing the game to be <b>fully</b> <b>compatible</b> with computers that run Windows Vista, Windows 7 or OS X 10.6, and playable for the first time on those that run Linux or OS X 10.7 or newer—was first revealed to be in development on 6 June 2014, with a formal announcement coming shortly afterwards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, {{released}} in 1977, was an introductory {{version of the}} original D geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD rules were not <b>fully</b> <b>compatible</b> {{with those of the}} D Basic Set and as a result, D and AD became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.|$|E

25|$|Less than a {{year after}} release of its release, Parallels {{spokesperson}} John Uppendahl confirmed version 10 will not be <b>fully</b> <b>compatible</b> with Windows 10.

25|$|While several {{third-party}} projects (e.g. GNU Classpath and Apache Harmony) created {{free software}} partial Java implementations, the large {{size of the}} Sun libraries combined {{with the use of}} clean room methods meant that their implementations of the Java libraries (the compiler and VM are comparatively small and well defined) were incomplete and not <b>fully</b> <b>compatible.</b> These implementations also tended to be far less optimized than Sun's.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{valuable}} characteristics of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik compared to similar compilations {{is that most}} listed integrals are referenced. The literature list contains 92 main entries and 140 additional entries (in the eighth English edition). The integrals are classified by numbers, which haven't changed from the fourth Russian up to the seventh English edition (the numbering in older editions {{as well as in}} the eighth English edition is not <b>fully</b> <b>compatible).</b>|$|E
25|$|Before Microsoft {{added support}} for long filenames and creation/access time stamps, bytes 0x0C–0x15 of the {{directory}} entry {{were used by}} other operating systems to store additional metadata, most notably the operating systems of the Digital Research family stored file passwords, access rights, owner IDs, and file deletion data there. While Microsoft's newer extensions are not <b>fully</b> <b>compatible</b> with these extensions by default, most of them can coexist in third-party FAT implementations (at least on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes).|$|E
