The mean velocity profiles show a dramatic decrease in the velocity of the central jet immediately downstream of the <b>injection</b> <b>station.</b> It is found that the high velocity outer jet creates a reduction in static pressure through an aspiration effect, which causes the central jet to spread, thereby reducing its velocity.

40|$|One of {{the issues}} {{concerning}} the replacement of natural gas by green gas is the seasonal pattern of the gas demand. When constant production is assumed, this may limit the injected quantity of green gas into a gas grid {{to the level of}} the minimum gas demand in summer. A procedure was proposed to increase the gas demand coverage in a geographical region, i. e. the extent to which natural gas demand can be replaced by green gas. This was done by modeling flexibility into farm-scale green gas supply chains. The procedure comprises two steps. In the first step, the types and number of green gas production units are determined, based on a desired gas demand coverage. The production types comprise time-varying biogas production, non-continuous biogas production (only in winter periods with each digester having a specified production time) and constant production including seasonal gas storage. In the second step locations of production units and <b>injection</b> <b>stations</b> are calculated, using mixed integer linear programming with cost price minimization being the objective. Five scenarios were defined with increasing gas demand coverage, representing a possible future development in natural gas replacement. The results show that production locations differ for each scenario, but are connected to a selection of <b>injection</b> <b>stations,</b> at least in the considered geographical region under the assumed preconditions. The cost price is mainly determined by the type of digesters needed. Increasing gas demand coverage does not necessarily mean a much higher cost pric...|$|R

40|$|The {{generalized}} {{eddy viscosity}} approach is described and {{results are presented}} of test cases which show that predictions obtained by this approach are adequate for most engineering applications. Because {{of the importance of}} starting computations from the <b>injection</b> <b>station</b> where experimentally determined mean and turbulence parameters are rarely available, a very simple core model applicable to simple step-type (slug) profiles was developed. Agreement between predicted and experimental mean profiles was generally almost as good for calculations made by using this model throughout the core region and the transition model for all subsequent regions as predictions made by starting from experimental profiles in the transition region. The generalized eddy-viscosity model, which was developed in part through correlation of turbulence parameters, successfully predicted turbulent shear stress, turbulent intensity, and mean velocity profiles for a 0. 040 -inch-diameter microjet. Therefore, successful scaling by the model was demonstrated since data used in its development was for jet areas up to 90, 000 times as large as the microjet and velocities only 1 / 20 th as high...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMethylene {{diphenyl}} diisocyanate (MDI) is {{the most}} used isocyanate {{in the manufacture of}} polyurethane foam, and {{it is one of the}} major causes of occupational asthma. Therefore, in this research, the MDI concentration in the air of the foam- producing section in a car manufacturing company was assessed. To determine MDI concentration, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) air sampling and analysis method, No. 49, was used. In the method, a certain volume of the workplace air was drawn with an impinger content of dimethylformamide and diluted hydrochloric acid. By doing this, organic isocyanates were extracted followed by reactions of hydrolysis to similar amines. The final solution was used for the absorption by the UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Evaluation of MDI in the summer showed that MDI concentration in all parts of the workplace was less than the threshold limit value, and only when local ventilation system and air condition system (air suppliers) were off was the concentration of MDI in the foam <b>injection</b> <b>station</b> higher than the threshold limit value. On the other hand, it is probable that air pollution increases in winter due to closing of doors of the foam-producing section and turning off of the air-conditioning system. Therefore, permanent air-handling and local ventilation is essential when working in the workplace in order to prevent respiratory, skin, eye, and gastrointestinal diseases...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to examine slot film cooling effectiveness and the interaction between the cooling film and an incident planar shock wave in turbulent hypersonic flow. The experimental studies were conducted in the 48 -inch shock tunnel at Calspan at a freestream Mach number of close to 6. 4 and at a Reynolds number of 35 x 10 (exp 6) based on the length of the model at the injection point. The Mach 2. 3 planar wall jet was generated from 40 transverse nozzles (with heights of both 0. 080 inch and 0. 120 inch), producing a film that extended the full width of the model. The nozzles were operated at pressures and velocities close to matching the freestream, as well as at conditions where the nozzle flows were over- and under-expanded. A two-dimensional shock generator was used to generate oblique shocks that deflected the flow through total turnings of 11, 16, and 21 degrees; the flows impinged downstream of the nozzle exits. Detailed measurements of heat transfer and pressure were made both ahead and downstream of the <b>injection</b> <b>station,</b> with the greatest concentration of measurements in the regions of shock-wave/boundary layer interaction. The major objectives of these experimental studies were to explore the effectiveness of film cooling in the presence of regions of shock-wave/boundary layer interaction and, more specifically, to determine how boundary layer separation and the large recompression heating rates were modified by film cooling. Detailed distributions of heat transfer and pressure were obtained in the incident shock/wall-jet interaction region for a series of shock strengths and impingement positions for each of the two nozzle heights. Measurements were also made {{to examine the effects of}} nozzle lip thickness on cooling effectiveness. The major conclusion from these studies was that the effect of the cooling film could be readily dispersed by relatively weak incident shocks, so the peak heating in the recompression region was not significantly reduced by even the largest levels of film cooling. For the case studies in the absence of film cooling, the interaction regions were unseparated. However, adding film cooling resulted in regions of boundary layer separation induced in the film cooling layer [...] the size of which regions first increased and then decreased with increased film cooling. Surprisingly, the size of the separated regions and the magnitude of the recompression heating were not strongly influenced by the thickness of the cooling film, nor by the point of shock impingement relative to the exit plane of the nozzles. The lip thickness was found to have little effect on cooling effectiveness. Measurements with and in the absence of shock interaction were compared with the results of earlier experimental studies and correlated in terms of the major parameters controlling these flows...|$|E

A total of 40 volunteers were randomized into two groups of 20. 1) The Overlay group received a training session that consisted of four in-sertions with image and laser guidance, followed by two insertions with laser overlay only. 2) The Control group received a training session of six classical freehand insertions. Both groups then con-ducted two freehand insertions. The movement of the needle was tracked during the series of insertions. The final insertion proce-dure was assessed to determine if there was a benefit to the overlay method compared to the freehand insertions. The Overlay group had a better success rate (83. 3 % versus 68. 4 %, p = 0. 002), and po-tential for less tissue damage as measured by the amount of needle movement inside the phantom (3077. 6 mm 2 versus 5607. 9 mm 2, p = 0. 01).

40|$|The Monte Carlo Investigation of Trajectory Operations and Requirements (MONITOR) {{program was}} {{developed}} to perform spacecraft mission maneuver simulations for geosynchronous, single maneuver, and comet encounter type trajectories. MONITOR is a multifaceted program which enables the modeling of various orbital sequences and missions, the generation of Monte Carlo simulation statistics, and the parametric scanning of user requested variables over specified intervals. The MONITOR program has been used primarily to study geosynchronous missions and has the capability to model Space Shuttle deployed satellite trajectories. The ability to perform a Monte Carlo error analysis of user specified orbital parameters using predicted maneuver execution errors can make MONITOR {{a significant part of}} any mission planning and analysis system. The MONITOR program can be executed in four operational modes. In the first mode, analytic state covariance matrix propagation is performed using state transition matrices for the coasting and powered burn phases of the trajectory. A two-body central force field is assumed throughout the analysis. Histograms of the final orbital elements and other state dependent variables may be evaluated by a Monte Carlo analysis. In the second mode, geosynchronous missions can be simulated from parking orbit <b>injection</b> through <b>station</b> acquisition. A two-body central force field is assumed throughout the simulation. Nominal mission studies can be conducted; however, the main use of this mode lies in evaluating the behavior of pertinent orbital trajectory parameters by making use of a Monte Carlo analysis. In the third mode, MONITOR performs parametric scans of user-requested variables for a nominal mission. Various orbital sequences may be specified; however, primary use is devoted to geosynchronous missions. A maximum of five variables may be scanned at a time. The fourth mode simulates a mission from orbit injection through comet encounter with optional Monte Carlo analysis. Midcourse maneuvers may be made to correct for burn errors and comet movements.

The production and concentration of these radionuclides depends on the beam parameters such as energy, intensity, particle type, and target configuration. The radionuclides produced in the soil can potentially migrate to the ground water. Soil activation and migration to the ground water depends {{on the details of}} the local hydrogeology. Generally, very few places such as the beam stops, target <b>stations,</b> <b>injection</b> and extraction sectors can have high enough radiation fields to produce radionuclides in the soil outside the enclosures.

40|$|Manure is {{increasingly}} being {{viewed as a}} threat to aquatic ecosystems due to the introduction of natural and synthetic hormones from land-application to agricultural fields. Of particular environmental concern are the natural hormones 17 α and 17 β -estradiol (E 2), estrone (E 1), estriol (E 3), testosterone (TST), and androstenedione (AND) and the synthetic hormones 17 β - and 17 α-trenbolone (TB) and trendione (TND). These compounds are known to cause endocrine disruption in sensitive aquatic organisms (e. g., fish, turtles) at ng/L concentrations. Despite the known negative effects of hormones on fish and other aquatic organisms, the fate and transport of hormones in agroecosystems remains poorly understood. Therefore, this dissertation assessed hormones released to receiving ditches from tile drained Midwestern fields under various manure applications practices. ^ The study was conducted at Purdue University 2 ̆ 7 s Animal Science Research and Education Center (ASREC), an EPA-designated concentrated animal feeding operation consisting of 600 ha of tile drained cropland in North Central Indiana. Animal wastes were stored on-site in lagoons and then land-applied through lagoon effluent pivot irrigation, solids broadcasting, and subsurface <b>injection.</b> Seven monitoring <b>stations</b> were installed to monitor flow and collect samples from four tile drain and three receiving ditch locations. ^ The hydro-chemo dynamics of hormones associated with various manure application practices were assessed, and hormone transport to tile drains was found to be rapid, likely due to the presence of preferential flow pathways. The chemograph dynamics observed during storm events showed concentrations generally following hydrograph trends, suggesting that high flow events contribute to the majority of hormone loads. Hormones also were found to persist over the winter with increased concentrations coinciding with early thaws and snow melt. The highest concentrations of hormones in the receiving ditches were observed in June, potentially posing a threat to fish during a sensitive time in their sexual development. These concentrations were associated with dairy effluent irrigation; however, the frequency of detection of hormones was higher for fields that had received higher applications of dairy solids. Therefore, it is likely that dairy effluent irrigation may cause short-lived high concentrations whereas the application of solid wastes may cause more chronic exposure to aquatic organisms. ^ The estrogen loads exported by the receiving ditches were estimated to be 3 ̆c 3...|$|R
40|$|Streams are {{commonly}} classified as 2 ̆ 2 gaining 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 losing 2 ̆ 2 {{according to their}} interactions with groundwater. However, the gaining and losing nature of a stream can vary in space and time. Understanding the spatial and temporal persistence of gaining and losing reaches is essential for understanding controls on stream health. This is particularly important during low flow conditions when water demand is high, affecting water resources and its users {{in the region as}} well as the ecological impacts within the stream and surrounding ecosystems. Hydrologic models are typically designed to simulate high flows, and are challenged by low flows. This problem will become more important as hydrologists are asked to forecast the increasing occurrence of low flows as a consequence of climate change. Low flow discharges have been a focus of research as they are occurring earlier in the summer and have longer durations throughout the fall. This study investigated the gaining and losing nature of a stream as well as the particular timing of gaining/losing transitions in a small watershed in Southwestern, Idaho during the 2012 calendar year. To understand the spatial and temporal changes occurring, chloride was used as a chemical tracer to measure discharge and monitor gains and losses by mass recovery in a 1200 m study reach. The study reach located between two gauging stations (2500 m apart) was divided into six 200 m sub-reaches where conductivity probes were placed to perform sequential multi-slug tracer injections at least once a month. Discharge results between slug <b>injections</b> and gauging <b>stations</b> did not always agree in magnitude, but did however show similar trends during both gaining and losing times. Also, the transition from gaining to losing conditions in late June was also captured by both of these methods. Although both methods of stream measurement agreed with one another, variations in streamflow were observed at the 200 m scale during the winter and spring. These variations were investigated and were contributed to connecting tributaries and hillslope springs, which were active from snowmelt and spring precipitation. During the summer recession, losing conditions were observed at all spatial scales and discharge measurements were the lowest at the beginning of August. From here on into the fall, discharge increased with continued losses, even though no significant precipitation occurred until the second week of October. I think the system is greatly affected by riparian vegetation, which resulted in the June transition as well as the increase in summer discharge when no other hydrologic controls were affecting streamflow...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest {{in the use of}} gas/vapour monitors and electronic nose instruments by the environmental, automotive and medical industries. These applications require low cost and low power sensors with high yield and high reproducibility, with an annual prospective market of 1 million pounds. Present device and sensor technologies suffer a major limitation, their incompatibility with a standard silicon CMOS process. These technologies have either operating/annealing temperatures unsuited for MOSFET operation or an inappropriate sensing mechanism. The aim of this research is the development of CMOS compatible gas/vapour sensors, with a low cost of fabrication, high device repeatability and, in the future, transducer sensor amalgamation. Two novel approaches have been applied, utilising bulk CMOS and SOI BiCMOS. The bulk CMOS designs use a MOSFET sensing structure, with an active polymeric gate material, operating at low temperatures (< 100 °C), based on an array device of four elements, with channel lengths of 10 μm or 5 μm. The SOI designs exploit a MOSFET heater with a chemoresistive or chemFET sensing structure, on a thin membrane formed by the epi-taxial layer. By applying SOI technology, the first use in gas sensor applications, operating temperatures of up to 300 °C can be achieved at a power cost of only 35 mW (simulated). Full characterisation of the bulk CMOS chemFET sensors has been performed using electrochemically deposited (e. g. poly(pyrrole) /BSA)) and composite polymers (e. g. poly(9 -vinylcarbazole)) to ethanol and toluene vapour in air. In addition, environmental factors (humidity and temperature) on the response and baseline were investigated. This was carried out using a newly developed flow <b>injection</b> analysis test <b>station,</b> which conditions the test vapour to precise analyte (< 15 PPM of toluene) and water concentrations at a fixed temperature (RT to 105 °C +- 0. 1), with the sensor characterised by either I-V or constant current instrumentation. N-channel chemFET sensors operated at constant current (10 μA) with electrochemically deposited and composite polymers showed sensitivities of up to 1. 1 μV/PPM and 4. 0 μV/PPM to toluene vapour and to 1. 1 μV/PPM and 0. 4 μV/PPM for ethanol vapour, respectively, with detection limits of < 20 PPM and < 100 PPM to toluene and < 20 PPM and 10 + PPM to ethanol vapour (limited by baseline noise), respectively. These responses followed either a power law (composite polymers) or a modified Langmuir isotherm model (electrochemically deposited polymers) with analyte concentration. It is proposed that this reaction-rate limited response is due to an alteration in polymers work function by either a partial charge transfer from the analyte or a swelling effect (polymer expansion). Increasing humidity caused, in nearly all cases a reduction in relative baseline, possible by dipole formation at the gate oxide surface. For the response, increasing humidity had no effect on sensors with composite polymers and an increase for sensors with electrochemically-deposited polymers. Higher temperatures caused a reduction in baseline signal, by a thermal expansion of the polymer, and a reduction in response explained by the analyte boiling point model describing a reduction in the bulk solubility of the polymer. Electrical and thermal characterisation of the SOI heaters, fabricated by the MATRA process, has been performed. I-V measurements show a reduction in drain current for a MOSFET after back-etching, by a degradation of the carrier mobility. Dynamic measurement showed a two stage thermal response (dual exponential), as the membrane reaching equilibrium (100 - 200 ms) followed by the bulk (1 - 2 s). A temperature coefficient of 8 mW/°C was measured, this was significantly higher than expected from simulations, explained by the membrane being only partially formed. Diode and resistive temperature sensors showed detection limits under 0. 1 °C and shown to measure a modulated heater output of less than 1 °C at frequencies higher than 10 Hz. The principal research objectives have been achieved, although further work on the SOI device is required. The results and theories presented in this study should provide a useful contribution to this research area...|$|R
