5|$|Evidence of {{tectonics}} on Enceladus is also {{derived from}} <b>grooved</b> terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges. These bands, first discovered by Voyager 2, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. <b>Grooved</b> terrains {{such as the}} Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of <b>grooved</b> terrain on Ganymede. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, <b>grooved</b> topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features. In other areas, these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running {{the length of the}} feature. Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts.|$|E
5|$|Much of this {{acceptance}} {{has been}} based on the erroneous assumption that the canines are <b>grooved</b> instead of ridged; <b>grooved</b> canines in Euchambersia would parallel the fangs of various venomous snakes as well as the venom-delivering incisors of the living solenodons. This interpretation, which has consistently appeared in literature published after 1986, was determined by Julien Benoit {{to be the result of}} the propagation of Broom's overly reconstructed diagram of the skull, without the context of the actual specimens. This line of evidence has been raised to support the necessity of a re-evaluation the hypothesis of a venomous bite in Euchambersia. Additionally, Benoit argued that <b>grooved</b> and ridged canines are not necessarily associated with venomous animals either, as shown by their presence in hippopotami, muntjacs, and baboons, in which they play a role in grooming or sharpening the teeth; in the latter two, ridged canines are also accompanied by a distinct fossa in front of the eye, which is entirely unconnected with venom. Furthermore, <b>grooved</b> and ridged teeth in non-venomous snakes are used to reduce suctional drag when capturing slippery prey like fish or invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that in most}} circumstances, some special treatment of an asphalt surface is required to improve aircraft braking in wet conditions.

30|$|<b>Groove</b> filling was {{the first}} method {{proposed}} in the literature to produce a composite by FSP (Mishra et al. 2003). It is simple and requires less machining. A straight <b>groove</b> can be produced on the workpiece using ordinary milling cutter. Recently, Gandra et al. (2011) has studied {{the position of the}} <b>groove</b> with respect to the tool pin and demonstrated that if the <b>groove</b> is placed under the pin, the powder distribution is found to be more compared with placing the <b>groove</b> outside the pin interaction area (advancing or retrieving). Another strategy was proposed by Heydarian et al. (2014) in <b>groove</b> filling method in which parallel <b>grooves</b> with gradient <b>groove</b> depths were produced and FSP was carried out. Compared with single <b>groove,</b> composite produced from the gradient <b>grooves</b> was found to have uniform distribution of the powder. Whereas the <b>groove</b> filling and closing method needs additional tools such as pin-less FSP tool, and also the process involves two cycles; one to close the <b>groove,</b> and the second to produce the composite. The amount of secondary phase that can be introduced into the workpiece is more in <b>groove</b> filling and closing method compared with simple <b>groove</b> filling method because it prevents the escape of filled particles during FSP.|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that a twin <b>groove</b> {{arrangement}} {{will provide a}} more effective lubrication and a cooler operation than a single <b>groove</b> one, but little evidence {{has been found in}} support of this claim. Furthermore, there are no experimental works, to the authors’ knowledge, that compare the performance of single and twin axial <b>groove</b> bearings with the same geometry. An experimental assessment of a journal bearing with either two axial <b>grooves</b> located at +/- 90 º or just one single <b>groove</b> at + 90 º to the load line was performed. The comparison was made by using the same bearing for both <b>groove</b> configurations but the oil feeding to the - 90 º <b>groove</b> was shut with a valve in one of the cases in order to emulate a single <b>groove</b> bearing. Measurements of total and partial lubricant flow rate through each <b>groove,</b> shaft locus, inner bush surface temperature, oil outlet temperature and electrical motor consumption were performed. For the range of applied loads tested the twin <b>groove</b> journal bearing displayed a lower maximum temperature but a higher outlet temperature and eccentricity than the single <b>groove</b> journal bearing. Also the measured total flow rate in the bearing was approximately the same for the single and the twin <b>groove</b> arrangements. For the twin <b>groove</b> bearing, the partial flow rate through each <b>groove</b> varied dramatically with increasing load: At high eccentricities the flow being supplied to the active land of the bearing through the + 90 º <b>groove</b> was much lower than that supplied to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º <b>groove.</b> Actually, the measured flow rate at the + 90 º <b>groove</b> was almost zero for the highest load tested, with nearly all the lubricant being fed to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º <b>groove.</b> This means that under heavy load operation, the existence of an extra <b>groove</b> at - 90 º to the load line might actually deteriorate lubrication effectiveness when compared with a single <b>groove</b> arrangement...|$|R

5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the <b>grooved</b> terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the <b>grooved</b> terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the <b>grooved</b> terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E
40|$|A {{plate-fin}} {{heat exchanger}} {{is a type}} of heat exchanger widely used in air conditioners, and tubes and fins are tightly assembled by the mechanical expansion process of tubes. The tube expansion process deforms the <b>grooves</b> inside the tube, and the <b>groove</b> shapes also affect the adhesion between tubes and fins. In this study, the adhesion and heat transfer performance affected by the tube expansion of the non-uniform <b>groove</b> shape tube with different heights are investigated by both analysis and experiments. From the analysis method, it was shown that the contact pressure of non-uniform <b>groove</b> tube is higher than that of the uniform <b>groove</b> tube, and the most appropriate high <b>groove</b> number of the non-uniform <b>groove</b> tube is designed for the maximum contact pressure. From the experimental results, the decreasing rate of the condensation heat transfer coefficient is smaller in the non-uniform <b>groove</b> tube with different heights, compared to the conventional uniform <b>groove</b> tube. Also, the air-side heat transfer coefficient of the non-uniform <b>groove</b> tube with different heights is higher than that of the uniform <b>groove</b> tubes...|$|R
