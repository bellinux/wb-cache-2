2500|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a set}} of complete dentures is a challenge for any dentist/denturist. [...] There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. [...] In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. [...] One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. [...] The dentist or <b>denturist</b> must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. [...] An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or <b>denturist,</b> to make the denture. A <b>denturist</b> is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A <b>denturist</b> not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture {{in his or her own}} laboratory. The <b>denturist</b> then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a <b>denturist.</b> Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. [...] The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. [...] These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. [...] The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. [...] Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. [...] Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for final processing. The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.|$|E
2500|$|Once the {{relative}} position of each arch {{to the other}} is known, the wax rim {{can be used as}} a base to place the selected denture teeth in correct position. [...] This arrangement of teeth is tested in the mouth so that adjustments can be made to the occlusion. After the occlusion has been verified by the dentist or <b>denturist</b> and the patient, and all phonetic requirements are met, the denture is processed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Denturists</b> have {{campaigned for}} the right to {{practice}} independently in many states, with the argument that they can provide greater access and lower-cost prosthetic services. This argument has been disproved by examining other jurisdictions in the world which have both dentists and <b>denturists.</b> For example, six years after the Canadian province of Ontario began regulating <b>denturists,</b> the fees quoted in their fee guide were similar to those of dentists. Consequently, most of these campaigns have so far failed.|$|R
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, <b>denturists</b> must {{operate under}} the {{supervision}} or oral health certificate of a dentist. Many dentists argue that this does not happen. For example, in 1991, investigators hired by the Arizona Dental Association found that only three out of the state's 13 <b>denturists</b> advised callers to see a dentist before visiting them. Many <b>denturists</b> argue that from a business point of view dentists are viewed as competition and in many locations dentists may [...] "steal their business" [...] after doing an exam.|$|R

2500|$|The {{process of}} {{fabricating}} a denture usually {{begins with an}} initial dental impression of the maxillary and mandibular ridges. Standard impression materials are used during the process. The initial impression is {{used to create a}} simple stone model that represents the maxillary and mandibular arches of the patient's mouth. This is not a detailed impression at this stage. Once the initial impression is taken, the stone model is used to create a 'Custom Impression Tray' which is used to take a second and much more detailed and accurate impression of the patient's maxillary and mandibular ridges. Polyvinylsiloxane impression material is one of several very accurate impression materials used when the final impression is taken of the maxillary and mandibular ridges. [...] A wax rim is fabricated to assist the dentist or <b>denturist</b> in establishing the vertical dimension of occlusion. [...] After this, a bite registration is created to marry the position of one arch to the other.|$|E

After capturing broad-based consumer support, the issue was placed on the ballot and passed by an overwhelming margin. Both the <b>denturists</b> and the dentists in Oregon adopted strategies similar to those used in Canada over 20 years ago when the issue was raised in a number of provinces. As was the case in Canada, the <b>denturists</b> prevailed. <b>Denturists</b> stressed the price differential and the issue of freedom of choice. Dentists stressed health and safety issues. The public perceived the dentists' campaign as negative and self-serving. This perception {{may have contributed to the}} election results.

Frailty is usually construed as a neg-ative term associated with various levels of dependency, although, as in all characteriza-tions of health and disability, the levels are indistinct. The dominant model of frailty portrays a person coping dynamically with the usual needs of daily life but with impaired neurolog-ical control and energy levels below a critical threshold. 1 This model incorporates a multi-tude of assets (e. g., strength, wealth, social sup-port) and deficits (e. g., chronic disease, poverty, social isolation) that either support or disturb social independence.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Dental {{services}} use by two cohorts {{under the}} universal dental {{plan for the}} elderly in Alberta, Canada, was examined. METHODS. Two birth cohorts 65 to 69 years old at entry who used the plan from 1978 to 1979 (n = 17, 816) or from 1985 to 1986 (n = 27, 474) were analyzed over 6 successive years for differences in dental services use and costs. RESULTS. The 1985 / 86 cohort received 24 % more visits per patient than the 1978 / 79 cohort. Their inflation-adjusted expenditures increased by 19 % mainly {{as a result of}} increases in denturists' expenditures (33 %) (dentists' expenditures increased just 4 % because of lower plan fee increases). The 1985 / 86 cohort received relatively many more periodontal and fewer denture services. Annual attendance over 6 consecutive years was high, especially for the 1985 / 86 cohort and dentists' patients; 55 % of the 1985 / 86 cohort who used dentists did so in 5 or all 6 years. CONCLUSIONS. Differences in plan expenditures per patient between the birth cohorts and dentists and <b>denturists,</b> along with the high continuity of care for dentists' patients, have important implications for planning and administering dental plans for the elderly.

Emerging economies are encouraged to develop a national strategic plan for oral health. International organizations have developed goals for oral health that can be referenced and adapted by emerging economies as they seek to formulate specific objectives for their countries. Demographic data that assess {{the nature and extent}} of oral diseases in a country are essential to sound planning and the development of an oral healthcare system that is relevant, effective and economically viable.
