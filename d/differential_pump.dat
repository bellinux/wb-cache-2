40|$|Slip Coupling {{came in a}} VW Golf 4 MOTION {{that same}} year {{and a year later}} it was {{presented}} in a Volvo S 60 AWD. The first generation Haldex LSC was based upon a unique patented <b>differential</b> <b>pump</b> that created a hydraulic flow proportional to the difference velocity over the coupling. With help of a linear throttle valve, activated with help of a stepper motor, the ‘stiffness ’ could be varied and the torque transfer controlled. One can see the Haldex system as a rotational damper with variable characteristics. Later, in the year 2002 Haldex Generation II was introduced. This second generation of Haldex LSC is still using the unique differential hydraulic pump, but the linear throttle valve has been exchanged for a solenoid controlled proportional throttle valve. On top of that a pressure sensor is introduced and used actively for closed loop pressure (torque) control, which created performance improvements especially within the limits of tyre-road adhesion. However, the mechanical-intelligence 1 is still there for disturbances beyond the bandwidth largely determined by the CAN communication, e. g. slip control and µ-jump. Also it offers great robustness to poor signal quality and CAN signal loss. In case of a broken CAN bus the fall back is a certain predefined stiffness value, which is a compromise between traction and manoeuvrability. LSC’s without this <b>differential</b> <b>pump</b> have to shut off and leave you in the bush, because there is not such compromising pre-emptive torque.

40|$|Source {{oxidation}} of easily oxidizing {{elements such}} as Ca, Sr, Ba, and Ti in an oxidizing ambient leads to their flux instability {{and is one of}} the biggest problems in the multi-elemental oxide Molecular Beam Epitaxy technique. Here we report a new scheme that can completely eliminate the source oxidation problem: a self-gettering <b>differential</b> <b>pump</b> using the source itself as the pumping medium. The pump simply comprises a long collimator mounted in front of the source in extended port geometry. With this arrangement, the oxygen partial pressure near the source was easily maintained well below the source oxidation regime, resulting in a stabilized flux, comparable to that of an ultra-high-vacuum environment. Moreover, this pump has a self-feedback mechanism that allows a stronger pumping effectiveness for more easily oxidizing elements, which is a desired property for eliminating the source oxidation problem.

40|$|Application of {{hydrodynamic}} cavitation for disinfection {{of water}} is gaining momentum, as it provides environmentally and economically sound options. In this effort, the effect of cavitating conditions created by <b>differential</b> <b>pump</b> valve opening and that created by flowing through a cavitating element (orifice plates) on the microbes (zooplankton in seawater) is described. The experimental results are compared with modeling of cavitating conditions that includes cavity dynamics, turbulence generated by individual oscillating cavity, cell wall strength and geometrical & operating parameters of cavitation device. Theoretical model for quantifying the cavitationally generated turbulent shear and extent of microbial disinfection has been developed. Experimental results indicated that cavitation and/or turbulent fluid shear dominantly originating from cavitation are effective tools for seawater disinfection as more than 80 % of the Zooplankton present in the seawater were killed. It was also observed that shock waves generated due to cavitation is not the sole cause for zooplankton disruption. A correct physical mechanism accounting fluid turbulence and shear, generated from stable oscillation of cavity, significantly contribute towards the disruption.

Eleven of these are to be equipped with the APS Undulator A and the other five with a Wiggler-A-type source. The Undulator A front ends are designed to operate in a ``windowless`` mode using an APS-designed <b>differential</b> <b>pump.</b> However, during beamline commissioning and early operations of the storage ring, it is prudent to install windows to ensure storage ring vacuum safety before easing into windowless operation.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{response}} of implantable rotary blood pump (IRBP) -assisted patients to exercise and head-up tilt (HUT), {{as well as the}} effect of alterations in the model parameter values on this response, using validated numerical models. Furthermore, we comparatively evaluate the performance of a number of previously proposed physiologically responsive controllers, including constant speed, constant flow pulsatility index (PI), constant average pressure difference between the aorta and the left atrium, constant average <b>differential</b> <b>pump</b> pressure, constant ratio between mean pump flow and pump flow pulsatility (ratio(P) I or linear Starling-like control), as well as constant left atrial pressure (P) over bar (ta) control, with regard to their ability to increase cardiac output during exercise while maintaining circulatory stability upon HUT. Although native cardiac output increases automatically during exercise, increasing pump speed was able to further improve total cardiac output and reduce elevated filling pressures. At the same time, reduced venous return associated with upright posture was not shown to induce left ventricular (LV) suction. Although (P) over bar (ta) control outperformed other control modes in its ability to increase cardiac output during exercise, it caused a fall in the mean arterial pressure upon HUT, which may cause postural hypotension or patient discomfort. To the contrary, maintaining constant average pressure difference between the aorta and the left atrium demonstrated superior performance in both exercise and HUT scenarios. Due to their strong dependence on the pump operating point, PI and ratio(PI) control performed poorly during exercise and HUT. Our simulation results also highlighted the importance of the baroreflex mechanism in determining {{the response of}} the IRBP-assisted patients to exercise and postural changes, where desensitized reflex response attenuated the percentage increase in cardiac output during exercise and substantially reduced the arterial pressure upon HUT...|$|E

40|$|As {{shown by}} {{theoretical}} and experimental results in this thesis, a carefully designed UV-IMS[PID] coupling with oa-TOFMS was successfully self set up. It offers high transmission, simple spectrum, high speed {{and it is}} able to record the whole mass spectrum quasi simultaneously. These features make it attractive to identify ions, fragments or ion clusters in IMS and to conduct high-throughput molecular analysis of large libraries for compound confirmation and purity assessment. By simulation with SIMION v. 7. 0 it was proved that the configuration of the three stage <b>differential</b> <b>pump</b> system and the Einzel lens was suitable for an orthogonal design of an interface between atmospheric pressure and the TOFMS. The pinhole interface system to the UV-IMS [PID]-TOF was characterized by studying a two and a three stage interface. They are optimized and proved to be able to identify ions that has been ionized in IMS. This device has been proved to have unique benefits for volatile organic compounds analysis. The detection limits are in the range of 0. 8 µg/L for acetone, 8. 6 µg/L for ethanol and 17. 2 µg/L for benzene with direct permeation sampling. The instrument has a dynamic range of about 3 decades for all detected compounds. A wide range of applications including chemical weapon simulation substances detection as well as fungal analysis were achieved with this device. It yields simple spectra that facilitate analysis. Compared the results of TOF spectra with UV-IMS spectra, most VOCs appearing in UV-IMS are monomer or protonated monomer ions.

40|$|Abstract Effect of fine {{graphite}} flake, carbon nanotube, {{and carbon}} nanofiber additives on {{the efficiency of}} an external gear pump driving an ethanol-based closed hydraulic loop was investigated experimentally. A number of graphite, carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) dispersions in ethanol were prepared with concentrations ranging from 194 - 1500 ppm. The fluids were investigated in an external gear pump with a maximum operating pressure of 100 psi. Pump inlet pressure, volumetric flow rate, and electric power consumption data were recorded over a range of pump discharge pressures. The power consumed by the motor at a given <b>differential</b> <b>pump</b> pressure was found to remain approximately constant for all additive concentrations. It was found that increases in both volumetric flow rate and overall pump efficiency were observed when pure ethanol {{was replaced by the}} colloidal suspensions. This was attributed to a roller bearing effect caused by the alignment and self-lubrication of the colloidal additives when confined to micro-scale clearances between the gear surfaces. It was found that that pump performance was also a function on the CNT aspect ratio and could very from pump to pump, or even after a pump was disassembled and reassembled. This indicates that the clearance geometry between the gears and between the housing may play a critical role. To examine any potential structural changes in the additives, environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) images of the additives were obtained before and after extended run periods within the pump. The results indicate that graphite and CNTs retained significant resilience, i. e. no breakage and deformation was observed. However, the very long aspect ratio CNFs appear to have undergone some scission. To examine any issues with filterability, iii graphite and CNT suspensions were run through two filters of different size and composition and the filters where then qualitatively examined using ESEM images. The results indicate that a considerable amount of the additives were filtered from the suspension. This indicates that filterability is an issue {{that needs to be addressed}} if these suspensions were to be used in industrial applications...|$|E
