40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} two new chelating materials derived from succinylated mercerized cellulose (cell 1). Cell 1 was activated through two different methods by using diisopropylcarbodiimide and acetic anhydride (to form an <b>internal</b> <b>anhydride)</b> and reacted with triethylenetetramine {{in order to obtain}} cell 2 and 4. New modified celluloses were characterized by mass percent gain, concentration of amine functions, elemental analysis, and infrared spectroscopy. Cell 2 and 4 showed degrees of amination of 2. 8 and 2. 3 mmol/g and nitrogen content of 6. 07 % and 4. 61 %, respectively. The capacity of cell 2 and 4 to adsorb Cu 2 +, Cd 2 +, and Pb 2 + ions from single aqueous solutions were examined. The effect of contact time, pH, and initial concentration of metal ions on the metal ions uptake was also investigated. Adsorption isotherms were well fitted by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity of cell 2 and 4 were found to be 56. 8 and 69. 4 mg/g for Cu 2 +; 68. 0 and 87. 0 mg/g for Cd 2 +; and 147. 1 and 192. 3 mg/g for Pb 2 +, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} two new chelating materials, MMSCB 3 and 5, derived fromsuccinylated twice-mercerized sugarcane bagasse (MMSCB 1). MMSCB 3 and 5 were synthesized from MMSCB 1 using two different methods as described by Gurgel and Gil (2009). In the first method MMSCB 1 was activated with 1, 3 -diisopropylcarbodiimide {{and in the second}} with acetic anhydride (to form an <b>internal</b> <b>anhydride)</b> and later both were reacted with triethylenetetramine in order to obtain MMSCB 3 and 5. New obtained materials were characterized by mass percent gain, concentration of amine groups, FTIR, and elemental analysis. MMSCB 3 and 5 showed mass percent gain of 19. 9 and 57. 1 %, concentration of amine groups of 2. 0 and 2. 1 mmol/g, and nitrogen content of 5. 8 and 4. 4 %. The capacity of MMSCB 3 and 5 to adsorb Cu 2 þ, Cd 2 þ, and Pb 2 þ from aqueous single metal ion solutions was evaluated at different contact times, pHs, and initial metal ion concentrations. Adsorption isotherms were well fitted by Langmuir model. Maximum adsorption capacities of MMSCB 3 and 5 for Cu 2 þ, Cd 2 þ, and Pb 2 þ were found to be 59. 5 and 69. 4, 86. 2 and 106. 4, 158. 7 and 222. 2 mg/g, respectively...|$|E
50|$|Fittig's {{research}} covered wide {{areas of}} organic chemistry. The aldehydes and ketones provided material for his earlier work. He observed that aldehydes and ketones may suffer reduction in neutral, alkaline, and sometimes acid solution to secondary and tertiary glycols, substances which he named pinacones; {{and also that}} certain pinacones when distilled with dilute sulfuric acid gave compounds, which he named pinacolines. The unsaturated acids also received much attention, and he discovered the <b>internal</b> <b>anhydrides</b> of oxyacids, termed lactones. In 1863 he introduced the reaction known by his name. In 1855 Charles-Adolphe Wurtz had shown that when sodium acted upon alkyl iodides, the alkyl residues combined to form more complex hydrocarbons; Fittig developed this method by showing that a mixture of an aromatic and alkyl haloid, under similar treatment, yielded homologues of benzene. His investigations on Perkin's reaction led him to an explanation of its mechanism which appeared to be more {{in accordance with the}} facts. The question, however, is one of much difficulty, and the exact course of the reaction appears to await solution. These researches incidentally solved the constitution of coumarin, the odoriferous principle of woodruff. Fittig and Erdmann's observation that phenyl isocrotonic acid readily yielded α-naphthol by loss of water was of much importance, since it afforded valuable evidence as to the constitution of naphthalene. They also investigated certain hydrocarbons occurring in the high boiling point fraction of the coal tar distillate and solved the constitution of phenanthrene. We also owe much of our knowledge of the alkaloid piperine to Fittig, who in collaboration with Ira Remsen established its constitution in 1871.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePolypropylene/organoclay nanocomposites {{have been}} {{prepared}} via direct melt intercalation in an <b>internal</b> mixer. Maleic <b>anhydride</b> grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) {{was used as a}} compatibilizer to improve the dispersability of the clay. The structures of nanocomposites have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and rheometry in small amplitude oscillatory shear. The effects of concentration of PP-g-MA and processing parameters were investigated. Wide angle X-ray diffraction shows that the interlayer spacing increases with the concentration of PP-g-MA, but is not significantly influenced by processing conditions. The study of linear viscoelastic properties shows that the storage modulus G′ is very sensitive to the microstructure of the nanocomposite. A Carreau-Yasuda law with a yield stress is proposed to describe the rheological behavior of these materials. Applications to the twin screw extrusion process are also presente...|$|R
