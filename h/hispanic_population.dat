5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85.

These findings allowed us to define two regional groups, the West and the East. In the former, Native American contributions ranged from 35. 58 % to 57. 87 %; in the East region the values ranged from 0 % to 21. 27 %. An African influence was similar in both regions, ranging from 0 % to 17. 11 %, with a tendency of increasing in the East region.
