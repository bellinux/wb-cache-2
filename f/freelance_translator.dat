5|$|On 22 November 2011, <b>freelance</b> <b>translator</b> Nazerine {{released}} a fan translation patch {{of the free}} demo version of the game. The initial project involved Nazerine translating, writing, and revising the game text, while another person hacked the game so that the translated text displayed properly on the game screen. This English patch launched {{the first wave of}} western interest in the game, with several video game publications reporting on it due to the game's unusual concept. The success of this translation attracted the attention of Hato Moa herself, who then offered Nazerine the opportunity to translate the full game—and later its sequel, Holiday Star—for an official English release. The translation process of the full game was also a solo effort by Nazerine; however, Hato removed the need for hacking by directly supervising the translation, adjusting images in the game for English sentences. As the demo's English patch was made before Nazerine had access to the full version of the game, several lines of dialogue were translated differently to reflect context revealed in Bad Boys Love; for example, third-person pronouns from Kazuaki Nanaki's route implying that he had a female lover in the fan translation were replaced with gender-neutral ones in the official translation. Few dramatic changes were made, though several jokes were added in Nazerine's translations of the game that were not present in the original Japanese text. The official English version of the game was released for download on 15 February 2012. The 2014 remake has also been confirmed to have used Nazerine's translation.|$|E

D., Department of Distributed and Dependable Systems Abstract: The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to create a}} {{software}} solution that will allow translation agencies to better collaborate with <b>freelance</b> <b>translators</b> who do not own expensive translation tools. One part of the software solution is an information system with a graphical appli- cation that will allow translation agency staff to remotely assign documents for translation and manage them. Another part is a graphic application for <b>freelance</b> <b>translators</b> with an integrated graphic translations editor, in which translators will translate speci ed les. The software solution is primarily designed to sup- port the SDLXLIFF commercial translation format {{so that it can be}} reused in the original SDL Trados Studio application. In the text part of the thesis we present in detail the issue of translations and formats used for their sharing. It also presents the design, analysis and deve- lopment of the mentioned information system and graphical user applications. Subsequently, the structure of the implemented software solution is described. Keywords: Sdlxli tmx translation editor wcf [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A two-part {{study was}} {{launched}} {{in light of the}} Japan Translation Federation’s 2012 statement in its guide, 翻訳で失敗しないために翻訳発注の手引き [lit.

It is a fundamental principle that professional translators work into their native languages] (Japan Translation Federation, 2012, p. 15). The key goal is to gauge the extent to which this 2012 statement is reflected in current practices among the sellers and buyers of translation services between Japanese and English. In this paper, which describes {{the first part of the}} study, the focus is on the practices of sellers of translation services between Japanese and English: specifically, professional <b>freelance</b> <b>translators.</b> Twenty-four professional <b>freelance</b> <b>translators</b> completed an online questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire, first, suggest that current practices among sellers of translation services between Japanese and English are consistent with the Japan Translation Federation’s 2012 statement and, second, broadly support secondary literature on L 1 translation (translation into the first language) and L 2 translation (translation into the second language). Whilst this is only a snapshot of current practices among sellers of translation services between Japanese and English, the overall results are informative. In the second, follow-up part of the study the focus will be on the current practices of buyers of translation services between Japanese and English...|$|R
