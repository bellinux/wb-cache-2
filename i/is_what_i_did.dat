2500|$|When Edwards' signing was {{announced}}, it {{was also}} announced that Callaham's first draft would be rewritten by another writer. In July 2011, David S. Goyer was attached to rewrite the script. Goyer only worked a few weeks on the script and did not get any credit, stating, [...] " [...] a little bit. [...] I mean I did {{three or four weeks}} of work on Godzilla, it wasn’t a page-one rewrite or anything like that. [...] The term is ‘script doctoring,’ <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on it." [...] In November 2011, Max Borenstein was hired to continue work on the script. In October 2012, Legendary announced that writer Drew Pearce would polish the script, making the principal characters older to suit the actors that Legendary had intended to cast.|$|E

60|$|Well, I was smarting under a {{sense of}} defeat. Undeserved defeat, but what of that? That didn't soften the smart any. And {{to think of the}} circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any {{political}} firmament for centuries, sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith! And I could see that those others were sorry for me--which made me blush till I could smell my whiskers scorching. Put yourself in my place; feel as mean as I did, as ashamed as I felt--wouldn't you have struck below the belt to get even? Yes, you would; it is simply human nature. Well, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I am not trying to justify it; I'm only saying that I was mad, and anybody would have done it.|$|E
60|$|I almost {{regretted that}} my theory about the well's trouble was correct, because I had {{another one that}} had a showy point or two {{about it for a}} miracle. I remembered that in America, many centuries later, when an oil well ceased to flow, they used to blast it out with a {{dynamite}} torpedo. If I should find this well dry and no explanation of it, I could astonish these people most nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite bomb into it. It was my idea to appoint Merlin. However, it was plain that there was no occasion for the bomb. One cannot have everything the way he would like it. A man has no business to be depressed by a disappointment, anyway; he ought to make up his mind to get even. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I said to myself, I am in no hurry, I can wait; that bomb will come good yet. And it did, too.|$|E
60|$|I venture this {{explicit}} statement because, amidst much sympathetic appreciation, I have detected {{here and there}} a note, as it were, of suspicion. Suspicion of facts concealed, of explanations held back, of inadequate motives. But what is lacking in the facts is simply what I did not know, and what is not explained <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand myself, and what seems inadequate is the fault of my imperfect insight. And all that I could not help. In the case of this book I was unable to supplement these deficiences by the exercise of my inventive faculty. It was never very strong; and on this occasion its use would have seemed exceptionally dishonest. It is from that ethical motive and not from timidity that I elected to keep strictly within the limits of unadorned sincerity and to try to enlist the sympathies of my readers without assuming lofty omniscience or descending to the subterfuge of exaggerated emotions.|$|E

6000|$|The subjugation of Aunt Plessington was difficult, but not {{altogether}} hopeless, Marjorie felt, provided her rejection of Magnet {{had not been}} taken {{as an act of}} personal ingratitude. There was a case on her side. She was discovering, for example, that Trafford had a really very considerable range of acquaintance among quite distinguished people; big figures like Evesham and MacHaldo, for example, were intelligently interested in the trend of his work. She felt this gave her a basis for Plessingtonian justifications. She could produce those people--as one shows one's loot. She could imply, [...] "Oh, Love and all that nonsense! Certainly not! This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it for." [...] With skill and care and good luck, and a word here and there in edgeways, she believed {{she might be able to}} represent the whole adventure as the well-calculated opening of a campaign on soundly Plessingtonian lines. Her marriage to Trafford, she tried to persuade herself, might be presented as something almost as brilliant and startling as her aunt's swoop upon her undistinguished uncle.|$|E

At first I thought {{that would be a very}} good thing, for you would be separated from her, and that's what you need and deserve. Young men are young men, and they are often a good deal kinder than they would be if they stopped to think. But a person of mature age is different. He would know what is due to himself and his standing in society. At least, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> think. But it suddenly flashed on me that they might want to get away as quick as they could--which would be proper, dear knows--and it would be just like you to go with them.

6000|$|... ...It is very difficult, {{and even}} pretty painful, {{to try to}} put forward after the fact the {{considerations}} and emotions that have been intense for one in the long ferment of an artistic process: but I must nevertheless do something toward making you see a little perhaps how ... the editing of those earliest things other than [...] "rigidly" [...] had for me a sort of exquisite inevitability. From the moment of those of my weeks in Cambridge of 1911 during which I began, by a sudden turn of talk with your Mother, to dally {{with the idea of a}} [...] "Family Book," [...] this idea took on for me a particular light, the light which hasn't varied, through all sorts of discomfitures and difficulties--and disillusionments, and in which in fact I have put the thing through. That turn of talk was the germ, it dropped the seed. Once when I had been [...] "reminiscing" [...] over some matters of your Dad's and my old life of the time previous, far previous, to her knowing us, over some memories of our Father and Mother and the rest of us, I had moved her to exclaim with the most generous appreciation and response, [...] "Oh Henry, why don't you write these things?"--with such an effect that after a bit I found myself wondering vaguely whether I mightn't do something of the sort. But it dated from those words of your Mother's, which gave me the impulse and determined the spirit of my vision--a spirit and a vision as far removed as possible from my mere isolated documentation of your Father's record. We talked again, and still again, of the [...] "Family Book," [...] and by the time I came away I felt I had somehow found my inspiration, though the idea could only be most experimental, and all at the mercy of my putting it, perhaps defeatedly, to the proof. It was such a very special and delicate and discriminated thing to do, and only governable by proprieties and considerations all of its own, as I should evidently, in the struggle with it, more and more find. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> find above all in coming at last to work these Cambridge letters into the whole harmony of my text--the general purpose of which was to be a reflection of all the amenity and felicity of our young life of that time at the highest pitch that was consistent with perfect truth--to show us all at our best for characteristic expression and colour and variety and everything that would be charming. And when I laid hands upon the letters to use as so many touches and tones in the picture, I frankly confess I seemed to see them in a better, or at all events in another light, here and there, than those rough and rather illiterate copies I had from you showed at their face value. I found myself again in such close relation with your Father, such a revival of relation as I hadn't known since his death, and which was a passion of tenderness for doing the best thing by him that the material allowed, and which I seemed to feel him in the room and at my elbow asking me for as I worked and as he listened. It was as if he had said to me on seeing me lay my hands on the weak little relics of our common youth, [...] "Oh but you're not going to give me away, to hand me over, in my raggedness and my poor accidents, quite unhelped, unfriendly: you're going to do the very best for me you can, aren't you, and since you appear to be making such claims for me you're going to let me seem to justify them as much as I possibly may?" [...] And it was as if I kept spiritually replying to this that he might indeed trust me to handle him with the last tact and devotion--that is do with him everything I seemed to feel him like, for being kept up to the amenity pitch. These were small things, the very smallest, they appeared to me all along to be, tiny amendments in order of words, degrees of emphasis &c., to the end that he should be more easily and engagingly readable and thereby more tasted and liked--from the moment there was no excess of these soins and no violence done to his real identity. Everything the letters meant affected me so, in all the business, as of our old world only, mine and his alone together, with every item of it intimately known and remembered by me, that I daresay I did instinctively regard it at last as all my truth, to do what I would with.... I have to the last point the instinct and the sense for fusions and interrelations, for framing and encircling (as I think I have already called it) every part of my stuff in every other--and that makes a danger when the frame and circle play over too much upon the image. Never again shall I stray from my proper work--the one in which that danger is the reverse of one and becomes a rightness and a beauty....|$|E
