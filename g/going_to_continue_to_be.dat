After winning the role, Budig further {{explained}} {{her interest in}} the part and her early portrayal of the character: [...] "This was a recurring role," [...] she stated. [...] "I didn't {{have to go in}} and test [...] the process proceeded swiftly." [...] Judy [...] told me that Greenlee was a bad girl who comes to Pine Valley and causes trouble. It was the summer; I figured there wasn't going to be anything going on in L.A. [...] why not go back to New York? Plus, I never get to play the bad girl and delve into the dark side. I'm always playing the good girl. It's been exciting because the role has really come to fruition these past three months. Her dad's a drunk, her mother pays no attention to her, she lives with her grandmother [...] she's pathetically desperate, kind of like me. I'm kidding. I love her name; it's so debutante. I think she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a spoiler.|$|E

"If Christianity, {{as one of}} {{the ancient}} popes is said to have remarked, were merely a {{profitable}} fable," [...] the rector continued, [...] "there might be something in your contention that St. John's, as a church, had reached the pinnacle of success. But let us ignore the spiritual side of this matter as non-vital, and consider it from the practical side. We have the most influential people in the city, but we have not their children. That does not promise well for the future. The children get more profit out of the country clubs. And then there is another question: is it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> profitable? Is it as profitable now as it was, say, twenty years ago? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mine? You don't {{mean to say}} {{you suppose}} I own it!" [...] George Flack shouted. The light {{projected}} upon her innocence by his tone {{was so strong that}} the girl blushed, and he went on more tenderly: [...] "It's a pretty sight, the way you and your sister take that sort of thing for granted. Do you think property grows on you like a moustache? Well, it seems as if it had, on your father. If I owned the Reverberator I wouldn't be stumping round here; I'd give my attention to another branch of the business. That is I'd give my attention to all, but I wouldn't go round with the delivery-cart. Still, I'm going to capture the blamed thing, and I want you to help me," [...] the young man went on; [...] "that's just what I wanted to speak to you about. It's a big proposition as it stands, but I mean to make it bigger: the most universal society-paper the world has seen. That's where the future lies, and the man who sees it first is the man who'll make his pile. It's a field for enlightened enterprise that hasn't yet begun to be worked." [...] He continued, glowing as if on a sudden with his idea, and one of his knowing eyes half-closed itself for an emphasis habitual with him when he talked consecutively. The effect of this would have been droll to a listener, the note of the prospectus mingling with the question of his more intimate hope. But it was not droll to Francie; she only thought it, or supposed it, a proof of the way Mr. Flack saw everything on a stupendous scale. [...] "There are ten thousand things to do that haven't been done, and I'm going to do them. The society-news of every quarter of the globe, furnished by the prominent members themselves--oh THEY can be fixed, you'll see!--from day to day and from hour to hour and served up hot at every breakfast-table in the United States: that's what the American people want and that's what the American people are going to have. I wouldn't say it to every one, but I don't mind telling you, that I consider my guess as good as the next man's on what's going to be required in future over there. I'm going for the inside view, the choice bits, the chronique intime, as they say here; what the people want's just what ain't told, and I'm going to tell it. Oh they're bound to have the plums! That's about played out, anyway, the idea of sticking up a sign of 'private' and 'hands off' and 'no thoroughfare' and thinking you can keep the place to yourself. You ain't going to be able any longer to monopolise any fact of general interest, and it ain't going to be right you should; it ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> possible to keep out anywhere the light of the Press. Now what I'm going to do is to set up the biggest lamp yet made and make it shine all over the place. We'll see who's private then, and whose hands are off, and who'll frustrate the People--the People THAT WANTS TO KNOW. That's a sign of the American people that they DO want to know, and it's the sign of George P. Flack," [...] the young man pursued with a rising spirit, [...] "that he's going to help them. But I'll make the touchy folks crowd in THEMSELVES with their information, and as I tell you, Miss Francie, it's a job in which you can give me a lovely lift." ...|$|E

5000|$|In May, {{elections}} for the city council of Vienna followed: out of 165 mandates the social democrats won 100 seats. Jakob Reumann became the first social-democratic mayor of Vienna. Vienna was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the stronghold of the socialists in a largely conservative-governed nation. The socialist-led city government built the first Gemeindebauten for the working class, such as the Karl-Marx-Hof, Sandleitenhof, and the public housing estates on the Gürtel ring road, and instituted social, healthcare and educational reforms. These measures indeed ameliorated the living conditions for workers and raised their standard of living. This deepened the ties of workers towards the party and created a large pool of loyalists on whom the party could always depend, giving rise to the term [...] "Rotes Wien" [...] (Red Vienna) of the 1920s.|$|E

Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit. When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue, Barkley replied, [...] "It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems.

50|$|The first President's Science and Technology Advisor was James R. Killian, {{appointed}} in 1958 by President Dwight D.

President Eisenhower realized then that if Americans were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the world leader in scientific, technological and military advances, the government would need to provide support. After World War II, the US government began to formally provide support for scientific research and to establish the general structure by which science is conducted in the US. The foundation for modern American science policy was laid way out in Vannevar Bush's Science - the Endless Frontier, submitted to President Truman in 1945. Vannevar Bush was President Roosevelt's science advisor and {{became one of the most}} influential science advisors as, in his essay, he pioneered how we decide on science policy today. He made recommendations to improve the following three areas: national security, health, and the economy—the same three focuses we have today.|$|E

Police Chief Nate Harper began disciplinary measures against Wallace, but the reprimand was rescinded by Huss.|$|E
5000|$|Before her casting on Glee, Naya Rivera {{had made}} {{numerous}} appearances in small roles on popular primetime television shows. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought actors who could {{identify with the}} rush of starring in theatrical roles. Auditioning actors with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act. Rivera drew on her own high school experience of unpopularity {{to prepare for the}} role, as well as watching films such as Mean Girls to [...] "really get in the zone and feel like a bitchy Sophomore".

Santana played a more prominent part in the last nine episodes of Glee first season. Rivera commented: [...] "Santana's been wreaking havoc with people's boyfriends and people's babies and teachers—she's the high school terror, and she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the villain."
