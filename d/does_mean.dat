25|$|Lebanese Protestant scholar Kamal Salibi (1929–2011) {{observes that}} , which {{literally}} <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> tenth, might more loosely {{be used to}} mean portion, and , or from all, might refer just to food in the giver's possession, so that the whole verse might mean He gave him a portion of food..|$|E
25|$|Many people {{assert that}} this {{abandonment}} of the god hypothesis means the abandonment of all religion and all moral sanctions. This is simply not true. But it <b>does</b> <b>mean,</b> once our relief at jettisoning an outdated piece of ideological furniture is over, that we must construct something to take its place.|$|E
25|$|Taliesin was a British poet, or bard, of the 6th Century. The {{details of}} his life are sketchy and come only from his own poetry, so Bond filled in {{specific}} elements to suit her story. As mentioned in the book, Bedd Taliesin <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> 'Taliesins' grave', but his actual burial site is unknown. Although later mythology places him {{in the court of}} King Arthur, Bond wanted Taliesin to appear as real as possible, to help ground the fantasy sections of the book in reality.|$|E

25|$|Since the victims' fund {{made all}} its {{payments}} and closed in 2003, Lieberman will not receive any money. The decision <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that Philip's name {{can be added}} to official memorials to the victims. One to her specifically has already been established at Dutchess Community College, where her mother works as a computer programmer. The family buried an urn full of ashes from Ground Zero at a cemetery near their home. Six months after the appeals court decision, in July 2008, the family was officially notified by the city that Philip had been added to the victims' list.|$|E
25|$|On Jefferson's {{isolated}} mountaintop, sex {{took place}} {{as part of}} a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not share our current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his concubine, she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} various {{influenza}} strains to show species-selectivity is {{largely due to}} variation in the hemagglutinin genes. Genetic mutations in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single amino acid substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to receptors on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types. This doesn't mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
25|$|What {{is notable}} {{is that the}} {{majority}} of these urban areas are in the upper reaches of either the Trent itself, {{as is the case with}} Stoke, or the tributaries. For example, Birmingham lies at the upper end of the Tame, and Leicester is located towards the head of the Soar. Whilst this is not unique for an English river, it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that there is an ongoing legacy of issues relating to urban runoff, pollution incidents, and effluent dilution from sewage treatment, industry and coal mining. Historically, these issues resulted in a considerable deterioration in the water quality of both the Trent, and its tributaries, especially the Tame. To bring clean water to the West Midlands, Birmingham Corporation created a large reservoir chain and aqueduct system to bring water from the Elan Valley.|$|E
25|$|The {{generally}} hot {{climate of}} the Barossa Valley usually means that the grapes become ripe very easily {{with high levels of}} sugars and low levels of acids. Winemaking in the Barossa Valley often utilizes the process of acidification in order to add balance to the wine. The high alcohol levels from the fermented sugars may be offset by various winemaking practices including reverse osmosis and adding water to the must. Historically, winemakers in the Barossa Valley have utilized very short maceration periods that limit {{the amount of time that}} the wines spends in contact with the skin. Often the wine is racked off the skins into oak wine barrels before fermentation is even completed. While this <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that supplemental tannins might need to be added, this short maceration often leaves the wines with a smooth mouthfeel. The extensive use of oak is also a characteristic of Barossa Valley winemaking with American oak, with its more aggressive dill and coconut aroma notes, often used more than French oak.|$|E

25|$|Westcountry Television, another {{independent}} company, replaced Television South West at 00:00 GMT on 1 January 1993. The first programme {{aired on}} the channel was a video welcoming viewers to Westcountry and promising {{higher levels of}} regional commitment. Later, Westcountry was purchased by Carlton Television, {{and it is now}} simply part of the ITV Network. However, since that original commitment to regional programming in 1993 (and approximately 16 hours of regional programmes per week), in 2007 this had been reduced to less than seven hours per week. There is no longer any mention of Westcountry on the ITV network in Cornwall, except for a vague verbal mention before a local programme is shown. Despite this, Westcountry Television has remained committed to Cornwall since launch, and have two small news studios in the county at Truro and Penzance. There is also a five-minute opt-out, broadcast from Redruth transmitting station of news stories specific {{to the west of the}} ITV Westcountry region (there are three others, based in Barnstaple, Plymouth and Exeter.) It <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> though that those viewers in the east of the county receive news aimed at Plymouth City and the South Hams areas, as the Caradon Hill transmitting station covers Plymouth and Mid and South Devon as well as east Cornwall.|$|E

In 2007 the SPFA was replaced by a new body, PFA Scotland, but the new organisation's awards are considered to be a direct continuation of the SPFA awards.|$|E

500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E

Although the extreme lack {{of water in the}} Great Basin makes this distinction of little current practical use, it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that in wetter times the lake that once filled Death Valley (Lake Manly) was the last stop for water flowing in the region, meaning the water there was saturated in dissolved materials. Thus the salt pans in Death Valley are among the largest in the world and are rich in minerals, such as borax and various salts and hydrates. The largest salt pan in the park extends [...] from the Ashford Mill Site to the Salt Creek Hills, covering some [...] of the valley floor. The best known playa in the park is the Racetrack, known for its moving rocks.|$|E
500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E

500|$|SmarTrip and CharmCard have {{different}} qualifications for inter-system usage, e.g. using CharmCard on non-MTA providers, and using SmarTrip on MTA. Passes and non-cash loads (such as employee transit benefits) are stored {{on the card}} in a separate [...] "purse" [...] from cash loads. Purse benefits can only be used on the issuing system for that benefit, so a day pass issued by MTA on either a CharmCard or SmarTrip will only be valid on MTA, and a WMATA-issued monthly pass will not be valid on MTA {{even if it was}} loaded on a CharmCard. This <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> it is possible to have identical or different passes (like a monthly pass from one and a day pass from the other) from both WMATA and MTA simultaneously loaded on the same card. Monthly transit benefits provided by an employer will only be valid for whichever system the employer is registered with, so an employer who is registered to provide transit benefits with WMATA will only grant benefits usable on WMATA and Washington, DC-area transit providers, even if the benefits are loaded on a CharmCard. Cash loaded on either card is valid on both WMATA and MTA vehicles. This also means purse funds cannot be used for cash equivalents, so a person who is authorized for a monthly bus pass in employee benefits cannot use that benefit to pay for rail travel or a day pass.|$|E
