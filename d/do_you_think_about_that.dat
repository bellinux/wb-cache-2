But I begin to think I had better get out of this paltry boat, for my bulk swells to a very unusual degree, and if we are not the more careful, she will presently be swamped.” ...|$|E

5000|$|First, to sum {{the demand}} {{functions}} without other strong assumptions {{it must be}} assumed that they are independent; that is that one consumer's demand decisions are not influenced by the decisions of another consumer. For example, A is asked how many pairs of shoes he would buy at a certain price. A says at that price I would be {{willing and able to}} buy two pairs of shoes. B is asked the same question and says four pairs. Questioner goes back to A and says B is willing to buy four pairs of shoes, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> A says if B has any interest in those shoes then I have none. Or A, not to be outdone by B, says [...] "then I'll buy five pairs". And on and on. This problem can be eliminated by assuming that the consumers' tastes are fixed in the short run. This assumption can be expressed as assuming that each consumer is an independent idiosyncratic decision maker.|$|E

At {{the end of the day}} thats all thats important. Everything else is irrelevant." [...] —Larry Mullen Jr. In the early days of U2, his {{contributions}} to the band were often limited to fills and drum rolls, but he became more involved in the writing of the songs later, particularly in conjunction with Adam Clayton, his partner in the rhythm section, with whom he has collaborated on solo projects. When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2s songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of “spinning ” involves investment bankers allocating lucrative shares in {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs) to executives they are courting. For example, an investment banker courting the business of Joseph Cayre allocated 100, 000 shares of Pixar Animation Studios to him when Pixar went public. Cayre sold the shares that day for a $ 2 million profit. Cristina Morgan, the managing director of investment banking at Hambrecht & Quist, sees nothing unfair in spinning. Allocating hot IPOs to corporate executives, according to Morgan, is neither illegal nor immoral. It’s a business decision. “What we’re talking about is trying to solicit business,” said Morgan {{in an interview with}} Michael Siconolfi (1997). “What do you think about taking them out to dinner? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> We throw lavish parties with caviar. Is that not trying to influence them, their behavior? I suggest that it is ” (p. A 1). In such ways, many investment bankers, security analysts, traders, and other finance professionals seem to behave as if they lived in a cocoon. Finance professionals can take pride in the contributions they make to society by analyzing the value of companies and stocks, linking entrepreneurs with investors, and operating markets that provide liquidity and optimal sharing of risk. Finance professionals favor regulations that promote fairness, but too often they maintain the naive belief that their own perceptions of fairness are shared by all. They are not. James Penrose (1997) reacted to Morgan’s defenses as follows: “Are [investment bankers] really unable to see any distinction between a golf outing or a dinner with a favored client and a payoff of several hundred thousand dollars? ” (p. A 23). Social norms, including rules of fairness, are rules of behavior enforced by the community. They often make their way into the law. People who violate rules of fairness that are enshrined in th...|$|E
