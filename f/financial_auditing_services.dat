40|$|The {{research}} paper, {{focused on}} a rather technical approach, has the goal to design a system that brings together diverse audit stakeholders and investigates how an audit database available online can be implemented in SharePoint, {{as part of an}} on-line audit system which is collaborative and national. The online audit database covers various information needs for both financial auditors and the employees of the Chamber of Financial Auditors of Romania. For rapid deployment, we used various tools: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R 2, SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Designer 2010 and various implementation features: external content types, external lists, business data web parts etc. In this paper, we use two research methods: the first one is empiric, based on formulating a questionnaire and the interpretation of the results, while the second is the analysis of the implementation process by using a step-by-step approach. The online audit database stores information about the results of previous audits, the opinions issued as result of audits, the results of online electronic inspections, audit firms, audited entities, risks identified etc. The conclusion was that the online database, which is updated through Internet, is feasible to implement in SharePoint, for multiple <b>audit</b> stakeholders including <b>financial</b> auditors who can sell their <b>financial</b> <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> benefiting from the transparency that the system provides...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this thesis is, firstly, to {{investigate}} clients’ perspective toward the Big 4 ’s <b>financial</b> <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality. Secondly, the gaps between clients’ perceptions and expectations of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality provided by the Big 4 audit firms will be studied. Finally, factors influencing clients’ expectations of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality will be categorised. Method A combination of qualitative and quantitative approach {{is used in the}} form of a web-based self-completion questionnaire. A qualitative approach is used in one section of the questionnaire which is an open-ended question asking about the clients’ perception toward <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality. A quantitative approach is used in the rest of the 2 sections of the questionnaire; firstly, asking the respondents to score the level of perception and expectation of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality; secondly, asking for types of clients’ industries. The respondents are 25 clients who have direct experience with the Big 4 audit firms located in Thailand. Finding  Clients strongly expect assurance, reliability, and responsiveness while strongly perceive assurance and reliability of the Big 4 ’s <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality. However, it is obvious that clients’ perception of all 5 dimensions is less than those of expectation; assurance, reliability and responsiveness are significantly different at. 05 level. Moreover, eight factors from given expectation score are re-categorised in order from the most important issue to the least important as follows; Factor 1 : Trust & Confidence, Factor 2 : Responsiveness & Accuracy, Factor 3 : Knowledge and skills in clients’ industry, Caring and Independence, Factor 4 : Understanding of Clients, Factor 5 : Timing/Scheduling & Right Service, Factor 6 : Physical Facilities, Factor 7 : Professional appearance & Professional Procedures, and Factor 8 : Information & Communication Channels and Materials. Conclusion  In conclusion, the factors that are not satisfied by the clients; assurance, reliability, responsiveness, should be taken account of by the Big 4. Not only the Big 4 operating in Thailand have to be aware of their service quality, the other audit firms both international brands and local brands should also be aware of their service quality in order to satisfy their clients and to avoid damages of the firms and markets from audit failure. Both the audit firms and the clients together can help in audit quality improvement. Recommendation  To improve <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality, it is not only the Big 4 audit firms’ responsibility but also the good cooperation from the clients could be the crucial support, and the ongoing policies are needed because it takes some time to see the consequences. When the quality level of <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> becomes a win-win situation, both audit firms and clients receive mutual benefits. Moreover, the Big 4 are the big actors in the audit industry in Thailand with promptly financial and human resource, they should support non-Big 4 to improve <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> quality.

40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} a material but less understood {{component of the}} public audit marketplace, namely the provision of “audit-related” <b>services</b> to <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> clients. I use the benefit plan <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> setting to examine the company and benefit plan characteristics associated with auditor selection {{and the impact of}} audit-related <b>services</b> on <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> quality. I provide market evidence of distinct shifts {{in the use of the}} same audit firm for the <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> and other audit-related services over time as well as characteristics of the choice of auditors. I then test whether having the same audit firm for both types of <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> is associated with <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> quality as measured by missed misstatements (revealed through future restatements). I find that companies that engage the same audit firm for their <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> and benefit plan audit are less likely to have subsequent restatements. I also test whether having the same audit firm for both types of <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> is associated with switching the <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> firm. I find that companies that engage the same audit firm for their <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> and benefit plan audit are associated with a lower likelihood of switching their <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> firm. Overall, my results suggest that choosing the same auditor for both the <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> and audit-related <b>services</b> is associated with a higher level of <b>financial</b> statement <b>audit</b> quality consistent with knowledge spillover between the financial statement and benefit plan audits.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} current {{government}} auditing system in China and the proposal to move it from {{the control of the}} executive body (the State Council) to the control of the legislature (the National People's Congress). Interviews with government auditors, government and people's congress officials, and leading academics identify the problems caused by lack of audit independence. Although audit independence can be increased by moving the control of government auditing to the legislature, many of our interviewees considered such a move as infeasible in the current political climate. To smooth the reform toward a legislature-led audit system, we propose a “Dual-Track System” in which the different audit responsibilities currently undertaken by the government auditing system are separated. The responsibility for auditing the use and control of fiscal budgets by the central and regional governments would be {{under the control of the}} legislature as this area of government auditing has a clear need for audit independence. Other audit functions including economic responsibility auditing, special purpose funds <b>auditing,</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> <b>auditing</b> and state-owned enterprise auditing would remain under the control of the government.
