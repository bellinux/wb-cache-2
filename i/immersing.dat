The second <b>immersed</b> tube tunnel was built in Ningbo Yongjiang in 1995, a project that overcame the disadvantages of a soft soil foundation and used the piecewise connection of precast method [65].

5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves <b>immersing</b> the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E

40|$|A novel <b>immersed</b> {{boundary}} {{method for}} three-dimensional, time-dependent flows {{is presented in}} this work and applied to simulating the behaviour of an individual fibre in various flow regimes. The fibre is placed in a periodic box and has either a fixed position or is allowed to move freely (including translation and rotation) through the domain. The <b>immersed</b> boundary method mirrors the velocity field along the normal of the local triangulated <b>immersed</b> boundary segment to guarantee that the fluid {{takes into account the}} <b>immersed</b> body accurately. As a result of the procedure, there is a fictitious velocity field inside the <b>immersed</b> boundary, mirroring the boundary layer. Care is taken to solve the velocity field {{in such a way that}} the mass is conserved in the cells containing the <b>immersed</b> boundary. The method applied is second-order accurate and is intended to be used for fully resolving the flow field around arbitrary moving bodies <b>immersed</b> in a fluid. The <b>immersed</b> boundary method is employed on a selection of different fibre shapes, aiming at predicting the behaviour of real fibres in realistic flow situations. The force exerted by the fluid is directly calculated by integrating the pressure and viscous forces over the objects <b>immersed.</b> The resulting coarse-grained drag and lift force functions can be employed in larger scale calculations of fluid-fibre flows...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>immersed</b> {{boundary}} {{method is}} a general technique for modeling elastic boundaries <b>immersed</b> within a viscous, incompressible fluid. The method {{has been applied to}} several biological and engineering systems, including large scale models of the heart and cochlea. These simulations have the potential to improve our basic understanding of the biological systems they model and aid in the development of surgical treatments and prosthetic devices. Despite the popularity of the <b>immersed</b> boundary method and the desire to scale the problems to accurately capture the details of the physical systems, parallelization for large scale distributed memory machine has proven challenging. The primary reason is a classic locality and load balance tradeoff that arises in distributing the <b>immersed</b> boundary data structure across processors. In this paper we describe a parallelized algorithm for the <b>immersed</b> boundary method that is designed for scalability on distributed memory multiprocessors and clusters of SMPs. It is implemented using the Titanium language, a Java-based high performance scientific computing. Our software package, called IB, takes advantage of the object-oriented features of Titanium to provide a framework for simulating <b>immersed</b> boundaries that separates the generic <b>immersed</b> boundary method code from the specific application features that define the <b>immersed</b> boundary structure and the forces that arise from those structures. Our results demonstrate the scalability of our design and the feasibility of large scale <b>immersed</b> boundary computations with the IB package. 1...|$|R
