In total, 39 personal samples were taken using a 37 -mm CFC and a GSP worn side by side for simultaneous collection of the 'total' dust and the inhalable particulates, respectively. In addition, 20 static general area measurements were carried out using GSP, CFC, and Respicon samplers in parallel, the latter one providing information on the extra-thoracic fraction of the workplace aerosol. The study showed that there is a linear relationship between the concentrations measured with the CFC and those measured with the GSP sampler. The geometric mean value of the ratios of time-weighted average concentrations determined from GSP and CFC samples of all personal samples was 2. 88. The individual values covered a range between 1 and 17 related to differences in size distributions of the Be-containing particulates. This was supported by the area measurements showing that the conversion factor increases with increasing values of the extra-thoracic fraction covering a range between 0 and 79 %...|$|E

The sampler was paired with the IOM (2 L min- 1), a traditional <b>inhalable</b> air <b>sampler,</b> and deployed in metal working facilities. The samplers were compared {{to determine whether the}} prototype matched the IOM and whether the new sampler could improve the sensitivity for detecting lower concentrations of metals. The following processes were sampled: welding, grinding, soldering, pouring, sawing, tending and shooting guns. A total of 21 out of 28 paired samples had detectable metals out of 15 possible metals. There were seven out of eight personal samples and 14 out of 20 area samples with detectable metal concentrations. The average sample time was seven hours, but ranged from 4. 2 – 8. 3 hours. The most common metals that were detected on 10 or more samples were iron, manganese, zinc, copper, and lead. Metal concentrations collected by the two samplers were not statistically different for the aggregate metal concentrations collected (p = 0. 67), metals collected by sample type, personal or area (p = 0. 52) or by particle “sizes,” small or large (p = 0. 40), collected from the processes. While the samplers were not statistically different, linear regression equations to assess the sampler relationships showed that there were {{significant differences between the two}} samplers. Over the total metal concentrations collected, the prototype collected about 71 % of what the IOM collected. By sample type, the prototype performed better during area sampling as opposed to personal sampling and by particle size, the prototype performed better in the collection of smaller, heat generated particles, as opposed to larger, mechanically generated particles. Though minor differences were found between concentrations detected on the prototype and IOM, it was determined that in general, these differences were negligible in their interpretation and comparison to occupational exposure limits. Plots also indicated that the prototype sampler performs well at sampling low concentrations of metals, however, only a small amount of metals were detected on the prototype that were not found on the IOM, therefore, the improvement of sensitivity was not assessed. High-flow sampling was hindered by the ability of air sampling pumps to maintain the required operation flow rate of 10 L min- 1 for the duration of a work shift.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the facing-the-wind sampling efficiency of three personal aerosol samplers as a function of particle phase (solid versus liquid). Samplers examined were the IOM, Button, and a prototype personal high-flow <b>inhalable</b> <b>sampler</b> head (PHISH). The prototype PHISH was designed to interface with the 37 -mm closed-face cassette and provide an <b>inhalable</b> <b>sample</b> at 10 l min(- 1) of flow. Increased flow rate increases the amount of mass collected during a typical work shift and helps to ensure that limits of detection are met, particularly for well-controlled but highly toxic species. Two PHISH prototypes were tested: one with a screened inlet and one with a single-pore open-face inlet. Personal aerosol samplers were tested on a bluff-body disc that was rotated along the facing-the-wind axis to reduce spatiotemporal variability associated with sampling supermicron aerosol in low-velocity wind tunnels. When compared to published data for facing-wind aspiration efficiency for a mouth-breathing mannequin, the IOM oversampled relative to mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency for all sizes and particle types (solid and liquid). The sampling efficiency of the Button sampler was closer to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency than the IOM for solid particles, but the screened inlet removed most liquid particles, resulting in a large underestimation compared to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency. The open-face PHISH results showed overestimation for solid particles and underestimation for liquid particles when compared to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency. Substantial (and statistically significant) differences in sampling efficiency were observed between liquid and solid particles, particularly for the Button and screened-PHISH, with a majority of aerosol mass depositing on the screened inlets of these samplers. Our results suggest that large droplets have low penetration efficiencies through screened inlets and that particle bounce, for solid particles, is an important determinant of aspiration and sampling efficiencies for samplers with screened inlets.

Airborne wheat allergen can be measured by enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) in extracts of <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>samples,</b> but only limited knowledge {{is available on the}} size distribution of wheat allergen-carrying particles. Recently, a new sampling medium, porous polyurethane foam, has been introduced for the size-selective sampling of airborne dust in various occupational settings. We investigated the applicability of these foams for size-selective wheat allergen measurements. Methods: Personal and stationary measurements were performed in a flour mill, using respirable and thoracic foams inserted into the conventional IOM <b>inhalable</b> <b>sampler,</b> together with PTFE (Teflon) filters. Foams and filters were eluted and wheat allergen levels determined by human IgG 4 inhibition EIA. Results: Wheat allergen levels could be determined in both filter and foam eluates. Inhalable dust levels from filters and foams ranged from 1. 4 to 53 mg m- 3, and wheat allergen levels from 15 to 580 μg m- 3. The allergen was mainly borne on particles with Dae (particle aerodynamic diameter) > 10 μm and particles with 4 μm > Dae ≤ 10 μm, accounting for 54. 5 - 77. 5 % and 18. 9 - 43. 2 % of the total allergen yield, respectively. Less than 4 % of airborne wheat allergen was carried by particles smaller than 4 μm (respirable fraction). Conclusions: Measurement of wheat allergen in dust fractions trapped in respirable and thoracic foams is technically feasible.

40|$|Abstract-»-A {{number of}} cases of {{respiratory}} sensitization to soluble platinum have arisen in the U. K. over the last few years, despite measured 8 h TWA exposure levels below the current long-term exposure limit in most cases. One possible cause of sensitization may be as a result of high exposures over short periods. Short-term sampling has been hampered by inadequate sampling and analysis techniques. This investigation has used two types of personal <b>inhalable</b> <b>sampler,</b> with ICP-MS analysis, to take 15 min TWA soluble platinum exposure measurements at three sites. The lower detection limit for soluble platinum salts was approximately 0. 01 ug m~ 3 for IS min samples, allowing exposures two orders of magnitude below the exposure limit to be measured. It was found that the majority of short-term exposure levels were significantly below 0. 006 mg m~ 3. No evidence was found for altered work practices during sampling, indicating that either sensitization is occurring at airborne exposure levels below the exposure limit, or there is an alternate route of exposure. iCrown copyright © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

Sampling efficiency and wall losses were tested in a low-velocity wind tunnel with particles ranging from 9. 5 to 89. 5. The results were compared to the proposed low-velocity inhalability criterion as well as published data on the IOM sampler.

Field samples were collected from six wood product factories using 25 -mm glass fiber filters with the Button aerosol sampler. Gravimetric mass was determined in one laboratory by weighing the filters before and after aerosol collection. Diffuse reflection mid-infrared spectra were obtained from the wood dust on the filter which is placed on a motorized stage inside the spectrometer. The metric used for the DRIFTS analysis was the intensity of the carbonyl band in cellulose and hemicellulose at ~ 1735 cm(- 1). Calibration curves were constructed separately in both laboratories using the same sets of prepared filters from the <b>inhalable</b> <b>sampling</b> fraction of red oak, southern yellow pine, and western red cedar in the range of 0. 125 - 4 mg of wood dust. Using the same procedure in both laboratories to build the calibration curve and analyze the field samples, 62. 3 % of the samples measured within 25 % of the average result with a mean difference between the laboratories of 18. 5 %. Some observations are included as to how the calibration and analysis can be improved. In particular, determining the wood type on each sample to allow matching to the most appropriate calibration increases the apparent proportion of wood dust in the sample and this likely provides more realistic DRIFTS results.

Paired samplers were deployed for 2420 hr on 1920 days over a 3 -month period. On each sampling day, the paired samplers were deployed at three fixed locations and data were analyzed to identify agreement and to examine systematic biases between concentrations measured by these samplers. Thirty-six paired gravimetric samples were analyzed; insignificant, unsubstantial differences between concentrations were identified between the two samplers (p = 0. 16; mean difference 0. 03 mg/m(3)). Forty-four paired samples were available for endotoxin analysis, and a significant (p = 0. 001) difference in endotoxin concentration was identified: the prototype sampler, on average, had 120 EU/m(3) more endotoxin than did the IOM samples. Since the same gravimetric samples were analyzed for endotoxin content, the endotoxin difference is likely attributable to differences in endotoxin extraction. The prototype's disposable thin-film polycarbonate capsule was included with the filter in the 1 -hr extraction procedure while the internal plastic cassette of the IOM required a rinse procedure that is susceptible to dust losses. Endotoxin concentrations measured with standard plastic IOM inserts that follow this rinsing procedure may underestimate the true endotoxin exposure concentrations.

To compare exposure levels between workplaces and living areas a new assay able to measure airborne DM antigen concentrations was developed. METHODS: At workplaces and in living areas, 213 floor dust samples and 92 personal <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>samples</b> were collected. For sensitive quantification of DM antigens, a new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on polyclonal antibodies to Dermatophagoides farinae extract was developed. Reactivity of five house dust mite and four storage mite species was tested. All dust samples were tested with the new EIA and with the Der f 1 and Der p 1 -EIAs (Indoor Biotechnologies, UK) which detect major allergens from D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus by monoclonal antibodies. Samples below the detection limit in the DM-EIA were retested in an assay variant with a fluorogenic substrate (DM-FEIA). RESULTS: The newly developed DM-EIA detects antigens from all nine tested domestic mite species. It has a lower detection limit of 200 pg/ml of D. farinae protein, compared to 50 pg/ml for the DM-FEIA. DM antigens were detected by DM-EIA/FEIA in all floor dust and 80 (87 %) of airborne samples. Der f 1 was found in 133 (62 %) floor dust and in only 6 airborne samples, Der p 1 was found in 70 (33 %) of floor samples and in one airborne sample.

The Seven-hole sampler, PAS- 6 sampler, Millipore (25 and 37 mm) cassette, IOM sampler and a Polish sampler were mounted on the reference CALTOOL device and used simultaneously. All samplers except the IOM <b>sampler</b> under-sampled <b>inhalable</b> dust. To compare measurements from different studies and countries, correction factors should be applied to all but the IOM sampler, which was the only sampler that performed similar to the CALTOOL sampler...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation {{exposure}} {{at seven}} UK secondary aluminium smelters was investigated {{to quantify the}} main exposures and identify their sources. The substances monitored were gases (carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulphide and nitrogen dioxide), total inhalable dust, metals, ammonia, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particulate fluoride salts and acids. The results showed that people were exposed {{to a range of}} workplace air pollutants. Personal exposure results for total inhalable dust were between 700 and 5600 mg m 3 and the maximum per-sonal exposure result for particulate fluoride salts was 690 mg m 3 (as F). The maximum aluminium, total PAH and lead personal exposure results were 900, 19 and 18 mg m 3 respectively. The average proportion of aluminium in total <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>samples</b> was 13 % and rotary furnace processes generated the most dust. Particulate fluoride salt exposure was more widespread than hydrofluoric acid exposure. The source of the salt exposure was fluor-ide containing fluxes. The lead exposure source was lead solder contamination in the furnac...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{personal}} dust and endotoxin concentrations among animal farmers have been either small or {{limited to a}} few sectors in their investigations. The present study aimed to provide comparable information on the levels and variability of exposure to personal dust and endotoxin in different types of animal farmers. 507 personal <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>samples</b> were collected from 327 farmers employed in 54 pig, 26 dairy, 3 poultry, and 3 mink farms in Denmark. Measurements in pig and dairy farmers were full-shift and performed during summer and winter, while poultry and mink farmers were monitored during 4 well-defined production stages. The collected samples were measured for dust gravimetrically and analyzed for endotoxin by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Simple statistics and random-effect analysis were {{used to describe the}} levels and the variability in measured dust and endotoxin exposure concentrations. Measured inhalable dust levels had an overall geometric mean of 2. 5 mg m(- 3) (rang...|$|R
40|$|Indoor air {{contaminants}} such as {{dust and}} gases {{are present in}} concentrations that may be hazardous to worker health in poultry production. Poultry dust may contain inflammatory agents (e. g., endotoxin) and inhalation exposure {{has been associated with}} pulmonary symptoms. The current control practice to reduce worker exposure to poultry dust is the use of respiratory protection (e. g., filtering face-piece respirators). Limited research has been conducted to evaluate engineering controls to reduce dust concentrations in broiler chicken production. Therefore, the purpose of this research was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a water sprinkling system to reduce inhalable dust and ammonia concentrations in a broiler chicken house. Inhalable dust and ammonia concentrations were measured daily for the production cycle of a flock of broiler chickens (63 days). Inhalable dust was measured gravimetrically using an <b>inhalable</b> <b>sampler</b> and ammonia was measured by a direct reading sensor. Sampling was performed on a stationary mannequin inside two broiler chicken houses. One house used a sprinkler cooling system to deliver a water mist throughout the house and the second house was an untreated control. The sprinkler system activated 5 days after chicken placement and continued through day 63 of the broiler chicken production cycle. The following sprinkler activation program was used each hour from 6 am to 10 pm: days 5 – 9 five seconds, days 10 – 14 ten seconds, and days 15 - 63 for fifteen seconds. Geometric mean (GM) inhalable dust concentrations collected in the treatment house (5. 2 mg/m 3) were lower than those found in the control house (6. 0 mg/m 3). The GM ammonia concentration within the treatment house was higher at 10. 6 ppm (GSD: 1. 80), compared to the control house (GM 9. 51 ppm; GSD: 1. 77). However, the observed differences were not statistically significant (p = 0. 33 and p = 0. 34, respectively). Concentrations of inhalable dust were reduced by 11 β when using the water sprinkling system, however the reduction was not statistically significant. The observed reduction in dust concentration was not sufficient to eliminate the need for respiratory protection...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) {{reduced the}} Beryllium (Be) 8 -hr Time Weighted Average Threshold Limit Value (TLV-TWA) from 2. 0 {micro}g/m{sup 3 } to 0. 05 {micro}g/m{sup 3 } with an inhalable 'I' {{designation}} {{in accordance with}} ACGIH's particle size-selective criterion for inhalable mass. Currently, per the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is following the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 2. 0 {micro}g/m{sup 3 } as an 8 -hr TWA, {{which is also the}} 2005 ACGIH TLV-TWA, and an Action Level (AL) of 0. 2 {micro}g/m{sup 3 } and sampling is performed using the 37 mm (total dust) sampling method. Since DOE is considering adopting the newer 2009 TLV guidelines, the goal {{of this study was to}} determine if the current method of sampling using the 37 mm (total dust) sampler would produce results that are comparable to what would be measured using the IOM (<b>inhalable)</b> <b>sampler</b> specific to the application of high energy explosive work at LLNL's remote experimental test facility at Site 300. Side-by-side personal sampling using the two samplers was performed over an approximately two-week period during chamber re-entry and cleanup procedures following detonation of an explosive assembly containing Beryllium (Be). The average ratio of personal sampling results for the IOM (inhalable) vs. 37 -mm (total dust) sampler was 1. 1 : 1 with a P-value of 0. 62, indicating that there was no statistically significant difference in the performance of the two samplers. Therefore, for the type of activity monitored during this study, the 37 -mm sampling cassette would be considered a suitable alternative to the IOM <b>sampler</b> for collecting <b>inhalable</b> particulate matter, which is important given the many practical and economic advantages that it presents. However, similar comparison studies would be necessary for this conclusion to be applied to other types of activities, where earlier studies have shown that the IOM sampler tends to collect higher concentrations of Be compared to the 37 -mm cassette, which could complicate compliance with what is already an extremely low exposure limit...|$|R

40|$|Industrial hygienists {{can compare}} 2 ̆ 2 total 2 ̆ 2 dust {{concentrations}} to higher inhalable concentrations using a value called the performance ratio. A commonly used performance ratio of 2. 5 {{is used for}} dusts found in the workplace, after results from multiple studies were compiled. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the 2 ̆ 2 total 2 ̆ 2 and inhalable dust performance ratio over a range of conditions to investigate whether the commonly used value of 2. 5 varies between: (1) dust type (2) IOM and Button inhalable samplers and (3) distance from the dust source. Dust concentrations were generated in a still air chamber using three dust types; sawdust, flour, and glass microbeads. The IOM, Button, and CFC samplers were used to measure concentrations at four locations increasing in distance from the source. Linear regressions in the form of [Inhalable mg m- 3] = S x [2 ̆ 2 Total 2 ̆ 2 mg m- 3] were used to calculate the appropriate performance ratio, S. The intercept of this regression was forced through the origin. Linear regression was also used to examine whether the effect of distance on S was significant and a distance factor (β 1) was calculated. The calculated performance ratios, S, differed between sawdust, flour, and glass microbeads, and were 1. 62, 2. 82, and 2. 97 respectively when comparing IOM concentration to CFC concentration. Performance ratios computed for the Button sampler for sawdust, flour, and glass microbreads were 0. 82, 1. 04, and 0. 57 respectively. Performance ratios were significantly different (p= 0. 049) between the two <b>inhalable</b> <b>sampler</b> types. The IOM/CFC performance ratio for all three dusts averaged 2. 47 (SD= 0. 74), whereas the Button/CFC performance ratio for the three dusts averaged 0. 81 (SD= 0. 24). Only the IOM/CFC performance ratio had a statistically significant distance factor at α= 0. 05. The authors caution against using a single performance ratio of 2. 5 for all dusts due to the large variance involved with dust sampler and dust type. Distance from the source did not significantly affect the performance ratios computed under laboratory conditions. Industrial hygienists are advised to perform side by side <b>sampling</b> with <b>inhalable</b> and 2 ̆ 2 total 2 ̆ 2 dust samplers to create specific performance ratios appropriate for tasks found in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|International {{standards}} establish {{criteria for}} size-selective aerosol sampling for industrial hygiene. Commercially available aerosol samplers {{are designed to}} conform to these criteria. This study uses semi-monodispersed aerosols generated in a vertically aligned test chamber to compare the performance of three commercially available respirable dust samplers, one of which can, in addition, simultaneously sample for thoracic and inhalable dust fractions. Comparison methods are used to calculate a theoretical fractional value based on the appropriate <b>sampling</b> <b>conventions</b> of the total dust concentration and size distribution of test materials. Performance of actual samplers can be conducted by comparing observed results to the theoretical value. Results show {{the design of the}} test chamber and use of fused aluminum oxide is appropriate to conduct simplified performance verification tests for inhalable and respirable dust samplers. This study showed the TSI RespiCon followed the inhalable and respirable conventions closely, but results for the thoracic fraction required the use of a correction factor. The SKC aluminum cyclone tended to undersample the respirable fraction, while the BGI CAS 4 cyclone and the TSI RespiCon appear to most closely follow the convention. Improved selection of test material and characterization of particle sizes are recommended to further develop this method of performance verification...|$|R
