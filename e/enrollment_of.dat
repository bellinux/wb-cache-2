30|$|The overall <b>enrollments</b> <b>of</b> each race/ethnicity {{seemed to}} {{increase}} across time in advanced mathematics and advanced science courses, {{which is a}} promising phenomenon (see Fig.  12). However, the racial/ethnic gaps were constant across time with the highest <b>enrollments</b> <b>of</b> Asian students (around 15 %) and the lowest <b>enrollments</b> <b>of</b> Black students (around 2 %) (see Table  12). Similar to Riegle-Crumb’s (2006) finding in the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement (AHAA) data set, this might be because of the late start of the mathematics course sequence by the underrepresented minority students. The same inference {{can be made for}} the advanced science courses as Asian and White students tended to achieve the required mathematics and science credits as early as middle school, so they can enroll/complete the advanced level of the courses during high school.|$|R
