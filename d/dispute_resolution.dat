In her dedication speech, O'Connor advocated for civility among those in the legal profession and for avoiding personal attacks among lawyers. In December 2005, the school's moot courtroom was used for a real civil trial after the Marion County Courthouse was damaged the previous month.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCompetition between public activities and private companies for aviation depot level maintenance began in 1987. Since then numerous {{areas of concern}} have developed in the public/private arena. One such area is <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution.</b> This thesis addresses the <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution</b> process currently utilized by Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). The current administrative process essentially uses the Naval Aviation Depot (NADEP) chain of command. This method works well when NAVAIR and its subordinate activities are involved. However, the introduction of Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC) to administer the contracts {{and the addition of}} other Services' depots competing for these awards have forced NAVAIR to readdress its disputes process. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) does not apply to public performing activities, but it is NAVAIR's policy that its public/private process will operate as if it did. With this in mind, NAVAIR's disputes process should mirror that which is delineated in the FAR. The litigation portion of the <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution</b> process outlined in the FAR does not apply to public activities, because the Government cannot sue itself. Therefore NAVAIR's <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution</b> process should take the form of Alternate <b>Disputes</b> <b>Resolution</b> (ADR) as delineated in the FAR.

5|$|Registration {{takes place}} through a third party, a domain name registrar. The {{relationship}} between Norid, the registrar and the holder is regulated through civil legal agreements. The registrar registers the domain {{on behalf of}} the holder, and the holder then holds the right to the domain name until it is terminated, unless a <b>dispute</b> <b>resolution</b> dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per registration and change of holder, as well as NOK60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK5,000 and a deposit of minimum NOK10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{registering}} a domain, {{the user}} signs a declaration {{that they are}} not infringing on the rights of other parties and that the user will assume full responsibility for any consequences of use of the domain name. The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative <b>Dispute</b> <b>Resolution</b> Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to take over a domain name include infringements of the Trademarks Act and the Marketing Control Act. Trademark holders will also be awarded the domain if the registration was solely made to sell the domain to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E

40|$|The current New Zealand tax <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution</b> {{procedures}} were enacted in 1996 following a recommendation {{made by the}} Organisational Review Committee of the Inland Revenue Department in 1994. Yet, following their enactment and despite a number of positive aspects to the <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution</b> procedures, commentators and professional bodies alike have continued to raise concerns that inefficiencies, {{particularly with respect to}} time and cost, are affecting their operation and are, consequently, adversely impacting on taxpayersâ€™ perceptions of the fairness of the procedures. It is believed that this is potentially negatively impacting on the tax system and on taxpayer voluntary compliance. Consequently, suggestions have been made for the use of alternative <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution</b> procedures, such as mediation, as another method to resolve tax disputes. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a refined tax mediation regime for New Zealand through improving the features of the proposed tax mediation regime for New Zealandâ€™s tax <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution</b> system first developed by Jone and Maples (2012 b). Utilising a sequential mixed methods approach, consisting of a quantitative survey questionnaire followed by a qualitative focus group interview, this study seeks feedback on Jone and Maplesâ€™ (2012 b) proposed New Zealand tax mediation regime from purposively selected practitioners (experts) in the tax <b>disputes</b> <b>resolution</b> and mediation fields. The feedback obtained is used in refining Jone and Maplesâ€™ (2012 b) proposed tax mediation regime. This study finds that the most important aspect of the refined proposed regime is the inclusion of a mediator who is independent of both parties and moreover, that the mediator is foremost trained and qualified in mediation as opposed to being a specialist in tax law. The findings also indicate that mediation should not be made a mandatory phase of the disputes procedures. This study recommends that the refined tax mediation regime should be an administrative phase and incorporated with the existing conference phase in a proposed â€˜ADR stageâ€™ of the disputes procedures. Notwithstanding the potential budgetary and resource constraints, the findings indicate that if mediation were to be provided as a cost-free service, taxpayers (particularly small taxpayers) should be appreciative of the opportunity to put their cases forward and be heard, even if an agreement has not been reached through mediation. The literature suggests that this should in turn enhance taxpayersâ€™ perceptions of fairness of the disputes procedures and thereby voluntary compliance. This study provides a foundation for the further development of tax mediation in New Zealand...|$|R
