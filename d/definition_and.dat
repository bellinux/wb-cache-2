5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base unit that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK), for its <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E

5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or <b>definition,</b> <b>and</b> this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, RFC 1738 {{formally}} defined relative {{and absolute}} URLs, refined the general URL syntax, defined how to resolve relative URLs to absolute form, and better enumerated the URL schemes then in use.

5|$|Making an {{exception}} for zero {{in the definition of}} evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers.

30|$|In this section, {{we first}} review the basic <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> {{properties}} of fractional integral and derivative {{for the purpose}} of acquainting with sufficient fractional calculus theory. Many <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> studies of fractional calculus have been proposed in the past two centuries (see, e.g., [8]). The two most commonly used definitions are the Riemann-Liouville operator and the Caputo operator. We give some <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> properties of the fractional calculus.|$|R

5|$|On {{the corner}} pendentives, {{each of which}} depicts a violent subject, {{the removal of the}} carbon black has diminished the {{dramatic}} intensity of all four scenes.

5|$|A further twelve bodies, pending {{refinements}} {{of knowledge}} regarding their physical properties, were possible candidates {{to join the}} list under this definition. Some objects in this second list were more likely eventually to be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the <b>definition,</b> <b>and</b> that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E
5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended {{an increase in}} the number of full-time inspectors from two to four; restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the tightening of the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> practice of pithing. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E

On October 27, 2012, Devin Townsend performed a one-off show covering his musical career called The Retinal Circus at Roundhouse in London. The 3-hour performance was recorded in high <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 30, 2013. Also in 2012, Townsend played bass on the debut Bent Sea album Noistalgia.
