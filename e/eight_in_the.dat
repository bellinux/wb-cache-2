5|$|A left-handed opening batsman, Morris {{played in}} all five Tests, partnering the {{right-handed}} Sid Barnes in three Tests; Barnes {{was injured in}} the Third and Fourth Tests. Barnes was unable {{to open in the}} former and did not play in the latter. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, with Bill Brown being the reserve.

5|$|Constantine's {{reputation}} {{continued to}} grow. An innings for Shannon in 1921 against renowned fast bowler George John received great local publicity, {{but according to}} the cricket writer and social historian C. L. R. James, this was the only time prior to 1928 that Constantine played in such an effective way. Constantine's father, still a formidable player, did not put himself forward for selection into the Trinidad team in 1921, in the hope that his son would replace him. The white captain of the Trinidad team, Major Bertie Harragin, recognised the younger Constantine's promise, and selected him to play in Trinidad's Inter-Colonial Tournament match against British Guiana. Unfortunately, Constantine arrived late after a newspaper advertised the wrong starting time, and did not play. However, he made his first-class debut in the following match, the final of the tournament, against Barbados on 21 September 1921. He scored a duck in his first innings, batting at number <b>eight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> batting order. After taking two wickets at a cost of 44 runs in Barbados' only innings, he scored 24 in his second innings, batting at number three.|$|E

In both his other matches for the county that season, Seamer batted {{as part of the}} top order, and though he reached double figures in each of his innings, he did not achieve another half-century.|$|E
