40|$|Background: Rates of {{caesarean}} section are progressively increasing {{in many parts}} of the world. As a result of psychosocial factors, there has been an increasing tendency for pregnant women without justifiable medical indications for {{caesarean section}} to ask for this procedure in China. The psychosocial factors for requesting cesarean section were analyzed in our study. Methods: A self-made questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were administered to evaluate lying-in women’s psychosocial state. Results: The proportion of lying-on women’s age and education degree was different significantly between the two groups (p ％ vs. 3. 42 %, p 0. 05). By logistic regression, we found that for primipara, higher education degree, anxiety and lacking confidence were the dangerous factors for cesarean, while lower economic degree was a defendant factor. Conclusion: There were five main psychosocial factors such as education degree and <b>economic</b> state, <b>parity,</b> anxiety and confidence of lying-on women affecting the choice of the delivery way. The nulliparous women who feel anxious without confidence in nice economic state, with better education have higher risk to choose cesarean. </span...|$|R

40|$|Background: The 2002 - 2003 IDHS {{shows that}} the {{presentation}} of breastfeeding within an hour after birth or early initiation in Indonesia is still low (38 %). According to some studies, early initiation {{plays an important role}} in reducing infant mortality rate, determining the success of exclusive breastfeeding, preventing pre-lactation feeding, creating more intensive bonding between mother and baby. Some earlier studies state that delivery methods are related with early initiation. However, there have been some studies whose results are in contrast with those previous studies. Objective: To study the relationship between delivery methods and early initiation in Dr. Sardjito hospital, Yogyakarta. Method: This was an observational study with a cross-sectional study design through quantitative and qualitative approaches. Samples were postpartum women in Dr. Sardjito hospital as many as 100 respondents. Data were analyzed with univariable analysis using frequency distribution table, bivariable analysis using chi-square, and multivariable analysis using binary regression. Results: The proportion of early initiation of breastfeeding was three times greater in women who gave birth with normal delivery methods than women who gave birth with cesarean section (RR= 3. 1; 95 % CI= 1. 42 - 6. 89). Another factor that was related with early initiation of breastfeding was the support from health providers (RR= 2. 3; 95 % CI= 1. 36 - 3. 78).

40|$|Introduction : The {{popularity}} of family deliveries {{has been increasing}} for several years, so {{it is reasonable to}} make an evaluation of the factors that influence decisions on choosing this type of delivery as well as an evaluation of the effects of such a decision. Aim of the research : The aim of the research was to define how the age of a woman in labour, her marital status, residence, her and her partner’s education, financial situation, parity, and participation in classes at a childbirth school can affect a decision on having a family delivery. The research also defined the objective indices of the birth-giving process: the method of its completion, the performance of episiotomy, application of painkillers, and the condition of the newborn. The quality of the completed labour was evaluated in the subjective opinions of young mothers. Material and methods: By means of a survey and analysis of medical documentation, 80 women giving birth in the company of their partners were compared with 80 women giving birth in the traditional way. Results : Place of residence, <b>economic</b> status, <b>parity,</b> education, and attendance of a childbirth school are strongly associated with the chosen form of childbirth. Episiotomy was performed more frequently in women who gave birth in the presence of their partners. Newborn babies received similar scores in the Apgar Scale. Painkillers were applied more often in family deliveries than in conventional ones. Conclusions : The main advantages of a family delivery include the feeling of higher self-esteem and safety, and the strengthening of ties between partners.

The study examines the evolving political priorities of the communist party leadership {{in the context of the}} Marxist theoretical framework; the challenges of the Civil War; foreign intervention and the 1941 invasion; post-war reconstruction; and the attempt to gain military and <b>economic</b> <b>parity</b> with the USA. At each point, Kaser describes how the internal dialogue between enterprises, consumers and the state apparatus influenced the strategies adopted for economic growth and agricultural and industrial development. Kaser highlights the contributions made to the internal debate by N I Bukharin, G V Plekhanov, E A Preobrazhensky, N D Kondratiev, A V Chayanov, V G Groman, L V Kantorovich, Ye G Liberman, G A Feldman, V V Novozhilov, Branko Horvat and A G Aganbegyan. He is critical of the approaches of Western Marxists (for example, Paul A. Baran and Paul M Sweezy) and of Joan Robinson as presenting an over simplified picture of the way decision-making operated and of tending to conflate state ownership with control over resources. He argues that because the planning procedures had changed little since the first Five Year Plan (1928-32), enterprises were forced to engage in numerous deals over the composition and timing of their supplies and deliveries that in turn manifested itself in both chronic shortages and persistent waste. The [...] "three laws of socialism" [...] promulgated by Stalin, which in effect meant that heavy industry was given preference over the production of consumer goods, along with a high rate of saving and the maintenance of a stable proportion in the shares of national output between agriculture and industry, held back the growth of national income in comparison with market oriented industrial countries, notably the USA. Kaser explains how the invention of mathematical tools to achieve balance in a planned economy were swept aside under Stalin and continued to be viewed with suspicion until the 1960s. Even so, he doubts whether such computerised techniques could in practice generate efficient pricing and assure balanced growth and general economic equilibrium in the USSR.|$|E

Antenatal care (ANC) coverage and provision of high Fe if not {{followed by a}} decrease in the incidence of anemia can result indirectly in the risk of low birth weight. Supplementary feeding is expected to resolve the issue. Objective: To assess the effect of supplementary feeding on the third trimester of pregnancy on birth weight. Method: This was a quantitative study with a study design of quasi-experiment and non-equivalent control group. The given intervention was fish-processed feeding for 30 days. The study population was pregnant women in the third trimester in all health centers in the City of Yogyakarta and the samples were 104 pregnant women in some health centers with convenience sampling technique. The subjects were divided into two, namely the treatment group (PMT) and the comparison group (non-PMT). Birth weight was weighed immediately after the baby was born. Statistical analysis used t-test and logistic regression. Results: The mean birth weight of infants in the treatment group and the comparison group was 3248 g and 2974 g, respectively, so that the difference in the mean birth weight of both groups was 274 g (p= 0. 0002; 95 %C: 131 - 416). Thus, supplementary feeding was shown significantly affect the birth weight. The extraneous variables that significantly influenced birth weight were pregnancy interval. Other extraneous variables were age, mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC), education, occupation, <b>economic</b> status, <b>parity,</b> protein intake, compliance of Fe tablet intake, antenatal care, gestational age at delivery and anemia status were not proven statistically significant to affect birth weight.

This work stems from longer-term tests of real exchange rate convergence {{in the former}} Yugoslavia. This period is of interest on two fronts: first, it investigates real exchange dynamics in the after-math of a war financed in part through seigniorage; and second, we investigate the level of economic integration with the European Union following {{the breakup of the}} former Yugoslavia. Given the short-run nature of the available data we use both univariate and panel unit root tests with and without structural breaks. The results suggest that there is statistical evidence that real exchange rates between the eight transition countries and Germany are stationary when breaks are accounted for.
