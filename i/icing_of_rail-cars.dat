40|$|The {{necessity}} of work-in-process management <b>of</b> <b>rail-cars</b> production by intelligent decision support software, {{which is based}} on JIT and Kanban principles, is identified. The scheme of one type cargo-flow movement between two workshops with control by electronic and traditional kanban-card is offered. For simulation <b>of</b> <b>rail-cars</b> production cargo flows Markov chain of M/M/ 1 / 1 type was applied. Simulation shows the dependence of the work-in-process on the in-flow and out-flow intensity. To determine the high level of the optimal work-in-process the stochastic inventory management model is applied...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to clarify}} the {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> jams on ice-covered rivers. We focused on the phenomenon whereby river <b>ice</b> <b>of</b> various sizes accumulates in narrow spaces over rivers. Before conducting an ice jam hydraulic experiment, we developed a calculation model for the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> jams formed from river <b>ice</b> <b>of</b> mixed sizes under one-dimensional unsteady flow. The occurrence <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> jam was found {{to depend on the}} ratio of river width to ice size. The calculation model created in this study was found to be able to reproduce the water level <b>of</b> the <b>ice</b> jam experiment...|$|R
