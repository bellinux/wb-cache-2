During their journey from the sipapu {{to the world of the}} living, the spirits stop along the road and eat the food left for them by the living.|$|E
500|$|... "Barge of the Dead" [...] was {{the first}} episode to provide a {{detailed}} account of Gre'thor, which was previously referenced only in Star Trek: The Next Generation. The title was developed from [...] "the Klingon belief that the <b>dead</b> <b>travel</b> to Gre'thor on a barge steered by a ferryman". Religious studies scholars Ross Kraemer, William Cassidy, and Susan L Schwartz interpreted the representation of Gre'thor and Klingon spirituality as borrowing from Norse and Greek mythology, specifically the crossing of the rainbow bridge Bifröst or the river Styx. Exploring the influence of the Greek story of Odysseus (Latin: Ulysses) on Star Trek: Voyager, the Classical philologist Otta Wenskus points to Siren-like creatures who call out with the voices of those loved by those on the barge. Though the motif of a barge and ferryman is not present in Homer's portrayal of the underworld in the Odyssey, it was subsequently popularized by its use in Virgil's Aeneid and Dante's Inferno. The pediatrician Victor Grech, in a paper on Klingon culture, interpreted Torres' belief in the Klingon mythological figure Fek'lhr, who tortures the souls of the dishonored, as being in line with Catholic views of Satan.|$|E

[...] Her answer was one I knew only too well. I listened to the end; and replied that I had heard it all before, but should be delighted if she had anything further to say. Some malignant devil stronger than I must have entered into me that evening, for I have a dim recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to the Thing in front of me.|$|E

50|$|Traditional Aboriginal Tasmanians {{also related}} beliefs {{of a spiritual}} afterlife. One such belief, related by an {{aboriginal}} person from the west coastal nation, was {{that the spirit of}} the <b>dead</b> <b>travelled</b> to a place over the sea: to the far north-west, called Moo-ai. This possibly reflects the ancestral memory of the Mara language group, resident in Western Tasmania, who are believed to have settled Tasmania from the Warrnambool region in modern day Victoria.but other Tasmanians state that after death their spirits would have a post-corporeal existence in their traditional lands. Other reference is made to an Island of the Dead tini drini, described as 'an island in Bass Strait' where the dead would be reincarnated or 'jump up white men'. White here does not refer to european, but rather the skeletal or phantasmic nature of returned dead.|$|R
