6000|$|What sum {{of modern}} money, in real {{purchasing}} power, this [...] "400,000 Hungarian Gold Gulden" [...] is, I have inquired in the likely quarters without result; {{and it is}} probable no man exactly knows. The latest existing representative of the ancient Gold Gulden is the Ducat, worth generally about a Half-sovereign in English. Taking the sum at that latest rate, it amounts to 200,000 pounds; and the reader can {{use that as a}} note of memory for the sale-price of Brandenburg with all its lands and honors,--multiplying it perhaps by four or six to bring out its <b>effective</b> <b>amount</b> in current coin. Dog-cheap, it must be owned, for size and capability; but in the most waste condition, full of mutiny, injustice, anarchy and highway robbery; a purchase that might have proved dear enough to another man than Burggraf Friedrich.|$|E
6000|$|Although the State may not {{promise to}} pay a dollar, yet, {{wherever}} [...] such paper money carries any purchasing power with it (which has [...] very seldom happened, and then only for short periods), it will be [...] found {{that there is a}} vague popular understanding that the State [...] intends, at some time or other, to redeem the notes with value in [...] coin to some amount. In the early cases of irredeemable money in [...] our colonies, the income of taxes, or similar resources, were [...] promised as a means of redemption. To some—although a [...] slight—extent, the idea of value was associated with such paper. [...] The actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation. The [...] paper did depreciate with increased issues. But only in so far as [...] the increased issues proved to the community that there was less [...] and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they [...] depreciate. In other words, we come to the familiar experience, [...] known to many, of a paper money depending for its value on the [...] opinions of men in the country. This was partially true, even of [...] our own greenbacks, which were not fiat money, but promises to [...] pay (although not then redeemable), as may be seen by the movement [...] of the line in Chart XII (p. 359), which represents the [...] fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war. The upward [...] movement of the line, which indicates the premium on gold during [...] our late war, of course represents correspondingly the [...] depreciation of the paper. Every victory or defeat of the Union [...] arms raised or lowered the premium on gold; it was the register of [...] the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with [...] the paper. The second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks [...] were regarded as confessions of financial distress; it was this [...] which produced the effect on their value. It was not only the [...] quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity. It [...] is, of course, clear that the value of a paper money like the [...] greenbacks, which were the promises to pay of a rich country, [...] would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued; and [...] this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on [...] the chart, showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the [...] issues increased. But the thing which weighed largely in people’s [...] minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption; and the premium [...] on gold was practically a register of the “betting” on this [...] possibility. In 1878, when Secretary Sherman’s reserve was seen to [...] be increasing to an <b>effective</b> <b>amount,</b> and when it became evident [...] that he would have the means (i.e., the value represented by all [...] the paper that was likely to be presented) to resume on the day [...] set, January 1, 1879, the premium gradually faded away. The [...] general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later [...] period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding, [...] because the contraction had been stopped in 1868, and that [...] consequent on the resumption act in May, 1878.|$|E
