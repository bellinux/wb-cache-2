The growth in population of the new town—around 1,000% between 1951 and 2001—has outstripped that of most similar-sized settlements.

5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E

5|$|However, in non-technical {{contexts}} and in {{software for the}} World Wide Web, the term URL remains widely used. Additionally, the term web address (which has no formal definition) often occurs in non-technical publications as a synonym for a URI that uses the scheme http or https. Such assumptions can lead to confusion, for <b>example</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of XML namespaces, which have a visual similarity to resolvable URIs.|$|E

5|$|Logarithms {{also occur}} in {{log-normal}} distributions. When the logarithm of a random variable has a normal distribution, the variable {{is said to}} have a log-normal distribution.

Hydroxyproline, {{a major component}} of the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells.
