5|$|Although the Wehrmacht's {{offensive}} {{had been}} stopped, German intelligence estimated that Soviet forces {{had no more}} reserves left and thus {{would be unable to}} stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East. The Red Army <b>had</b> <b>accumulated</b> a 58-division reserve by early December, when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. Even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men, only slightly outnumbering the Wehrmacht. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.|$|E

5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they <b>had</b> <b>accumulated</b> nearly 50carts.

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first <b>had</b> <b>accumulated</b> a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
