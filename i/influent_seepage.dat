Well, hydrographs show that recharge from rainfall occur very fast and {{keep pace with the}} increasing or decreasing rainfall in this area. Fluctuation of water table is generally constant in the eastern region in comparison to the western region. The tube wells in the east (100 Â m deep on an average) are deeper in comparison to {{the western part of the}} district (Mondal et al. 2014).

40|$|Zalengei area, Darfur Province, Sudan, a {{semi-arid}} area, appears favorable in {{many respects}} for future agricultural development. The cultivation of new cash crops depends {{on the availability of}} adequate supplies of ground water of satisfactory quality to irrigate these crops. The principal aquifer in the area is unconfined in the valley fill sediments which form the Lower Terrace and the Flood Plain formations. The average thickness of the aquifer is some 90 feet, and its average transmissivity and storage coefficient are 100, 000 gallons/day/foot, and 0. 2 respectively. The storage capacity of the ground water reservoir is some 140, 000 acre feet. Ground water is discharged from the basin by evapotranspiration, effluent seepage, and underflow out of the basin. Recharge to the ground water is from direct precipitation over the basin area, by <b>influent</b> <b>seepage,</b> and by underflow into the basin. The ground water supplies of the area have small amounts of dissolved solids, mostly bicarbonates and, carbonates. The waters that underlie Wadi Aribo are generally rich in calcium and magnesium bicarbonates, whereas those underlying Wadi Azum are rich in sodium carbonates and bicarbonates. The ground water underlying Wadi Azum is an approximate blend of the waters supplied by its tributaries and the water of the Large Dariba Lake. This lake has the highest content of fluoride yet known in natural waters. The arable land in the area is 7200 acres. The amount of ground water needed to irrigate these lands is about 21, 600 acre-feet per year. About 20 per cent of this amount can be recharged to the ground water body from the annual precipitation over the basin area; the rest can be recharged by <b>influent</b> <b>seepage</b> from the wadis during flood time. Most of the water supplies are of excellent to good quality for irrigation and domestic uses...|$|E
40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} during the winter 1965 - 1966 at an instrumented research site near Tucson, Arizona, to characterize changes in the subsurface water regime of the stratified sediments at the site during <b>influent</b> <b>seepage</b> in the Santa Cruz River. At the peak of recharge from the principal runoff event of the winter, observation well data accounted for 33 percent of the observed total change in the subsurface water content. The remaining 67 percent, observed by means of moisture logs in access tubes, was contained in two near-saturated mounds in the intermediate vadose zone. Slow drainage of water from these mounds into the semi-confined phreatic zone apparently reduced the rates of recession of observation well hydrographs. Water content changes in the intermediate vadose zone and related long-term drainage should be accounted for during water balance studies and aquifer testing in the Tucson Basin...|$|E
40|$|The {{computer}} model UNSAT 2 for unsaturated water flow {{is used to}} complement a field study conducted at the University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center Field Laboratory during <b>influent</b> <b>seepage</b> along the Santa Cruz River during the runoff events on the Winter of 1967 - 1968. Field measurements accomplished by a neutron moisture logger showed that the hydrogeologic characteristics governing the movement and storage of subsurface flow are somewhat uniform throughout the area. The mathematical model provides a two-dimensional transient saturated-unsaturated analysis of the subsurface flow at the field site. The results attained using a conceptualized flow region {{proved to be an}} acceptable aid to a unified interpretation of the field measurements. Because boundary conditions are time and space dependent, the sensitivity to boundary conditions prevented the successful model calibration, although not its applicability. This, together with more serious limitations on data availability and computer capacity, precluded the imminent use of the {{computer model}} UNSAT 2 for this individual research site...|$|E
40|$|The Cash River basin lies in {{the eastern}} part of Kassala Province, Sudan. The rock units in the area are the Basement Complex, Clays of the Plain, and the {{alluvial}} deposits of the Gash River. The average annual precipitation is 13, 4 inches. The mean seasonal runoff of the Gash River at Kassala town is about 381, 000 acre-feet, and the mean average period of flow is 88 days per year. The principal aquifer in the area is the alluvium. The aquifer is unconfined, and the average saturated thickness is 90 feet. The average transmissivity of the aquifer is 100, 000 gallons per day/foot and the average specific yield is 13 per cent, The storage capacity of the ground water reservoir is about 484, 000 acre-feet, The annual discharge from the reservoir for irrigation, domestic uses, and evapotranspiration is about 58, 000 acre-feet, The aquifer is recharged seasonally from the Gash River during the rainy season by <b>influent</b> <b>seepage</b> and from direct precipitation over the basin, The ground water supplies of the area have small amounts of dissolved solids, The ground water is of an excellent quality for irrigation and domestic purposes...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{analytical}} {{solutions for}} vertical <b>influent</b> <b>seepage</b> flow to an infinite series of tile drains underlain by an impervious layer do not adequately consider the free surface nor give {{solutions for the}} drain diameter (see Figure 1). The theoretical investigations described herein basically sought to find a method whereby an engineer could find the required diameter, depth, and spacing of an adequate tile drainage system when given the ratio of infiltration to soil hydraulic conductivity {{and the depth of}} the impervious layer. From a study of the available literature it was decided the problem would be exceedingly difficult to solve exactly but it seemed as if an approximate solution of good accuracy could be obtained by approximating the shape of the impervious layer, where the flow is sluggish, and satisfying the conditions exactly at the free surface, a critical region of flow. Previously published solutions invariably adopt the opposite viewpoint, with a consequent loss in accuracy. The solution to the problem when the impervious layer is at infinite depth had been solved exactly using the rather laborious hodograph technique. This work employs to advantage an image method developed by Davison and Rosenhead (1940). Detailed results are obtained herein for the condition when no water stands over the tile lines and these are given in a graphical form which enables a ready computation of drain depth diameter and spacing when the field data are known (ratio of rate of infiltration to hydraulic conductivity and the depth of the impervious layer). A comparison with field results shows that the solutions are probably as accurate as could be desired. The case which occurs when water stands over the tile lines has not been extensively tabulated for reasons explained in the report. A method is given whereby adequate tile drainage systems may be designed on a long term basis. The design curves given are not for intermittent unsteady flows such as irrigation schemes (a more difficult problem) but should prove exceedingly useful for engineers concerned with land reclamation schemes and marsh drainage...|$|E
40|$|The aquifer test, {{involving}} a production well and several observation wells near a stream, {{is one of}} the effects of induced streambed infiltration on water levels in aquifers. In presently available analytical treatments of flow problems associated with induced infiltration, recharge by the <b>influent</b> <b>seepage</b> of surface water is commonly simulated by use of a hypothetical image well. The assumption is made that water levels in the aquifer will behave the same whether recharge occurs over an area or through an image well. Electric analog computers, in which the streambed is simulated as an area of recharge in accordance with natural conditions instead of as a recharging image well, were used to appraise the accuracy of estimated effects of induced infiltration on water levels based on the image well theory. Electric analog computers for two aquifer test sites for which field data are available were constructed. The selected aquifer tests involve the two extreme aquifer-stream situations, i. e. the case where the cone of depression spreads beneath and beyond the entire streambed and the case where the cone of depression spreads only part way beneath the streambed. The analog computers consist of analog models and excitation-response apparatus. The analog models are regular arrays of resistors and capacitors and are scaled-down versions of aquifer-stream situations. The excitation-response apparatus consists of a power supply, waveform generator, pulse generator and an oscilloscope. It is concluded that, during induced infiltration aquifer tests, the image-well theory closely describes drawdowns on the land sides of streams {{with a high degree of}} accuracy whether the cone of depression spreads beneath and beyond or only part way beneath the streambed. Drawdowns beneath or beyond the streambed and the streambed areas of infiltration based on the image-well theory are not those which are observed in the field. However, the streambed infiltration rates per foot of head loss based on hypothetical drawdowns beneath streambeds and streambed areas of infiltration computed with the image-well theory seem to be empirically correct.

40|$|The {{impact of}} septic tank {{effluent}} disposal on groundwater quality was investigated at Oxford. The Oxford township {{can be regarded}} as typical of many small communities on the Canterbury Plains which have a high density of septic systems serviced by soakage pit drainage. The primary concern with grouped septic systems is the potential for both chemical and microbial groundwater contamination. The alluvial gravel aquifers of the Canterbury Plains are especially susceptible to microbial contamination due to the high rates of groundwater flow which may transport both bacteria and viral contaminants over large distances. Geological investigations established the presence of an areally extensive, tuff derived, clay unit which forms an aquitard beneath the unconfined aquifer in the north of the Oxford area. Recharge of the unconfined aquifer above the clay unit is exclusively from rainfall infiltration while to the south, groundwater levels respond to rainfall infiltration and <b>influent</b> <b>seepage</b> from the Eyre River. The presence of two hydrogeologically distinct gravel units within the unconfined aquifer was determined by application of the column dilution technique. Point dilution tests showed the average groundwater velocity of 130 m/day in the upper gravel unit to be significantly higher than the 40 m/day measured in the underlying gravels. The presence of discrete channels of preferred flow within the unconfined aquifer system was also established by point dilution tests, intrachannel velocities ranging from 210 to 400 m/day. A resistivity salt tracing test indicated groundwater flow in an easterly direction with a velocity of 250 m/day through an observed channel feature. Groundwater quality monitoring showed a significant degree of groundwater contamination close to the Oxford township. Concentrations of faecal coliform bacteria in excess of drinking water standards were detected up to 900 m downgradient of the nearest septic tank. Elevated levels of chemical indicators (N 03 -N, CL-) were also detected in all monitoring wells. The pattern of groundwater contamination was complex, reflecting both the heterogeneity of groundwater flow through the unconfined aquifer system and the influence of monitoring well location. Predictive modelling indicated the potential for the transport of faecal coliform bacteria up to 2. 6 km downgradient of Oxford. Modelling also suggested increased urban development within Oxford to have a relatively minor effect on the overall extent of groundwater contamination. Additional hydrogeological and water quality data, aided by the application of numerical solute transport modelling techniques, may provide a more accurate estimate of the impact of septic tank effluent disposal on groundwater quality. Future sewage disposal options for Oxford have to balance the low potential for microbial contamination of drinking water supplies outside the groundwater zone delineated by this study, against the environmental acceptability continuing contamination of this zone. This study has identified the need for further research into the effects of septic tank effluent discharge on groundwater quality in the Canterbury region, to provide a sound base for future resource management decisions...|$|E
