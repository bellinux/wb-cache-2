5|$|Together with turtles, the tuatara has {{the most}} {{primitive}} hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no eardrum and no earhole, and the middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly adipose (fatty) tissue. The stapes comes {{into contact with the}} quadrate (which is immovable), as well as the hyoid and squamosal. The hair cells are unspecialized, innervated by both afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyramidal}} tracts {{include both}} the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts. These are aggregations of <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers {{from the upper}} motor neurons that travel from the cerebral cortex and terminate either in the brainstem (corticobulbar) or spinal cord (corticospinal) and {{are involved in the}} control of motor functions of the body.|$|E
2500|$|The nerve axons {{traveling}} {{down the}} tract {{are referred to}} as <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers of the upper motor neurons. These axons travel down the tracts in the white matter of the spinal cord until they reach the vertebral level of the muscle that they will innervate. At this point, the axons synapse with lower motor neurons. The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons, but instead synapse with an interneuron that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the anterior grey column. Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so {{at the level of the}} spinal cord they terminate in.|$|E
50|$|The cell {{bodies for}} {{the facial nerve}} are grouped in {{anatomical}} areas called nuclei or ganglia. The cell bodies for the afferent nerves {{are found in the}} geniculate ganglion for taste sensation. The cell bodies for muscular <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> are found in the facial motor nucleus whereas the cell bodies for the parasympathetic <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> are found in the superior salivatory nucleus.|$|R

60|$|Every {{child has}} made the attempt to hold the foot still while it is tickled, and has failed; and {{probably}} there is scarcely any one who has not vainly tried to avoid winking, when a hand has been suddenly passed before the eyes. These examples of muscular movements which occur independently of the will, or in spite of it, illustrate what physiologists call reflex-action; as likewise do sneezing and coughing. To this class of cases, in which involuntary motions are accompanied by sensations, has to be added another class of cases, in which involuntary motions are unaccompanied by sensations:--instance the pulsations of the heart; the contractions of the stomach during digestion. Further, the great mass of seemingly-voluntary acts in such creatures as insects, worms, molluscs, are considered by physiologists to be as purely automatic as is the dilatation or closure of the iris under variations in quantity of light; and similarly exemplify the law, that an impression {{on the end of}} an afferent nerve is conveyed to some ganglionic centre, and is thence usually reflected along an <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> to one or more muscles which it causes to contract.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} direction of neural activity is efferent conduction. The <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber is the axon of a motor neuron. Bundles of these axons form a motor nerve, or <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E

50|$|Afferent and efferent are {{connected}} to affect and effect through their common Latin roots: Afferent nerves affect the subject, whereas <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> allow the subject to effect change.|$|R
5000|$|The somatic {{nervous system}} (SoNS or {{voluntary}} nervous system) {{is the part}} of the peripheral nervous system associated with skeletal muscle [...] control of body movements. The SoNS consists of afferent nerves or sensory <b>nerves,</b> and <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> or motor nerves. Afferent nerves are responsible for relaying sensation from the body to the central nervous system (CNS); <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> are responsible for sending out commands from the CNS to the body, stimulating muscle contraction; they include all the non-sensory neurons connected with skeletal muscles and skin. The a- of afferent and the e- of efferent correspond to the prefixes ad- (to, toward) and ex- (out of).|$|R
50|$|In the {{peripheral}} nervous system, an <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber is the axon of a motor neuron. The nerve fiber {{is a long}} process projecting far from the neuron's body that carries nerve impulses away from {{the central nervous system}} toward {{the peripheral}} effector organs (mainly muscles and glands). A bundle of these fibers is called a motor nerve or an <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In anatomy, a {{ganglion}} ( [...] plural ganglia) is a {{nerve cell}} cluster {{or a group}} of nerve cell bodies located in the autonomic nervous system and sensory system. Ganglia house the cell bodies of afferent <b>nerves</b> and <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sensation {{from the}} bladder is {{transmitted}} to {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) via general visceral afferent fibers (GVA). GVA fibers on the superior surface follow the course of the sympathetic <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> back to the CNS, while GVA fibers on the inferior portion of the bladder follow the course of the parasympathetic efferents.|$|R
30|$|Material and Methods: In {{this video}} we {{describe}} the nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy. The dissection of the pelvic spaces and the pelvic lymphadenectomy are showed. The detailed autonomic nerve structures (the pelvic splanchnic nerves, the inferior hypogastric plexus and the visceral afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves)</b> were identified and separated by meticulous dissection during this procedure.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the spindle}} {{also has a}} motor efferent {{innervation}} carried by the <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers of gamma motor neurons, which {{is used by the}} nervous system to modify the spindle's sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|The abducens nerve or {{abducent nerve}} (the sixth cranial nerve, {{also called the}} sixth nerve or simply CNVI) is a somatic <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> that, in humans, {{controls}} the movement of a single muscle, the lateral rectus muscle of the eye.|$|E
5000|$|The trochlear nerve, {{also called}} the fourth cranial nerve or cranial nerve IV, is a motor nerve (a somatic <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve)</b> that innervates only a single muscle: the {{superior}} oblique muscle of the eye, which operates through the pulley-like trochlea.|$|E
2500|$|Sensation {{from the}} bladder is {{transmitted}} to {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) via general visceral afferent fibers (GVA). [...] GVA fibers on the superior surface follow the course of the sympathetic <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> back to the CNS, while GVA fibers on the inferior portion of the bladder follow the course of the parasympathetic efferents.|$|R
5000|$|The pelvic splanchnic <b>efferent</b> preganglionic <b>nerve</b> cell bodies {{reside in}} the lateral gray horn of the spinal cord at the T12-L1 {{vertebral}} levels (the spinal cord terminates at the L1-L2 vertebrae with the conus medullaris), and their axons exit the vertebral column as S2-S4 spinal nerves through the sacral foramina. Their axons continue away from the CNS to synapse at an autonomic ganglion. The parasympathetic ganglion where these preganglionic neurons synapse will {{be close to the}} organ of innervation. This differs from the sympathetic nervous system, where synapses between pre- and post-ganglionic <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> in general occur at ganglia that are farther away from the target organ.|$|R
50|$|A motor {{signal from}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) to the {{periphery}} is called an efference, and a copy of this signal is called an efference copy. Sensory information coming from sensory receptors in the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system is called afference. On a similar basis, nerves into the nervous system are afferent nerves and ones out are termed <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers of gamma motoneurons also {{terminate}} in muscle spindles; {{they make}} synapses at {{either or both}} of the ends of the intrafusal muscle fibers and regulate the sensitivity of the sensory afferents, which are located in the non-contractile central (equatorial) region.|$|E
50|$|Afferent nerve fibers {{are often}} paired with <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers from the motor neurons (that travel from the CNS to the PNS), in mixed nerves. Stimuli cause nerve impulses in the receptors and alter the potentials, {{which is known}} as sensory transduction.|$|E
50|$|The {{pyramidal}} tracts {{include both}} the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts. These are aggregations of <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers {{from the upper}} motor neurons that travel from the cerebral cortex and terminate either in the brainstem (corticobulbar) or spinal cord (corticospinal) and {{are involved in the}} control of motor functions of the body.|$|E
50|$|There are {{upper motor neurons}} {{and lower}} motor neurons, with the cell type {{described}} above being a lower motor neuron. Upper motor neurons are cortico-spinal interneurons that arise from the motor cortex and descend to the spinal cord where they activate the lower motor neurons through synapses. The term 'motor neuron' is usually restricted to the <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> that actually innervate muscles (the lower motor neurons).|$|R
5|$|Another {{option is}} to insert a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not be}} as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|R
50|$|In addition, muscles {{react to}} {{reflexive}} nerve stimuli {{that do not}} always send signals {{all the way to}} the brain. In this case, the signal from the afferent fiber does not reach the brain, but produces the reflexive movement by direct connections with the <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> in the spine. However, the majority of muscle activity is volitional, and the result of complex interactions between various areas of the brain.|$|R
50|$|The CNS {{receives}} sensory (afferent) {{input from}} the PNS and directs {{the flow of information}} to association neurons (interneurons) to create chemical synapse responses which in turn cause the formation of motor (<b>efferent</b> <b>nerve)</b> responses to stimulus. Association neurons are located in the grey matter of the spinal cord and the brain.|$|E
50|$|The primary larynx-related {{functions}} of the mainly <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber RLN, include the transmission of nerve signals to the muscles responsible for regulation of the vocal folds' position and tension to enable vocalization, {{as well as the}} transmission of sensory nerve signals from the mucous membrane of the larynx to the brain.|$|E
50|$|The motor {{branches}} of spinal nerves include: ansa cervicalis, dividing into a superior root, C-1, and an inferior root, C-2 and C-3, and the phrenic nerve, C-3 to C-5, the segmental nerve branches, C-1 to C-5. These nerve groups transmit <b>efferent</b> <b>nerve</b> (motor) {{information from the}} brain to muscle groups of the scalp, neck, diaphragm (anatomy), and shoulders.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} acute {{intravenous}} infusion of cyclosporine (10 mg/kg) on efferent renal and genitofemoral nerve activity and afferent renal nerve activity was studied in anesthetized rats. All animals were studied after unilateral renal denervation and extracellular fluid volume expansion. Activity of both <b>efferent</b> sympathetic <b>nerves</b> was increased significantly by cyclosporine infusion (renal, 69 %; genitofemoral, 60 %). Afferent renal nerve activity was increased 82 % after cyclosporine (P less than 0. 05). Urine flow rate and both absolute and fractional sodium excretion from the innervated kidney were reduced 50 % after cyclosporine infusion (P less than 0. 01). Absolute and fractional sodium excretion from the denervated kidney were significantly increased after cyclosporine. Infusion of vehicle had no {{significant effect on}} any measured variable in innervated or denervated kidneys. These studies demonstrate the capacity of cyclosporine to increase <b>efferent</b> sympathetic <b>nerve</b> activity and afferent nerve activity. It is also shown that sodium retention resulting from acute infusion of cyclosporine {{can be attributed to}} the increase in <b>efferent</b> renal <b>nerve</b> activity...|$|R
25|$|Motor {{supply for}} all {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue is supplied by <b>efferent</b> motor <b>nerve</b> fibers from the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), {{with the exception of}} the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X).|$|R
2500|$|When the afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>nerves</b> {{are both}} destroyed, {{as they may}} be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale, the bladder is flaccid and {{distended}} for a while. Gradually, however, the muscle of the [...] "decentralized bladder" [...] becomes active, with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra. The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied. The reason for the difference between the small, hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended, hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known. The hyperactive state in the former condition suggests the development of denervation hypersensitization even though the neurons interrupted are preganglionic rather than postganglionic.|$|R
