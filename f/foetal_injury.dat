World-wide electronic foetal monitoring is based almost entirely on the cardiotocogram (CTG), which is a continuous display of the foetal heart rate (FHR) pattern together with the contraction of the womb. Despite {{the widespread use of}} the CTG, there is no significant improvement in foetal outcome. In the UK alone it is estimated that birth related negligence claims cost the health authorities over £ 400 M per-annum. An expert system, known as INFANT, has recently been developed to assist CTG interpretation. However, the CTG alone does not always provide all the information required to improve the outcome of labour. The widespread use of ECG analysis has been hindered by the difficulties with poor signal quality and the difficulties in applying the specialised knowledge required for interpreting ECG patterns, in association with other events in labour, in an objective way.

The widespread use of ECG analysis has been hindered by the difficulties with poor signal quality and the difficulties in applying the specialised knowledge required for interpreting ECG patterns, in association with other events in labour, in an objective way. A fundamental investigation and development of optimal signal enhancement techniques that maximise the available information in the ECG signal, along with different techniques for detecting individual waveforms from poor quality signals, has been carried out. To automate the visual interpretation of the ECG waveform, novel techniques have been developed that allow reliable extraction of key features and hence allow a detailed ECG waveform analysis. Fuzzy logic is used to automatically classify the ECG waveform shape using these features by using knowledge that was elicited from expert sources and derived from example data. This allows the subtle changes in the ECG waveform to be automatically detected in relation to other events in labour, and thus improve the clinicians position for making an accurate diagnosis. To ensure the interpretation is based on reliable information and takes place in the proper context, a new and sensitive index for assessing the quality of the ECG has been developed. New techniques to capture, {{for the first time in}} machine form, the clinical expertise / guidelines for electronic foetal monitoring have been developed based on fuzzy logic and finite state machines, The software model provides a flexible framework to further develop and optimise rules for ECG pattern analysis. The signal enhancement, QRS detection and pattern recognition of important ECG waveform shapes have had extensive testing and results are presented. Results show that no significant loss of information is incurred as a result of the signal enhancement and feature extraction techniques...|$|E
40|$|Preterm {{premature}} rupture of the foetal membranes (früher vorzeitiger Blasensprung) {{has remained}} a devastating complication of pregnancy with very high risk of pregnancy loss. Several methods of sealing spontaneously ruptured membranes to stop amniotic fluid leakage and prolong pregnancy have been tested, but no {{one of them has}} achieved a clinical breakthrough. Also, needle and foetoscopic puncture of membranes for diagnostic or surgical interventions in the amniotic cavity carry a significant risk of persistent membrane leakage and subsequent rupture - thus limiting the developing field of intrauterine foetal surgery. Efforts are concentrated on taking action before rupture rather than reacting after rupture: one avenue of research concerns prophylactic plugging of foetoscopic access sites in foetal membranes at the time of intervention, thus inhibiting leakage and rupture. <b>Foetal</b> membrane <b>injuries,</b> spontaneous or iatrogenic, constitute extreme challenges to repair: thinness of foetal membrane tissue, difficult localisation and accessibility of the rupture site, the need for injectable sealants, wet gluing conditions and poor wound healing in this tissue all complicate repair. The goal is to achieve immediate {{and at the same time}} long-lasting closure of the membrane leak. Here we review approaches to closure of foetal membrane defects with liquid sealants or solid biomaterial scaffolds, with the focus on prophylactic plugging of foetoscopic access sites...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma hominis is {{a member}} of the genus {{mycoplasma}} and has only been isolated from humans. It is most frequently isolated from the urogenital tract in the absence of symptoms, but has been isolated from wounds, brain abscess, inflamed joints, blood and placenta from pregnancy with adverse outcomes (especially preterm birth and occasionally term stillbirth). Controversy surrounds whether this organism is a commensal or a pathogen; however, Mycoplasma hominis has been shown to induce preterm birth and <b>foetal</b> lung <b>injury</b> in an experimental primate model as a sole pathogen. These bacteria are known to exist as a parasitic infection, due to a number of missing synthetic and metabolism pathway enzymes from their minimal genome; therefore, the ability to adhere to host cells is important. Here we provide a review that clarifies the different nomenclature (variable adherence-associated antigen and P 50) that has been used to investigate the major surface adhesin for this organism, as well as reported mechanisms responsible for turning off its expression. Variation in the structure of this protein can be used to separate strains into six categories, a method that we were able to use to distinguish and characterise 12 UK strains isolated from between 1983 and 2012. We propose that the Vaa should be used in further investigations to determine if commensal populations and those that are associated with disease utilise different forms of this adhesin, as this is under-studied and identification of pathogenic determinants is overdue for this organism...|$|R
