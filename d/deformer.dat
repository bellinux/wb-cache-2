6000|$|J'aurais dû déjà vous remercier de tout le plaisir que vous m'avez fait en m'envoyant Sapho. Je vous suis très-reconnaissant de cette bonne et amicale pensée, qui s'ajoutera désormais, pour moi, au {{souvenir}} du livre. Je n'avais pas attendu l'arrivée de votre volume pour le lire--mais cela m'a donné l'occasion de m'y remettre encore et de tirer un peu au clair les diverses impressions que tant d'admirables pages m'ont laissées. Je n'essaierai pas de vous rapporter ces impressions dans leur plénitude--dans la crainte de ne réussir qu'à <b>déformer</b> ma pensée--tout autant que la vôtre. Un nouveau livre de vous me fait passer par l'esprit une foule de belles idées, que je vous confierais de vive voix--et de grand cœur--si j'avais le bonheur de vous voir plus souvent. Pour le moment, je vous dirai seulement que tout ce qui vient de vous compte, pour moi, comme un grand évènement, une jouissance rare et fructueuse. Je vous aime mieux dans certaines pages que dans d'autres, mais vous me charmez, vous m'enlevez toujours, et votre manière me pénètre plus qu'aucune autre. Je trouve dans Sapho énormément de vérité et de vie. Ce n'est pas du roman, c'est de l'histoire, et de la plus complète et de la mieux éclairée. Lorsqu'on a fait un livre aussi solide et aussi sérieux que celui-là, on n'a besoin d'être rassuré par personne; ce n'est donc que pour m'encourager moi-même que je constate dans Sapho encore une preuve--à ajouter à celles que vous avez données--de tout ce que le roman peut accomplir comme révélation de la vie et du drôle de mélange que nous sommes. La fille est étudiée avec une patience merveilleuse--c'est un de ces portraits qui épuisent un type. Je vous avouerai que je trouve le jeune homme un peu sacrifié--comme étude et comme recherche--sa figure me paraissant moins éclairée--en comparaison de celle de la femme--qu'il ne le faudrait pour l'ntérêt moral la valeur tragique. J'aurais voulu que vous nous eussiez fait voir davantage par où il a passé--en matière d'expérience plus personnelle et plus intime encore que les coucheries avec Fanny--en matière de rammollissement de volonté et de relâchement d'âme. En un mot, le drame ne se passe peut-être pas assez dans l'âme et dans la conscience de Jean. C'est à mesure que nous touchons à son caractère même que la situation devient intéressante--et ce caractère, vous me faites l'effet de l'avoir un peu négligé. Vous me direz que voilà un jugement bien anglais, et que nous inventons des abstractions, comme nous disons, afin de nous dispenser de toucher aux grosses réalités. J'estime pourtant qu'il n'y a rien de plus réel, de plus positif, de plus à peindre, qu'un caractère; c'est là qu'on trouve bien la couleur et la forme. Vous l'avez bien prouvé, du reste, dans chacun de vos livres, et en vous disant que vous avez laissé l'amant de Sapho un peu trop en blanc, ce n'est qu'avec vous-même que je vous compare. Mais je ne voulais que vous remercier et répondre à votre envoi. Je vous souhaite tout le repos qu'il vous faudra pour recommencer encore! Je garde de cette soirée que j'ai passée chez vous au mois de février une impression toute colorée. Je vous prie de me rappeler au souvenir bienveillant de Madame Daudet, je vous serre la main et suis votre bien dévoué confrère, ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Deformer</b> {{first started}} {{producing}} tracks {{under the name}} FXecute. In 1995 they changed their name to <b>Deformer.</b> All tracks during that period were produced on Amiga 2000 and Atari computers using Akai S950 samplers. Jungle, Breakbeat and Rave music were primary and samples from cult and obscure horror films were {{used to create a}} rather dark atmosphere which became a <b>Deformer</b> signature. To create a unique sound within Jungle music production, <b>Deformer</b> mostly avoided to use the famous ‘Amen Break’ and Mike Redman recorded his own live drums which he later sampled in a similar tradition. <b>Deformer</b> performed in underground clubs, creating a buzz in the alternative dance scene after the mid nineties.|$|E
50|$|In 1992 Redman {{started the}} project <b>Deformer,</b> a {{collective}} with {{several members of}} the Redrum Squad and Redman himself. <b>Deformer</b> makes progressive electronic music. The group produces demos and performs in the international clubbing scene. The cover for the maxi single Meatcleaver was banned in several countries; it shows a monkey's head composed of pornographic images. In 2006 <b>Deformer</b> won a prize for Best Dance Act and in 2008 they released a record with American rap group Public Enemy. The group performed at pop festival Lowlands in the Netherlands in 2008. In 2011, <b>Deformer</b> developed an audiovisual project called Videopacolypz and released an accompanying album. Videopacolypz was created with the minimal sounds of the Videopac computer of 1978.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deformers</b> {{is being}} {{developed}} by video game studio Ready at Dawn. The project began as a physics technology demonstration. A duo at the studio began working on prototype for <b>Deformers</b> in August 2014 while most employees were occupied with The Order: 1886.|$|R
50|$|<b>Deformers</b> was {{initially}} scheduled to launch for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on February 14, 2017, however it was delayed {{so that the}} development team could address issues from feedback they had received. An open beta of the Windows version ran from April 1-4 on digital distribution service Steam. <b>Deformers</b> will be the second game published by GameStop's publishing program GameTrust.|$|R

50|$|In 2006 <b>Deformer</b> won a {{prize for}} Best Dance Act and in 2008 they {{released}} a record with Rap group Public Enemy. They collaborated with DJ Starscream (Slipknot), 6Blocc and Heavy metal band Living Colour. They performed at renowned festivals like; Lowlands and Outlook. <b>Deformer</b> shared {{the stage with}} sounding names like: Amon Tobin, Venetian Snares, Andy C, Technical Itch and many others. In 2009 <b>Deformer</b> introduced the subgenre ‘Defcore’ with the track ‘Extreme Deformity’, a mixture of Dubstep and Gabber. In 2011, they developed an audiovisual project called ‘Videopacolypz’ and released an accompanying album. Videopacolypz was created with the minimal sounds coming from the Videopac game console that was originally released in 1978. Mike Redman has previously collaborated with Dutch Breakcore producer Bong-Ra on his acclaimed ‘Bikini Bandits Kill Kill Kill’ album, but in 2011 <b>Deformer</b> and Bong-Ra joined forces and founded the group Wormskull. They released the album entitled ‘Sound of Hell’ on German record label Ad Noiseam the same year. The band Wormskull, with Balázs Pándi on drums, combines live music with electronica and like <b>Deformer,</b> uses obscure cult, horror and exploitation film samples.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deformer</b> {{currently}} {{consists of}} just Mike Redman and occasional guest artists during live shows. Redman usually wears a deformed mask during the performances. In 2012 ‘Hybrid’ {{was released on}} PRSPCT Recordings. In 2014 Redman collaborated with American Horror-icon, director and producer Charles Band, founder of film company Full Moon Features. They produced the album ‘Full Moon Deformed’. <b>Deformer</b> still performs on an international basis.|$|E

40|$|Lattice <b>deformers</b> are {{a popular}} option for {{modeling}} {{the behavior of}} elastic bodies as they avoid the need for conforming mesh generation, and their regular structure offers significant opportunities for performance optimizations. Our work expands the scope of current lattice-based elastic <b>deformers,</b> adding support {{for a number of}} important simulation features. We accommodate complex nonlinear, optionally anisotropic materials while using an economical one-point quadrature scheme. Our formulation fully accommodates near-incompressibility by enforcing accurate nonlinear constraints, supports implicit integration for large time steps, and is not susceptible to locking or poor conditioning of the discrete equations. Additionally, we increase the accuracy of our solver by employing a novel high-order quadrature scheme on lattice cells overlapping with the model boundary, which are treated at sub-cell precision. Finally, we detail how this accurate boundary treatment can be implemented at a minimal computational premium over the cost of a voxel-accurate discretization. We demonstrate our method in the simulation of complex musculoskeletal human models...|$|R
50|$|In 2011 <b>Deformer</b> {{formed a}} {{co-operation}} with Bong-Ra, named Wormskull. The band Wormskull combines live music with electronica.|$|E
50|$|Hailing from Rotterdam city <b>Deformer</b> {{integrated}} {{the local}} Gabber sound to their formula {{and the track}} ‘Slasher’ became a blueprint for future productions. The sound was different {{at the time and}} during that period the artwork for Drum and Bass records was usually very clean and mostly consisted of abstract computer graphics. <b>Deformer</b> took an opposite approach and made record sleeves that would more easily be associated with the artwork of Death Metal records. The cover for the maxi single ‘Meatcleaver’ was banned in several countries; it shows a monkey’s head composed of pornographic images. Due to the unorthodox record sleeves <b>Deformer</b> often failed to reach the more mainstream audience that buy Drum and bass records. <b>Deformer</b> is known for going against the grain and also like to induct hidden messages in their recordings and artwork. For example; in their 2005 album ‘Revolution Theory’ there is a hidden track before position 1 on the CD. This can only be found when rewinded in an external cd player. ‘Meatcleaver’ has reversed speech in the track, the artwork contains almost unrecognizable pop icons.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 {{that some}} of their tracks were officially {{released}}. Their debut ‘FXecutioners’, released on Mike Redman’s independent record label Redrum Recordz received critical acclaim. It was a mixture between jungle, progressive drum and bass and dark trip hop. Around 2000 Redman asked members of the Rap group Redrum Squad to take part during the live performances of <b>Deformer.</b> Turntablist Eni-Less, MC P-Mode and DJ Mack completed the line up accompanied by mostly two dancers they call ‘Freaqks‘ and occasional guest artists. The <b>Deformer</b> live shows were very horror influenced. During the bigger live shows the Freaqks would often spray fake blood into the audience, dance with prosthetics like chopped off heads and the stage would be decorated with fake corpses. <b>Deformer</b> also used a giant gorilla prop on stage with a person in it to move it across the stage. The show element was of great importance and no other act within their field has previously done such a thing. <b>Deformer</b> were resident during the popular ‘Illy Noiz’ Drum and Bass parties in Rotterdam led by DJ Mack.|$|E

Fake blood was also used, but CG blood was also shown.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} {{of a set of}} techniques called space deformations, also known as free-form deformations, warps, skinning or <b>deformers.</b> This family of techniques has various applications in modeling, animation, rendering or simulation, and we focus especially on their application to modeling. Space deformation techniques are mappings of space onto another space, and can therefore be applied conveniently to any embedded geometry. This independence from the underlying geometric representation of deformed shape makes even the simplest and earliest deformation techniques still applicable and popular in current industrial practice. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Deformers</b> is a {{multiplayer}} brawler {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Players {{take control of}} squishy ball-shaped creatures called a Forms {{that are capable of}} rolling, jumping, dashing, and absorbing items. In the deathmatch and team deathmatch modes, the goal is to roll around and knock opponents off the arena platform. Form-ball is a mode that plays like association football, a ball must be knocked into a net to score goals. The game supports online 2, 3, and 4-player splitscreen as well as online multiplayer with up to eight players.|$|R
50|$|Redman {{started out}} as a solo MC and founder of the rap group Redrum Squad. He owns the leading record label Redrum Recordz and creates music for {{different}} musical genres (Hardcore, rap, hip-hop, metal, drum and bass, breakcore, Jungle. Redman {{is also a member of}} the groups <b>Deformer</b> and Wormskull. He has toured internationally with these acts and collaborated with renowned international artists and producers. <b>Deformer</b> has released a record with American rap group Public Enemy.|$|E
50|$|Spidle {{subsequently}} {{left the}} band following his divorce from Thili, and was temporarily replaced by Rob Shedden. Shedden left the band {{to focus on}} Long Long Long, and original members Urich and Smith recorded released a third album as a duo. <b>Deformer,</b> was released on their own label, Fundog in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Deformer</b> logo is {{a monkey}} with six arms. Inspired by the Asian ‘three wise monkeys’ proverb. Where the monkeys {{originally}} cover their eyes, ears and mouth (see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil) Deformer’s monkey accents the eyes, ears and mouth distorting the proverb to ‘See, hear, scream!’ combining the three wise monkeys into one furious ape.|$|E

50|$|Pose space {{deformation}} is {{a computer}} animation technique {{which is used to}} deform a mesh on skeleton-driven animation. Common use of this technique is to deform the shape of a mesh (for example, an arm) according to the angle of the joint (in this case, the elbow) bent. Although the name is commonly called Pose space deformation on many scholarly articles, 3D animation software rarely uses that name. On Autodesk Maya, it's implemented under the name Pose <b>Deformer,</b> and on Blender, it's implemented as Shape Keys. The first famous application of this technique was the cloth's movement on the first episode of the animated film The Animatrix.|$|E
40|$|Believable {{physical}} interactions involving collisions between objects are essential in motion graphics and video games.

This paper presents a custom <b>deformer</b> for creating simple collision effects in Autodesk Maya. The <b>deformer</b> determines intersection between objects by performing inclusion tests for selected vertices, and approximates the elastic behavior of the soft body in response to collisions by applying a controllable deforming algorithm to the object surface. No physics simulation is required in this process.
