40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (the {{most severe}} form of {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} type I) causes progressive {{deterioration of the}} central nervous system and death in childhood. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation before the age of two years halts disease progression and prolongs life, but many children lack a bone marrow donor. We investigated the feasibility of using cord-blood transplants from unrelated donors and a myeloablative preparative regimen that did not involve total-body irradiation in young children with <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> METHODS: Between December 1995 and October 2002, 20 consecutive children with <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> received busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin before receiving cord-blood transplants from unrelated donors. The children were subsequently evaluated for engraftment, adverse effects, and effects on disease symptoms. RESULTS: Cord-blood donors had normal alpha-L-iduronidase activity (mean number of cells, 10. 53 x 10 (7) per kilogram of body weight) and were discordant for up to three of six HLA markers. Neutrophil engraftment occurred a median of 24 days after transplantation. Five patients had grade II or grade III acute graft-versus-host disease; none had extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease. Seventeen of the 20 children were alive a median of 905 days after transplantation, with complete donor chimerism and normal peripheral-blood alpha-L-iduronidase activity (event-free survival rate, 85 percent). Transplantation improved neurocognitive performance and decreased somatic features of <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood from unrelated donors appears to be an excellent source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Sustained engraftment can be achieved without total-body irradiation. Cord-blood transplantation favorably altered the natural history of <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and thus may be important to consider in young children with this form of the disease.

40|$|Skin {{fibroblasts}} {{from eight}} families with <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (X-linked recessive and autosomal recessive) and normal individuals {{have been studied}} in cell culture. A good correlation between cellular metachromasia and the quantitative estimation of intracellular mucopolysaccharides was observed provided the culture conditions were standardized. In both forms of <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> intracellular mucopolysaccharide content {{could be used to}} distinguish the affected individual and the carrier from the normal subject, although the total mucopolysaccharide content of fibroblast cultures or the amount in the culture medium did not permit such a distinction. Retinol, in concentrations similar to those encountered in man in hyper-vitaminosis A, caused a reduction in total mucopolysaccharide content of fibroblast cultures from normal and affected individuals. Cultures from three patients with the X-linked recessive form of <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> showed a gradual but marked decrease in cellular metachromasia and approximately 60 % decrease in mucopolysaccharide content. Synthesis of polysaccharides and sulfation appeared to be equally affected. On removal of retinol from the medium the content of intracellular mucopolysaccharides returned to pretreatment levels. The possible relevance of these findings to the treatment of <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a {{group of}} {{lysosomal}} storage disorder characterized by progressive multiorgan accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Patients with MPS I (<b>Hurler′s</b> <b>syndrome)</b> present {{as one of the}} most difficult airway problems to be managed by anesthesiologists.

25|$|MPS I H (also called <b>Hurler</b> <b>syndrome</b> or α-L-iduronidase deficiency), is {{the most}} severe of the MPS I subtypes. Developmental delay is evident {{by the end of}} the first year, and {{patients}} usually stop developing between ages 2 and 4. This is followed by progressive mental decline and loss of physical skills. Language may be limited due to hearing loss and an enlarged tongue. In time, the clear layers of the cornea become clouded and retinas may begin to degenerate. Carpal tunnel syndrome (or similar compression of nerves elsewhere in the body) and restricted joint movement are common.|$|E
25|$|MPS I H-S, Hurler–Scheie syndrome, is {{less severe}} than <b>Hurler</b> <b>syndrome</b> alone. Symptoms {{generally}} begin between ages 3 and 8. Children may have moderate intellectual disability and learning difficulties. Skeletal and systemic irregularities include short stature, marked smallness in the jaws, progressive joint stiffness, compressed spinal cord, clouded corneas, hearing loss, heart disease, coarse facial features, and umbilical hernia. Respiratory problems, sleep apnea, {{and heart disease}} may develop in adolescence. Some persons with MPS I H-S need continuous positive airway pressure during sleep to ease breathing. Life expectancy is generally into the late teens or early twenties.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{children}} may be quite large at birth and appear normal but may have inguinal (in the groin) or umbilical (where the umbilical cord passes through the abdomen) hernias. Growth in height may be faster than normal but begins to slow {{before the end of}} the first year and often ends around age 3. Many children develop a short body trunk and a maximum stature of less than 4 feet. Distinct facial features (including flat face, depressed nasal bridge, and bulging forehead) become more evident in the second year. By age 2, the ribs have widened and are oar-shaped. The liver, spleen, and heart are often enlarged. Children may experience noisy breathing and recurring upper respiratory tract and ear infections. Feeding may be difficult for some children, and many experience periodic bowel problems. Children with <b>Hurler</b> <b>syndrome</b> often die before age 10 from obstructive airway disease, respiratory infections, and cardiac complications.|$|E

40|$|Cell culture {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} for studying connective tissue disorders involving fibroblasts. <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> an inborn error of mucopolysaccharide metabolism, is an inherited disease resulting in an accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in various tissues of the body (1 - 3). It has recently become evident that skin fibroblasts from affected individuals and carriers of the abnormal gene grown in cell culture contain metachromatic granules when stained for mucopolysaccharides with toluidine blue O (4). The preservation of the biochemical abnormality of <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> in cell culture should permit a chemical investigation of this inherited mucopolysaccharidosis at the cellular level. Comparative studies on fibroblasts from normal subjects and patients with <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> provide a convenient method to amplify the present information on the environmental conditions which modify mucopolysaccharide synthesis. Fell and her colleagues (5 - 8), using the techniques of organ culture, found that when embryonic cartilage was grown in medium containing retinol (vitamin A alcohol), there was a marked disappearance of metachromatic material from the matrix which {{was associated with a}} 50 % loss of intracellular mucopolysaccharides. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to relate cellular mucopolysaccharides, measured quantitatively by chemical analyses, with cellular metachromasia of human skin fibroblasts and using these techniques, to study the effect of retinol on cellular mucopolysaccharides of skin fibroblasts derived from normal individuals and patients with <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R

40|$|Clones of skin {{fibroblasts}} {{from normal}} individuals, patients with different mucopolysaccharidoses, and certain of their relatives {{have been examined}} for cellular metachromasia and cellular uronic acid. All the clones derived from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers in families with the autosomal forms of <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> showed marked metachromasia and increased cellular uronic acid. Since only one cell population was demonstrated in clones derived from heterozygous carriers, no evidence for autosomal inactivation was obtained. Clones derived from affected individuals with the X-linked recessive form of <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> contained uniform populations of metachromatic staining cells which demonstrated increased cellular uronic acid. Clones derived from the noncarrier fathers showed no cellular metachromasia or increased cellular uronic acid. Clones derived from the heterozygous mothers and sisters showed two populations both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the average, 72 % of these clones were metachromatic and demonstrated an increased uronic acid content; 28 % of the clones showed no metachromasia and the uronic acid content {{was similar to that}} found in normal individuals.

40|$|Seven {{families}} affected with <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{have been}} studied using the methods of cell culture. Skin fibroblasts obtained from the skin of 7 patients with <b>Hurler's</b> <b>syndrome</b> contained metachromatic granules when stained for mucopolysaccharides with toluidine blue O and alcian blue, whereas fibroblasts from normal subjects contained no metachromatic granules. In four families skin cultures of the clinically normal parents showed fibroblasts which contained demonstrable metachromatic granules and "gargoyle" cells and {{were considered to be}} heterozygous for the abnormal gene. Fibroblast cultures from certain other members of these families showed metachromasia. These findings were also considered to indicate heterozygosity for the abnormal gene. Three families of the X-linked type of the disease were studied. Fibroblasts cultured from the father contained no metachromatic granules whereas those of the hemizygous mother contained both metachromatic granules and "gargoyle" cells. In one family the abnormal gene could be traced through unaffected individuals for three generations.
