5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary <b>intake</b> of salt. High sodium <b>intake</b> {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium <b>intake</b> by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the <b>intake</b> of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare energy and {{macronutrient}} <b>intakes</b> between adult Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, mainland Puerto Ricans, and non-Hispanics. METHODS. Age-specific mean <b>intakes</b> were estimated based on 24 -hour recalls from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) (1982 to 1984) and the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) (1976 to 1980) and were compared with the use of t tests. RESULTS. Mexican Americans had higher total fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat <b>intakes</b> than did Puerto Ricans and older Cuban Americans. Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans had similar <b>intakes,</b> except for younger Cuban Americans, who had higher total and saturated fat and lower carbohydrate <b>intakes.</b> Cholesterol <b>intakes</b> among Mexican American men and 60 - to 74 -year-old women were higher than those among other Hispanic groups. Carbohydrate and protein <b>intakes</b> were higher among Hispanic groups compared with those among non-Hispanics while total fat <b>intakes</b> were generally lower. CONCLUSIONS. Since macronutrient <b>intakes</b> differ between Hispanic groups, dietary research, recommendations, and interventions should be targeted to each group individually. Older Puerto Rican and Cuban American adults met population guidelines for reducing chronic disease risk for more macronutrients than any other group...|$|R

This study {{describes}} dietary <b>intakes</b> and food sources of fat and fatty acids in 1051 Irish adults (aged 18 – 90 years), {{using data from the}} 2011 national food consumption survey, the National Adult Nutrition Survey. It also compares current <b>intakes</b> for 18 – 64 -year-olds with those reported in the last such survey in 2001, the North/South Ireland Food Consumption Survey. Dietary fat <b>intakes</b> were estimated using data from 4 -d semi-weighed (2011) and 7 -d estimated (2001) food diaries. In 2011, <b>intakes</b> for 18 – 64 -year-olds were as follows: total fat, 34 · 1 (sd 6 · 1) % total energy (%TE); SFA, 13 · 3 (sd 3 · 3) %TE; MUFA, 12 · 5 (sd 2 · 6) %TE; PUFA, 6 · 1 (sd 2 · 2) %TE; and trans-fat, 0 · 511 (sd 0 · 282) %TE. Apart from MUFA, <b>intakes</b> decreased (P 65 years had the highest <b>intakes</b> of SFA; however, <b>intakes</b> were typically higher than UK-recommended values for all groups. In contrast, <b>intakes</b> of long-chain n- 3 fatty acids were lowest in younger age groups. <b>Intakes</b> of trans-fat were well within UK-recommended levels.

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand and account for seasonal variation in food and nutrient <b>intakes</b> when planning interventions to combat micronutrient deficiencies in resource-poor settings. The objective {{of the present study was}} to quantify food and nutrient <b>intakes</b> and assess the adequacy of micronutrient <b>intakes</b> among young children and their mothers during the lean and post-harvest (PH) seasons in rural Burkina Faso. We quantified food <b>intakes</b> by 24 -h recall in a representative sample of 480 children aged 36 - 59 months and their mothers in two provinces in Western Burkina Faso. We calculated the probability of adequacy (PA) of usual <b>intakes</b> of ten micronutrients and an overall mean PA (MPA). Seasonal changes in nutrient <b>intakes</b> and PA were assessed by mixed linear regression and non-parametric tests, respectively. Energy <b>intakes</b> did not differ significantly between seasons for women or children, although the women's <b>intakes</b> were slightly higher in the PH season. Most of the micronutrient <b>intakes</b> were significantly higher in the PH season, with the exception of vitamin A which was lower and vitamin B 12 and Zn which were similar across seasons. MPA increased significantly across seasons, from 0 · 26 to 0 · 37 for women and from 0 · 43 to 0 · 52 for children. PA of Ca, vitamin C, folate and vitamin B 12 were very low. Staple grains and vegetables were major sources of micronutrients but <b>intakes</b> were not sufficient to meet nutrient needs for the majority of the subjects. Food-based strategies are needed to increase micronutrient <b>intakes</b> of women and children in Burkina Faso. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Whether {{adolescent}} overweight/obesity {{is linked}} to socioeconomic status (SES) and fruit and vegetable (F/V) <b>intakes</b> has not been confirmed. We aimed {{to determine whether there}} is an association between SES and adolescent overweight/obesity and to test the mediating effect of F/V <b>intakes.</b> This cross-sectional study included the data of 63, 111 adolescents extracted from the 2013 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. Overweight/obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥ 85 th percentile, while F/V <b>intakes</b> were categorized as high (recommended levels: ≥ 1 fruit serving and ≥ 3 vegetable servings per day) versus low. Among girls, low SES (beta = 0. 50, p < 0. 001) and F/V <b>intakes</b> (beta = − 0. 17, p = 0. 038) were both significantly associated with overweight/obesity; the former association was significantly mediated by F/V <b>intakes</b> (Sobel test: z = 2. 00, p = 0. 046). Among boys, neither SES nor F/V <b>intakes</b> was significantly associated with overweight/obesity. Adolescent overweight/obesity was significantly linked to low SES and F/V <b>intakes</b> among girls only; low SES indirectly increased the risk of overweight/obesity via low F/V <b>intakes.</b> Therefore, promoting F/V <b>intakes</b> for socially disadvantaged girls should be prioritized as a population-based strategy for preventing adolescent overweight/obesity in South Korea...|$|R

40|$|Polyphenols {{have been}} {{suggested}} as protective factors {{for a range of}} chronic diseases. However, studying the impact of individual polyphenols on health is hindered by the intrinsic inter-correlations among polyphenols. Alternatively, studying foods rich in specific polyphenols fails to grasp the ubiquity of these components. Studying overall dietary patterns would allow for a more comprehensive description of polyphenol <b>intakes</b> in the population. Our objective was to identify clusters of dietary polyphenol <b>intakes</b> in a French middle-aged population (35 - 64 years old). Participants from the primary prevention trial SUpplementation en VItamines et Minéraux AntioXydants (SU. VI.

The fifty most consumed individual dietary polyphenols were divided into energy-adjusted tertiles and introduced in a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), leading to comprehensive factors of dietary polyphenol <b>intakes.</b> The identified factors discriminating polyphenol <b>intakes</b> were used in a hierarchical clustering procedure. Four clusters were identified, corresponding broadly to clustered preferences for their respective food sources. Cluster 1 was characterised by high <b>intakes</b> of tea polyphenols. Cluster 2 was characterised by high <b>intakes</b> of wine polyphenols.

40|$|In the UK, {{there are}} marked ethnic {{differences}} in risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes and obesity, which originate in childhood. Dietary nutrient <b>intakes</b> are important determinants of chronic disease risks. The aims of this thesis are to determine (a) the extent of {{ethnic differences in}} dietary nutrient <b>intakes</b> in children and (b) the contribution of dietary nutrient <b>intakes</b> to ethnic differences in blood lipids, insulin and glucose and adiposity markers. The analyses {{are based on a}} cross-sectional study of 2209 school children of South Asian, black African-Caribbean and white European origin aged 9 - 10 years in whom detailed assessments of dietary nutrient <b>intakes</b> were made, using 24 -hour recall and 4 day diary methods. Compared with white European children, South Asian children reported higher mean total energy, fat, polyunsaturated fat and protein intakes; carbohydrate <b>intakes</b> (particularly sugars) and vitamins C and D <b>intakes</b> were lower. Black African-Caribbean children, in contrast, had lower <b>intakes</b> of total and saturated fat, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and vitamin D and higher <b>intakes</b> of protein and carbohydrates (particularly starch). Marked ethnic differences in cardio-rnetabolic risk markers were apparent. South Asian children had raised insulin and HbAlc levels, high triglyceride and low HDL-cholesterol; while LDL cholesterol levels were similar; black African-Caribbean children had moderately raised insulin and HbAlc levels, low LDL- cholesterol and triglycerides and high HDL-cholesterol, particularly in black Africans. The lower LDL-cholesterol levels in black Africans were explained by their lower saturated fat <b>intakes</b> and their higher starch <b>intakes.</b> However, ethnic differences in dietary nutrient <b>intakes</b> had little effect on ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes risk markers and adiposity. The dietary patterns of black Africans may help to protect against CHD risk in the next generation and provide a useful reference point for chronic disease prevention for other ethnic groups.
