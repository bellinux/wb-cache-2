Particular emphasis is placed on the analysis of enterprises innovative activities and their roles in the development of the modern Entrepreneurship Institute. Also, they investigate the wide range of instruments of governmental support, which are provided at the regional level. The comparison and analysis have resulted to making proposals for optimization of the Russian government support programs for entrepreneurship on state- and regional levels. The results of the comparison can be useful to improve developing entrepreneurship and encouraging innovation in the forestry and forest-based sector at the regional policy of Russia...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{ensure that}} forest {{ecosystem}} {{services will be}} maintained in future climate conditions, the challenge of developing and implementing forest adaptation strategies has become a priority shared across Europe (European Commission 2010) {{and around the world}} (FAO 2012). A critical aspect of any adaptation (and mitigation) strategy is to ensure that management choices have sufficient flexibility and are consistent with sustainable forest management (SFM) principles that balance the forest’s social, ecological and economic outputs. Most current studies, however, still tend to consider forest adaptation independently of exogenous developments (Seppälä et al. 2009), or are based on forecasting and thus only extrapolate from current trends. Yet the futures of forest systems are also uncertain because change may come mainly from socio-economic, and not ecological, drivers (Schoene and Bernier 2012). Climate change will, moreover, have a highly uncertain effect on socio-ecological systems such as forests. A number of authors and international publications on the environment have posited that scenarios studies offer a framework for dealing with strong uncertainties and the complexity of socio-ecological systems: “Comparisons among a set of contrasting scenarios are used to understand the systemic interrelation and dynamics of complex socio-ecological systems and to define a range of possibilities and uncertainties in quantitative and qualitative terms” (Thompson et al. 2012). Likewise, SFM practices are beginning to underscore the importance of taking into account landscape-level views of the forest, and of the many exogenous drivers of regional change, when thinking about integrated land use (Schoene and Bernier 2012). Adaptation strategies must therefore move away from single technical solutions and must not rely on one-size-fits-all mechanisms. New modes of governance that enable rapidly accelerating social, economic and institutional changes are required (Seppälä et al. 2009). Recent emphasis has also been placed on the importance of implementing regionally based forest adaptation strategies that are accepted by local stakeholders (Spathelf et al. 2013). A scenario planning approach that engages stakeholders in scenario development could be a way to overcome such challenges by combining anticipatory learning of climate change impacts (Tschakert and Dietrich 2010) with land use planning. Thus, forest adaptation could be seen from a perspective of forest planning rather than of forest management. It could involve a more indirect form of management that is broader in scale in terms of time, space and organisational level (Mermet and Farcy 2011). The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss how a foresight approach and scenario planning can offer an appropriate framework for dealing with climate change uncertainties at local level, and for elaborating a plurality of forest adaptation strategies derived from plausible sectoral, socio-ecological and regional changes. To test this assumption, the Landes de Gascogne Forest (LGF) 2050 case study (Mora et al. 2012) appears particularly interesting, due both to recent storm damage in 1999 and 2009 and because of the increasing, diverse demands in changing economic and social conditions for various forest ecosystem goods and services. The Landes region of south-western France is located at the intersection of Northern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. It covers a surface area of about 15, 000 km 2. The major biophysical features of the area include temperate, oceanic climate conditions, podzolic sandy soils and shallow groundwater levels. The LGF, which was expanded in the nineteenth century to become the largest cultivated and privately owned (92 %) forest in Europe, is primarily composed of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). The LGF covers two thirds of the Landes de Gascogne region, with agricultural and built-up land representing 18 and 7 %, respectively (Mora et al. 2012). The forest also has a significant economic impact through its <b>forestry</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest-based</b> <b>industries.</b> A unique aspect of the Landes forest-wood chain is the location of both timber processing stages within the region and its largely exclusive use of local maritime pine wood resources. However, the forestry and forest-based sector have faced difficulties since the Martin and Klaus storms in 1999 and 2009 that created approximately 70 million cubic metres of windthrow damage. The forestry sector is also experiencing structural challenges as synergies among industry subsectors weaken and biorefinery activities gain prominence. Bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the large urban centres of Bordeaux to the north and Bayonne to the south (Fig. 1), the Landes area has become an increasingly popular place to live and to work. Almost all of the 390 municipalities in the region are now experiencing population growth, urbanisation, the emergence of a broader base of economic activity and, more generally, a diversification of their forest-derived goods and services. The contribution of forest-related activities to the rural economy and to social well-being may change as a result of these trends (Slee et al. 2004) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The water {{footprint}} by the Water Footprint Network (WF) is an ambitious tool for measuring human appropriation and promoting sustainable use of fresh water. Using recent case studies and examples from water-abundant Fennoscandia, we consider {{whether it is}} an appropriate tool for evaluating the water use of <b>forestry</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest-based</b> products. We show that aggregating catchment level water consumption over a product life cycle does not consider fresh water as a renewable resource and is inconsistent {{with the principles of}} the hydrologic cycle. Currently, the WF assumes that all evapotranspiration (ET) from forests is a human appropriation of water although ET from managed forests in Fennoscandia is indistinguishable from that of unmanaged forests. We suggest that ET should not be included in the {{water footprint}} of rain-fed <b>forestry</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest-based</b> products.

40|$|Report of TAC 49, Rome, June 19 - 24, 1989, Alex McCalla presiding. Medium term {{plans for}} the period 1990 - 1994 for CIMMYT, IRRI, and ICARDA were {{endorsed}} {{and sent to the}} CGIAR for approval. TAC expressed strong views on the location of IBPGR, particularly that a developing country location had been ruled out. TAC urged rapid settlement of the administrative problems to enable IBPGR to strengthen its technical and research capacity. The early chapters of the TAC Chair's paper on approaches to expanding the CGIAR were discussed, along with drafts of regional papers. The reports of the TAC fact finding missions to candidate centers except AVRDC were discussed in closed session. Forestry played a role in these discussions. TAC also reviewed an inventory of international <b>forestry</b> research, <b>and</b> identified common themes of deforestation, fuelwood, <b>and</b> <b>forest-based</b> <b>industries.</b> Members felt more information was needed. In a joint meeting with center directors, TAC endorsed revised terms of reference and guidelines for external program reviews of centers (Annexes IV and V). Papers by outside authors on the role of universities in agricultural research in developing countries, and agricultural research priorities for Africa were discussed. Views varied widely on the practice of IARCs managing donor funds intended for national institutions. Mr. McCalla said he would discuss the issue with donors before proceeding further. TAC decided to establish an ad hoc committee including donors, center directors, the CGIAR Secretariat, TAC members, and some outsiders to review the new resource allocation process, taking center views into account.
