5|$|Maine {{was to be}} {{the third}} Montana-class battleship. She was to be named in honor of the 23rd state, and was {{assigned}} to the New York Navy Yard. Maine would have been the third ship to bear that name <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> commissioned.|$|E
5|$|New Hampshire {{was to be}} {{the fourth}} Montana-class battleship, and was to be named in honor of the ninth state. She was {{assigned}} to the New York Navy Yard, and would have been the third ship to bear that name <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> commissioned.|$|E

5|$|Ohio {{was to be}} {{the second}} Montana-class battleship. She was to be named in honor of the 17th state, and was {{assigned}} to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for construction. Ohio would have been the fourth ship to bear that name <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> commissioned.|$|E

5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a rueful}} defeat and bewilderment in Dan's face that made Mrs. Pasmer laugh. [...] "What <b>has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> doing now?" [...] she asked.|$|R

5|$|Louisiana {{was to be}} {{the fifth}} and final Montana-class battleship. She was to be named in honor of the 18th state and {{assigned}} to the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia. Louisiana would have been the third ship to bear that name <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> commissioned. By hull number, Louisiana was the last American battleship authorized for construction.|$|E
5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses. However, she likely would have avoided these <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> underway, and {{if she had been}} hit, damage control teams would have kept the ship afloat.|$|E
5|$|West Caruth was {{inspected}} by the 12th Naval District of the United States Navy after completion for possible {{use as a}} service collier and was assigned the identification number of 3850. <b>Had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> commissioned, {{she would have been}} known as USS West Caruth (ID-3850), but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not. <b>She</b> {{begged to}} spend the day with Constance Hacket, and we picked her up as we came home. Poor child, what <b>has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> doing? I <b>have</b> not looked after her properly.' ...|$|R

5|$|Willkie {{visited the}} {{president}} at the White House {{for the first time}} as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before Roosevelt's third swearing-in. The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie, and she would have done so herself <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, and gave his former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, Winston Churchill. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie's mission. He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22.|$|E

25|$|Doughty {{grew up in}} Oahu, Hawaii, {{where she}} had no {{exposure}} to death until, at age 8, she witnessed the death of another child in an accident. She was quickly taken {{from the scene of}} the accident and it was never spoken of again. For several years, she became obsessed with fears of her own or her family's deaths. Doughty says she could have recovered better from the incident <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> given the opportunity to face the reality of the child's death.|$|E

60|$|Poor Miss Mackenzie! I {{fear that}} they who read this chronicle of her life will already have allowed {{themselves}} to think worse of her than she deserved. Many of them, I know, will think far worse of her than they should think. Of what faults, even if we analyse her faults, <b>has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> guilty? Where <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> weak, who among us is not, in that, weak also? Of what vanity <b>has</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> guilty with which the least vain among us might not justly tax himself? Having been left alone in the world, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> looked to make friends for herself; and in seeking for new friends <b>she</b> <b>has</b> wished {{to find the best}} that might come in her way.|$|R
25|$|However, her opponents' {{efforts were}} unsuccessful, and five {{candidates}} entered the Democratic primary. As {{a result of}} the fragmented primary opposition, McKinney won just enough votes to avoid a runoff. This all but assured her return to Congress after a two-year absence. However, contrary to traditional practice, the Democrats did not restore McKinney's seniority. <b>Had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> able to regain her seniority, she would have been a senior Democrat on the International Relations and Armed Services committees, as well as ranking Democrat on an International Relations subcommittee.|$|E
25|$|On November 19, Parrish {{spoke to}} the press about her {{expulsion}} from caucus. She said that <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> in Martin's place, she {{would have done the}} same. She went on to say, however, that the party under Martin had fallen into disarray and that Martin and his inner circle ran the party using guerrilla warfare tactics. She said she would still vote with the Liberals on the vast majority of legislation, but would now be free to express her views without fear of reprisal.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of September, her intentions had become quite clear. She has said that only widespread sexism in the Socialist Party had prevented it from rallying around her candidacy {{as it would have}} <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> a man. She announced an official team to promote her campaign on 30 August. At this point, polls showed her to be much more popular than her closest competitor, former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and other Socialist heavyweights Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Jack Lang, another former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and Fran√ßois Hollande.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the face}} smiled, {{and it was}} a smile that {{reassured}} her and drove away the last doubt that <b>she</b> <b>had.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> on her feet in an instant.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> weeping. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> weeping now. Ann Veronica was {{overcome}} by this amount of emotion.|$|R

25|$|The mayoral primary {{elections}} were held on May 19, 2015. Democrats nominated Jim Kenney, {{a member of}} the Philadelphia City Council, as their party's nominee. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. <b>Had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> elected, Bailey would have become Philadelphia's first female mayor, as well as the city's first Republican mayor in more than 60 years.|$|E
25|$|On 14 July 2017, Ludlam {{resigned}} from the Senate after he found that he had dual Australian-New Zealand citizenship. The next week on 18 July 2017, his former co-deputy, and Queensland Senator, Larissa Waters resigned, after discovering that she held dual citizenship with Canada, and that <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> born a week later {{that would not have}} been the case. Both were ineligible to be elected to Parliament under section 44 of the Australian Constitution. Subsequently, Adam Bandt and Rachel Siewert were named as temporary co-deputy leaders until the arrival of Ludlam and Waters' replacements in Canberra.|$|E
25|$|Potsdam was {{en route}} to the United States when war was declared. She {{returned}} to Germany by sailing around the north coast of Scotland. Requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine, she was initially used as an accommodation ship at Hamburg. Plans to convert her to an aircraft carrier were not carried through. Work started in November 1942 as Project Elbe, but conversion was abandoned in February 1943 after little work had been done by Blohm & Voss. <b>Had</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> converted, she would have carried 24 aircraft and been armed with 6 dual 4.1 inch Anti-Aircraft guns, 5 dual 3.7mm Anti-Aircraft guns and 24 to 32 20mm Anti-Aircraft guns.|$|E
60|$|Grace promised, {{and went}} away in better humour, but more because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made {{important}} than because she cared for what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> doing. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> glad {{no one could}} say <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> behindhand with her service, {{but it was a}} burthen to her, and she did not open her mind to enter into it so as to make it otherwise.|$|R
