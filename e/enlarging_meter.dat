50|$|The runway is made {{of asphalt}} and has {{dimensions}} 1899 × 45 meters. It needs to be <b>enlarged</b> to 2100 <b>meters</b> at least if the airport would be used by low-cost airlines in the future. From the aerial pictures it seems that such an enlargement is possible.|$|R
5000|$|The gravity-based {{aqueduct}} {{was initially}} 3,000 meters long from the dam to the reservoir. It was later <b>enlarged</b> to 4,100 <b>meters,</b> but was eventually decommissioned, under the mayoral administration of Guillermo Vivas Valdivieso, when a new, pump-based, {{water supply system}} was inaugurated. At its highest point the aqueduct rose 50 feet high.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{church building}} had one nave and was {{made out of}} Tournai limestone. In {{the latter half of}} the 13th century, the nave was <b>enlarged</b> by 6 <b>meters</b> and at the west side of the church a new front arose. A Gothic style choir was added around 1300, using large blocks of Balegem sandstone, a brick octagonal crossing tower around 1450, and a northern transept just before the religious troubles of the 16th century.|$|R
5|$|The {{last two}} shipsQ and Rwere <b>enlarged</b> versions: 188 <b>meters</b> long at the {{waterline}} and 196 m overall. Their beams were 1 meter wider, at 18 meters. The ships' draft was lower at 5.4 meters. The ships {{were designed to}} displace 9,300 tons, and displaced 8,568 tons standard. All six ships were to have steel-made, and up to 85% welded construction. The design called for fifteen watertight compartments and a double bottom for 78% {{of the length of}} the hull.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the avenue, four towers and one groundscraper named after {{precious}} or semi-precious stones (Onyx, Beryl, Jade, Ruby) have been erected around a private garden built on the roof of the Italie 2 shopping mall (itself formerly known as Galaxie). An esplanade was supposed to cover the Avenue d'Italie, something which has finally been abandoned. It is one of the rare spots where the Avenue d'Italie has been <b>enlarged</b> to 70 <b>meters,</b> as planned by the Italie 13 project.|$|R

2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{completed}} [...] (13%) over the designed displacement, {{resulting in an}} extra foot of draft {{and a loss of}} [...] in designed speed. The use of new technologies and unproven designs led to a number of issues which only became apparent once Yūbari was commissioned. The smoke stack was found to draw poorly, and was <b>enlarged</b> by 1.80 <b>meters</b> in 1924. Additional ballast was also added to increase stability. In 1932, the 80mm anti-aircraft gun was removed and in 1935, two twin Type 93 [...] guns were fitted. These were replaced by two twin 25mm guns in 1940.|$|R
50|$|The Lake Placid Club {{built the}} first ski jump on this site in 1920, using the {{hillside}} itself as the jump surface. The jump {{was referred to as}} the Intervales 35-meter jump. On February 21. 1921, the first competition was held at this site, drawing 3,000 spectators. The record jump for the day was 124 feet, set by Antony Maurer. In 1923, the jump was <b>enlarged</b> to fifty <b>meters,</b> and in 1927, a new steel tower was built, raising the jump to 60 meters. In 1928, the tower was raised to 75 meters; this was the tower used for the 1932 Winter Olympic Games. In 1977, the old tower was demolished to make way for new 70 and 90-meter jumps, used for the 1980 Winter Olympic Games. In 1994, the landing hills were re-graded to bring the jumps into compliance with current rules, and increasing their height to 90 and 120 meters.|$|R
5000|$|Built between 1131 and 1138 {{to replace}} a {{previous}} Byzantine church, and shortly thereafter <b>enlarged</b> by several <b>meters,</b> the church {{is an excellent example}} of Romanesque architecture. The three-aisled basilica incorporates cross-vaulted ceilings and pillars, clear clean lines and a somewhat unadorned interior. The nave is separated from the lower lateral aisles by arcades of arches. The high altar, designed by the French sculptor Philippe Kaeppelin incorporates many different scenes. On the front of the altar are depicted the Nativity (left), the Descent from the Cross (center) and the Annunciation (right); on the left-hand end is the teaching of Mary by her mother, on the right-hand end her presentation in the Temple. [...] In the south aisle is a flight of steps leading down to the crypt, in a grotto believed by the Crusaders to be Mary's birthplace. An altar dedicated to Mary is located there. The Byzantine basilica was partly stretched over two water basins, collectively known as the Pools of Bethesda, and built upon a series of piers, one of which still stands today in its entirety.|$|R
5000|$|After {{independence}} on July 5, 1975, {{the port}} became owned by ENAPOR [...] Until 1986, the port was a rectangular shape and its length was east-west, it underwent expansion {{and went to}} the latitude of the nearby islet and its length became north to south, the point was <b>enlarged</b> by 600 <b>meters.</b> In 2002, Avenida Combatentes da Liberdade da Patria went under construction and finished in 2003, it was the extension of what was Rua do Porto and encircles the west of the harbor, two rotaries exists in the northern part, before there was never a road in the area between the plateau and the river.Three recent shipwrecks occurred {{at the front of the}} mouth of Ribeira da Trindade, first in around the 1990s, then a second one in around 2004 and a third one in 2005, a French fishing boat sunk very close to the on the boundary with Achada Grande to the east, the weather and sea conditions made the boat rusty and in 2014, its remains disappeared. The right one disappeared in 2009 and the left one disappeared in 2010 and only a tiny remain is left.|$|R
40|$|Pianosa Island {{belongs to}} the Tuscany Archipelago; it has an {{extension}} of 10 km 2, 18 km of coastal development and a max altitude of 29 m a. s. l. The island {{is made up of}} neogenic and quaternary sediments; pelitic Miocene sediments outcrops {{at the base of the}} cliff in the south-western coast, while the bio-calcarenitic Pliocene sediments cover most part of the island. Quaternary deposits are established by biodetrital shore sediments of Tyrrhenian age and by Late Pleistocene colluvial deposits. The island is characterized by cliffs in the western and southern sector, by plain surfaces and by a small beach in the east side. Cliffs have been distinguished in 3 different types. In the first type is always present a developing wave notch. When the coast is not characterized by cliff we can found erosion plains (at maximum level of approximately 4 m) formed during the Tyrrhenian high stand (Isotopic stage 5 e). These erosion planes can be suspended and sub-horizontal (when the layers of the pliocenic substrate dip towards inland), or gently tilted towards sea (when the layers of the pliocenic substrate dip towards sea). On these various erosion planes are always present rock pools characterized by different shape and dimension, besides rare fossiliferous shore deposits (Panchina). In these sediments have been recognized, between others: Strombus bubonius, Patella ferruginea and Conus testudinarius, dating Tyrrhenian age. On the island we can found three different order of erosion planes at 2 - 4 m, 8 m and 25 m a. s. l. Karst process produced erosion epigean micro-landforms, such us dissolutional flutes, dissolutional groves and dissolutional pans (kamenitza), macro-landforms represented by E-W karst oval basin depressions, <b>enlarged</b> hundred <b>meters</b> and few meters deep. The same process left isolated rock promontory residual of the tyrrhenian cliffs coast lines. Much diffused are hypogean karst shape such as caves and conduits that, sometimes, are opened on the cliff and are visible only by the sea. In some of these caves, characterized by speleothemes, we discovered, at a quote of 7 m a. s. l., marine deposits and litodomes holes probably of Tyrrhenian age. Frequently is the founding of breccias breeded by collapse of caves and conduits. Surface karst landforms are widening covered by high agricoltural activity developed in the last two centuries due to the presence of the agricoltural penal colony...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to carry out an investigastion into {{suitable}} alternatives to gasoline for use in modern automobiles. The fuel would provide the western world with a means of extending the natural gasoline resources and the third world a way of cutting down their dependence on the oil producing countries for their energy supply. Alcohols, namely methanol and ethanol, provide this solution. They {{can be used as}} gasoline extenders or as fuels on their own. In order to fulfil the aims of the project a literature study was carried out to investigate methods and costs of producing these fuels. An experimental programme was then set up in which the performance of the alcohols was studied on a conventional engine. The engine used for this purpose was the Fiat 127 930 cc four cylinder engine. This engine was used because of its popularity in the European countries. The Weber fixed jet carburettor, since it was designed to be used with gasoline, was adapted so that the alcohol fuels and the blends could be used in the most efficient way. This was mainly to take account of the lower heat content of the alcohols. The adaptation of the carburettor was in the form of <b>enlarging</b> the main <b>metering</b> jet. Allowances for the alcohol's lower specfic gravity were made during fuel metering. Owing to the low front end volatility of methanol and ethanol, it was expected that `start up' problems would occur. An experimental programme was set up to determine the temperature range for a minimum required percentage `take off' that would ease start-up since it was determined that a `take off' of about 5 % v/v liquid in the vapour phase would be sufficient for starting. Additions such as iso-pentane and n-pentane were used to improve the front end volatility. This proved to be successful. The lower heat content of the alcohol fuels also meant that a greater charge of fuel would be required. This was seen to pose further problems with fuel distribution from the carburettor to the individual cylinders on a multicylinder engine. Since {{it was not possible to}} modify the existing manifold on the Fiat 127 engine, experimental tests on manifold geometry were carried out using the Ricardo E 6 single cylinder variable compression engine. Results from these tests showed that the length, shape and cross-sectional area of the manifold play an important part in the distribution of the fuel entering the cylinder, ie. vapour phase, vapour/small liquid droplet/liquid film phase, vapour/large liquid droplet/liquid film phase etc. The solvent properties of the alcohols and their greater electrical conductivity suggested that the materials used on the engine would be prone to chemical attack. In order to determine the type and rate of chemical attack, an experimental programme was set up whereby carburettor and other components were immersed in the alcohols and in blends of alcohol with gasoline. The test fuels were aerated and in some instances kept at temperatures ranging from 50 oC to 90 oC. Results from these tests suggest that not all materials used in the conventional engine are equally suitable for use with alcohols and alcohol/gasoline blends. Aluminium for instance was severely attacked by methanol causing pitting and pin-holing in the surface. In general this whole experimental programme gave valuable information on the acceptability of substitute fuels. While the long term effects of alcohol use merit further study, it is clear that methanol and ethanol will be increasingly used in place of gasoline...|$|R
