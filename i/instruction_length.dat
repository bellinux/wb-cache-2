25|$|In {{literature}} {{several factors}} are named for explaining why language competence is decreasing. Many researchers, however, regard {{the level of}} competence of the learner as essential for attrition. It is said that the higher the level of competence, the less attrition will occur. Thus, {{a reference to the}} theory of the critical threshold can be drawn. Similar to this theory it is claimed, that according to conducted studies, the higher the level of competence of the learner {{at the end of the}} incubation period, the fewer will be lost. Therefore duration, success and intensity of the language instruction or language input in general is vitally important. Weltens (1987) divides the factors influencing language attrition into three categories: characteristics of the acquisition process (method of <b>instruction,</b> <b>length</b> of exposure, proficiency before attrition, relationship between L1 and the FL), characteristics of the attrition period ('post exposure' and length of the attrition period), and learner characteristics. The second category are sociopsychological factors, as the attitude towards the target language and culture and aligned with the motivation for acquiring the language. Further, factors, which are settled in the language environment, should be considered as well, e.g. the status and prestige of the language are meaningful, too. Another frequent occurring factor is age. A variable that seems to be quite important, especially observing language attrition in children. Even though children are regarded as the better foreign language learner, their cognitive development is less progressed compared to adults. Further, usually they haven't learned to write or read in any language, and usually particularly not in the second language at all. Therefore their literacy skill in the L2 is very limited if not even there yet. Cohen (1989) conducted a study observing young children. He found out, that the attrition in an 8-year-old boy was stronger than the one in his 12-year-old sister. Tomiyama, suggested on the basis of her findings, that these children might not lose their knowledge of the L2 completely, moreover the access to such information is inaccessible and may vanish with time passing by. At the beginning of the 80s another, so far unnoticed factor, was introduced into the research field. Socioaffective factors as attitude, orientation and motivation are now accounted. On account of that, he established a socio-educational model of language acquisition. Thereby motivation and attitude influence the workload of the individual to keep their language competence. Further, individuals, who have positive attitudes towards the target language, seek possibilities and opportunities during the incubation period to retain their language competence (Gardner 1987: 521). However, the factor motivation is hardly considered examining language attrition. Especially during the last 10–15 years it became more and more acknowledged in the field of language acquisition rather than attrition. Only Gardner considered motivation as a possible factor influencing attrition. Even until today it is hardly recognised as an influencing factor and therefore exist only a few studies about motivation and its effects.|$|E

50|$|A modern RISC {{processor}} {{can therefore}} be much more complex than, say, a modern microcontroller using a CISC-labeled instruction set, {{especially in terms of}} electronic circuit complexity, but also {{in terms of the number}} of instructions or the complexity of their encoding patterns.

The initial 256 {{bytes of memory}} ($0000 - $00FF; a.k.a., page [...] "0") could be accessed using a one-byte absolute or indexed memory address. This reduced instruction execution time by one clock cycle and <b>instruction</b> <b>length</b> by one byte. By storing often-used data in this region, programs could be made smaller and faster.|$|E
5000|$|Opcodes {{were one}} character. Memory {{addresses}} ("I" [...] a branch target, [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] data) and unit address were three characters.

5000|$|Similar {{techniques}} can of course be used where multiple instructions are involved, {{as long as}} the combined <b>instruction</b> <b>length</b> is adjusted accordingly.

50|$|In {{vertical}} microcode, each microinstruction {{is significantly}} encoded that is, the bit fields generally pass through intermediate combinatory logic that, in turn, generates the actual control and sequencing signals for internal CPU elements (ALU, registers, etc.).

Consequently, vertical microcode requires smaller <b>instruction</b> <b>lengths</b> and less storage, but requires more time to decode, resulting in a slower CPU clock.|$|R
