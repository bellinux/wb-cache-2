40|$|As the chromatographic {{behavior}} of the fatty acid esters of green leaf xanthophylls was different to that of free xanthophylls, the fractionation and the isolation of these xanthophylls were carried out with application of this properties by silicagel column chromatogray, followed by determination of hydoroxyl groups in these xanthophylls using the quantitative analysis of fatty acid to be bound in GLC method. By these chromatographic method six fractions of green leaf xanthophylls were able to be obtained as esters in which at least two were considered to isolate. When the hydroxyl gloups of these fractions were subsequently estimated by absolutely quantitative determination of fatty acid with GLC, only one xanthophyll had four hydroxyl groups and others two. These conclusions partially agreed {{with the results of}} <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>numbers</b> of the known xanthophylls, that is, VI- 1 fraction which was considered to correspond to the lutein with one hydroxyl group had two hydroxyl groups, while VII- 3 corresponded to auroxanthin with two hydroxyl groups had the same number of the groups. It was deduced that the difference between the estimated and the known <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>numbers</b> probably accounts for both the oxidation of the carotenoids during the chromatographic procedure and the subsequent production of epoxide groups. Therefore, the usefulness of these methods for fractionation of green leaf xanthophylls and for decision of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>numbers</b> is now not able to be judged.

Obviously, glycerol provides the most hydroxyl radicals leading to the best promotion effect. Methanol molecule, which has only one hydroxyl, could not contribute enough hydroxyl radicals to promote the degradation. However, the difference of the adsorption constants could not influence their promotion effect. Although the adsorption of methanol is the highest, its promotion effect is not the best.

The melamine resin is a minor constituent and plays the role of a crosslinking agent. In this paper, alkyd resins of high <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>numbers</b> based on trimethylolpropane, ricinoleic acid and phthalic anhydride were synthesized. Two alkyds having 30 and 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid were formulated by calculation on alkyd constant. Alkyds were characterized by FTIR and by the determination of acid and <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>numbers.</b> Then synthesized alkyds were made into baking enamels by mixing with melamine-formaldehyde resins (weight ratio of 70 : 30 based on dried mass). Two types of commercial melamine resins were used: threeisobutoxymethyl melamine-formaldehyde resin (TIMMF) and hexamethoxymethyl melamine resin (HMMMF). Prepared alkyd/melamine resin mixtures were cured in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under non-isothermal mode. Apparent degree of curing as a function of temperature was calculated from the curing enthalpies. Kinetic parameters of curing were calculated using Freeman-Carroll method. TIMMF resin is more reactive with synthesized alkyds than HMMMF resin what was expected. Alkyd resin with 30 wt% of ricinoleic acid is slightly more reactive than alkyd with 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid, probably because it has the high contents of free hydroxyl and acid groups. The gel content, Tg, thermal stability, hardness, elasticity and impact resistance of coated films cured at 150 °C for 60 min were measured. Cured films show good thermal stability since the onset of films thermal degradation determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is observed at the temperatures from 281 to 329 °C. Films based on alkyd 30 are more thermal stable than those from alkyd 40, with the same melamine resin. The type of alkyd resin has no significant effect on the gel content and the hardness of film. Hardness of cured film increases with increasing of Tg. The values of the films elasticity are satisfied for all prepared samples and are independent on the type of alkyd or melamine resin. The impact resistances of coated films are very high...|$|R

The aim of the experiments is designed to improve the properties of PCL by formation of their polymers with 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -propandiol monomers with various chain length as a raw material to prepare poly(urethane-ester). These polymers were synthesized by a ring-opening polymerization of 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -propandiol and e-caprolactone monomers in various composition in the presence of 1 -hydroxy- 3 -chloro-tetraisobuthyldistanoxane as a catalyst.

Hardwood bleached ha f t pulp fibers were recycled, swollen, and subsequently analyzed for water retention value (WRV), dy-namic contact angle, and <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>number.</b> Results show that the relative swelling powers of the liquids were: 12 % NaOH> formamide> dimethyl sulfoxide = 2 % NaOH = ethylene glycol. These liquids resulted in WRVs that were 23 - 72 % higher than the control, i. e. the water-swollen recycled fibers (WRV 1. lo). Swelling increased the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>number</b> of the fibers except for those treated with 12 % NaOH. Fibers that were swollen to a greater extent had a higher total surface-free energy and a lower water contact angle. By swelling the fibers in organic liquids, polar surface-free energy increased with an increase in hydroxyl numbers. Such a relationship was obscured for the alkaline treatments, which presumably altered the chemical composition of the fibers. These findings promote understand-ing for a more effective formulation of treatment methods for recycled fibers.

40|$|ABSTRACT Polyurethanes (PUs) {{have been}} widely used in coatings, adhesives, sealants, and foams. Historically, the raw {{materials}} of a PU, polyol and isocyanate, were derived from petroleum. Nowadays, the increasing concerns regarding the depletion of petroleum resources and environmental problems caused by fossil fuels, has triggered great interest in the development of monomers based on renewable resources for PU production. In this project, a novel solvent-free/catalyst-free method was developed to prepare polyols from epoxidized soybean oil and castor oil for PU production. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, and reaction ratios of carboxyl acid and epoxy groups on the properties of the resulting polyols were investigated. Moreover, the properties of final PUs were compared with that from castor oil and methoxylated soybean oil polyol. To validate the versatility of this approach, this method was extended to other vegetable oils systems. Polyols with a broad functionality were prepared by castor oil fatty acid initiating ring opening reaction of various epoxidized vegetable oils, which were prepared with formic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The effect of the polyols 2 ̆ 7 structure on the thermal, mechanical, and shape memory properties of the resulting PU was studied. Possible catalysts (DBU, Pyridine) were found that could promote the ring opening reaction in this method by decreasing the reaction temperature and reaction time. The ring opening reaction kinetic for the vegetable oil systems was investigated by dynamic differential scanning calorimetry. The effect of DBU on the structure of polyols was studied as well as the properties of PU. The polyols prepared by this novel method were used to prepare PU foam for potential application in automobile seat cushions. The compatibility between this vegetable oil-based polyol and a petroleum-based polyol was investigated by solution tests and theoretical prediction. The effect of bio-component on the physical, mechanical, thermal stability, and thermal conductivity of resulting PU was investigated. Also, two approaches were proposed to modify lignin to compatibilize them with PU matrix for preparation of PU nanocomposites. The effects of this cheap and abundant renewable filler on the thermo-mechanical and dielectric properties of the final PU composites were studied. In order to increase the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>numbers</b> of vegetable oil-based polyols, another method was developed for high performance PUs. A strong reductant, LiAlH 4, was used to reduce the ether and epoxy groups in epoxidized vegetable oils to prepare high functionality bio-polyols. The properties of the final PU based on those novel polyols were characterized and compared with that from a petroleum-based polyol. Finally, carbon nanotubes were incorporated into the PU matrix to improve the thermo-mechanical properties of nanocomposites. The surface of carbon nanotube was functionalized with an amine group, which formed a covalent bond with the PUs. The loading effect of carbon nanotube on the properties of the resulting PU was investigated...|$|R

Examination of the cell geometry revealed different cell shapes. The form factor as an indicator of cell deviation from spherical shape increased (more round forms were observed) with increasing amount of Voranol CP 1055. The TG examination showed that specimens with 6 and 8 g of Voranol 3322 substituted by Voranol CP 1055 completely degraded at 350 °C, while foams with 10 and 12 g of Voranol 3322 substituted by Voranol CP 1055 displayed lower mass loss at higher temperatures and had residual masses of 46 % and 43 % at 600 °C respectively. The addition of antipyrene in an amount of 1 % (based on the amount of polyol) contributed to improved thermal stability, no visible color change of the specimen tested at 210 °C for 40 minutes, and to rounder cell forms.

40|$|Glycosidases are {{involved}} in a range of important biological processes. The possibility of blocking or modifying these processes using glycosidase-inhibiting sugar mimics for therapeutic or biotechnological applications has attracted much interest. This may have significance in the treatment of cancer, viral infections, diabetes and obesity. Iminosugars are analogues of mono- or disaccharides where the ring oxygen is replaced by a nitrogen atom. These compounds include polyhydroxylated derivatives of monocyclic structures such as piperidines and pyrrolizidines, and also of bicyclic structures such as indolizidines and pyrrolizidines. Routes to nitrone 190 from L-xylose and D-arabinose were explored and the application of nitrone 190 towards the synthesis to hyacinthacine A 1 and hyacinthacine B 2 were investigated. The differential protection of the C- 3 position of nitrone 190 meant that this position would be selectively deprotected after cycloaddition, liberating the C- 1 <b>hydroxyl</b> group (hyacinthacine <b>numbering)</b> as a site for inversion. Inversion of the hydroxyl group would then provide the required stereochemical outcome for hyacinthacines A 1 and B 2, where the stereochemistry at C- 1 and C- 2 is ci...|$|R
40|$|New polyols were {{synthesized}} with 2 -hydroxypropane- 1. 2. 3 -tricarboxylic {{acid and}} butane- 1, 4 -diol (1. 4 -BD). The synthesis was performed using different catalysts {{in the amount}} of 0. 1 %. Used catalyst: Tyzor TPT, tin(II) acetate, sulfuric(IV) acid. The fourth reaction was conducted without the use of a catalyst. The polyols’ properties were evaluated with regards to the usefulness in rigid polyurethane-polyisocyanurate (PUR-PIR) foams (acid value, density, pH and solubility, FTIR spectra). Based on the research, it was evaluated that only the polyol synthesized using Tyzor TPT (E 6) was useful in production of rigid PUR-PIR foams. Its <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>number</b> was 496 mgKOH/g and its viscosity was about 14 552 mPa · s. A series of five foams P 6. 1 –P 6. 5 was produced with this polyol. Rigid foams test results indicated that the amount of this compound in the foam substantially affects its compressive strength, density and their retention. The foams have low brittleness values...|$|E
40|$|Bagasse was {{subjected}} to a liquefaction process with polyethylene glycol/glycerol using sulfuric acid as catalyst. The effects of various liquefaction conditions, such as reaction time, liquefaction temperature, catalyst content, and liquid ratio (liquefaction solvents/bagasse), on the liquefied residue (LR) content and hydroxyl and acid numbers of liquefied products were investigated. The preferred liquefaction condition of bagasse was determined through orthogonal experiments. The {{results showed that the}} catalyst content and reaction time have a greater influence than liquid ratio and liquefaction temperature on the percentage of LR. The hydroxyl and acid numbers of the liquefied products were influenced by many factors, including liquefaction temperature, reaction time, acid content, and liquid ratio. The <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>number</b> of liquefied products decreased as the liquefaction reaction progressed, but the acid number of liquefied products increased. Based on the obtained data, the kinetics for liquefaction was modeled using the first-order reaction rate law and the apparent activation energy for the liquefaction of bagasse was estimated to be 38. 30 kJ mol(- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Gd@C 82 (OH) 40 {{has been}} {{proposed}} to be as {{a new generation of}} the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, but water-soluble fullerenols Gd@C 82 (OH) n with n > 36 can easily lead to open-caged structures of a high instability. This restricts the practical bio-uses of Gd-metallofullerenols with a large number of hydroxyl groups. To explore how the imaging efficiency varies with decreasing <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>number</b> in Gd@C 82 (OH) n of a good stability in vivo, Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 was prepared, characterized and its imaging efficiency in mice was studied. This work aims at searching a chemical form of water-soluble Gd-metallofullerenols that satisfy both requirements of the good stability and high imaging efficiency in vivo. The results indicate that the proton relaxivity of Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 is lower than that of Gd@C 82 (OH) 40, but still higher than the commercial Gd-DTPA MRI contrast agent. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|We have {{performed}} constant energy and constant temperature equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of model liquids of water, methanol, and ethanol, {{and of the}} binary aqueous mixtures of the alcohols at mole fractions alcohol of 0. 25, 0. 50, and 0. 75 at room temperature. The total number of molecules is 256 and the integration timestep is 0. 5 fs. The molecules are modelled with rigid, nonpolarizable effective site potentials. The TIP 4 P model is applied for water, and the OPLS models {{for methanol and ethanol}} (trans). The thermostatically controlled simulations are performed within the Nose-Hoover formalism, with separate temperature control of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Reservoir coupling in the mixtures is determined as a weighted average of the liquid values. We present enthalpies of vaporization and excess configurational energies for the mixtures. Further, we show all radial site-site correlation functions for the self- and cross-interactions. We also present results for self-diffusion coefficients for the components, and the velocity auto correlations functions. The NVT simulations are investigated with respect to the possibility of reproducing the canonical ensemble. We find that the simulations are not entirely within the premises of the canonical ensemble. We suggest that this is due to a too weak coupling (too large heat bath mass). The results are nevertheless found to be in good agreement with experiments and published simulational studies. The NVE simulations for the mixtures reproduce the desired temperature well. The energy conservation is good and improves with decreasing water content. Effects of using only trans-ethanol might be seen for the self-diffusion coefficients. Structural results for both the model alcohols are found to be consistent with V-chains. Upon addition of water, methyl-methyl coordination numbers for both alcohols decrease less than the <b>hydroxyl</b> coordination <b>numbers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} structure on photocatalytic oxidation was evaluated {{by comparing the}} performance of butanedioic acid, propanol and their hydroxylated derivates in an aqueous TiO 2 suspension. The influence of Pt deposits had on the photooxidation of these compounds was also studied. The photoactivity was found {{to depend on the}} nature of the parent substance and its level of hydroxylation. The presence of additional hydroxyl functional groups on butanedioic acid accelerated the diacid disappearance rate but decreased the overall mineralisation rate. Accelerated diacid disappearance was attributed to increased parent organic adsorption via enhanced bonding between the extra OH groups and the TiO 2 surface. The slower mineralisation rates were ascribed to the additional hydroxyl groups altering or enhancing intermediate formation to produce more recalcitrant intermediates (e. g. ethanoic acid). In contrast, no consistent relationship was found between the additional <b>hydroxyl</b> group <b>number</b> and mineralisation rate for the alcohols. Hydroxyl addition to propanol was proposed to not significantly alter its adsorption mode on TiO 2 leading to similar disappearance rates for the alcohols. Differences in mineralisation rates were observed and thought to be dominated by differences in degradation rates of the generated intermediates. Pt/TiO 2 displayed a higher photoactivity than bare TiO 2 for both organic groups. Similar intermediates were formed irrespective of the Pt presence with its function as an electron sink primarily responsible for the enhancement. The Pt deposits also displayed a thermal (dark) catalytic effect for oxidising formic acid. Its dark catalysis was augmented by pre-irradiating the Pt/TiO 2 with UV light. Pre-irradiation was suspected to enhance electron accumulation in the Pt deposits, in turn facilitating oxygen dissociation which then enhanced formic acid oxidation. The pre- irradiation effect decayed with time but could be readily recovered by re- irradiating the Pt/TiO 2. This dark catalytic effect may further contribute to the overall Pt/TiO 2 photoactivity as formic acid is a commonly generated intermediate from photocatalysis...|$|R
30|$|In these conditions, {{catalytic}} ozonation {{has been}} attracting increasing attention {{as a result}} of its higher efficiency in the degradation and mineralization of organic pollutants and lower negative effect on the nature of water [8, 9]. Supported, unsupported metals and metal oxides are the most commonly used catalysts for the ozonation of organic pollutants in water. Among various semiconductors, titanium dioxide has been recurrently reported as active, inexpensive and nontoxic. It can accelerate the ozonation process for degradation of a wide range of different pollutants [10, 11]. The most common applications of titania are in photocatalysis systems; however, it has been proposed as an active catalyst in catalytic ozonation of organic pollutants. TiO 2 -catalyzed ozonation was more effective for the removal of some pollutant than ozone alone. The detailed and complete mechanism of catalytic ozonation is not clear up to this time and many studies have been done so far, but it is not completely obvious and is one of the gaps of catalytic ozonation. The effect of TiO 2 on ozone decomposition to produce hydroxyl radicals was not obvious. Some researchers proposed mechanisms based on non-radical pathway to form <b>hydroxyl</b> radical. A <b>number</b> of mechanisms are offered, but the direct formation of hydroxyl radicals from ozone decomposition on the surface of TiO 2 or indirect formation {{as a result of}} secondary reactions is still unknown [12]. Rosal et al. [13, 14] were investigated the degradation of clofibric acid by catalytic ozonation on titania. It was proposed that the adsorption and the following reaction of pollutants on catalyst sites are responsible for the improvement of catalytic ozonation.|$|R
