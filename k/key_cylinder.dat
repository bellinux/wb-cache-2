5000|$|The K-tool {{is a tool}} used by many fire {{departments}} for forcible entry. [...] It is {{used in conjunction with}} a Halligan bar and a flat-headed axe or maul (commonly referred to as [...] "irons" [...] or (with a maul instead of an axe) [...] "strong irons") to remove a cylinder lock. It consists of a steel block roughly 3 inches by 3 inches by 1 inch thick with a K-shaped notch on one side, having sharp edges that grip the cylinder, and a U-shaped flange on the other side. The notch is slipped over the lock cylinder, then forced down by striking with the flat side of the axe or maul. The halligan is then inserted into the flange and used to pry the K-tool off the door, thereby pulling the entire <b>key</b> <b>cylinder</b> out. The bolt is then retracted from the inside of the cylinder hole using a turning tool, such as a screwdriver.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{development}} of compressed air powered engine {{system based on}} Subaru EA 71 model. The objective of this thesis {{is to make a}} reverse engineering and design of the engine model, and make the computational analysis of the compressed air powered engine working model by using GT-Power. The thesis describes the compressed air technology that addresses the problems of exhaust gas pollution from vehicles, as well as utilization of fossil fuel. The development of the compressed air powered engine model starts with dismantling the original engine, cleaning the engine with petrol, and drawing all the components into Solidworks. Then develop the engine into two working stages that working with gasoline for four cylinders in the first stage and working with compressed air for two cylinders in the second stage. In this thesis, the research focuses on the second stage. Some components such as cylinder heads and cam profile are modified based on the new design. After this, a simulation by GT-Power is run, and computational analysis the performance of new compressed air powered engine. The results indicated the engine performance predictions and <b>key</b> <b>cylinder</b> predictions. The project achieves the objective of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. However the new model lacks the power output so that continuous research is needed to fully prove the viability of the technology of the compressed air powered engin...|$|E

Since PLC’s are used primarily in discrete and batch manufacturing, they have been ignored traditionally in the academic circles of automatic process control, the latter focusing primarily on large-scale, continuous processing.

Yet the typical process control course today still reflects continuous processing and PLC’s are largely ignored. This situation calls for change. At the University of Colorado, we have introduced a module in our control course (Instrumentation & Process Control, CHEN 4570, 4 credit hours including a full laboratory component) that allows students to learn the fundamentals of digital logic, logic diagrams and ladder logic programming of PLC’s, and applications to chemical processing.

5000|$|Division 10 — Specialties Lockers: Division 10 — Specialties is a {{category}} within the National Master Specification (NMS) {{set of guidelines}} developed by Public Works and Government Services Canada. Division 10 — Specialties items that could be required within a locker room (to meet commercial building and construction regulations) are lockers, washroom accessories, toilet compartments, and toilet partitions. Lockers are constructed of two sides: a back, top and a bottom. Different types of materials are used in locker manufacturing, offering {{a wide variety of}} metal lockers, stainless steel lockers, solid plastic lockers, solid phenolic lockers, and custom lockers. A padlock is the most common way to lock a locker; however, you can also use a <b>keyed</b> <b>cylinder</b> lock, built in combination locks or keypad locks. There are a lot of optional extras that can be utilized for lockers, for example: bases, sloping tops, end panels, customized shelves and hooks as well as the locking method (coin-operated lockers are another option). The environment {{is the best way to}} distinguish what type of locker will be required for which type of space. For example, if you are putting gym lockers into a humid area, or anywhere close to showers, stainless steel or solid plastic lockers would be most suitable because they are moisture-resistant and rust-resistant. Wood lockers would not be appropriate for this type of environment because the moisture from the humidity would rot the wood.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Thermal {{stress in}} {{castings}} results from nonuniform cooling. The thermal stress and the deforma-tion {{can change the}} casting and mold contact conditions which then alter the heat transfer between the cast-ing and the mold. The contact element method was used to study the interaction between a sand mold and a casting. The contact status was then fed back to the heat transfer analysis between the sand mold and the casting to re-evaluate the heat transfer coefficient based on the gap size or pressure between surfaces. The thermal and mechanical phenomena are then coupled in two directions. The method was applied to analyze stress in a stress frame specimen casting and a cylinder block. The results are more accurate than without consideration of the contact effects on the heat transfer. <b>Key</b> words: <b>cylinder</b> block; casting/mold (core) interaction; thermal stress; contact element metho...|$|R

40|$|<b>Key</b> words: <b>cylinder</b> liner; {{piston ring}}; additives; {{tribological}} behavior Abstract: With a piston ring reciprocating liner test rig, the tribological behavior at {{top dead center}} of diesel engine was evaluated between hydrorefined mineral oil (HMO) and two kinds of cylinder liner/piston ring, chromium-plated+honing/physical vapor deposition (CP/PVD) and boron-phosphrous alloy cast iron+honing/physical vapor deposition (CI/PVD). Friction coefficient vs. temperature at different loads was used to discriminate the principal function of tribofilm. The analysis shows that the interface between CP/PVD and HMO was subject to thin film lubrication with stearic acid at 70 - 150 ℃. When the temperature exceeds 150 ℃, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP) began to change the friction status of interface. However, the steady boundary lubrication of CI/PVD exists from 50 — 250 ℃ at different loads and can not distinguish the scope of additives effects.
