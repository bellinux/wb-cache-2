40|$|Three test {{sites in}} the western US were {{selected}} to discriminate among surface geologic materials {{on the basis of}} their thermal properties as determined from HCMM data. Attempts to determine quantitatively accurate thermal inertia values from HCMM digital data met with only partial success due to the effects of sensor miscalibrations, radiative transfer in the atmosphere, and varying meteorology and elevation across a scene. In most instances, apparent thermal inertia was found to be an excellent qualitative representation of true thermal inertia. Computer processing of <b>digital</b> <b>day</b> and night HCMM data allowed construction of geologically useful images. At some test sites, more information was provided by data than LANDSAT data. Soil moisture effects and differences in spectrally dark materials were more effectively displayed using the thermal data...|$|E
40|$|In film production, it is {{sometimes}} not convenient or directly impossible to shoot some night scenes at night. The film budget, schedule or location may not allow it. In these cases, the scenes are shot at daytime, and the ’night look ’ is achieved by placing a blue filter {{in front of the}} lens and under-exposing the film. This technique, that the American film industry has used for many decades, is called ’Day for Night ’ (or ’American Night ’ in Europe.) But the images thus obtained don’t usually look realistic: they tend to be too bluish, and the objects ’ brightness seems unnatural for night-light. In this article we introduce a <b>digital</b> <b>Day</b> for Night algorithm that achieves very realistic results. We use a set of very simple equations, based on real physical data and visual perception experimental data. To simulate the loss of visual acuity we introduce a novel diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) which takes luminance into account and respects contrast, produces no ringing, is stable, very easy to implement and fast. The user only provides the original day image and the desired level of darkness of the result. The whole process from original day image to final night image is implemented in a few seconds, computations being mostly local.

5000|$|Closing credits {{are usually}} {{shown on the}} screen in small characters, which either flip very quickly from page to page, or scroll from bottom to top of the screen. Credits which scroll either left-to-right or up-and-down are also known as staff rolls, which comes from pre <b>digital</b> <b>days</b> when the names were {{literally}} on a roll of paper and would pass {{in front of the}} camera. Standard film credits move from bottom to top, and are often called [...] "credit crawls." [...] Industry traditions, guild rules, and union rules generally dictate the order and placement of specific names and job titles. Increasingly, post-credits scenes are being added to the end of films. Still, short or full logos appear at the end of films (with the exception of Universal Pictures).|$|R

40|$|In lm production, it is {{sometimes}} not convenient or directly impossible to shoot some night scenes at night. The lm budget, schedule or location may not allow it. In these cases, the scenes are shot at daytime, and the 'night look ' is achieved by placing a blue lter {{in front of the}} lens and under-exposing the lm. This tech-nique, that the American lm industry has used for many decades, is called 'Day for Night ' (or 'American Night' in Europe.) But the images thus obtained don't usually look realistic: they tend to be too bluish, and the ob-jects ' brightness seems unnatural for night-light. These problems stem from the fact that this Day for Night pro-cess is exclusively optical (lters, lm exposure), and hence it can't provide the modications that account for how we see the world at night: different spectrum for the night illuminant, desaturation of colors, brightness modication according to wavelength, contrast modi-cation according to luminance adaptation levels, and non-uniform and non-linear loss of resolution. In this article we introduce a <b>digital</b> <b>Day</b> for Night algorithm that achieves very realistic results. We use a set of very simple equations, based on real physical data and visual perception experimental data. To simulate the loss of visual acuity we introduce a novel diffusion Partial Dif-ferential Equation (PDE) which takes both luminance and contrast into account, produces no ringing, is stable, very easy to implement and fast.
