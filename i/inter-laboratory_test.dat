This method has been improved substantially during the EU funded QUIESST collaborative project. Within the same framework, an <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>test</b> {{has been carried}} out to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the newly developed method when applied to real-life samples, including the effect of outdoor weather variability and sample ageing. This article presents the statistical analysis of the <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>test</b> results, and the values of the repeatability and the reproducibility, both in one-third octave bands and for the single-number ratings. The estimated reproducibility values can be used as the extended measure of uncertainty at the 95 % credibility level in compliance with the ISO GUM.

40|$|This report {{describes}} in detail an <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>test</b> {{to detect the}} irradiation of spices, herbs and spice-and-herb mixtures in the dose range used for reduction {{of the number of}} contaminating microorganisms. Approx. 3 months and 9 months after irradiation the 14 participating laboratories determined the thermoluminescence (TL) of mineral contaminations that were isolated from coded samples. 18 different products (six spices, six herbs and six spice-and-herb mixtures) were examined. By whole sample analysis results were obtained in the <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>test</b> which are typical for this method: Only one non-irradiated sample was classified as irradiated. By contrast, from some spice or herb products (5) all irradiated samples were correctly identified. From other products (3) some irradiated samples could not be identified as irradiated. From the rest of products (4) the majority of the irradiated samples was not identified as irradiated. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} state definitively whether the whole sample method can be recommended as a screening technique. The decision rests with the user. However, data analysis of whole sample measurements revealed that the TL intensities of non-irradiated samples were within the same order of magnitude. Thus, there is no further need for establishing product-specific threshold values. The results make it clear that irradiation of spices, herbs and spice-and-herb mixtures with commercially used doses can be clearly detected by determination of TL signals of contaminating minerals throughout the entire period in which the products are normally stored and that the methods described are suitable for routine analysis in food inspection laboratories.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the results obtained from immunomonitoring of clinical trials is a difficult task due to the variety of methods and protocols available to detect vaccine-specific T-cell responses. This heterogeneity {{as well as the}} lack of standards has led to significant scepticism towards published results. In February 2005, a working group was therefore founded {{under the aegis of the}} Association for Immunotherapy of Cancer ("CIMT") in order to compare techniques and protocols applied for the enumeration of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Here we present the results from two consecutive phases of an international <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> project referred to as the "CIMT monitoring panel". A total of 13 centers from six European countries participated in the study in which pre-tested PBMC samples, synthetic peptides and PE-conjugated HLA-tetramers were prepared centrally and distributed to participants. All were asked to determine the number of antigen-specific T-cells in each sample using tetramer staining and one functional assay. The results of the first testing round revealed that the total number of cells analyzed was the most important determinant for the sensitive detection of antigen-specific CD 8 (+) T-cells by tetramer staining. Analysis by ELISPOT was influenced by a combination of cell number and a resting phase after thawing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, the experiments were repeated in a second phase but now the participants were asked to change their protocols according to the new guidelines distilled from the results of the first phase. The recommendations improved the number of antigen-specific T-cell responses that were detected and decreased the variability between the laboratories. We conclude that a two-step approach in <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> allows the identification of distinct variables that influence the sensitivity of different T-cell assays and to formally show that a defined correction to the protocols successfully increases the sensitivity and reduces the inter-center variability.

The main result of the ILT is the determination of the repeatability and reproducibility standard deviation values typical of these measurements, {{for the first time since}} the ISO 9053 publication in 1991. Ten European laboratories took part in the ILT project; two melamine foam sheets of different thickness, taken from the same factory batch, were sent to each laboratory.

The data show that most of the laboratories have a good internal repeatability, particularly for single sample measurements. The overall reproducibility is not so good, mainly due to systematic deviations inherent in the current laboratory practice.

Administrators and Policy makers involved in Environmental and Agriculture Policies need efficient tools for monitoring the status of cultivated soil. To face these requests and provide practical solutions, a rapid and effective test of soil status identified and quantitative information about its reliability provided. In this study, the precision of the Tiulin method for soil wet aggregate stability index (WASI) was evaluated through an <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>test,</b> according to the validation procedure proposed by ISO 5725. Precision was expressed in terms of repeatability (sr) and reproducibility (sR) standard deviations with related limits (r and R). Six different soils, collected from three Italian agricultural areas, with different organic matter and clay contents, were chosen and six measurement replicates were carried out for each combination of soil and laboratory. The values of sr and sR, obtained after the detection of outliers according to the Grubbs (outliers in the means) and Cochran tests (outliers in the variances), ranged respectively from 0. 92 to 2. 93 and from 1. 42 to 12. 31. The corresponding r and R ranged from 2. 57 to 8. 22 and from 3. 98 to 34. 48. No significant correlations were found both between WASI and r or between WASI and R. On the contrary the relative standard deviation of repeatability was inversely correlated (R 2 = 0. 88, **P< 0. 01) with soil organic matter. The precision is within the range of other chemical and biological methods and can be considered satisfactory.

Here, we present results of an <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>test</b> on determination of nitrogen isotope ratios in marine and lacustrine sediments. Six different samples covering {{a wide range of}} total nitrogen content and d 15 N values were analyzed by eight different laboratories using their routine procedures. The laboratories were asked to measure three batches with three replicates for each sample to assess accuracy and variability within and among laboratories; this permits assessment of repeatability and reproducibility, which are essential in meta analysis of the increasing database on d 15 N values in marine sediments. The grand average d 15 N values for individual samples ranged from 1. 65 – 10. 90 ‰. One laboratory exhibited an average bias of - 0. 27 ‰ compared to the mean of all other laboratories. Apart from one sample, which showed an exceptionally high overall standard deviation (OSD) of 0. 51 ‰, the analytical precision (1 s) averaged 0. 24 ‰, ranging from 0. 18 – 0. 31 ‰ for individual samples. Out of the eight participating laboratories, two showed a significantly elevated within-laboratory standard deviation (WLSD) of 0. 41 ‰ and 0. 32 ‰ compared to an average WLSD of 0. 15 ‰ for the other laboratories. The WLSD was inversely correlated with the ratio of peak height to peak width, which was taken as a simple measure of peak shape. Moreover, our data also revealed an inverse correlation between total nitrogen content and measurement precision. These correlations may provide guidance for improving the measurement precision of individual laboratories.

40|$|Unconventional gas, such as shale gas, {{tight gas}} or coalbed methane {{is able to}} offer a new and {{attractive}} perspective for low-carbon fuel supply. Furthermore, they may provide possibilities for CO 2 -storage and coevally for enhanced gas recovery. This is suggested by theoretical considerations of displacing the adsorbed methane by a more strongly adsorbing gas such as CO 2. Optimizing {{the development of these}} unconventional resources, while minimizing their environmental impact, requires a more fundamental understanding of the coupled physico-chemical processes involved. In order to better understand the interaction of gas and water with coal of different maturity, a measuring plan has been developed and executed. The general observation is that CO 2 and CH 4 sorption capacity of dry coals shows a parabolic trend with rank with a minimum between 1. 1 and 1. 3 % vitrinite reflectance. The CH 4 and CO 2 sorption capacity of moist coals, in contrast, shows a linear increase with increasing maturity. The sorption capacity ratio of CO 2 and CH 4 for dry coals has an approximately constant ratio of 2 over the entire maturity range. For moist coals this ratio is higher at low maturity values and decreases to values around 2 with increasing maturity. The highest CO 2 to CH 4 sorption capacity ratios are observed at low surface coverage. Based on the literature review an extended measuring concept was developed to investigate the competitive interaction between sorbed water and gases such as CH 4 and CO 2. The determination of the required high-precision CO 2 sorption isotherms is challenging because in the temperature and pressure range of interest (T= 308 - 350 K) the density of supercritical CO 2 increases rapidly with increase pressure. To improve the reliability of the sorption measurements, an inter-laboratory comparison between different European research institutes has been conducted (Chapters 2 and 3). During the first inter-laboratory comparison the comparability between the manometric and the gravimetric sorption methods was demonstrated. In the second <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>test</b> the properties of natural coal sample and their influence on the accuracy of the measurements was investigated. The observed excess sorption maxima for coals are 1. 77 ± 0. 07, 1. 37 ± 0. 02 and 1. 41 ± 0. 02 mol kg- 1 in the order of increasing vitrinite reflectance. A decrease of the pressure at maximum excess sorption has been observed from lignite to bituminous coal to semi-anthracite. This shift varies from roughly 6. 89 ± 0. 5 MPa, 6. 68 ± 0. 4 MPa, down to 5. 89 ± 0. 6 MPa in the order of increasing vitrinite reflectance. These could be related to an increase in micropore volume. Furthermore, these chapters contain recommendations and best practice rules for CO 2 sorption isotherm measurements on coals. During the subsequent phase of the PhD project the competitive interaction between sorbed water and gases such as CH 4 or CO 2 was investigated (Chapter 4). A conceptual model was developed explaining CO 2 and CH 4 sorption on coal as a function of rank and the interaction mechanism of adsorbed water molecules. The adsorption behaviour of CH 4 and CO 2 was studied on a sequence of coal samples, covering the maturity range from 0. 5 up to 3. 3 % vitrinite reflectance. A deeper understanding of the physical processes of the competitive sorption of CH 4, CO 2 and water has been achieved. Based on the thermodynamic description of the experimental observations presented in this thesis, the conceptual molecular model has been improved, by combining experimental data and published molecular dynamic simulations. The proposed molecular concept clarifies the thermodynamic process of CH 4 and CO 2 sorption on coals, the three fundamental kerogen types and the effects of adsorbed water. The main parameters controlling ultimate gas recovery from coalbed methane (CBM) deposits are the natural cleat permeability and the total gas content. Among the three gas storage mechanisms (compressed gas in the open porosity, dissolved gas in the formation water and sorbed gas), sorption is the dominant mechanism for CBM reservoirs. Sorption behaviour changes with coal rank, but also with temperature and pressure and hence with burial history. The fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics of CH 4 sorption capacity as a function of temperature and pressure is a prerequisite for assessing methane saturation in CBM reservoirs (Chapter 6). The results of this study lead {{to the conclusion that the}} geothermal gradient is much more important than the hydrostatic pressure gradient for the CH 4 sorption capacity as a function of depth. For CBM as well as CO 2 -ECBM activities a low geothermal gradient is favourable. Furthermore, a low-rank coal deposit requires a lower pressure draw-down than high rank coal deposits to desorb an equivalent amount of methane. The study of the thermodynamics of adsorption suggests that it is more likely to observe under-saturated CBM reservoirs in high rank than in low rank coal deposits...|$|E

Additional studies investigate occupational risk at the human-animal interface. In trials where the animals were challenged with Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjobovis (Hardjobovis) and/or Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona (Pomona), sequential samples were taken from sheep and cattle to evaluate diagnostic tests at various known times post-infection. Although no statistically significant differences were found, results suggested that during the early stage of a Pomona infection in sheep, qPCR on serum had the highest sensitivity for detecting leptospires in blood, followed by blood culture and qPCR on whole blood. In sheep infected under carefully controlled experimental conditions, culture tended to have higher sensitivity for detecting leptospires (either Hardjobovis or Pomona) in urine than qPCR; whereas in cattle with Hardjobovis infection, higher sensitivity was apparent using qPCR. Sensitivity was similar in culture and qPCR for detecting leptospires in kidney from sheep with either Hardjobovis or Pomona infections. There was low sensitivity and specificity of dark field microscopy for both urine and kidney samples, thus questioning the usefulness of this technique in veterinary settings. A cross-sectional study was carried out at a NZ sheep and cattle abattoir to investigate the seroprevalence (by microscopic agglutination test (MAT)), shedding rate (by urine qPCR), and renal colonisation rate (by kidney qPCR) of slaughtered animals. Urine, kidney and blood samples were collected from carcasses of 399 sheep and 146 cattle. The animal-level seroprevalence found in sheep (57 %, predominately lambs) and cattle (73 %, predominately ≤ 18 months old) was substantially higher than in previous studies; these and the recorded shedding rate (27 %) and renal colonisation rate (27 %) raised occupational health concerns that meat workers from this abattoir may be at risk of exposure to leptospires during their daily work routine. iv Samples from this abattoir study were used to investigate the <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>test</b> agreements between a research (HLRL) and a commercial veterinary diagnostic laboratory (GV), and test agreements (HLRL) between specimens for leptospirosis diagnosis. Urine qPCR results on from the two laboratories had almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0. 93). The MAT agreement between these two laboratories was higher for Hardjobovis (kappa = 0. 94) than Pomona (kappa = 0. 53). This serovar-dependent difference suggested that the different MAT results may be more likely due to the different source of antigen cultures (especially serovar Pomona) used in two laboratories than observer variation. These inter-laboratory comparisons can assist researchers and diagnosticians in understanding the sometimes discrepant test results received. Within HLRL, almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0. 84) between qPCR results on urine and kidney suggested that the qPCR on these two specimens can be used interchangeably. The comparisons between MAT and qPCR on both kidney and urine, suggested that except from Hardjobovis-seropositivity in sheep, Pomona-seropositivity in sheep and seropositivity of both Hardjobovis and Pomona in cattle was not considered to be predictive for indicating shedding/renal colonisation at individual animal level. A pilot panel of isolates from 18 sheep and five cattle kidney cultures demonstrated the utility of a multi-locus sequence typing scheme for genotyping Leptospira spp. field isolates from sheep and cattle in NZ. The sequence results provided sufficient genetic variability to assign the isolates to two distinct species, those being L. borgpetersenii and L. interrogans. Two dominant serovars (Hardjobovis and Kenniwicki) were identified. Identical sequences found in Hardjobovis isolates from sheep and cattle provided evidence for inter-species transmission of Leptospira spp. Aiming to establish the best diagnostic test or combination of tests for the early diagnosis of human leptospirosis, suspect leptospirosis patients were recruited via rural general practitioners (GP), hospital doctors and phlebotomists within the Waikato District Health Board area. For each recruited patient (n = 14), blood culture, MAT (on acute and convalescent serum), and whole blood/serum PCRs (by three laboratories) were performed. Although it is difficult to make conclusions based on findings from 14 patients recruited from one region, this is the first attempt to compare different diagnostic tests for acute leptospirosis cases in NZ. The information of clinical v symptoms, demographics, and exposure to risk factors can contribute to the GPs‟ suspicion of future leptospirosis cases. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence and quantify putative risk factors for both intra- and extra-curricular exposure to leptospirosis among undergraduate veterinary students at Massey University, NZ. All participating students (n = 302) were MAT negative for each serovar (Hardjobovis, Pomona, and Ballum), using a cut-point of ≥ 48. This study demonstrated that these veterinary students were at low risk of contracting leptospirosis, despite frequent exposure to potential sources of infection (e. g. animal urine within and outside veterinary curriculum, home slaughtering, hunting, and outdoor activities involving fresh water). The similar frequency of exposure to the non-work putative risky activities (hunting and home slaughtering) reported in veterinary students as previously reported in meat workers, added strength to the finding that non-work activities are less important risk factors compared to within-work activities...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) method {{for the high}} throughput determination of 10 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in milk samples using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) with a triple quadrupole (QqQ) instrument and an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The new extraction procedure is highly efficient, and we obtained absolute recoveries in the range 78. 1 - 97. 1 % for the extraction and clean-up steps. Chromatographic separation is performed in the gradient mode with a biphenyl column and acidic mobile phases consisting of water and acetonitrile containing formic acid. The chromatographic run time was about 12 min, and NSAID peaks showed a good symmetry factor. For MS/MS detection, we used multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, using ESI in {{both positive and negative}} modes. Our method has been validated in compliance with the European Commission Decision 657 / 2002 /EC, and we obtained very satisfactory results in <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> Furthermore, we explored the use of a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer, combining a quadrupole and an Orbitrap mass analyzer, for high resolution (HR) MS/MS detection of NSAIDs.

The biomethane potential (BMP) of these materials has to be determined to get insight in design parameters for anaerobic digesters. Although several norms and guidelines for BMP <b>tests</b> exist, <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> regularly still show high variability of BMPs for the same substrate. A workshop was held in June 2015, in Leysin, Switzerland, with over 40 attendees from 30 laboratories around the world, to agree on common solutions to the conundrum of inconsistent BMP test results. This paper presents the consensus of the intense roundtable discussions and cross-comparison of methodologies used in respective laboratories. Compulsory elements for the validation of BMP results were defined. They include the minimal number of replicates, the request to carry out blank and positive control assays, a criterion for the test duration, details on BMP calculation, and {{last but not least}} criteria for rejection of the BMP tests. Finally, recommendations on items that strongly influence the outcome of BMP tests such as inoculum characteristics, substrate preparation, test setup, and data analysis are presented to increase the probability of obtaining validated and reproducible results.

The instrument was equipped with remote control and surveillance facilities. The system's software allows for the internet-based networking between the measurement and control stations, global management, trend analysis, and early-warning applications. The experience of water laboratories has been utilised at the design of the instrument's hardware and software {{in order to make the}} system rugged and user-friendly.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{optimization}} and validation of an analytical method for {{the determination of}} the residual concentration of the prescription antibiotics metronidazole, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, clindamicyn, clarithromycin, erythromycin-H 2 O, roxithromycin and tylosin in wastewater and advanced treated wastewater. The method applied was used in a study of removal efficiency of these compounds at a full scale operational water reclamation plant using microfiltration-reverse osmosis (MF-RO) (Kwinana, Western Australia). The analytical procedure involves off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Method validation included determination of linearity, accuracy, precision, method limits of quantitation (MLQs), reproducibility and matrix effect. SPE recoveries were generally higher than 89 % for both pre- and post- RO water, except for erythromycin which yielded approximately 50 % recovery. The overall precision of the method was better than 16 % RSD (relative standard deviation), for all compounds and matrices. MLQ ranged between 23 - 53 ng/L and 2. 5 - 31 ng/L for pre- and post- RO water, respectively. In-house reproducibility expressed as RSD was generally better than 10 %. <b>Inter-laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> revealed a generally good agreement between concentrations of antibiotics reported by all participants. Results demonstrate that MF/RO treatment is capable of removing antibiotics present at relevant environmental concentration in secondary effluent (from the low to-mid ng/L range) to below MLQs (2. 5 - 31 ng/L), and more importantly, three to six orders of magnitude below the health guideline values developed for this project.

For implementation of ultra deep sequencing assays in clinical laboratories for routine diagnostics, intra- and <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> are of the utmost importance. 5 A multicenter {{study was conducted to}} validate an updated assay design for 454 Life Sciences' GS FLX Titanium system targeting protease/reverse transcriptase (RTP) and env (V 3) regions to identify HIV- 1 drug-resistance mutations and determine co-receptor use with high sensitivity. The study included 30 HIV- 1 subtype B and 6 subtype non-B samples with viral titers (VT) of 3, 940 - 447, 400 copies/mL, two dilution series (52, 129 - 1, 340 and 25, 130 - 734 copies/mL), and triplicate samples. Amplicons spanning PR codons 10 - 99, RT codons 1 - 251 and the entire V 3 region were generated using barcoded primers. Analysis was performed using the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer and geno 2 pheno for tropism. For comparison, population sequencing was performed using the ViroSeq HIV- 1 genotyping system. The median sequencing depth across the 11 sites was 1, 829 reads per position for RTP (IQR 592 - 3, 488) and 2, 410 for V 3 (IQR 786 - 3, 695). 10 preselected drug resistant variants were measured across sites and showed high inter-laboratory correlation across all sites with data (P 20 % were missed, variants 2 - 10 % were detected at most sites (even at low VT), and variants 1 - 2 % were detected by some sites.
