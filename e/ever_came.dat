5|$|The {{suspension}} {{came when}} Richard {{was leading the}} NHL in scoring and the Canadiens were battling Detroit for first place. Richard's suspension also cost him the 1954–55 scoring title, the closest he <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> to winning it. When Richard's teammate Bernie Geoffrion surpassed Richard in scoring by one point {{on the last day}} of the regular season, the Canadiens' fans booed him.|$|E
5|$|Watts's {{composition}} echoes J. M. W. Turner's 1843 {{treatment of}} the same topic, Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis, in primarily depicting a circle of bright light. However, Turner's painting depicts recognisable human figures, and no work by Turner <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> as close to pure abstract art as Watts's composition.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner {{was hired as}} director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous. Burt Reynolds also turned down the role, while Sylvester Stallone was interested, but nothing <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> of it. Paul Newman was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4million, turning down all three roles.|$|E

5|$|The Earls of Morton {{continued}} to live at Aberdour, although they never regained their earlier high status. In 1688 the castle was badly damaged by fire, and in 1690 the 11th Earl consulted the architect James Smith. Smith surveyed the damage and drew up proposals for repairing and extending the castle with another wing north of the east range. The Earl also sought estimates for the demolition of the tower house and central range. Nothing <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> of these proposals, although repairs were carried out to the east range, being completed in 1703.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} went mostly unnoticed {{upon its}} live broadcast. However, {{four years after}} the production of Casino Royale, CBS invited Fleming to write 32 episodes over a two-year period for a television show based on the James Bond character. Fleming agreed and began to write outlines for this series. When nothing <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> of this, however, Fleming grouped and adapted three of the outlines into short stories and released the 1960 anthology For Your Eyes Only along with an additional two new short stories.|$|E
5|$|Charles' {{choices were}} appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: {{he was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> to a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was a practicing Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E

In June, the Cleveland Indians were {{reportedly}} attempting to trade for McLaughlin and teammate Larry Milbourne in exchange for Bo Díaz. However, nothing <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> of the deal. With Seattle that season, he went 3–6 with a 6.85 ERA, two saves, and 41 strikeouts in 45 games, four of which were starts. Over his four-year tenure with the Mariners, McLaughlin had a combined record of 14–21 with a 5.10 ERA, five complete games, 16 saves, and 203 strikeouts in 113 games. Of those games, he made 28 starts and finished 47.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{of other}} leagues {{took note of}} the {{financial}} boon that followed SEC expansion to twelve teams. Atlantic Coast Conference representatives began discussing expansion to twelve schools {{in the first years}} of the new century, who began publicly pursuing the possibility of expansion anew in 2003. On May 13, 2003, representatives voted in favor of extending invitations to three schools. The only certain school was the University of Miami, while the other two spots were still being debated. Initially, the league favored admitting Miami, Syracuse University, and Boston College. After a month of debate, however, the ACC elected to extend formal invitations to Miami, Boston College, and Virginia Tech, which joined after initially being overlooked. This came years after these schools were considered for ACC membership in the early 1990s but nothing had <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> to fruition. Pittsburgh and Syracuse would also eventually join the ACC after rejections in 1990 and 2003, becoming members in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Helles landing {{was made}} by the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). The {{division}} landed on five beaches in an arc about the tip of the peninsula, named 'S', 'V', 'W', 'X' and 'Y' Beaches from east to west. On 1 May, the 29th Indian Brigade (including the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles) landed, took and secured Sari Bair above the landing beaches and was joined by the 1st/5th and the 2nd/10th Gurkha battalions; the Zion Mule Corps landed at Helles on 27 April. At 'Y' Beach, during the first engagement, the First Battle of Krithia, the Allies landed unopposed and advanced inland. There were {{only a small number of}} defenders in the village but lacking orders to exploit the position, the 'Y' Beach commander withdrew his force to the beach. It was as close as the Allies <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> to capturing the village as the Ottomans brought up a battalion of the 25th Regiment, checking any further movement.|$|E

5|$|On June 29, 2007, CMLL's annual Gran Alternativa tournament {{took place}} at Arena Mexico. Guerrero teamed up with Euforia, but the team was {{defeated}} by Místico and his partner La Sombra. After the loss Guerrero publicly asked Dr. Wagner, Jr. to join him for a challenge to Místico and Negro Casas for the CMLL Tag Team Championship. The match was held on July 13, 2007 at Arena Mexico and saw Guerrero and Wagner win the championship. A week later Guerrero and Wagner lost the titles back to Místico and Casas, making the team the shortest reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champions ever. The loss caused the two fighting in mutual accusations of betrayal, which in turn led to a feud between the two wrestlers. On July 27, at Arena Mexico, Dr. Wagner, Jr. and Místico held a mano a mano match which was decided by a treacherous intervention by Guerrero, who climbed into the ring, attacked Wagner from behind and caused him to lose the match, then the aftermath, Guerrero ripped off Wagner's mask. On August 3, 2007, Guerrero teamed up with Atlantis and Sangre Azteca against Dr. Wagner Jr., Alex Koslov and Volador Jr. at Arena México after the match Guerrero took the microphone and challenged Wagner for a mask versus mask match but no match <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> of it as Dr. Wagner, Jr. left CMLL shortly after. In 2008 Último Guerrero teamed with newcomer Dragón Rojo Jr. to win the 2008 Gran Alternativa tournament.|$|E
