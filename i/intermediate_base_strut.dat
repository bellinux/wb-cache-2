40|$|The MIT Truss Damping {{group has}} been {{studying}} the application of truss-like struc-tures to support the internal components of underwater vehicles. A truss structure is able to reduce the vibrational energy transmitted from internal noise sources to the hull by scattering and multi-paths. In a real application a truss will mount equipment at many points and this truss will {{be attached to the}} hull at various points. Spatial spectral analysis of the total elastic wave field is conducted to find the phase relationship of the total elastic wave field at the joints of a three-dimensional truss. A single-input/multiple-output system is excited by broadband white noise at one <b>base</b> <b>strut</b> and measured by accelerometers at joints and on <b>base</b> <b>struts</b> along the axis of the truss. The phase of the cross-spectra shows an approximately linear phase relationship as a function of frequency. However, the frequency-wavenumber spectrum shows that the wavenumbers at the joints of the truss are evenly distributed in high inertance bands (approximately between- 10 dB and 10 dB re 1 /kg). This is due to reverberation, and can be regarded as phase randomness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper reports {{our work}} on parallelizing an {{algorithm}} computing Gröbner bases on a distributed memory parallel machine. When computing Gröbner bases, {{the efficiency of}} computation {{is dominated by the}} total number of S-polynomials. To decrease the total number of S-polynomials it is necessary to apply a selection strategy that selects the minimum polynomial as a new element of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>base.</b> On a distributed memory parallel machine, as opposed to a shared memory parallel machine, we have to take into account non-trivial communication costs between processors. To reduce such communication costs, it is better to employ coarse grained parallelism rather than fine grained parallelism. We adopt a manager-worker model. S-polynomials are reduced in worker processes in parallel, and the minimum polynomial is selected in the manager process. To implement the selection strategy in this parallel model, synchronization between worker processes is required for every selection of a new element of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>base.</b> However, in spite of synchronization, introducing the selection strategy produces not only a better absolute computation speed but also better speedup with multi-processors. We achieved about 8 times speedup with 64 processors for large problems, T- 6 and Ex- 17...|$|R
