5|$|The {{head of the}} Black Dragons (David Carradine, {{credited}} as Grand Master), pays a {{visit to}} Guam to take the matter into his own hands. It turns out that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> prominently seen ringside in Max's flashbacks. The Black Dragons kidnap Christy, enticing Max and Jane {{to come to their}} hideout. Max and Grand Master reach an agreement that Max will fight Arnold Chon's character to death. If Max wins, Max and the Goody sisters can go free.

25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> The fact that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E
25|$|His name is the {{synonym for}} the {{faithful}} discharge of duty. In his business regulations {{he has won}} the respect and admiration of all who know him. As a public officer, when fortunes were within his grasp, not a thought of seizing them entered his mind. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> vigorously positive, determined, honest, generous and able. Not a stain has been cast on his name. Not a man can say a word against him to impeach his qualifications for the Mayoralty of New York.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> magnificently {{at home in}} nature, a virtuoso of pre-Christian innocence, {{almost a}} Portuguese teacher of Zen. Reis is a stoic Horatian, a pagan believer in fate, a player with {{classical}} myths less original than Caeiro, but more representative of modern symbolism. De Campos emerges as a Whitmanesque futurist, a dreamer in drunkenness, the Dionysian singer of what is oceanic and windswept in Lisbon. None of this triad resembles the metaphysical solitude, {{the sense of being}} an occultist medium which characterise Pessoa's 'own' intimate verse.|$|E

His organising ability and good luck were legendary; the fact of [...] "Jack" [...] Creswell being on <b>a</b> committee <b>was</b> practically <b>a</b> guarantee of success.

25|$|Harry is Edna’s {{husband and}} Tobias’s best friend. At {{one point in}} the past, Harry and Tobias, coincidentally, had an extramarital affair with the same young woman. Besides both having been {{businessmen}} and meeting at the same club, it is unclear what else Harry and Tobias have in common except that they have known one another {{for a long time and}} neither sleeps with his wife. Harry is something of a reflection of Tobias, but he is even more reserved. Of all the characters in this play, Harry speaks the least. And when he does speak, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of few words with lots of pauses around each one. He prefers to talk around things rather than going at them straight on. He also avoids questions, as when Agnes tries to find out why he and his wife have come to their home. Instead of giving Agnes an answer, he compliments the furnishings in Agnes’s home. He also has the tendency to repeat himself; at one point he repeats the same line four times when he tries to explain how fear has driven his wife and him out of their home. It is Harry, in the end, who tells Tobias that he and Edna have decided to leave. Although Harry prompted the discussion with Edna about resolving the issue of staying at their friends’ house, it is implied that Edna made the decision and that Harry just delivered the message.|$|E

"There is no {{question}} of his guilt....He {{was by no means}} as rabid and outspoken in his expressions as many others, and but for his prominence and the resulting far-reaching effect of his words, very probably might not have received the sentence he did. He is an old man, not strong physically. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of much personal charm and impressive personality, which qualifications make him a dangerous man calculated to mislead the unthinking and affording excuse for those with criminal intent." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, Marvel announced Civil War II: Kingpin by writer Matthew Rosenberg {{and artist}} Ricardo Lopez Ortiz. Rosenberg said, [...] "Wilson Fisk is an opportunist, first and foremost. Under his selfish motives, his brutal exterior, {{or even the}} facade he puts up as a pillar of his community, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who sees ways to benefit himself and he takes them... He wants to get whatever he can, however he can, and see how far he can push things. He is {{in the business of}} furthering Wilson Fisk, and the new Civil War will provide him a unique opportunity.

500|$|Macdonald (1815–91) was {{the first}} Prime Minister of Canada, in office 1867–73, and again 1878–91. [...] Brown depicts the Prime Minister {{in the role of}} scheming villain and caricatures his {{features}} in an absurd manner, giving him an extremely oversized nose and showing him as a drunk. [...] <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of ambitions and will not let anyone {{stand in the way of}} his legacy. [...] In the appendix, however, Brown discloses that he does not see Macdonald as the villain he has portrayed in the book. [...] Brown's distrust of big government leads him to push the conspiracy theory side of the story to Macdonald's detriment, but, in the end, he states that he [...] "would rather have lived in a state run by John A. Macdonald than one run by Louis Riel".|$|E
500|$|In March 1643, Temple had {{returned}} to Sussex, and along with his stepbrother, John Busbridge, he was appointed by Parliament to the Sussex committee set for the sequestration (i.e. seizure and administration) of the assets of prominent Royalists. In December 1643, Temple was prominent in the defence of the crossing of the River Adur at Bramber Castle against a Royalist attack during Lord Hopton's attempt to obtain control of Sussex for the King. His actions were described by Dr Cheynell: [...] "Upon the 12th of December I visited a brave soldier of my acquaintance, Captn Jas Temple, who did that day defend the fort of Bramber against a bold and daring enemy to the wonder of all the country and I did not marvel at it, for <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> that hath his head full of stratagems, his heart full of piety and valour, and his hand as full of success as it is of dexterity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season {{saw the two}} drivers collide again. With Senna leading Prost, now in a Ferrari, in {{the world}} Drivers' Championship, Prost qualified second for the penultimate race {{of the season in}} Suzuka with Senna on pole. Between the end of qualifying and race day, pole position was switched {{to the other side of}} the track without explanation. Senna complained that no longer being on the racing line, his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would get less grip and therefore a slower start compared to Prost who had been moved to the clean side of the grid. The Brazilian's appeal was rejected. At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two; but whilst braking for the first corner, Senna refused to back off and collided with Prost at , clinching the title for the Brazilian. Prost almost retired from the sport, saying [...] "What he did was disgusting. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> without value." [...] A year later, Senna admitted that the move was premeditated, in retaliation for the collision at the chicane on the same course the previous year.|$|E

500|$|Hawk {{wins the}} gladiator tournament in Valhalla, gaining {{citizenship}} in the Center, and is asked by Hiroko {{to help her}} find a boy who has gone missing. Upon their failure to find him, they are escorted by Zayin to the Center, where they meet the Messian bishop. He reprimands Hiroko for acting independently and tells Hawk that his true identity is Aleph, the Messiah, who will save mankind and bring about the paradisiacal [...] "Thousand-Year Kingdom", and that Beth was sent by God as the Messiah's partner. The Center sends Aleph and Beth on missions across Tokyo Millennium to eradicate demons and prepare {{the world for the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom. They meet with Gimmel, and are shown Arcadia, a prototype of the Thousand-Year Kingdom. Returning to the Center, they learn that demons have invaded and that someone the bishop calls the Anti-Messiah is proclaiming to the people that he is the true Messiah. Aleph and Beth are sent to stop him, and learn that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Daleth. During the ensuing fight, Daleth nearly kills Aleph, but Beth sacrifices herself, allowing Aleph to regain the upper hand. Honoring Beth's dying wish, he spares Daleth, and is considered the true Messiah.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{described}} Joseph as an [...] "awkward {{and very}} bookish" [...] character, one who struggled {{to relate to}} his patients, {{in contrast to the}} [...] "happy-go-lucky Sam", which resulted in comedy as [...] "Sam is the antithesis of Joe." [...] He also deemed his character [...] "incredibly honest and morally upright", [...] "a total oddball with all sorts of hang-ups", and as being [...] "very stuck in his ways." [...] During his tenure, these aspects of his characterisation have each been explored. It was revealed in Joseph's first appearance that both his father and grandfather had been pioneering cardiothoracic Consultants, and that it had always been expected of him to follow the same path. [...] His residual guilt over his brother's attempted suicide was developed throughout his first few months at Holby City Hospital. Roberts commented on the event that: [...] "It underpins much of his behaviour. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> burdened by guilt and loss. I think I can be so bold as to say he transfers many of his feelings about his brother onto patients and staff alike, without ever betraying the source of his pain." [...] Joseph's resultant fastidiousness developed into OCD, something he attempted to control and hide by use of relaxant medication.|$|E
500|$|In his prime, Smith {{was widely}} {{recognised}} by both contemporaries and rivals as a formidable negotiator. Hempstone considered him [...] "a man too principled (or short-sighted) to compromise {{with what he}} regards as wrong", while Welensky compared dealing with him to [...] "trying to nail jelly to a wall". He had an [...] "iron nerve", to quote his RF colleague PK van der Byl, and a reputation for [...] "icy calm"; he almost never got angry or raised his voice. He spoke with [...] "a nasal monologue" [...] as Peter Younghusband described it—"uninspiring even by Rhodesian oratorical standards". His open, informal association with the general public fostered the impression among white Rhodesians that their Prime Minister was still an [...] "ordinary, decent fellow", which Berlyn cites as {{a major factor in}} his enduring popularity. Welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an [...] "almost hypnotic influence" [...] over the Rhodesian electorate, which helped him to win [...] "election after election... hands down". He also had the grudging respect of at least some of his black nationalist opponents during the Bush War; one, quoted anonymously by People magazine in 1976, asserted that [...] "If we had a leader like Mr Smith, we would have won long ago." [...] Sithole, the long-time ZANU leader, said: [...] "Smith is a fighter. He put up a great fight for his people. We were like two bulls in there, the way we fought. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> I respect him." ...|$|E
