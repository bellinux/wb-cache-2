This region was visited by one of Matsuno's colleagues, who was a wine enthusiast and favored Saint-Émilion, one of the largest vineyards of Bordeaux. Captivated by this small town's architecture, the design team went on a trip to France to adopt these styles into the game. A team of five people was formed in September 1998, including Matsuno and the principal persons in charge of graphics and decorations, to realize the game's setting.|$|E

5|$|On February 17, 2010, the US Department of Transportation {{awarded a}} $55.5M TIGER grant for {{the station in}} West Fitchburg and a new layover {{facility}} {{in the town of}} Westminster. In June 2010, the MBTA and Pan Am Railways reached an agreement for trackage rights and fees on several lines, including MBTA access to Wachusett station and the layover on the Pan Am Southern mainline partially owned by Pan Am Railways. The project officially began with a publicized groundbreaking on October 18, 2010, and was originally scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2012. However, by February 2012, the station was just at 30% <b>design</b> <b>phase,</b> with track and signals to reach 30% design by late spring.

5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the <b>design</b> <b>phase,</b> including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the Collins class.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As we {{know that}} delay occurs in every phase of {{construction}} project. One of the key characteristics of the construction projects is executing {{the scope of work}} in a specific amount of time. As project time overrun may have bad consequences for the project performing organization such as cost overrun, damage of company’s reputation, etc. it is important to clarify between causes of excusable delays and causes of non-excusable delays. While most previous studies have focused on finding causes or overcoming delays in the construction phase, few studies have analyzed delay problems in the planning and <b>design</b> <b>phases.</b> The main purpose of proposed research work is to identify and rank delay causes in the planning and <b>design</b> <b>phases.</b> A structured questionnaire was sent to engineers at the A/E companies for public construction projects in INDIA. Based on 95 valid responses, this study identified the delay causes and analyzed the importance and frequency of delays using the relative importance index. Analytical results reveal that “changes in client’s requirement ” are the main causes of delays in both planning and <b>design</b> <b>phases.</b> The finding is good justification for many public clients who usually change their requirements during the planning and <b>design</b> <b>phases</b> that really delay construction projects.

5|$|Author Fred Brooks {{criticized the}} program's {{requirement}} for the Comanche {{to be capable of}} ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project's <b>design</b> <b>phase</b> and of their costly repercussions. Williams observes that the Comanche's weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft's final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche's engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight of the helicopter. Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky, while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone {{for a number of years}} was considered to be extreme. According to Williams, it was concluded that the Army's aviation budget would be better spent on the delivery of less risky and more critical needs.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the <b>design</b> <b>phase</b> of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the <b>design</b> <b>phase,</b> the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E

Construction of Phase 1, which widened MD 5 to 6 lanes {{in the vicinity of the}} future interchange, began in November 2009 and was completed in August 2011. Phase 2, which will build the interchange itself, went through the <b>design</b> <b>phase,</b> with construction beginning in 2016 and be completed in 2019. In addition, the route is planned to be upgraded to a full freeway between US 301 and the Capital Beltway, with new interchanges at Burch Hill Road/Earnshaw Drive and Surratts Road. This project is currently in the planning stages with many alternatives including upgrading only portions to freeway, adding reversible lanes or high-occupancy vehicle lanes, and various interchange designs.|$|E

40|$|At {{each stage}} of the product {{development}} process, the designers are facing an important task which consists of decision making. Two cases are observed: the problem of concept selection in conceptual <b>design</b> <b>phases</b> and, the problem of pre-dimensioning once concept choices are made. Making decisions in conceptual <b>design</b> <b>phases</b> on a sound basis {{is one of the}} most difficult challenges in engineering design, especially when innovative concepts are introduced. On the one hand, designers deal with imprecise data about design alternatives. On the other hand, design objectives and requirements are usually not clear in these phases. The greatest opportunities to reduce product life cycle costs usually occur during the first conceptual <b>design</b> <b>phases.</b> The need for reliable multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) methods is thus greatest at early conceptual <b>design</b> <b>phases.</b> Various MCDA methods are proposed in the literature. The main criticism of these methods is that they usually yield different results for the same problem [22, 23, 25]. In this work, an analysis of six MCDA methods (weighed sum, weighted product, Kim & Lin, compromise programming, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE I) was conducted. Our analysis was performed via an industrial case of solar collector structure development. The objective is to define the most appropriate MCDA methods in term of three criteria: (i) the consistency of the results, (ii) the ease of understanding and, (iii) the adaptation of the decision type. The results show that TOPSIS is the most consistent MCDA method in our case...|$|R
