40|$|The aged {{degradation}} of material is observed when <b>heat-resisting</b> <b>steel</b> is exposed {{for long periods}} of time at high temperatures. In the present study, the degraded 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo steel that is used {{for long periods of}} time at high temperature (about 515 o C) and artificially reheat-treated materials are prepared. These materials were used to study the effect of aged degradation on fretting fatigue behavior. Through this experiment, it is found that the fretting fatigue strength of reheat-treated 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo steel is approximately 46 percent lower than that of the plain fatigue strength of the same material. Furthermore, the fretting fatigue strength of degraded 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo steel was less than 53 percent of the same materials plain fatigue strength. The maximum value of fatigue strength difference is observed as 57 percent between the fretting fatigue of degraded material and plain fatigue of reheat-treated material. These results can be used as basic data in a structural integrity evaluation of <b>heat-resisting</b> <b>steel</b> considering aged degradation effects...|$|E

The creep-fatigue fracture originated from prior austenite grain boundaries. Subgrains neighboring the prior austenite grain boundaries became coarse during creep-fatigue testing. Nano-indentation tests {{were performed on}} the coarse subgrains neighboring grain boundaries and finer subgrains inner grains. As the results, the nano scale-hardness of the coarse subgrains were markedly {{lower than those of}} the finer subgrains inner grains. Therefore, it is suggested that the coarse subgrains neighboring grain boundaries play an important role of creep-fatigue fracture mechanism...|$|E

Part {{of this research is}} being done to evaluate alloys containing (8 - 10) -cr-(10 - 14) ni-(0 - 8. 5) Si-(0 - 4) al to determine which of these alloys have austenitic structures, as well as fabrication properties and oxidation resistance sufficient to substitute for type 304 stainless steel. Based on initial results, an fe- 10 cr- 11 ni- 5 si alloy and an fe- 8 cr- 13 ni- 5 si alloy were selected for evaluation of oxidation, stress rupture, and tensile properties. Both alloys have oxidation resistance at 700 deg and 800 deg c that is better than that of type 304 stainless steel. The stress rupture strengths are less than that of type 304 stainless steel but significantly better than that of commericial <b>heat-resisting</b> <b>steels</b> with similar cr contents. Yield strengths of the alloys were equivalent to that of type 304. Both alloys had high tensile strengths comparable to those of stainless steels that transform to martensite during straining (e. g., type 301). These alloys have weld-hot-cracking resistance comparable to that of type 304 stainless steel.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research on substitutes for chromium-containing alloys in order to conserve imported critical and strategic materials. Part of this research concentrates on finding low-chromium substitutes for <b>heat-resisting</b> stainless <b>steels</b> for the temperature range 60020 to 80020 C. Ferritic alloys are emphasized that have oxidation resistance provided by chromium contents as low as 10 pct and stress rupture strength provided by the precipitation of the chi(X) -phase intermetallic compound, (Fe 36 Cr 12 (Mo, Ti) 10). Initially, research was concentrated on selecting an alloy composition having a minimum chromium content with strengthening provided by the X-phase. An Fe-(10 - 12 pct) Cr- 6 pct Mo-(1. 5 - 2. 0 pct) Ti alloy was selected. After the alloy selection, the tensile, stress rupture, and oxidation properties were determined. Stress rupture properties {{were found to be}} similar to those of 304 stainless steel. However, the alloys possessed brittleness during both stress rupture and tensile testing, possibly as a result of too high a content of molybdenum and titanium. Higher than expected oxidation rates were found that may be caused by the high molybdenum content...|$|R
