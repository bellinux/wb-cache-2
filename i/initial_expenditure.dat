5000|$|The other {{important}} aspect of the multiplier is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption, it also generates [...] "new" [...] tax revenues. For example, when money is spent in a shop, purchases taxes such as VAT are paid on the expenditure, and the shopkeeper earns a higher income, and thus pays more income taxes. Therefore, although the government spends $1, it is likely that it receives back a significant proportion of the $1 in due course, making the net expenditure much less than $1. Indeed, in theory, it is possible, if the <b>initial</b> <b>expenditure</b> is targeted well, that the government could receive back more than the initial $1 expended.|$|E

His plan to bring good, clean water into town was approved but the Board of Directors cautioned that the aqueduct would be better if made of clay to avoid disorganising the entire system in the event a brick or two became dislodged. The idea of taxing the company's own ships, it was felt, was unusual and it was noted that these had always enjoyed free water in the past, and instructed this to be removed from the revenue estimates. They further noted that it was unlikely for Malays, Chinese and other inhabitants of George Town to avail themselves of the channelled water owing to the presence of a good well in town, sufficient to their needs. The final nail in the coffin came when they asserted that taxation ought to be kept as low as it could to encourage settlers to come to the island.|$|E

40|$|Mandatory {{information}} system (IS) investments occur when government regulations require firms {{to alter their}} IS. These investments are additional expenditures added onto the <b>initial</b> <b>expenditures</b> of non-mandatory IS investments. Managers are concerned about associated costs and {{in an attempt to}} reduce the expenditures, most firms refrain from formal planning methods when mandatory investments are imposed upon them. Drawing on Henderson’s and Sifonis’ (1988) IS Planning and Investment Model as our theoretical lens, this paper argues that firms should re-consider this practice. It is hypothesised that formal planning methods are beneficial because they enable firms to combine mandatory and non-mandatory investments {{in such a way that}} competitive advantage can be achieved. We use a secondary dataset provided by the Australian government to test the hypotheses. Results show that only two out of three investigated formal planning methods are positively associated with competitive advantage. We conclude that in the special case of mandatory investments, formal methods are only beneficial if they incorporate information from the entire firm, rather than information from particular departments only...|$|R

40|$|Paper: 15 pp. digital file. The {{issue of}} {{taxpayer}} support of professional sports teams and for building new downtown facilities is a contentious one. Proponents argue {{this practice is}} beneficial to the community in terms of municipal revenue, economic growth and job creation because new money is spent in the economy. Further, this new money is subject to an economic multiplier effect, which greatly increases {{the economic impact of}} the <b>initial</b> <b>expenditures</b> by creating more jobs and more tax revenue for local governments. Thus, the cost to the taxpayer is said to be much less than the benefits. Many scholars refute these claims and, based on empirical research, suggest that quite the opposite is true. They take issue with the idea of team expenditures as new money, and suggest that the economic multipliers are overstated. They also argue that the cost of ongoing subsidies and capital investment in the construction of new facilities are underestimated. Furthermore, the sustainability of teams and facilities must be questioned in light of rapidly escalating costs; both players’ salaries and ticket prices continue to increase. Fierce competition among cities increases teams’ demands for newer facilities and more funding, leaving cities with small market thresholds out in the cold. Institute of Urban Studie...|$|R

When the analysis is carried out with a welfare-maximizing public firm and a profit-maximizing private firm, we show that equilibrium outcome depends {{on the size of}} cost inefficiency parameter of the public firm. Finally, we also conduct an analysis where the public firm acts as a strategic initiator of the costly <b>initial</b> <b>expenditure</b> before leaving the market to the private firms...|$|E

The construction bureau turned {{over control of the}} railroad, and the coal mine, to the Hokkaidō Government Office in January 1886. The following year, the two were split into separate offices, and the railroad began to be administered from Temiya instead of Sapporo, but {{before the end of the}} year, the Horonai Railway came to be contracted by the head of the Rails & Coal Mine Office, Murata Tsutsumi, to aid in the completion of the Ikunshunbetsu Line. This operation would not be profitable for the Horonai Railway, but Murata took these risks on himself, and explained to the Hokkaidō Government Office that this work was necessary in order to get the Ikushunbetsu coal mine operational, and that <b>initial</b> <b>expenditures</b> were necessary in such a venture. He hoped the expenses could be compensated for somewhat by the rents and taxes paid by the citizenry. Murata's scheme was approved in 1888, and he formed the Hokuyūsha (Northern Property Company) to manage the railroad contracts. For the next fifteen years, the Hokuyūsha paid the Horonai Railroad 5000 yen every year in return for using their trains and rails, and took on the responsibility of maintenance and all other fees; this revived the railroad's revenues.|$|R
