6000|$|... "She gave {{me another}} look, {{and this time}} <b>’er</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> seemed large and solemn. She walked along like one in a dream, and twice she tripped over the planks and would ’ave fallen if I hadn’t caught ’er round the waist.|$|R
60|$|Evelyn M. {{listened with}} <b>her</b> bright <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed upon the oracles.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: From {{right to}} left, black, red, and liver merle mixed breed puppies. You {{can tell the}} red is merle due to the faint {{mottling}} on her black sable tipped ears, but as she grew {{the only sign of}} merling was <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Once to the willow-tree [...] A maid came fearful, [...] Pale seemed {{her cheek}} to be, [...] <b>Her</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> tearful. [...] Soon {{as she saw}} the tree, [...] Her steps moved fleeter. [...] No one was there--ah me!-- [...] No one to meet her! ...|$|R
60|$|Mary {{turned and}} looked {{him up and down}} with <b>her</b> {{wondering}} <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|The girl raised <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and looked}} at the woman for an instant.|$|E

60|$|The miller {{turned and}} looked into <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and knew that she spoke truly.|$|E
60|$|She flashed me {{a glance}} of <b>her</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and I thought that tears impended.|$|E
