Immelt to President François Hollande published in Les Echos Immelt gave assurances about continued investment in Alstom's French activities, on security relating to Alstom's involvement in the French civil nuclear sector, and on job commitments made by Alstom Wind regarding its new factories, whilst making Alstom's wind activities available for sale to French investors. On 30 April, Alstom confirmed an offer had been received for its power and grid divisions (representing an <b>equity</b> <b>value</b> of €12.35billion, €11.4billion enterprise value) and was under review with key interests including the French state. On 30 April, GE confirmed an offer had been made, with a value of $16.9billion, representing a $13.5billion enterprise value plus $3.4billion cash. On 5 May, General Electric posted an offer to buy one fourth of the shares in Alstom's Indian power and distribution companies – Alstom T India and Alstom India – at 261.25 and 382.20 rupees a share (value US$278million and $111million respectively) subject to its bid for Alstom SA being successful.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} outside director {{compensation for}} {{a sample of}} 237 Fortune 500 firms over the 1998 - 2004 period. We document a trend towards fixed-value equity compensation and away from cash only and fixed-number equity compensation. Adjustments to director compensation are consistent with firms targeting a market level of compensation, and firms that deviate from their market wage symmetrically adjust compensation back toward the market level. We also document the relation between changes in compensation and changes in <b>equity</b> <b>values,</b> and find that upward adjustments begin sooner than downward adjustments. When <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> rise, we find virtually no immediate offset to director compensation. However, when <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> fall, fixed-number <b>equity</b> compensation is adjusted {{in the same period}} (by awarding more shares or options) to offset the loss of income by almost one-third. Thus, the magnitude of adjustments towards the market wage level is symmetric, but the timing is not. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{appraised}} {{the effect}} which book values and earnings {{would have on}} <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> of quoted corporate entities in Nigeria. In view of this, we obtained secondary data from the published reports of 105 firms selected for this study. The study period was 10 years (2005 – 2014). The regression technique was employed to analyse the data sourced from the annual accounts of sampled entities. Additionally, the Breusch-Pagan/ Cook-Weisberg Test was employed along with the VIF Test to verify whether the sourced data were normally distributed or whether there was presence of multicollinearity among the explanatory variables. Results from our analysis revealed inter alia, that {{book value per share}} and earnings jointly had significant and positive effect on <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> of Nigerian quoted firms. Given the level of significance of earnings in attempting to ascertain <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> of Nigerian firms, it was thus recommend that regulatory bodies like the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria among others should develop enforceable strategies and sanctions that would discourage and eliminate any form of earnings manipulation that may distort the information reported in the financial statements of quoted corporate entities in Nigeria...|$|R

Results suggest that DDM and RIM underestimate <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> of Thai firms and that RIM outperforms DDM in predicting cross-sectional stock prices. Results on regression of cross-sectional stock prices on the decomposed DDM and RIM <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> indicate that book <b>value</b> of <b>equity</b> provides the greatest incremental explanatory power, relative to other components in DDM and RIM terminal values, suggesting that book value distortions resulting from accounting procedures and choices are less severe than forecast and measurement errors in discount rates and growth rates. We also document that the incremental explanatory power of book <b>value</b> of <b>equity</b> during 1998 - 2004, representing the information environment under Thai Accounting Standards reformed after the 1997 economic crisis to conform to International Accounting Standards, is significantly greater than that during 1995 - 1996, representing the information environment under the pre-reformed Thai Accounting Standards. This implies that the book value distortions are less severe under the 1997 Reformed Thai Accounting Standards than the pre-reformed Thai Accounting Standards...|$|R

Because the strength of this ampli 8 ̆ 5 cation depends on the share of 8 ̆ 5 rms that are in 8 ̆ 5 nancial distress, it operates mostly in recessions, when <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> are low.

40|$|We derive the {{quantitative}} implications of growth theory for U. S. corporate equity plus net debt {{over the period}} 1960 - 2001. There were large secular movements in corporate <b>equity</b> <b>values</b> relative to GDP, with dramatic declines in the 1970 's and dramatic increases starting in the 1980 's and continuing throughout the 1990 's. During the same period, there was little change in the capital-output ratio or earnings share of output. We ask specifically whether the theory accounts for these observations. We find that it does, with the critical factor being changes in the U. S. tax and regulatory system. We find that the theory also accounts for the even larger movements in U.
