50|$|It is {{important}} to realize that only those sub-wavelength differences of successive ranges from the transmitting antenna to each target point and back, which govern signal phase, are used to refine the resolution in any geometric dimension. The central direction and the angular width of the <b>illuminating</b> <b>beam</b> do not contribute directly to creating that fine resolution. Instead, they serve only to select the solid-angle region from which usable range data are received. While some distinguishing of the ranges of different scene items can be made from the forms of their sub-wavelength range variations at short ranges, the very large depth of focus that occurs at long ranges usually requires that over-all range differences (larger than a wavelength) be used to define range resolutions comparable to the achievable cross-range resolution.|$|E

30|$|PA radar transmits {{identical}} waveforms at each transmit element, {{and these}} waveforms are {{reflected by the}} target located in far field with linear phase difference. Indeed, these echoes are superposed when they are received {{at the end of}} the receiving end. Utilizing the coherency of the reflecting echoes, a narrow and high-gain beam is formed when beamforming technique is applied. However, MIMO radar does not work that way. For the MIMO case, mutually orthogonal or non-coherent waveforms that cannot be stacked in homo-phase are transmitted, thus only wide low-gain beams can be synthesized at the transmitting end. In order to cover the whole area that the wide transmitting <b>beams</b> <b>illuminate,</b> multiple <b>beams</b> should be formed at the receiving end.|$|R

5000|$|Ptychography ( [...] πτυχο-γραφία, from πτυχή = fold + γραφή = writing/scripture) is a {{technique}} invented by Walter Hoppe that aims to solve the diffraction-pattern phase problem by interfering adjacent Bragg reflections coherently and thereby determine their relative phase. In the original formulation, Hoppe envisaged that such interference could be effected by placing a very narrow aperture in {{the plane of the}} specimen so that each reciprocal-lattice point would be spread out and thus overlap with other points. The name ptychography, from the Greek for fold, derives from this optical configuration; each reciprocal lattice point is convolved with some function, and thus made to interfere with its neighbors. In fact, measuring only the intensities of interfering adjacent diffracted beams still leads to an ambiguity of two possible complex conjugates for each underlying complex diffraction amplitude. The original formulation of ptychography is equivalent to the well known theorem that for a finite specimen (that is one delineated by a narrow aperture, sometimes known as a finite support), the one-dimensional phase problem is soluble to within an ambiguity of 2N, where N is the number of Fourier components that make up the specimen. However, such ambiguities may be resolved by changing the phase, profile or position of the <b>illuminating</b> <b>beam</b> in some way. The fact that not only the intensities of the diffracted beams but also the intensities lying midway between the beams, where the convolved Bragg beams interfere, is an alternative statement of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem for components of diffracted intensity. These components generally have twice the frequency (in reciprocal space) of their underlying complex amplitudes.|$|E

It was found that the light was focused outside the waveguide, and the fraction of the power radiated into air compared favorably with the theoretical calculation. The focal point outside the waveguide was found to move by about 1 cm when the wavelength was changed by 500 Å-in agreement with theoretical estimates...|$|R
40|$|Light microscopes {{can detect}} objects through several {{physical}} processes, such as scattering, absorption, and reflection. In transparent objects, these mechanisms are often too weak, and interference effects are more suitable {{to observe the}} tiny refractive index variations that produce phase shifts. We propose an on-chip microscope design that exploits birefringence in an unconventional geometry. It makes use of two sheared and quasi-overlapped <b>illuminating</b> <b>beams</b> experiencing relative phase shifts when going through the object, and a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensor array to record the resulting interference pattern. Unlike conventional microscopes, the beams are unfocused, leading to a very large field of view (20 mm(2)) and detection volume (more than 0. 5 cm(3)), {{at the expense of}} lateral resolution. The high axial sensitivity (< 1 nm) achieved using a novel phase-shifting interferometric operation makes the proposed device ideal for examining transparent substrates and reading microarrays of biomarkers.
