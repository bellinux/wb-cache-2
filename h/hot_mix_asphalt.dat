5000|$|Warm <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{concrete}} (commonly abbreviated as WMA) {{is produced}} by adding either zeolites, waxes, asphalt emulsions, or sometimes even water to the asphalt binder prior to mixing. This allows significantly lower mixing and laying temperatures and results in lower consumption of fossil fuels, thus releasing less carbon dioxide, aerosols and vapors. Not only are working conditions improved, but the lower laying-temperature also leads to more rapid availability of the surface for use, which is important for construction sites with critical time schedules. The usage of these additives in <b>hot</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>asphalt</b> (above) may afford easier compaction and allow cold weather paving or longer hauls. Use of warm mix is rapidly expanding.

IntegraBase’s binding technology also improves wet strength and improves water stripping properties (separation of the bitumen from the aggregate). The binding strength of IntegraBase also enables the construction of roads with marginal aggregates, allowing contractors to use local materials.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{concrete}} (commonly abbreviated as HMAC or HMA) {{is produced}} by heating the asphalt binder to decrease its viscosity, and drying the aggregate to remove moisture from it prior to mixing. Mixing is generally performed with the aggregate at about 300 °F (roughly 150 °C) for virgin asphalt and 330 °F (166 °C) for polymer modified asphalt, and the asphalt cement at 200 °F (95 °C). Paving and compaction must be performed while the asphalt is sufficiently hot. In many countries paving is restricted to summer months because in winter the compacted base will cool the asphalt too much before {{it is able to}} be packed to the required density. HMAC is the form of asphalt concrete most commonly used on high traffic pavements such as those on major highways, racetracks and airfields. It is also used as an environmental liner for landfills, reservoirs, and fish hatchery ponds.|$|E

The asphalt paving industry also uses this type of trailer or truck chassis mounted unit to haul <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> <b>asphalt</b> from the batch plant to the job site. Aggregates used in road building are often hauled with these units. Belt trailers generally utilize a sloped side that in most cases is covered in plastic which allows the product to slide down the sidewall onto the belt. The unload times for belt trailers usually is less than five minutes and the driver does not need to climb into the trailer to sweep like a moving floor trailer or more commonly referred to as walking floor. Generally most belt trailers are made out of aluminum, but some manufacturers feature steel and stainless steel construction that can be used in off road conditions and for hauling corrosive materials.|$|E
