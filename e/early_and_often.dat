5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} to designate it otherwise than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Warriors (2–2) aired it {{out against}} the Panthers (2–3), scoring <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often.</b> Hawaii {{attempted}} 38 passes and called just one run play in the first half, while jumping out a 34–9 lead. Brennan passed for 369yards in the one-sided half and led the Warriors to a 32-point lead before being taken out midway through the third quarter.|$|E
25|$|The {{momentum}} of the 1980 season continued into September 1981 for the Georgia Bulldogs as Walker and company took control {{early in the season}} by scoring <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often</b> in wins against Tennessee (44–0) and the Cal Golden Bears (27–13). Against the Volunteers, Walker rushed for 161 yards on 30 carries. Walker pounded California by rushing 35 times for 167 yards on September 12.|$|E

2500|$|Free recall {{describes}} {{the process in}} which a person is given a list of items to remember and then is tested by being asked to recall them in any order. [...] Free recall often displays evidence of primacy and recency effects. Primacy effects are displayed when the person recalls items presented {{at the beginning of the}} list <b>earlier</b> <b>and</b> more <b>often.</b> The recency effect is when the person recalls items presented at the end of the list <b>earlier</b> <b>and</b> more <b>often.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{sluggish}} Adelaide pitch {{had been}} rendered even more toothless by its new wicket, the fresh soil removing its tendency to take spin {{after the second}} day. With five fast bowlers in the touring team there were bouncers aplenty as they vied for a Test place, which slowed down the over-rate to 10 or 11 an hour. Mike Hendrick did best with his 5/68 in the second innings and Derek Underwood took 7/127 in the match with his carefully placed spin. By coincidence the South Australian wicketkeeper was Mike Hendricks and he made 57 in the home side's first innings. The South Australian captain Ian Chappell top-scored with 78 in the second despite hooking <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often,</b> {{but in the end}} the over-rate and flat pitch ensured a draw.|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{hit home}} runs <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often</b> in the 1921 season, {{during which he}} broke Roger Connor's mark for home runs in a career, 138. Each of the almost 600 home runs Ruth hit in his career after that {{extended}} his own record. After a slow start, the Yankees were soon locked in a tight pennant race with Cleveland, winners of the 1920 World Series. On September 15, Ruth hit his 55th home run, shattering his year-old single season record. In late September, the Yankees visited Cleveland and won {{three out of four}} games, giving them the upper hand in the race, and clinched their first pennant a few days later. Ruth finished the regular season with 59 home runs, batting [...]378 and with a slugging percentage of [...]846.|$|E

[...] He also applauded the song's [...] "outstanding, inspirational lyrics" [...] and Allen's vocal performance. Entertainment Weekly's Michael Slezak called the song [...] "a future smash hit" [...] and described it as [...] "downright verbose – packing in some sweet, new-age-y sentiments about existing in the moment, living without regret, and saying 'I love you' <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often</b> {{to the people in}} our lives". [...] He stated that rather than being cliché the song's lyrics are [...] "winningly inspirational thanks to the conviction in Kris’ vocals". [...] Yahoo! News described it as [...] "impressive" [...] and felt that Allen's version of the song [...] "improves on the unreleased version with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery". [...] Monica Herrera of Billboard said that Allen [...] "improves" [...] the Script's version [...] "with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery". Herrera also stated that [...] "Allen still seems [...] "emboldened by the risks he took on Idol" [...] and that his fans [...] "should be feeling the same after hearing the first track from his November 17 debut." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{marketing}} campaign for Indestructible began in late 2007, with {{a strategy of}} releasing content for fans <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often.</b> Promotion began with distributing stickers at live events. Reprise Records also partnered with Hot Topic retailers, who thereafter put an Indestructible album teaser on all Disturbed merchandise, and eventually began selling a limited edition 7" [...] vinyl record with two songs from the album on it. In March 2008, Disturbed performed a concert in Kuwait for United States military stationed there. The concert was streamed live on MySpace, and {{more than three million}} people viewed it. In February 2008, an audio sample was posted on Disturbed's MySpace profile to promote Indestructible. The sample, titled [...] "Perfect Insanity", is actually a song written early in the band's career that never previously appeared on an album, but was expected to appear on the album. The track was later made available for download, in its entirety, on Disturbed's website for promotional purposes. Another sample, titled [...] "Inside the Fire", appeared on Rock on the Range's MySpace profile in March 2008. The track was anticipated to be the first single released from the album, with a music video directed by Nathan Cox. On March 24, 2008 [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] debuted on more than sixty radio stations. It was released for digital download the next day.

On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often,</b> and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character sound a little off the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. Empire magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as [...] "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from being}} the loudest catcher in the Majors, Landrith also had a {{philosophy}} of talking things over with his pitcher face to face on the mound, <b>early</b> <b>and</b> <b>often.</b> It is normal for catchers to occasionally call a timeout and go the mound to talk with his pitcher, especially in crucial situations, but Hobie took this facet of the game to new extremes. It was not unusual for Hobie to make many as five visits to the mound in an inning. He once visited the mound ten times in a single inning to chat with Giants pitcher Sam Jones. Landrith was once described as a [...] "legendary chatterbox". He was inspired to have his frequent consultations at the mound by Birdie Tebbetts and Yogi Berra. He insisted {{that he did not}} commit this practice to stall for time, but because he believed [...] "there should be a closer relationship between pitcher and catcher. [...] I run out to the mound to eliminate any indecision on the pitcher's part and mine. Some batsmen have to be pitched to very carefully." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Iowa Hawkeyes welcomed Purdue to Kinnick Stadium {{one week}} after losing their much {{anticipated}} game against top-ranked Ohio State.

[...] Kyle Schlicher added two field goals {{in the second quarter}} and the Hawkeyes lead 20-3 at halftime. [...] Purdue's only first half scoring came on a 44-yard field goal by freshman Chris Summers. [...] Sims scored again on Iowa's first possession of the second half before Greg Orton caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Curtis Painter. [...] Tate then hit tight end Scott Chandler for a touchdown and Purdue then responded with a Jaycen Taylor touchdown run. [...] The Boilermakers could get no closer as they were shut out in the fourth quarter. [...] Shonn Greenne scored on a short run and Adam Shada returned an interception of a Curtis Painter pass 98 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

He recently returned from Scotland where he meant {{to learn how to}} make Scotch, but instead became trapped at a finishing school, where it was revealed that when he is not completely soused, Lyle is surprisingly intelligent and erudite, concocting an elaborate plan to escape from the finishing school that involved spicing the bland meals in the cafeteria to make them more delicious, so that the staff would feel more relaxed before he even attempted to leave. Despite this, he is clearly far more comfortable with himself while intoxicated; the blog entry that confirmed the success of his escape was supposedly written from a bar, and was a barely legible mess. He's also often seen wearing a Misfits T-shirt.|$|E
