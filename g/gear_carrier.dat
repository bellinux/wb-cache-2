A transmission housing envelops two epicyclic gear assemblies, and has shafts extending from it. One shaft {{is attached to a}} sun gear within the first epicyclic gear assembly. Planet gears are held symmetrically about the sun gear by a planet <b>gear</b> <b>carrier</b> and are in mesh with both the sun gear and a ring gear. Two unidirectional clutches restrict rotation of the first planet <b>gear</b> <b>carrier</b> and ring gear to one direction. A connecting shaft drives a second sun gear at the same speed and direction as the first planet <b>gear</b> <b>carrier</b> while a connecting portion drives a second planet <b>gear</b> <b>carrier</b> at the same speed and direction as the first ring gear. The transmission's output is then transmitted by the second ring gear to the second shaft.

By gyroscopic complexity, we mean {{the possibility of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>carrier</b> to be a floating link as, for instance, in robotic gear wrists. Thanks to the new formulas herein deduced, the methods based on the graph representation of planetary spur gear trains have been extended to bevel gear trains. In particular, the well known Willis equation has been modified to maintain its validity for bevel gears. The modified Willis equation was then embodied in new power ratio expressions. Under our simplifying hypotheses of absence of friction and constant angular speeds, it is shown that gyroscopic torques do not enter into power flow analysis. Two numerical examples are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{cracks of}} {{considerable}} length {{were discovered in}} two separate main transmissions planetary <b>gear</b> <b>carrier</b> plates of U. S. Army helicopters.

A data analysis based on the Time Synchronous Averaging signal transformation tends to indicate that the apart from any machining error or material fault that may have initiated the crack; there is evidence of a non-rotating fault, possibly on the ring gear, as well as a considerable non-uniform distribution of forces among the planet gears that may have been generated by the presence of the crack and or may have promoted its rapid development...|$|E

30|$|A {{planetary}} gearbox typically consists of some key components: a sun gear, planet gear, ring <b>gear,</b> <b>carrier,</b> and bearing, and faults may occur in these components owing to fatigue or tough working conditions. According to a condition-monitoring report on wind turbines, a gearbox failure {{is the leading}} contributor to all wind turbine failures [3]. A vibration-based method was proven {{to be one of}} the most popular techniques in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, and it has been determined that certain changes to the vibration signals can be seen when a fault occurs, e.g., crack or spalling [4 – 6]. The commonly used vibration signal processing methods can be divided into three categories: time domain methods, frequency domain methods, and time–frequency domain methods. Time domain methods refer to the analysis of a signal with respect to time, and are relatively easy and direct compared to both frequency and time–frequency domain methods. Statistical indicators, the time synchronous averaging (TSA) method, and an autoregressive (AR) model are typically used in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery [4, 7 – 9]. Frequency domain methods refer to an analysis of the signals with respect to the frequency, and a periodic signal in the time domain can be converted into a frequency component through a Fourier transformation. In this way, researchers can identify the difference between the spectrum of a normal vibration signal and a fault vibration signal with commonly used methods that include a spectrum-based analysis, resonance demodulation technique, and cepstrum analysis [10 – 12]. In contrast, time–frequency domain methods are used to study a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously, allowing both the constituent frequency components and their time variation features to be revealed and analyzed. Researchers have developed various time–frequency domain methods including a short-time Fourier transformation, Wigner–Ville distribution, continuous wavelet transform, and Hilbert-Huang transformation [13 – 16]. Although vibration-based methods have been successfully used in the fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of rotating machinery, the appearance of faults in the analysis results has to be identified artificially, e.g., the identification of a fault characteristic frequency in the spectrum, the determination of a filter sub-band in a demodulation analysis, or the determination of a wavelet type, all of which require considerable of experience and expertise [17 – 19]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop some intelligent techniques that can automatically determine the health conditions of a {{planetary gearbox}}.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a hidden}} {{aspect of a}} firm's capital structure {{through the use of}} a real options application. It is applied to the US airline industry, characterized by over levered balance sheets, and one which on some estimates, has made zero cumulative profit taking the years of the last century together. The paper introduces the notion of "financial flexibility", defined as the freedom (or flexibility) enjoyed by a conservatively geared firm to respond quickly and secure positive NPV projects, as opposed to an over levered firm. This "flexibility" is then valued as a real option using a model based on arithmetic Brownian motion involving a path dependant option pricing framework. It analyses the implications of debt financing in the US airline industry and develops a capital structure model that incorporates the value of "financial flexibility" enjoyed by conservatively <b>geared</b> <b>carriers.</b> This model essentially balances the quantified value of financial flexibility enjoyed by conservatively <b>geared</b> <b>carriers</b> against the relevant cost of obtaining this flexibility (i. e. the cost of carrying a sub optimal capital structure) and factors in the implications of "fire sales" (Pulvino, 1998) which is specific to the US airline industry. In its application to South West Airlines the paper concludes that the optimal capital structure, if the value of financial flexibility is incorporated - should move closer to the origin. A methodology of integrating the value of financial flexibility into the traditional theories of capital structure is proposed and demonstrated that (at least) in the US airline industry, failure to do so can result in a significant misstatement in a firm's value and its optimal capital structure. This paper makes two key contributions to the existing body of academic literature. The notion of valuing financial flexibility as a real option has been introduced previously by Beneda and Nelson (2003). However their quantification of the option value is through a standard Black Scholes equation where the underlying assumptions of this are not valid in quantifying a real option of this nature and this chapter makes a modification of the standard Black Scholes equation to reflect reality. Furthermore the paper applies the concept of financial flexibility specifically to the US airline industry and develops a conjecture on how this can be incorporated into the traditional theories of capital structure which is another contribution to the academic literature...|$|R

50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} typically employ an {{epicyclic gear}} train having {{one or more}} stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied. In epicyclic gear systems, torque {{is applied to the}} input gear or ‘sun’ gear. A number of planet gears are arranged around and engaged with this sun gear, and therefore rotate. The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the planet gear teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the planet gears to orbit around the sun gear. The planet gears are held in a ‘planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft. As the planet gears orbit around the sun <b>gear,</b> the <b>carrier</b> and the output shaft rotate together. Without the reaction arm to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot apply torque.|$|R
