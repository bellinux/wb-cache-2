500|$|Although he {{remained}} on cordial terms with Senator Seward, Greeley never seriously considered supporting {{him in his}} bid for the Republican nomination for president. Instead, during {{the run-up to the}} 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he pressed the candidacy of former Missouri representative Edward Bates, an opponent of the spread of slavery who had freed his own slaves. In his newspaper, in speeches, and in conversation, Greeley pushed Bates as a man who could win the North and even make inroads in the South. [...] Nevertheless, when one of the dark horse candidates for the Republican nomination, Abraham Lincoln, came to New York to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>address</b> at Cooper Union, Greeley urged his readers to go hear Lincoln, and was among those who accompanied him to the platform. [...] Greeley thought of Lincoln as a possible nominee for vice president.|$|E
500|$|King Baudouin, {{representing}} Belgium, {{gave the}} first {{speech in which}} he praised the [...] "genius" [...] of his ancestor, King Leopold II, who begun the colonisation of the Congo on his own initiative in the 1880s. Baudouin depicted the end of colonial rule in the Congo as {{the culmination of the}} Belgian [...] "civilising mission" [...] and spoke of the close relations he hoped would be maintained between the two countries. The thousands of Congolese listening via loudspeakers outside the Palais were infuriated. Following the end of the King's speech, Kasa-Vubu gave a short and uncontroversial address thanking the King for his attendance and for his best wishes. Both speeches were applauded vigorously. In a change to the schedule, Joseph Kasongo, the President of the Chamber of Deputies who was presiding over the ceremonies, invited Lumumba to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>address</b> as Lumumba had requested him to do so.

60|$|At the Complimentary Dinner, Camden, New Jersey, May 31, 1889.--Walt Whitman said: My friends, though {{announced}} to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>address,</b> {{there is no}} such intention. Following the impulse of the spirit, (for I am at least half of Quaker stock) I have obey'd the command to come and look at you, for a minute, and show myself, face to face; which is probably the best I can do. But I have felt no command to make a speech; and shall not therefore attempt any. All I have felt the imperative conviction to say I have already printed in my books of poems or prose; to which I refer any who may be curious. And so, hail and farewell. Deeply acknowledging this deep compliment, with my best respects and love to you personally--to Camden--to New-Jersey, and to all represented here--you must excuse me from any word further.|$|E
