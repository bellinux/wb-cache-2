Then {{everyone}} started calling me Mr. Baby. Then I became Mr. Baby onstage. I had my own theme song and everything. <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> little eyeliner mustache. From there it changed into Mr. Lady, which just seemed like a good name for a queer label."

500|$|Lancashire {{states that}} she was never driven by the ideas of fame and status. Her {{background}} had inspired an initial interest in working behind the scenes in television. She did not give serious thought to the performing arts {{until the age of}} 18. After winning a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama— where her contemporaries included Shirley Henderson, Maggie O'Neill and Niamh Cusack— Lancashire realised that she enjoyed acting. She graduated in 1986, describing her time as a student there as [...] "tremendous" [...] but [...] "seriously hard work and quite intimidating". After rejection from several repertory theatre companies, Lancashire was given her first acting role by Howard Lloyd-Lewis, artistic director of the Manchester Library Theatre Company, which provided her with an Equity Card. Lancashire performed two plays with the company, Pacific Overtures and The Beauty Game, which she states formed [...] "the start of my career as an actor". She found her first professional acting experience [...] "terrifying" [...] {{as a result of the}} live audiences, recalling that, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> bathing costume in some of the scenes, I got heckled!" [...] She also realised that taking risks or underperforming could have had consequences for her acting career. Her role as Denise in The Beauty Game earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards.|$|E

According to her, she was chosen at the {{audition}} because [...] "Steve Barron wanted someone with really long legs, and <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> black bathing suit that he liked.

2500|$|Winter {{was born}} to John Winter II and Edwina Winter on December 28, 1946, in Beaumont, Texas. Both he {{and his older brother}} Johnny were born with albinism, and both were {{required}} to take special education classes in high school. Winter states, [...] "In school I had a lot of friends. <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> lot of white shirts to, like, blend in I guess. No one really gave me a hard time about being albino or taking special education classes. Then again, I wasn't really popular." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size {{are you in the}} waist and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E

In February 2012, Bassingthwaighte was announced as a Moomba Monarch alongside Harry Kewell, the Australian socceroo.

In September 2015, Bassingthwaighte reunited with her former band Rogue Traders, performing {{together for the first}} time in seven years, at a corporate show in Gold Coast. They later reunited again in December for a New Year's Eve show, where they hinted at the possibility of future shows, and confirmed that Bassingthwaighte's former replacement Mindi Jackson had given the band's reunion her blessing.|$|E
