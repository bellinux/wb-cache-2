2500|$|The {{numerous}} {{criticisms of}} significance testing do {{not lead to}} a single alternative. A unifying position of critics is that statistics should {{not lead to a}} conclusion or a decision but to a probability or to an estimated value with a confidence interval rather than to an accept-reject decision regarding a particular hypothesis. It is unlikely that the controversy surrounding significance testing will be resolved in the near future. Its supposed flaws and unpopularity do not eliminate the need for an objective and transparent means of reaching conclusions regarding studies that produce statistical results. Critics have not unified around an alternative. Other forms of reporting confidence or uncertainty could probably grow in popularity. One strong critic of significance testing suggested a list of reporting alternatives: <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>for</b> importance, prediction intervals for confidence, replications and extensions for replicability, meta-analyses for generality.
