He can't communicate with Augustus, and the promised supplies fail to arrive, so Pym runs out of water. In the course of his ordeal, he discovers a letter written in blood attached to his dog Tiger, warning Pym to remain hidden, as his life <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|A failed {{monetary}} policy can have significant detrimental effects on an {{economy and the}} society that <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> These include hyperinflation, stagflation, recession, high unemployment, shortages of imported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and {{the adoption of a}} much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Prolog is not purely declarative: {{because of}} {{constructs}} like the cut operator, a procedural reading of a Prolog program {{is needed to}} understand it. The order of clauses in a Prolog program is significant, as the execution strategy of the language <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Other logic programming languages, such as Datalog, are truly declarative but restrict the language. As a result, many practical Prolog programs are written to conform to Prolog's depth-first search order, rather than as purely declarative logic programs.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} leukocytes {{in the blood}} is often an {{indicator}} of disease, and thus the WBC count is an important subset of the complete blood count. The normal white cell count is usually between 4 × 109/L and 11 × 109/L. In the US this is usually expressed as 4,000 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. They make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult, making them substantially less numerous than the RBCs at 40% to 45%. However, this 1% of the blood makes a large difference to health, because immunity <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> An {{increase in the number}} of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis. It is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses, which happen frequently. It is occasionally abnormal, when it is neoplastic or autoimmune in origin. A decrease below the lower limit is called leukopenia. It weakens the immune system.|$|E
500|$|The {{quest for}} 'purity' was {{retained}} in the zerg psyche, becoming a pseudo-religious concept to them. Through the quest for 'perfection' the zerg were set on a steady state of evolution and conflict. The core idea of this 'religion' {{was that there was}} a state that the zerg could reach where they no longer needed to evolve, that their evolutionary form would never have to change again because they could already adapt to any situation. Abathur accepts that the Overmind's instinctive desire for [...] "true perfection" [...] is impossible for the zerg swarm to achieve, yet reasoned that [...] "...chasing perfection was tactically sound regardless." [...] Instead, Abathur believed it is [...] "purpose" [...] which makes the zerg strong. Abathur states that without an overriding will, [...] "feral zerg" [...] are lesser than beasts, much like he was after the death of the Overmind. Abathur is personally responsible for the continuation of the zerg-species. He undertakes each experiment as though the survival of the species <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> alone, and tolerates no genetic regression or evolutionary backstep. It is revealed in Heart of the Swarm that {{he was the one who}} designed the Queen of Blades.|$|E
