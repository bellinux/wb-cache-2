500|$|As in many estate settlements, Brodess's death {{increased}} {{the likelihood that}} Tubman would be sold and her family broken apart. His widow, Eliza, began working to sell the family's slaves. Tubman refused {{to wait for the}} Brodess family to decide her fate, despite her husband's efforts to dissuade her.

500|$|... "Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling {{with the fact that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> huge responsibility of how others would be affected through what I was doing or saying on stage. I don't want to put on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. I wanted to keep it real, but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E
500|$|Meyer left {{to write}} for The New Show in late 1983, a {{short-lived}} variety series from Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels. He shared an office with writer Jack Handey, whom he credited with giving him comedy advice. Following this, he joined the writing teams at Not Necessarily the News, and Saturday Night Live beginning in 1985. He later called working on SNL an [...] "exhilarating, frustrating, stressful, and indelible experience." [...] Meyer's work was not well regarded among the SNL writers and producers. He said: [...] "My stuff wasn't very popular at Saturday Night. It was regarded as really fringey, {{and a lot of}} times my sketches would get cut. Sometimes they would get cut after dress rehearsal, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> horrible experience of looking out and seeing a painter carefully touching up my set and getting it all ready to be smashed to pieces and sent to a landfill in Brooklyn. It was just a mismatch, although I didn't realize it at the time." [...] He left the show in 1987.|$|E

2500|$|I {{must say}} when I bowled at Len I {{felt a sense}} of {{personal}} grudge I have never known against any other batsman. [...] Ray did too. I suppose Len suffered a greater barrage from the two of us than any other player in the world.

2500|$|Maurice Vallery-Radot, {{grandson}} of {{the brother of}} the son-in-law of Pasteur and outspoken Catholic, also holds that Pasteur fundamentally remained Catholic. According to both Pasteur Vallery-Radot and Maurice Vallery-Radot, the following well-known quotation attributed to Pasteur is apocryphal: [...] "The more I know, the more nearly is my faith that of the Breton peasant. Could I but know all <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> faith of a Breton peasant's wife". According to Maurice Vallery-Radot, the false quotation appeared for the first time shortly after the death of Pasteur. However, despite his belief in God, {{it has been said that}} his views were that of a freethinker rather than a Catholic, a spiritual more than a religious man. He was also against mixing science with religion.|$|E

[...] McCreight received many endorsements including the National Council of American Indians of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and the Oglala Sioux Tribe representing “eight thousand and 300 Indians.” McCreight was not to receive the appointment and President Herbert Hoover chose Philadelphia financier Charles James Rhoads.
