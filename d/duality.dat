5|$|Historically, {{the first}} form of graph <b>duality</b> to be {{recognized}} was the association of the Platonic solids into pairs of dual polyhedra. Graph <b>duality</b> is a topological generalization of the geometric concepts of dual polyhedra and dual tessellations, and is in turn generalized algebraically by {{the concept of a}} dual matroid. Variations of planar graph <b>duality</b> include a version of <b>duality</b> for directed graphs, and <b>duality</b> for graphs embedded onto non-planar two-dimensional surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with its}} use in graph theory, the <b>duality</b> of planar graphs has {{applications}} in several other areas of mathematical and computational study.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the <b>duality</b> called the dS/CFT correspondence. This <b>duality</b> involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a <b>duality</b> is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E

5|$|Building on {{his results}} on matrix games {{and on his}} model of an {{expanding}} economy, von Neumann invented the theory of <b>duality</b> in linear programming, after George Dantzig described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient von Neumann asked him {{to get to the}} point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and <b>duality,</b> conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the term}} <b>duality</b> {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a <b>duality,</b> it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
40|$|Large N topological string <b>dualities</b> {{have led}} to a class of {{proposed}} open/closed <b>dualities</b> for superstrings. In the topological string context, the worldsheet derivation of these <b>dualities</b> has already been given. In this paper we take the first step in deriving the full ten-dimensional superstring <b>dualities</b> by showing how the <b>dualities</b> arise on the superstring worldsheet at the level of F terms. As part of this derivation, we show for F-term computations that the hybrid formalism for the superstring is equivalent to a ĉ = 5 topological string in ten-dimensional spacetime. Using the ĉ = 5 description, we then show that the D brane boundary state for the ten-dimensional open superstring naturally emerges on the worldsheet of the closed superstring dual. Octobe...|$|R

5|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{pointed out}} a <b>duality</b> symmetry between different components of the metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime, which maps solutions of Einstein's field equations to other solutions. This symmetry between the tt-component of the metric, which describes time as measured by clocks whose spatial coordinates do not change, and a term known as the twist potential {{is analogous to the}} aforementioned <b>duality</b> between E and B.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, several theorists {{generalized}} Montonen–Olive <b>duality</b> to the S-duality relationship, which connects different string theories. Ashoke Sen studied S-duality in {{the context}} of heterotic strings in four dimensions. Chris Hull and Paul Townsend showed that type IIB string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S-duality to the same theory with small coupling constant. Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This <b>duality</b> implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.|$|E
5|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal {{field theory}} correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena <b>duality</b> or gauge/gravity <b>duality,</b> is a conjectured relationship between {{two kinds of}} physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On {{the other side of}} the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles.|$|E

40|$|The Hori-Tong and Hori <b>dualities</b> are {{infrared}} <b>dualities</b> between two-dimensional gauge theories with N = (2, 2) supersymmetry, {{which are}} reminiscent of four-dimensional Seiberg <b>dualities.</b> We provide additional evidence for those <b>dualities</b> with U(N_c), USp(2 N_c), SO(N) and O(N) gauge groups, by matching correlation functions of Coulomb branch operators on a Riemann surface Σ_g, {{in the presence of}} the topological A-twist. The O(N) theories studied, denoted by O_+(N) and O_(N), can be understood as Z_ 2 orbifolds of an SO(N) theory.

5|$|In {{computational}} geometry, the <b>duality</b> between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations {{implies that}} any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa. The same <b>duality</b> {{can also be}} used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi diagrams for moving a set of points on a surface to more evenly spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves the mesh by making its triangles more uniformly sized and shaped.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is {{represented as a}} superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical <b>duality</b> called Pontryagin <b>duality.</b> Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E

He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a <b>duality</b> was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>duality</b> applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar <b>duality</b> gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E
