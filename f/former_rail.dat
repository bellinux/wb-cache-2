5|$|At {{the hamlet}} of Summerdale, NY430 curves to the northeast, {{generally}} following the <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> line into Mayville, a village {{situated at the}} northwestern tip of Chautauqua Lake. In {{the center of the}} village, NY430 intersects NY394 at an intersection that once was the eastern terminus of NY430. Now, however, NY430 continues northeast past NY394 and out of Mayville.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> lines in Melbourne and {{regional}} Victoria have {{been converted into}} rail trails, for walking, cycling and horse riding. These make excellent tracks for beginners as the lines were originally designed to avoid steep gradients. Most lines are still in public ownership. Some sections of the track are specially leased to neighbouring farmers for stock grazing. This reduces maintenance costs.|$|E
5|$|Canopy Development, a green {{development}} company from Northampton, Massachusetts, owns {{a portion of}} the <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> bed in Rosendale. It has agreed to establish a right-of-way, rerouting the trail to allow public access. Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be bypassed. The Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a $20,000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston. By the end of summer 2013, the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale-Kingston extension was opened to the public, completing the entire 23.7 mile rail trail.|$|E

5|$|Lethbridge is {{near the}} Lethbridge Airport and the CPR rail yards in Kipp, Alberta. The airport {{provides}} commercial flights to Calgary and Edmonton, as well as private and charter flights elsewhere. The airport provides customs services for flights arriving from the United States. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, {{just west of the}} city, from downtown Lethbridge in 1983. The yards were planned for redevelopment with a mix of multi-family residential, commercial and light industrial land uses. The Park Place Mall is now located on the portion of the <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> yards north of 1Avenue South between Scenic Drive to the west and Stafford Drive to the east.|$|E

Musikhuset is the largest concert hall in Scandinavia, with seating for more than 3,600 people. Other major music venues include VoxHall, rebuilt in 1999, and the associated venue of Atlas, Train nightclub at the harbourfront, and Godsbanen, a <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> freight station.|$|E
5|$|A {{project to}} convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access {{just south of the}} American River to a {{standard}} signalized intersection was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and future development in the area, including redevelopment of a <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> yard, while slowing northbound traffic heading for the bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south of Broadway into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street has carried northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans took it over. This will calm traffic while improving the intersection {{at the south end of}} the former one-way pair, which the RT Light Rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of. In addition, the three blocks of F Street that carried southbound SR 160 from 12th Street to 15th Street have been calmed by the addition of a roundabout at 13th Street.|$|E

25|$|The Barrackpore Trunk Road (B.T. Road), one of {{the oldest}} metal roads in India, connects Barrackpore to Kolkata. The Ghoshpara Road connects the city of Barrackpore with Kanchrapara, a town on the {{boundary}} of the subdivision, and goes on to link Barrackpore with the adjacent district of Nadia. Several bus routes originate from Barrackpore such as 78 and 85. Route number 78, MM 5, 81, 78/C/1, K9 and other state owned bus routes (C29, S32) connect Barrackpore with Kolkata. Route number 85 connects Barrackpore with Kanchrapara directly and JM8 up to Naihati. Barrackpore serves as the gateway to Kolkata and its suburbs. <b>Former</b> <b>Rail</b> Minister Mamata Banerjee announced the extension of metro-rail project to Barrackpore which was later shelved infinitely.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 2010, the Singapore and Malaysia governments {{agreed to}} move the Singapore {{terminus}} of the Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) from the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station in southern Singapore to Woodlands in northern Singapore. This resulted in the railway lines in Singapore becoming surplus as the Woodland terminus is just over the border from Malaysia. Government {{agencies such as the}} Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) have taken responsibility for developing and implementing ideas and activities for the <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> lands. The URA has a dedicated web site on Rail Corridor. An example of activities permitted include Street Art on a section of the disused railway, supported by the SLA, URA, Land Transport Authority and the National Arts Council (Singapore).|$|E
25|$|The Amboy Depot Museum has {{operated}} {{on the site}} since 2003. The museum encompasses much of the <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> yard that Illinois Central maintained at Amboy's Northern Division Headquarters for its Cairo to East Dubuque line. When the line was completed in 1855 it was the longest rail line in the world. The museum consists of three buildings with the Amboy Illinois Central Depot being its primary structure. Inside are exhibits and artifacts relating {{to the history of}} Amboy and Illinois Central Railroad. Palmer School is a restored one-room schoolhouse that was relocated to museum property during the 1990s from its original location west of Amboy. The other structure is the Amboy Illinois Central Freight House which was relocated to museum property in 2003 to prevent its planned demolition.|$|E

25|$|The park {{contains}} site-specific sculptures, railway ruins, gardens, a waterfront promenade, and a walkway. Portions of the <b>former</b> <b>rail</b> yard, {{such as the}} New York Central Railroad 69th Street Transfer Bridge, {{were incorporated}} into the new park. The transfer bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Nearly a dozen rail yard ruins, such as a burnt warehouse frame, were ultimately integrated into the park. As {{a reminder of the}} location's history, New York Central Railroad logos are engraved onto park benches. A block away, on West End Avenue, a privately owned park has a remnant of a stone wall, as a remaining part of the embankment that dated to 1847. Construction workers had unearthed the stones during construction in 1994; some stones were salvaged for the new park during the four-day construction hiatus for archaeological excavation.|$|E
