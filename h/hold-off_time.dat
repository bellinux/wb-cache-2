40|$|Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) {{have been}} used {{in a wide range of}} low light sensing {{applications}} such as DNA sequencing, quantum key distribution, LIDAR and medical imaging. To operate the APDs, control circuits are required to achieve the desired performance characteristics. This thesis presents the work on development of three control circuits including a bias circuit, an active quench and reset circuit and a gain control circuit all of which are used for control and performance enhancement of the APDs. The bias circuit designed is used to bias planar APDs for operation in both linear and Geiger modes. The circuit is based on a dual charge pumps configuration and operates from a 5 V supply. It is capable of providing milliamp load currents for shallow-junction planar APDs that operate up to 40 V. With novel voltage regulators, the bias voltage provided by the circuit can be accurately controlled and easily adjusted by the end user. The circuit is highly integrable and provides an attractive solution for applications requiring a compact integrated APD device. The active quench and reset circuit is designed for APDs that operate in Geiger-mode and are required for photon counting. The circuit enables linear changes in the <b>hold-off</b> <b>time</b> of the Geiger-mode APD (GM-APD) from several nanoseconds to microseconds with a stable setting step of 6. 5 ns. This facilitates setting the optimal `afterpulse-free 2 ̆ 7 <b>hold-off</b> <b>time</b> for any GM-APD via user-controlled digital inputs. In addition this circuit doesn’t require an additional monostable or pulse generator to reset the detector, thus simplifying the circuit. Compared to existing solutions, this circuit provides more accurate and simpler control of the <b>hold-off</b> <b>time</b> while maintaining a comparable maximum count-rate of 35. 2 Mcounts/s. The third circuit designed is a gain control circuit. This circuit is based on the idea of using two matched APDs to set and stabilize the gain. The circuit can provide high bias voltage for operating the planar APD, precisely set the APD’s gain (with the errors of less than 3...|$|E

In this paper we have {{introduced a new}} miniaturized photodetector front-end on a chip to be applied in a portable fNIRS system. It includes silicon avalanche photodiodes (SiAPD), Transimpedance am-plifier (TIA) front-end and Quench-Reset circuitry to operate in both linear and Geiger modes. So it can be applied for both continuous-wave fNIRS (CW-fNIRS) and also single-photon counting. Proposed SiAPD exhibits high-avalanche gain (> 100), low-breakdown voltage (< 12 V) and high photon detection efficiency accompanying with low dark count rates. The proposed TIA front-end offer a low power consumption (< 1 mW), high-transimpedance gain (up to 250 MV/A), tunable bandwidth (1 kHz- 1 GHz) and very low input and output noise (~few fA/√Hz and few µV/√Hz).

40|$|Abstract—Economic {{sustainability}} of the ever-increasing traffic requirements {{is built on}} the cost reduction of IP-over-WDM backbone networks. These networks are composed {{of a set of}} IP routers connected via all-optical circuits (or lightpaths), bypassing intermediate nodes, thanks to reconfigurable optical equipment. Today, traffic survivability is ensured by over-dimensioning the IP layer and using some IP/MPLS fast convergence/reroute mechanism, without making use of the reconfigurability of the optical layer. In this paper, we provide algorithms to dimension an IP-over-WDM network under two different resilience schemes: IP restoration and optical-followed-by-IP restoration. In both cases, the IP routing is controlled by an OSPF-like algorithm. In the optical-followed-by-IP restoration, OSPF reactions to failures are delayed by appropriately setting the OSPF <b>hold-off</b> timer, giving <b>time</b> to lightpath restoration attempts to be completed. We evaluate the performance, in terms of bandwidth requirements and traffic survivability, of these two resilience schemes. Our tests show that optical-followed-by-IP restoration is a cost-efficient alternative to IP restoration, still improving traffic survivability in most cases, without any degree of over-dimensioning. Results were obtained using the open-source Net 2 Plan tool, and source code is available on the website.

40|$|Single-photon {{detectors}} {{based on}} avalanche photodiodes (SPAD) are {{key elements of}} many modern highly sensitive optical systems. One of the bottlenecks of such detectors is a afterpulsing effect which limits a detection rate and requires an optimal <b>hold-off</b> <b>time.</b> In this letter we propose a novel approach for statistical analysis of SPAD dark counts and we demonstrate its usefulness for the search of the experimental condition where the afterpulsing effect can be strongly eliminated. This approach exploits a sequence of ranked time intervals between the dark counts and does not contain a complex mathematical analysis of the experimental data.

Working in gated-mode at 225 K with 5 V excess bias, this detector shows very low afterpulsing, hence the <b>hold-off</b> <b>time</b> can be set as low as a few microseconds, thus allowing high photon-counting rates (towards 1 Mcps). The timing response has a full-width at half maximum of less than 90 ps and a full-width at 1 / 1000 of maximum of less than 450 ps, thanks to a very fast (30 ps) exponential tail, thus allowing extremely wide dynamic ranges in time-correlated single photon counting measurements. Furthermore, such InGaAs/InP SPAD shows good photon detection efficiency ({>}{ 25 %} at 1550 nm and 40 % at 1000 nm) at a moderately low dark count rate, below 100 kcps for a 25 mu{rm m} active-area diameter detector.

Critical parameters such as excess reverse bias voltage, <b>hold-off</b> <b>time</b> and optimum operating temperature have been experimentally determined for these photon-counting devices. The photon detection probability, dark count rate and afterpulsing probability have been measured under different operating conditions. An active-quench circuit (AQC) is presented for operating these GM-APDs. This circuit is relatively simple, robust and has such benefits as reducing average power dissipation and afterpulsing. Arrays of these GM-APDs have already been designed and together with AQCs open up the possibility of having a solid-state microarray detector that enables parallel analysis on a single chip. Another advantage of these GM-APDs over current technology is their low voltage CMOS compatibility which could allow for the fabrication of an AQC on the same device.

In this paper, we describe an InGaAs/InP SPAD with monolithically integrated resistor that is fully {{compatible with the}} planar fabrication process and provides a significant reduction of the avalanche charge and, thus, of afterpulsing and optical crosstalk. In {{order to have a}} fast SPAD reset (< 50 ns), we fabricated quenching resistors ranging from 10 to 200 k, smaller than what is available in the literature. The resistor, fabricated with the zinc diffusions already used for avoiding premature edge-breakdown, promptly reduces the avalanche current to a low value ∼ 100 μ A in less than 1 ns, while an active circuit completes the quenching and enforces a well-defined hold-off. The proposed mixed-quenching approach guarantees an avalanche charge reduction of more than 20 times compared with similar plain SPADs, enough to reduce the <b>hold-off</b> <b>time</b> down to 1 μ s.

Gating mode is an effective approach to synchronous single-photon detection. Increasing gating frequency and reducing module size are important challenges {{for the design of}} such detector system.

40|$|We designed, {{fabricated}} {{and tested}} a new planar InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD).

The detector has a separate absorption, charge and multiplication structure, with double p-type Zn diffusion into n-type InP for defining the p-n high-field avalanching junction. The SPAD can be operated at temperatures achievable with thermoelectric coolers mounted in compact packages (like TO- 8). When operated in gated mode with 5 V excess bias, the 25 μm active area diameter InGaAs/InP SPAD reaches good performance at 225 K: i) photon detection efficiency of 40 % at 1 μm and 25 % at 1. 55 μm; ii) dark count rate below 100 kcps (counts per second); iii) low afterpulsing allowing {{to set a}} <b>hold-off</b> <b>time</b> as short as 1 μs, corresponding to 1 Mcps; iv) timing jitter less than 90 ps (full width at half maximum) and time constant of decaying tail of just 30 ps.

30|$|In synopsis, in this paper, we have {{investigated}} the performance of an improved VHO reputation model based on a reputation system proposed in [7] and extended by the GM(1, 1) algorithm. In comparing the proposed algorithm vs. the original model {{with respect to a}} single node and a network ecosystem, clear improvements can be seen in both situations. From a single-mobile-node perspective, there is an advanced warning of network degradation and an increased <b>hold-off</b> <b>time</b> during surge in network load, preventing needless handovers. From a network perspective, the proposed model reduces the number of handovers between heterogeneous networks under rapid congestion scenarios, allowing the traffic to be well balanced in the ecosystem. In gradually varying network conditions, the prediction model will have a much diminished impact on the overall number of handovers so long as the target network is providing a sufficient quality of service. Furthermore, as in the single-mobile-node case, it reduces the number of handovers during sudden reductions in traffic, diminishing the possibility of a handovers when the network has not yet stabilized. Our future work includes exploring the advantages of using this enhanced model in comparison with MADM and artificial intelligence solutions, investigating the benefit of using other grey model systems such as the grey residual error correction model, and reducing the amount of score noise observed in the results.|$|E

The main requirements are: i) high detection efficiency; ii) low noise; iii) high count rate; iv) low timing jitter. Different technologies are currently available for single-photon detection at 1550 nm, but semiconductor devices (like Single-Photon Avalanche Diode, SPAD) offer a photon detection efficiency that is inherently higher than any photocathode employed in vacuum tube detectors. Additionally InGaAs/InP SPADs can detect single photons at 1550 nm with low noise when moderately cooled by means of thermo-electric coolers. Consequently, InGaAs/InP SPAD can be the enabling technology of practical quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, provided that the maximum count rate is increased above 1 Mcps.
