5000|$|In {{addition}} to being shaken and served [...] "up" [...] like other cocktails, margaritas can also be served as a blended ice slush similar to other tropical-inspired mixed drinks like the hurricane or piña colada. This variant {{is known as a}} frozen margarita. The ingredients can be poured over crushed ice <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kitchen <b>blender,</b> <b>or</b> for larger establishments that serve many of these, a large quantity of a [...] "house recipe" [...] of frozen margarita can be kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> machine designed specifically for the purpose (but also commonly used to serve non-alcoholic slush drinks); a cylinder leading to a pour spout is kept below freezing temperature, but an impeller within the cylinder constantly churns the mix so it can't freeze solid, and so it dispenses as a thick half-frozen slush. The first frozen margarita machine was invented on May 11, 1971, by Dallas restaurateur Mariano Martinez. The machine was originally a soft-serve ice cream machine and now sits in the Smithsonian National Museum of History.|$|R

Many fast food outlets do not make shakes by hand with ice cream. Instead, they make shakes in automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a premade milkshake mixture consisting of milk, a sweetened flavoring agent, and a thickening agent. However, some fast food outlets still follow the traditional method, and some serve milkshakes which are prepared by blending soft-serve ice cream (or ice milk) with flavoring or syrups. Milkshakes can also be made {{at home with a}} blender or automatic drink mixer.|$|E
5000|$|Manteiga de garrafa is a {{dairy product}} {{made from the}} cream of cows' milk. The cream is {{processed}} by physical agitation, as <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> beating by hand, followed by cooking at a temperature of 100 C to 130 C. Salt may also be added. Some recipes for making manteiga de garrafa include a step prior to cooking in which the congealed cream is washed in cold water. The cooking process separates the cream into two components, the manteiga (butter) and the [...] "borra" [...] (a watery precipitate). The manteiga is separated from the borra by filtration, and then placed in bottles. The finished product is almost pure fat, with a low water activity. Accordingly, it is inhospitable to microbial growth and can be kept at room temperature.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{prepared}} {{at least a}} day or more in advance by braising or simmering a piece of veal from the back leg called Eye Round, which is then cut into thin, individual servings. For the sauce, originally fresh white tuna (in most restaurants canned tuna is used today to reduce cost and preparation time) is simmered until fully cooked in white wine, cider vinegar, white onion and garlic, and then puréed with a mix of olive and vegetable oil and egg yolks <b>in</b> <b>an</b> electric <b>blender</b> <b>or</b> food processor to form a thick mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. The thick, smooth purée is then somewhat thinned with a little water and cooking liquid from the veal and a few capers are stirred in. Some of the sauce is spread out on a serving platter and the cold slices of veal are arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single layer on top. The rest of the sauce is then poured over the veal so that it is, generally, completely covered. The dish is allowed to refrigerate for a period up to 5 days to fully develop the flavor.|$|R
