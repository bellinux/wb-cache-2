50|$|The {{foreign debt}} {{of the country}} reached its peak in 2003 with an {{outstanding}} US$57.6 billion, {{which is more than}} the combined borrowings of the last two governments. According to the Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC) In a span of 14 years, the Aquino, Ramos, and Estrada administrations contracted a total of Php1.51 trillion in debts, Php2.03 trillion less than what Arroyo has borrowed in her first six years in office. Under Arroyo, the FDC estimates that based on 2007 interest and principal payments, taxpayers carry a <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>burden</b> of Php1.2 million every minute. Today, the FDC adds, every Filipino man, woman, and child owes creditors Php42,819.42. This eventually led to a state of fiscal crisis due to the huge amount of the deficit, as admitted by President Arroyo in 2004. As a response to this crisis, the option of an automatic appropriation policy that would allocate funds for debt service payments was questioned.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} factors {{responsible for}} low public sector human capital investment in Pakistan. The <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>burden</b> {{coupled with a}} rising debt stock can impact on human capital expenditure. To account for this, a Debt Net Cost Index is developed to measure the evolving net cost of public debt starting in 1960. Political factors examined are regime type, frequency of elections, quality of democracy, international aid preferences, elite capture in terms of industrial concentration, military burden and external hostility indices. We find that for the period as a whole from 1960 onwards, political factors dominate economic explanations such as the burden of debt servicing in accounting for low levels of human development expenditure. Only during episodes of civilian rule do economic factors {{in the form of}} the <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>burden</b> become salient. This is because civilian governments are often saddled with inherited debt from earlier military rulers. Pakistan's military regimes have been less resource constrained because of greater external flows, allowing them to spend more on everything, but the rise in human development expenditures was less than proportional to the rise in available resources...|$|E

By fitting a production function model to annual data for the period 1980 - 2011, the study examines the dynamic effect of debt service, capital stock and labour force on the economic growth of the country. By following Cunningham (1993), it has identified the long-run and short-run causal relationships among the included variables.

Similarly, the estimated error correction term shows the existence of a significant long-run causal relationship among the specified variables.

However, external borrowing requires fixed payments independent of the actual return on the invested funds. If a country either invests the money inefficiently or is subject to unexpected difficulties, {{it may not be}} able to meet contracted service payments. Potential debt servicing problems have existed for many years, and recently, the actual occurrence of service interruptions has become more frequent. Despite the difficulty of servicing debt, it is optimal, in an economic sense, for selected Arab countries to borrow from abroad. Foreign capital goods are usually scarce in the selected countries, so their productivity is relatively high. External borrowing allows more imports of capital without forcing down consumption. As long as the productivity of the capital exceeds its cost, debt servicing problems should not arise. A study of three Arab countries indicates that, real GDP growth can be increased through external borrowing. However, a higher level of debt raises the likelihood of debt servicing difficulties. Even when the use of debt is efficient, a heavier debt burden makes these selected Arab countries more susceptible to unexpected shocks. However, if GDP growth is not overly ambitious, the <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>burden</b> stabilizes and may eventually begin to decline. The greatest danger arises when future debt servicing requirements are ignored. A sharp increase in external debt may allow high GDP growth in the short run, but eventually the resulting debt service will become unsustainable. This study therefore, examines the impact of external debt on economic growth and external debt service on investment in three Arab countries from the middle income group in North Africa over the period 1982 - 2005. This study employs developed Chowdhury growth and investment models to determine the impact of external debt on economic growth during the period after the debt crisis. Moreover, a single equation model is inappropriate to analyze the relationship between external loans, economic growth, debt servicing and investment due to there being a circular relationship among them and other macroeconomic variables. Therefore, if only the output equation or investment equation are estimated, this is likely to understate the impact of external debt on economic growth. In addition, the relationship between external debt, investment and economic growth is not a simple one for a number of reasons. Firstly, the relationship between external debt, debt servicing, investment and economic growth, both indirectly and directly, must be viewed in terms of their impact on domestic savings and exports. Secondly, a complex relationship exists between external debt servicing and economic growth. Therefore, this study uses two equations to investigate the impact of external debt on economic growth and external debt service on investment in three Arab countries (Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco using a macro econometric model estimated for the period 1982 - 2005. The empirical findings reveal that external debt does not affect growth directly. The results indicate that external debt affects investment positively and is statistically significantly indicating external debt in selected countries encourages investment rather than depresses it. The findings of this research are consistent with the economic theory that external loans stimulate economic growth in less developed countries. Therefore, investment plays a very important role in the growth of selected Arab countries‟ economies. Furthermore, the result also confirms that there is no sign of a crowding out effect through which external debt service is hypothesized to affect investment. The important finding that external debt tends to have a relationship with investment and growth suggests that relying on external debt to enhance economic growth is a good policy. In addition, these countries need to supplement their lack of domestic saving with external loans and other forms of foreign capital such as foreign direct investment...|$|E

40|$|Debt {{burden ratio}} as {{measured}} on the aggregate level {{does not give}} an adequate assessment of {{the ability of the}} household sector to repay its debt. The low level of financial deepening in Poland is primarily reflected in a low percentage of households that have been granted a loan. Therefore, the average debt burden for households, which have any debt outstandings could be much higher than the one measured on the aggregate level. If the debt is concentrated among groups of households with lower incomes, it can threat the financial stability in case of FX or interest rate shocks. Using the data from Polish Households Budget Survey we first define three different measures of debt burden and calculate its dispersion in time and distribution among income groups. We find that (1) the total <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> <b>burden</b> and loan <b>service</b> <b>burden</b> ratios are on lower levels than in other European countries and recently have not risen substantially, (2) the mortgage <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> <b>burden</b> ratio has been rapidly increasing {{in the last four years}} especially in lower income groups of households reaching in 2004 the 3 / 4 of the level noted in EU- 15. In comparison with EU it seems that the level of indebtedness of house- holds in Poland is on a secure level. However, we notice that the secure level of debt burden ratio is on a lower level in emerging market countries than in wealthier countries because of the higher share of basic living costs in total consumption expenditure. Therefore, the increasing levels of mortgage <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> ratios in lower-income groups could pose a potential threat to the financial stability in case of FX or interest rate shock. ...|$|R

A commonly used measure of household indebtedness is the household <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> ratio (formerly known as the household <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> <b>burden),</b> published since 1980 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

The ratio for homeowners, which may summarize the effects of the recent refinancing boom on the financial obligations of homeowners, has risen gradually over the past decade; the ratio for renters has risen more steeply.

By synthesizing a relationship between budget deficits and external debt the study shows the implications on economic growth of conducting a fiscal policy within the contexts of debt stabilization and debt sustainability. The results of the econometric analysis confirm the existence of the debt Laffer curve and the nonlinear effects of external debt on growth in Nigeria. The study concludes that if debt-financed budget deficits are operated in order to stabilize the debt ratio at the optimum sustainable level debt overhang problems would be avoided and the benefits of external borrowing would be maximized. <b>Debt</b> Overhang, <b>Debt</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Burden,</b> <b>Debt</b> Sustainability, Debt Stabilization, External Debt, Optimal Debt Stock, Economic Growth, Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The two {{essays in}} my {{dissertation}} clarify {{the role of}} household debt and housing wealth in the U. S. economy because the effect of household debt and house prices on economic activity is conflicting based on existing empirical literature. In my first essay, Three Competing Effects of Expansion in Housing Finance on Consumption, I explicitly consider both <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> <b>burden</b> and wealth risk by adjusting income data with <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> and wealth data with its risk. Based on split-sample estimates of various consumption functions with different time horizons together with the data adjustment, I find that expansion in housing finance since the mid 1980 s has three competing effects on consumption. First, housing finance expansion decreases the sensitivity of a household‟s consumption response to short-run and medium-run movements in income via a relaxed credit constraint. Second, {{an increase in the}} liquidity of housing wealth leads to a bigger response of consumption to changes in house prices. However, this increased housing wealth effect can be mitigated or magnified from the last competing effect of increased <b>debt</b> <b>service,</b> depending on the directions of movements in house prices and interest rates. Thus, the net effect of expanded housing finance on consumption depends on the relative magnitudes of the three competing effects in the face of movements in income, house prices, and interest rates...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} pervasive regulation in the financial system on the economy, in general, and on private investment activity, in particular. A survey of the relevant literature concentrates {{on the issue of}} the arguments for, and against, financial deregulation. A macroeconomic growth model is analysed which focuses on the implications of an abrupt rise in the (private) <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> <b>burden,</b> following a removal of interest rate ceilings. Subsequently, selected models of investment are estimated on Greek annual data covering the period 1958 - 1985. The aim of the empirical work is to detect the effects of the elaborate controls imposed on the Greek banking system. (The possibility of such effects, and associated policy implications, were discussed in the preceding, theoretical, part of the thesis.) Particular effort has been expended to generate the appropriate series required for the estimations, especially those relating to the fiscal factors which influence investment behaviour. The empirical results reveal the important role of policy induced financial rationing in the determination of aggregate investment in Greece...|$|R
