However, such form-changing operation would lead to about 500 MPa stress range for the cable-net structure. Such stress range is nearly twice as much of that defined by the relative standard. So the cable-net structure is the most critical and <b>expendable</b> <b>part</b> of FAST reflector system. So, the service life of FAST would directly depend on the residual fatigue life of its cable-net structure. The present paper would {{make an effort to}} find a more appropriat...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In many scenarios, {{particularly}} in military and emergency response operations, mobile nodes {{that are in}} close proximity to each other exhibit a high degree of data affinity. For example, all soldiers in the same region, regardless of their specialty, will want to know all nearby threats, as well as all friendly assets. Since relaying queries to a distant server is costly in terms of bandwidth and battery power, it would be ideal to use local resources that are only a hop away. In this paper we propose a shared spatial cache that {{can be thought of as}} residing in a region rather than in any given node. Each node that participates in the cache holds an <b>expendable</b> <b>part</b> of the data, so that the loss of any node or small group of nodes can be tolerated with little or no degradation of service. We describe the analytical models that verify our claims and show the results of extensive simulations that validate our models under simulated but realistic conditions. I...|$|R

50|$|Classic rallies try {{to relive}} {{some of the}} great events of the 1960s and 1970s when man and machine were often alone for hours, even days, with little support. Cars now have <b>expendable</b> <b>parts</b> and a gearbox can be changed in twenty minutes. On the long tough rallies of yesteryear drivers had to drive 3000 km {{exclusively}} up and down the French Alps, against the clock for most of the way, and look after the gearbox and every other part of the car, since changing them was impossible. Liège-Sofia-Liège, for example, being almost a flat out drive from Belgium to Bulgaria and back, through the roughest roads the length of Yugoslavia and over the difficult passes like the Gavia and the Vivione in Italy. Service was wherever the service crews could reach and was usually limited to a change of tires, refueling and, if the team was lucky, only minor repairs, since any time used for service had to be made up on the road by the driver.|$|E

Additionally, unnecessary use of the absolute gravimeter should be reduced to save {{wear and tear on}} its <b>expendable</b> <b>parts.</b> In the near future, instead ofusing a gPhone underground, an equivalent (and inexpensive) borehole gravimeter should be developed and installed. If such a borehole gravimeter were incorporated into a device such as a multi-component borehole instrument (Ishii et al., 2002), the cost of each observation item would decrease. Furthermore, if the borehole device housing the gravimeter were adopted as part of a nationwide observation infrastructure, such as Hi-net (Obara et al., 2005), many observation environments would become available without requiring the construction of local hydrological models, thus enabling the correction of the inland-water gravity effect. Such a gravity monitoring system would contribute not only to geophysical applications, but also to monitoring at geothermal power stations and geological disposal sites.|$|E

Batch was {{replaced}} mid-season by Ty Detmer whom the Cleveland Browns received a fourth round pick for, but had already planned to cut him. Detmer immediately came in {{as a starter}} only to throw seven INT's against his former team. Batch was eventually released by the Lions that offseason for stated salary cap reasons, but was understood by all to be for personality conflicts with Millen. Batch had been deemed <b>expendable</b> due in <b>part</b> to the team's drafting of Joey Harrington with their first-round pick, and Millen had gone on record in his desire to find a starting quarterback other than Batch earlier that year. Still, Batch passed for over 9,000 yards with Detroit, reaching sixth on the Lions' all-time list. Ironically, Batch would ultimately last longer in the NFL than Harrington, who {{would prove to be}} a draft bust and was out of the NFL by 2009.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{initiation}} {{distance is}} the distance separating predator and prey when escape begins. The optimal flight initiation distance occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which {{depends on the}} prey 2 ̆ 7 s initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk. In current optimal escape theory, prey die when contacted by a predator. We explore effects of variable lethality, L, the probability of being killed on contact. Optimal flight initiation distance increases as lethality increases, matching expectations that prey should not flee when contact entails no fitness loss but should be increasingly wary as expected fitness loss on contact increases. Addition of lethality improves the ability of optimal escape theory to predict effects of factors affecting escape ability. Autotomy, the voluntary shedding of tails or other <b>expendable</b> <b>parts</b> as a last-ditch defense to permit escape, provides an example. After autotomy, running speed decreases in many prey, lethality increases because autotomy cannot be used again until the lost part has regenerated, and ability to obtain benefits may decrease due to reduced social status and foraging ability. These changes favor longer flight initiation distance but lowered initial fitness after autotomy has the opposite effect. Optimal escape theory including a lethality term clarifies how autotomy may lead to increase or decrease in flight initiation distance depending on the balance of its multiple effects. Effects of additional factors that may alter multiple parameters of the model, including age, sex, reproductive condition, injury, disease, and parasitism are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The valve {{and seat}} in modern mud pumps {{for oil and}} gas well {{drilling}} are <b>expendable</b> pump <b>parts.</b> New types of valve with a damper chamber without rubber or polyurethane seal and with metal-to-metal contact area and heavy-duty load bearing capacity have been elaborated [1]. Lighter weight body of plate characterizes this design. In comparison with the valve of ordinary construction a valve with a damper chamber contains additional struc-tural elements, which in the moment of setting on of the plate forms the chamber of the pro-moted pressure between a seat and plate. It is considered that application of damper cham-ber will decrease the shock loadings or “hammer-effect ” at the setting of plate. However, for development of reliable working construction it is necessary to resolve next basic problems: – to calculate the optimum size of clearances in damper chamber, – to define speed of landing of plate at the entrance in a damper chamber, – to overcome hydroabrasive wear in the clearances of damper chamber as a result of high speeds of mud flow. It is possible to resolve first two problems by the mathematical model of work of mud pump valve with a damper chamber. For possibility of resolving of mathematical model it is necessary to define the coefficient of discharge in valve by the computer design of fluid flow, as a nonlinear function depending on the height of getting up of plate above a seat. The computer three-dimensional parametric model of valve with a damper chamber has been developed for the valve assembly No. 7 of triplex single action pump. A paramet-ric model gives a possibility to change the height of getting up of plate H and the geometri-cal parameters of seat and plate and clearances in damper chamber. By a programmatic complex CosmosFlowWorks®, which will realize the finite ele-ment method for the tasks of hydrogasdynamics the value of speeds of stream and pressure was calculated in the area of landing of plate (Fig. 1).

40|$|Service {{and spare}} part {{logistics}} has experienced an increased interest throughout the last decade, as it comprises {{a large share}} of companies’ turnover and companies have realized the strategic value of having effective after-sales. Saab AB provides the Swedish Armed Forces with service and maintenance of twenty helicopters mainly based at Malmen air base, Linköping. To provide great service, spare parts need to be kept in stock. Numerous spare parts are expensive, desirably kept on a low inventory level and sent to repair shops throughout the world when broken. These spare parts are identified as repairables and together with an irregular and low demand, inventory control of these spare parts is difficult. This has led to the purpose of this thesis: “Develop a method for determination of repairable inventory levels with regards to costs and helicopter availability, and suggest suitable repairable inventory levels for Saab Support Solutions Malmen. ” Relevant theoretical theories within this field was identified as among others; Delivery service, Inventory control of spare parts, Forecasting spare parts, Inventory control of repairables and Cannibalization, the act of robbing components between helicopters. The existing theories, especially regarding inventory control of repairables shows the difficulties with applying existing inventory control models for businesses within the same field but with different prerequisites. Relevant parameters affecting repairables inventory levels within Saab’s business was then identified based on the inventory control theories. The study was limited to investigate 19 repairables, since this simplified the extent of the study by limiting the range but still provided a sufficient foundation to base conclusions on. The repairables were chosen because they fulfilled one or several of the conditions to; be very expensive, have long lead times or have experienced many stock outs. The study was divided into three parts for further investigation; what helicopter availability is, how factors except repairables affect helicopter availability and how repairables affect availability and costs. These areas formed main questions, a basis for mapping and analysis questions formed in order {{to find a way to}} fulfill the study’s purpose. In order to achieve credibility, the study’s execution was continuously documented. Information needed to answer the mapping and analysis questions was gathered mainly through interviews with key personnel at Saab and the Swedish Armed Forces and through IT-systems used by the two parties. Some facts proved to be easily accessed and highly valuable to the study, while other information was unavailable. During the study, it was identified that Saab and Försvaret’s view on helicopter availability differ in several aspects. They do not fully agree on when a helicopter is available, or who is responsible when a helicopter is unavailable. Both stakeholders may benefit from a closer relation and a common view on helicopter availability. Saab should control their repairable inventory to cover for 3000 yearly helicopter flight hours used by Försvaret, but be prepared to cover for approximately 4000 yearly flight hours. This study further concluded that helicopter availability is only slightly affected by factors other than repairables. <b>Expendable</b> spare <b>parts</b> are usually kept in stock due to their relative low costs and therefore only slightly affect the availability. Overhaul needed on the helicopters do affect the availability, but is hard to improve and will have the same impact almost regardless of used flight hours. The largest improvements can be done by improving repairables inventory levels, to a point when inventory stockouts do not occur and cannibalizations is unnecessary. viThis is however a tradeoff between cost and repairable availability and has to be discussed between Försvaret and Saab, as well as the acceptable level of cannibalization. This study concluded that it is impossible to calculate optimal repairable inventory levels given the conditions in this study. Repairable inventory levels can however be estimated, and procedures how Saab as well as similar businesses can proceed is presented. The study however presents how to estimate suitable inventory levels for operations similar to the studied business of Saab Support Solutions Malmen. The negative impacts of cannibalization are impossible to anticipate, and both Försvaret and Saab stated that zero cannibalizations are preferable. This study further concluded that the costs of keeping inventory to cover for repairable fail variations and prevent all cannibalizations would need to be unreasonable high. Therefore, repairables inventory levels was suggested for four different scenarios. The scenarios was combinations of 3000 and 4000 yearly flight hours used by Försvaret, together with almost zero cannibalizations and an ABC-classification of repairables that allows cannibalizations comparable to today’s levels. The final responsibility to agree upon appropriate repairable inventory levels is incumbent Saab and Försvaret...|$|R
