50|$|A {{dislocation}} {{that has}} been brought to a halt by an obstacle (a point defect) can overcome the obstacle and start moving again by a process called <b>dislocation</b> <b>climb.</b> For <b>dislocation</b> <b>climb</b> to occur, vacancies {{have to be able}} to move through the crystal. When a vacancy arrives at the place where the dislocation is stuck it can cause the dislocation to climb out of its glide plane, after which the point defect is no longer in its way. <b>Dislocation</b> <b>climb</b> is therefore dependent from the velocity of vacancy diffusion. As with all diffusion processes, this is highly dependent on the temperature. At higher temperatures dislocations will more easily be able to move around obstacles. For this reason, many hardened materials become exponentially weaker at higher temperatures.|$|E

The process of a vacancy being absorbed at the boundary of a half plane of atoms, rather than created, is known as negative climb. Since <b>dislocation</b> <b>climb</b> results from individual atoms [...] "jumping" [...] into vacancies, climb occurs in single atom diameter increments.|$|E

A gradual change from a edge-type to screw-type dislocations is found with decreasing temperature. It was found that edge <b>dislocations</b> undergo <b>climb</b> at high temperatures.

40|$|When {{a current}} flows in a conductor, the {{electron}} wind can cause atoms to diffuse. This paper considers {{the consequences of}} such diffusion along dislocation cores. A <b>dislocation</b> <b>climbing</b> in a crystal {{is viewed as a}} non-equilibrium thermodynamic system to define the force that drives self-diffusion along the core. Not only is a dislocation a mass-transport pipe, it also climbs and generates more dislocations—all in the electron wind. A prismatic loop climbs like a rigid disk, as atoms electro-migrate along the core from one edge of the loop to the other. Each loop is therefore a mass carrier responding to an electric current. Interstitial and vacancy loops can be simultaneously generated and subsequently climb in the opposite directions. The process can transport mass in single crystal or bamboo-like interconnects at moderate temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Plastic prestraining {{was applied}} to a solder {{interconnect}} to introduce internal defects such as dislocations in order to investigate the interaction of dislocations with electromigration damage. Above a critical prestrain, Bi interfacial segregation to the anode, {{a clear indication of}} electromigration damage in SnBi solder interconnect, was effectively prevented. Such an inhibiting effect is apparently contrary to the common notion that dislocations often act as fast diffusion paths. It is suggested that the dislocations introduced by plastic prestraining acted as sinks for vacancies in the early stage of the electromigration process, but as the vacancies accumulated at the <b>dislocations,</b> <b>climb</b> of those <b>dislocations</b> prompted recovery of the deformed samples under current stressing, greatly decreasing the density of dislocation and vacancy in the solder, leading to slower diffusion of Bi atoms...|$|R
50|$|Creep {{occurs when}} a {{material}} is held under levels of stress below their yield stress that causes plastic deformation over time. This is especially prevalent when a material is exposed to high stresses at elevated temperatures, because diffusion and dislocation motion occur more rapidly. Irradiation can cause creep due to the interaction between stress {{and the development of}} the microstructure. In this case, the increase in diffusivities due to high temperatures is not a very strong factor for causing creep. The dimensions of the material are likely to increase {{in the direction of the}} applied stress due to the creation of dislocation loops around defects that formed due to radiation damage. Furthermore, applied stress can allow interstitials to be more readily absorbed in dislocation, which assists in <b>dislocation</b> <b>climb.</b> When dislocations are able to climb, excess vacancies are left, which can also lead to swelling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second and}} third {{generation}} superalloys introduced about 3 and 6 weight per cent Rhenium, for increased temperature capability. Re is a slow diffuser and typically partitions to the γ matrix, decreasing the rate of diffusion (and thereby high temperature creep) and improving high temperature performance and increasing service temperatures by 30 °C and 60 °C in {{second and third}} generation superalloys, respectively. Re {{has also been shown}} to promote the formation of rafts of the γ' phase (as opposed to cuboidal precipitates). The presence of rafts can decrease creep rate in the power-law regime (controlled by <b>dislocation</b> <b>climb),</b> but can also potentially increase the creep rate if the dominant mechanism is particle shearing. Furthermore, Re tends to promote the formation of brittle TCP phases, which has led to the strategy of reducing Co, W, Mo, and particularly Cr. Younger generations of Ni-based superalloys have significantly reduced Cr content for this reason, however with the reduction in Cr comes a reduction in oxidation resistance. Advanced coating techniques are now used to offset the loss of oxidation resistance accompanying the decreased Cr contents. [...] Examples of second generation superalloys include PWA1484, CMSX-4 and René N5. Third generation alloys include CMSX-10, and René N6. Fourth, Fifth, and even Sixth generation superalloys have been developed which incorporate Ruthenium additions, making them more expensive still than the prior generation's Re-containing alloys. The effect of Ru on the promotion of TCP phases is not well-determined. Early reports determined that Ru decreased the supersaturation of Re in the matrix and thereby diminished the susceptibility to TCP phase formation. More recent studies have noted the opposite effect. Chen, et al., found that in two alloys differing significantly only in Ru content (USTB-F3 and USTB-F6) that the addition of Ru increased both the partitioning ratio as well as the supersaturation in the γ matrix of Cr and Re, and thereby promoted the formation of TCP phases.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{mesoscopic}} dislocation dynamics model for vacancy-assisted <b>dislocation</b> <b>climb</b> by upscalings from a stochastic model on the atomistic scale.

Our mesoscopic model consists of the vacancy bulk diffusion equation and a <b>dislocation</b> <b>climb</b> velocity formula.

50|$|One {{additional}} {{difference between}} <b>dislocation</b> slip and <b>climb</b> is the temperature dependence.

40|$|<b>Dislocations</b> can <b>climb</b> out {{of their}} glide plane by {{absorbing}} (or emitting) point defects (vacancies and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs)). In contrast with conservative glide motion, climb relies on the point defects' thermal diffusion and hence operates on much longer timescales, leading to some forms of creep. Whilst equilibrium point defect concentrations allow <b>dislocations</b> to <b>climb</b> to relieve non-glide stresses, point defect supersaturations also lead to osmotic forces, driving dislocation motion {{even in the absence}} of external stresses. Self-interstitial atoms typically have significantly higher formation energies than vacancies, so their contribution to climb is usually ignored. However, under irradiation conditions, both types of defect are athermally created in equal numbers. In this letter, we use simple thermodynamic arguments to show that the contribution of interstitials cannot be neglected in irradiated materials, and that the osmotic force they induce on dislocations is many orders of magnitude larger than that caused by vacancies. This explains why the prismatic dislocation loops observed by in situ transmission electron microscope irradiations are more often of interstitial rather than vacancy character. Using discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect on dislocation-obstacle interactions, and find reductions in the depinning time of many orders of magnitude. This has important consequences for the strength of particle-reinforced alloys under irradiation. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
