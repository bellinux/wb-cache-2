40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDCoal fly ash {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} to understand the environmental impacts associated with its disposal, management and reuse. Although several <b>beneficiation</b> <b>processes</b> have been proposed, {{there has been little}} or no emphasis on the environmental safety of such processes, products and wastes. Elemental analysis has revealed that toxic elements and radionuclides are present in coal fly ash. Rare earth elements (REE) such as La, Ce and Y are also present in significant amounts in coal fly ash. The aims of this study were to determine the total elemental composition of coal fly ash using different analytical techniques; to validate the application potentials of fly ash <b>beneficiation</b> <b>processes</b> in terms of their environmental safety; and to valorise coal fly ash with a view of recovering REE either by concentrating or leaching the REE in the coal fly ash, products or waste from the <b>beneficiation</b> <b>processes.</b> The <b>beneficiation</b> <b>processes</b> studied were treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) with fly ash; and the synthesis of geopolymer from fly ash. The fresh fly ash sample used in this study was collected directly from the hoppers at Matla power station and the AMD sample was collected from Carletonville goldmine. A total of 54 major, trace and REE were accurately determined in the ash using different analytical techniques. It was shown that the elemental content of Matla fly ash was of the same order as the SRM NIST coal fly ash 1633 b. The comparative study of the four analytical techniques established that ENAA can accurately determine the major, minor and trace elements; that XRF is best suited for the determination of the major and minor elements, whilst the LA ICP-MS is reliable for trace elements determination. The solid residue (AMD/FA) resulting from the AMD interaction with fly ash was characterized with fly ash and the results compared. The results revealed that the amounts of La (141. 09 ± 3. 85 mg/kg), Ce (27. 45 ± 2. 04 mg/kg), and Nd (63. 73 ± 0. 05 mg/kg) in AMD/FA residue was considerably higher than their average abundance in the earth crust that varies from 66 mg/kg in Ce and 40 mg/kg in Nd to 35 mg/kg in La. The results also showed that the AMD/FA residue contained As (11. 39 ± 1. 21 mg/kg), Cd (3. 77 ± 0. 02 mg/kg), Cr (72. 43 ± 1. 27 mg/kg), Hg (10. 50 ± 0. 85 mg/kg), Ni (124. 15 ± 1. 6 mg/kg) and Pb (22. 46 ± 1. 43 mg/kg) which are potentially harmful if leached in to the environment in excessive amounts...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the past}} several decades, kaolin has been intensively used in the paper {{industry}} as a coating and filler material. These applications require kaolin of a high brightness grade, which strongly depends {{on the level of}} impurities (mainly Fe-bearing minerals such as Fe oxides and hydroxides) and may be improved by <b>beneficiation</b> <b>processes</b> involving grain size classification, magnetic separation and chemical treatments. This investigation was carried out on five Brazilian kaolin samples of different geographical and geological origins. Granulometric, mineralogical, chemical and physical characterizations were performed on all samples before and after the <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process.</b> Chemical compositions were determined by X-ray fluorescence and the most important crystalline phases were identified using X-ray diffraction. Kaolinite is the dominant mineralogical phase with minor amounts of muscovite and quartz. The nature of Fe impurities was investigated by electron spin resonance and 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. For all studied kaolin samples, Fe ions (Fe 3 + and Fe 2 +) are present in variable amounts, in the kaolinite structure and also in Fe oxides (magnetite, hematite and goethite).

40|$|Biomineral {{beneficiation}} {{concerns the}} way in which microorganisms bring about the enrichment of an ore matrix. It involves the selective removal of undesired mineral constituents from an ore through microbe-mineral interactions in the processes such as selective flotation and flocculation. Adhesion of microorganisms to minerals result in alteration of surface chemistry of minerals relevant to <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process.</b> Physico-chemical properties of microbial cell surface influence their adhesion behaviour, therefore the physico-chemical characterisation of microbial cell is essential in order to fully understand and control the biomineral <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process.</b> Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Thiobacillus thiooxidans and Paenibacillus polymyxa are used in the present investigation. Mineral and bacterial cell surface is characterised by electro-kinetic measurements, XPS, FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopy, contact angle measurement, adhesion to organic solvents and surface energy evaluation. Thermodynamic approaches- Fowkes, Gemetric mean, Equation of state and Lifshitz-van der Waals Acid/base, for evaluating the surface energy from contact angles have been critically analysed using literature and measured contact angle data. Adhesion of microbial cells on mineral surface has been studied by constructing adsorption isotherms and DLVO potential energy diagrams.

40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of slimes is {{harmful to the}} flotation process: the performance and consumption of reagents are negatively affected. Traditionally, the desliming stage {{has been responsible for}} removing slimes. However, depending on the porosity of the mineral particles, desliming may not be sufficient to maximize the concentration results. An attrition process before the desliming operation can improve the removal of slime, especially when slimes cover the surface and/or are confined to the cavities/pores of the mineral particles. Attrition is present in the flowcharts of the <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process</b> of phosphate and industrial sand (silica sand). Research has been undertaken for its application to produce pre-concentrates of zircon and iron ore. However, there is still little knowledge of the influence of the attrition variables on the <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process</b> of iron ore. This study presents a factorial design and analysis of the effects of these variables on the reverse flotation of iron ore. The standard of the experimental procedures for all tests included the attrition of pulp, under the conditions of dispersion, desliming and flotation. The parameter analysed (variable response) was the metallurgical recovery in reverse flotation tests. The planning and analysis of the full factorial experiment indicated that with 95 % reliability, the rotation speed of the attrition cell impeller was the main variable in the attrition process of the iron ore.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{correctly}} predict {{the performance of}} <b>beneficiation</b> <b>processes,</b> such as hydrocycloning or ultrasonic treatment of iron ore fines, {{it is important to}} understand possible changes in size distribution, mineral composition and textural peculiarities.

In the case of soft or friable ores, attritioning and/or deagglomeration may have a significant effect on both separation performance and product stream specifications.

An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the response of a haematitic-goethitic iron ore to a combination of stirring and ultrasonic treatment. The effect of stirring and ultrasonic treatment on the size and mineral distribution has been quantified using image analysis and automatic ore texture classification. This approach has been applied to several size coarse fractions of the initial feed and product. The results show that, following treatment, the mass proportion of ore texture classes which contained higher amounts of ochreous goethite and kaolinite had significantly decreased compared with that in the feed, while the proportion of texture classes where haematite was the major mineral had increased.

No caso dos papéis revestidos, a demanda por caulins com alvura cada vez mais alta tem aumentado, o que vem se tornando num desafio cada vez maior para os respectivos produtores, principalmente os de caulins finos. Sabe-se que, quanto mais finoo caulim, mais finos são os seus contaminantes, e por causa disso o processo de beneficiamento torna-se cada vez mais complicado e de alto custo. Como os processos de beneficiamento convencionais de caulins geralmente requerem minérios de alta alvura para a obtenção de produtos de alta alvura, e a quantidade de minérios de alta alvura disponível geralmente é muito pequena, a comercialização desses caulins de alta alvura tem apresentado margens de lucro cada vezmenores, chegando até a se tornar inviável em alguns casos. A proposta deste trabalho foi então de desenvolver um processo debeneficiamento que conseguisse produzir caulins de alta alvura a partir de minérios de baixa alvura, sendo economicamente viável, a fim de atender às demandas crescentes do mercado papeleiro por este tipo de produto. O desenvolvimento foi dividido em duas etapas, sendo a primeira realizada entre 2003 e 2004, onde se testou um processo especial de beneficiamento chamado agregação seletiva, que objetivou a retirada dos contaminantes titaníferos dos caulins estudados. Como o resultado desta etapa não foi satisfatório, houve então uma segunda etapa deste trabalho em 2007, onde o mecanismo da agregação seletiva foi modificado, atingindo desta vez os objetivos propostos. Todo o desenvolvimento foi realizado no laboratório e planta piloto do setor de caulim, no CDM (Centro de Desenvolvimento Mineral) da Vale, em Santa Luzia, Minas Gerais. For {{the last}} years, the {{papermaking}} {{market has been}} demanding {{for more and more}} noble fillers. In the case of coated papers, the demand for high brightness kaolin has increased, which is becoming a growing challenge to their producers, especially those of fine kaolins. It is known that the finer is the kaolin, the finer are the contaminants, and due to this fact the respective <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process</b> becomes extremely complicated and high cost. As the conventional <b>beneficiation</b> <b>processes</b> usually require high brightness ores to obtain high brightness products, and the availability of high brightness ores is usually very small, the marketing of these high brightness products has been continuously shownlower profitability, even becoming not viable in some cases. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process</b> that allows toproduce high brightness products from low brightness ores, being economically viable, in order to meet mainly the papermakers growing demands.

Measuring the kaolin optical properties and the respective residual level of TiO 2, it was possible to conclude that the modified process developed in the second stage reached the proposed goals.

40|$|Near-density {{material}} is material with similar densities {{to that of}} the chosen cut-point density during the separation process of coal into product and discard. The problem is usually classified as a beneficiation problem and not as a reserve problem. To overcome the risk associated with near-density material in the <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process,</b> the constraints of the separators must be merged with the constraints of the coal resource. The problems caused by the presence of near-density material in the <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process</b> of raw coal to a certain percentage ash product, are commonly associated with South African coals. Near-density {{material is}} caused by the presence of finely dispersed mineral matter in the coal that {{can not be separated from}} the coal by current liberation methods. The mineral matter referred to is directly linked with the original depositional environment of the coal. The depositional environment of coal formation determined the ash, the mineral matter present and the distribution within the coal matrix. A closer look at the ash distribution reveals that all types of coal, irrespective of depositional environment, has intrinsic ash content grouped around a certain percentage and that the amount of near-density material present in the <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process</b> depends on the percentage ash, in the clean coal product, required. As the ash distribution is the controlling factor on near-density material, any external factor that effects the ash distribution will affect the coal’s washability characteristics. There are various methodologies to define a coal’s amenability to being washed to a certain clean coal ash product. All of the methods generate an empirical value of near-density material or the coal’s “difficulty” in being washed. All of these methods have their advantages and disadvantages, but the method used is of no consequence if the information is not applied correctly to the coal resource or reserve. At Leeuwpan Coal Mine a risk matrix is used to relate the values from near-density material calculations to the coal reserves. The risk values from the matrix is incorporated into the mining blocks so that during the mine planning phase the risk of near-density material can be quantified and minimized. At Leeuwpan Coal Mine the application of the risk matrix into the planning and exploitation of the coal seams indicated that through resource/reserve management quality problems, due to near-density material can be minimized and that yield can then be optimized. The optimisation of yield leads to a financial gain that increases the value of the reserves. Therefore by pro-active planning and a good understanding of the resource/reserve the risk associated with near-density material can be managed. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

(b) Evaluation of pumping/vacuum generation requirements. (c) Evaluation {{of the effect of}} using solid powder with non - uniform particle size. (d) To develop a model to enable the design and preliminary costing of a fullscale plant. Tests were performed in a test rig constructed for this purpose using different pipe diameters and nitrogen flow rates for the transport of the powder. It was found that the level in the hopper would have to be kept constant or a control system would have to be implemented in order to maintain a constant powder feed rate. In addition, a model was developed for the transport of the powder, and was used to optimize the pipe diameter required. An initial estimate of the operating cost and earnings of a possible full scale plant indicated that the <b>beneficiation</b> <b>process</b> would be very profitable. It is therefore suggested that this process be investigated further for conditions closer to the optimum modelled in a mini-pilot plant operation that includes the plasma reactor system in preparation of full scale implementatio...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the alkali {{roasting}} of ilmenite (FeTiO 3) {{is presented}} as a <b>process</b> route for <b>integrated</b> <b>beneficiation</b> of the mineral for rutile-rich phase and rare earth oxides; the latter is released as a consequence of physical changes in the ilmenite matrix, during the water leaching after roasting. The oxidative alkali roasting transforms ilmenite mineral into water-insoluble alkali titanate and water-soluble ferrite. After roasting the insoluble alkali titanate is separated from rare-earth oxide mixture in colloidal form and water-soluble ferrite. Further leaching of alkali titanate is carried out with oxalic (0. 3 M) and ascorbic (0. 01 M) acid solution which removes the remaining Fe 2 + ions into the leachate and allows precipitation of high-purity synthetic rutile containing more than 95 % TiO 2. Iron is removed as iron oxalate. The physico-chemical changes occurred during the roasting and leaching processes are reported by comparing the role of alkali on the roasting process and product morphologies formed...|$|R
