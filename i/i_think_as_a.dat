TV Guide called it the tenth greatest episode in television history. Review website IGN named it the best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series, writing that the episode [...] " [...] is a distinctive episode of the series, mixing a healthy amount of humor [...] with some very nasty business [...] In just 44 minutes, Boyle creates a fully formed character who makes a big impact in his one and only appearance." [...] Topless Robot named it the ninth-funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the third-best X-Files episode. Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it {{on the list of}} [...] "10 TV Episodes that Changed Television". Tom Kessenich, in Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, named the episode the seventh-best installment of the series, noting that it features [...] "a wonderful blend of humor, drama, and pathos, something The X-Files did better than just about any other show this past decade." [...] The cast and crew of the series have expressed their enjoyment of the installment. Duchovny considers [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] to be one of his favorite episodes of the third season. Nutter highlighted it {{as one of the most}} enjoyable entries that he had worked on. He also noted that, [...] "the writing was so tight and so crisp and so fresh that <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> director, the only thing you have to do is create the atmosphere, set up the characters, set up the shots and you are basically invisible. Then you step back and just let it happen." [...] Series writer and producer Frank Spotnitz stated that the episode worked on many levels and that it is his favorite of the episodes written for the show by Morgan. In 2016, Ira Madison of Vulture.com named it the best episode of the series and [...] "one of the best episodes of television ever", stating that the episode [...] "takes every element that made the series so iconic and throws them all into one heartbreaking installment".|$|E

For two hours the four ships lay within a cable's-length of each other, keeping up as animated a contest as circumstances would allow.

Encumbered by so much wreck, of which it was impossible to get rid, while exposed to so heavy a fire, the Black Prince, however, was finally dropped by her adversary, la Desiree drawing gradually ahead, until neither of those two vessels could bring a gun to bear. The English now turned to, to clear away wreck again, while the Frenchman bent a new fore-course, and a new spanker; those that had been standing being reduced to rags.|$|E
500|$|As a show, Torchwood {{is highly}} intertextual. The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} many sides of Jack are shown across various media.

60|$|Much of the time, {{while my}} wife {{was looking at the}} drawings, I sat observing the crowd of Sunday visitors. They were {{generally}} of a lower class than those of week-days; private soldiers in a variety of uniforms, and, for the most part, ugly little men, but decorous and well behaved. I saw medals on many of their breasts, denoting Crimean service; some wore the English medal, with Queen Victoria's head upon it. A blue coat, with red baggy trousers, was the most usual uniform. Some had short-breasted coats, made in the same style as those of the first Napoleon, which we had seen in the preceding rooms. The policemen, distributed pretty abundantly about the rooms, themselves looked military, wearing cocked hats and swords. There were many women of the middling classes; some, evidently, of the lowest, but clean and decent, in colored gowns and caps; and laboring men, citizens, Sunday gentlemen, young artists, too, no doubt looking with educated eyes at these art-treasures, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> general thing, each man was mated with a woman. The soldiers, however, came in pairs or little squads, accompanied by women. I did not much like any of the French faces, and yet I am not sure that there is not more resemblance between them and the American physiognomy, than between the latter and the English. The women are not pretty, but in all ranks above the lowest they have a trained expression that supplies the place of beauty.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 23: Extract {{from the}} {{unpublished}} manuscript of these letters: [...] "You have lately been at Richmond Hill," [...] said Mr. ----; [...] "did you admire the view, {{as much as}} is the fashion?"

I drove near him, and offered him a seat. He was agitated, and appeared like a man who had stolen goods about him. The amount of it was, that they were distributing the pictures to their former owners, and having an order to receive [...] "la Madonna della Seggiola," [...] he had laid hands on the prize, and, in his eagerness to make sure of it, was carrying it off, under his cloak.

6000|$|Sept. 3.--This day I went to Claremont {{to be sworn}} in.

We knelt [...] down to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy and stood up to [...] take (I think) the councillor's oath, then kissed the Queen's hand, [...] then went round the table shaking hands with each member, beginning [...] from Prince Albert who sat on the Queen's right, and ending with [...] Lord Wharncliffe on her left. We then sat at the lower end of the [...] table, excepting Lord E. Bruce, who went to his place behind the [...] Queen as vice-chamberlain. Then the chancellor first and next the [...] Duke of Buckingham were sworn to their respective offices. C. [...] Greville forgot the duke's privy seal and sent him off without it; [...] the Queen corrected him and gave it.... Then were read and approved [...] several orders in council; among which was one assigning a district [...] to a church and another appointing Lord Ripon and me to act in [...] matters of trade. These were read aloud by the Queen in a very [...] clear though subdued voice; and she repeated 'Approved' after each. [...] Upon that relating to Lord R. and myself we were called up and [...] kissed hands again. Then the Queen rose, as did all the members of [...] the council, and retired bowing. We had luncheon in the same room [...] half an hour later and went off. The Duke of Wellington went in an [...] open carriage with a pair; all our other grand people with four. [...] Peel looked shy all through.

6000|$|But {{the singer}} of the Crusades can be strong as well as gentle. You discern in his battles and single combats the poet ambitious of renown, and the {{accomplished}} swordsman. The duel of Tancred and Argantes, in which the latter is slain, is as earnest and fiery writing throughout as truth and passion could desire; that of Tancred and Clorinda is also very powerful as well as affecting; and the whole siege of Jerusalem is admirable for {{the strength of its}} interest. Every body knows the grand verse (not, however, quite original) that summons the devils to council, [...] "Chiama gli abitator," [...] &c.; and the still grander, though less original one, describing the desolations of time, [...] "Giace l'alta Cartago."[40] The forest filled with supernatural terrors by a magician, in order that the Christians may not cut wood from it to make their engines of war, is one of the happiest pieces of invention in romance. It is founded in as true human feeling as those of Ariosto, and is made an admirable instrument for the aggrandizement of the character of Rinaldo. Godfrey's attestation of all time, and of the host of heaven, when he addresses his army in the first canto, is in the highest spirit of epic magnificence. So is the appearance of the celestial armies, together with that of the souls of the slain Christian warriors, in the last canto, where they issue forth in the air to assist the entrance into the conquered city. The classical poets are turned to great and frequent account throughout the poem; and yet the work has a strong air of originality, partly owing to the subject, partly to the abundance of love-scenes, and to a certain compactness in the treatment of the main story, notwithstanding the luxuriance of the episodes. The Jerusalem Delivered is stately, well-ordered, full of action and character, sometimes sublime, always elegant, and very interesting-more so, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, and in a popular sense, than any other story in verse, not excepting the Odyssey. For the exquisite domestic attractiveness of the second Homeric poem is injured, like the hero himself, by too many diversions from the main point. There is an interest, it is true, in that very delay; but we become too much used to the disappointment. In the epic of Tasso the reader constantly desires to learn how the success of the enterprise is to be brought about; and he scarcely loses sight of any of the persons but he wishes to see them again. Even in the love-scenes, tender and absorbed as they are, we feel that the heroes are fighters, or going to fight. When you are introduced to Armida in the Bower of Bliss, it is by warriors who come to take her lover away to battle.|$|E
60|$|The Rose {{has been}} for many centuries a symbol of spiritual love and supreme beauty. The Count Goblet D'Alviella thinks that it was once {{a symbol of the}} sun,--itself a {{principal}} symbol of the divine nature, and the symbolic heart of things. The lotus was in some Eastern countries imagined blossoming upon the Tree of Life, as the Flower of Life, and is thus represented in Assyrian bas-reliefs. Because the Rose, the flower sacred to the Virgin Mary, and the flower that Apuleius' adventurer ate, when he was changed out of the ass's shape and received into the fellowship of Isis, is the western Flower of Life, I have imagined it growing upon the Tree of Life. I once stood beside a man in Ireland when he saw it growing there in a vision, that seemed to have rapt him out of his body. He saw the garden of Eden walled about, and {{on the top of a}} high mountain, as in certain mediæval diagrams, and after passing the Tree of Knowledge, on which grew fruit full of troubled faces, and through whose branches flowed, he was told, sap that was human souls, he came to a tall, dark tree, with little bitter fruits, and was shown a kind of stair or ladder going up through the tree, and told to go up; and near the top of the tree, a beautiful woman, like the Goddess of Life associated with the tree in Assyria, gave him a rose that seemed to have been growing upon the tree. One finds the Rose in the Irish poets, sometimes as a religious symbol, as in the phrase, 'the Rose of Friday,' meaning the Rose of austerity, in a Gaelic poem in Dr. Hyde's 'Religious Songs of Connacht;' and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of woman's beauty in the Gaelic song, 'Roseen Dubh;' and a symbol of Ireland in Mangan's adaptation of 'Roseen Dubh,' 'My Dark Rosaleen,' and in Mr. Aubrey de Vere's 'The Little Black Rose.' I do not know any evidence to prove whether this symbol came to Ireland with mediæval Christianity, or whether it has come down from Celtic times. I have read somewhere that a stone engraved with a Celtic god, who holds what looks like a rose in one hand, has been found somewhere in England; but I cannot find the reference, though I certainly made a note of it. If the Rose was really a symbol of Ireland among the Gaelic poets, and if 'Roseen Dubh' is really a political poem, as some think, one may feel pretty certain that the ancient Celts associated the Rose with Eire, or Fotla, or Banba--goddesses who gave their names to Ireland--or with some principal god or goddess, for such symbols are not suddenly adopted or invented, but come out of mythology.|$|E
60|$|Or, again, {{the matter}} might {{be put in}} this way. Modern martyrdoms fail even as demonstrations, {{because they do not}} prove even that the martyrs are {{completely}} serious. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fact, that the modern martyrs generally are serious, perhaps a trifle too serious. But their martyrdom does not prove it; and the public does not always believe it. Undoubtedly, as a fact, Dr. Clifford is quite honourably indignant with what he considers to be clericalism, but he does not prove it by having his teapot sold; for a man might easily have his teapot sold as an actress has her diamonds stolen--as a personal advertisement. As a matter of fact, Miss Pankhurst is quite in earnest about votes for women. But she does not prove it by being chucked out of meetings. A person might be chucked out of meetings just as young men are chucked out of music-halls--for fun. But no man has himself eaten by a lion as a personal advertisement. No woman is broiled on a gridiron for fun. That is where the testimony of St. Perpetua and St. Faith comes in. Doubtless it is no fault of these enthusiasts that they are not subjected to the old and searching penalties; very likely they would pass through them as triumphantly as St. Agatha. I am simply advising them upon a point of policy, things being as they are. And I say that the average man is not impressed with their sacrifices simply because they are not and cannot be more decisive than the sacrifices which the average man himself would make for mere fun if he were drunk. Drunkards would interrupt meetings and take the consequences. And as for selling a teapot, it is an act, I imagine, in which any properly constituted drunkard would take a positive pleasure. The advertisement is not good enough; it does not tell. If I were really martyred for an opinion (which is more improbable than words can say), it would certainly only be for one or two of my most central and sacred opinions. I might, perhaps, be shot for England, but certainly not for the British Empire. I might conceivably die for political freedom, but I certainly wouldn't die for Free Trade. But as for kicking up the particular kind of shindy that the Suffragettes are kicking up, I would as soon do it for my shallowest opinion as for my deepest one. It never could be anything worse than an inconvenience; it never could be anything better than a spree. Hence the British public, and especially the working classes, regard the whole demonstration with fundamental indifference; for, while it is a demonstration that probably is adopted from the most fanatical motives, it is a demonstration which might be adopted from the most frivolous.|$|E
