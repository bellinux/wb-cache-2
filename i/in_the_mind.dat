40|$|According to Eugene Nida’s {{theory of}} Dynamic Equivalence, the most {{important}} aim for translators should be to achieve equivalence in effect between original and translated text. Equivalent effect is achieved when a translated text creates the same associations and feelings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of its readers as was produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of <b>the</b> readers of the original text. Venuti argues that equivalent effect can only be achieved using what {{he refers to as}} ethnocentric domesticating strategies – placing <b>the</b> text <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural context of the target audience. He claims that a foreignizing strategy – placing <b>the</b> reader <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural context of the original text – is more appropriate. Consequently, equivalent effect is, in his view, a poor guiding principle for translation. In this thesis, I challenge Venuti’s view that only domesticating strategies can achieve equivalent effect in translation. Using a response-oriented method, I measure the associations to African American Vernacular English (AAVE) produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of respondents from the source audience. Then, I compare these associations with <b>the</b> associations produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of readers of two translations of AAVE – one using a domesticating strategy to translate AAVE, and one using a moderate foreignizing strategy. In contrast to Venuti’s assertions, I find that the moderate foreignizing strategy produces associations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of <b>the</b> target readers that are more <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> associations produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of <b>the</b> source readers than the domesticating strategy...|$|R

The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of the reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind.</b> Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image has other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E

The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (Vibhu) of the four states – Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Brahman. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of a Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.|$|E

Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
5|$|According to the Malayalam Bhagavata Purana, Krishna got {{the name}} Keshava as he slew Keshi. Krishna is {{referred}} to as slayer of Keshi twice in the Bhagavata Gita by Arjuna - Keshava (1.30) and Keshi-nisudana (18.1). In the first chapter (1.30), addressing Krishna as slayer of Keshi, Arjuna expresses his doubts about war, at the same time, finds Krishna capable of destroying them. Here, Keshi represents false pride and the reference as slayer of Keshi by Arjuna expresses his humility. Keshi as a mad horse who created havoc in Gokula - also represents the wild horse of doubts who run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of a person. In the last chapter (18.1), Arjuna addresses Krishna as Maha-baho ("mighty-armed") paired with the slayer of Keshi epithet, reminding the reader how Krishna killed Keshi with his arms alone. The Vishnu sahasranama ("The Thousand names of Vishnu") calls Krishna as Keshava (Names 23, 648) and Keshitha (649) - the slayer of Keshi. The fourth century play Mudrarakshasa also interprets the epithet Keshava as the slayer of Keshi. Keshighat is a major bathing ghat along the river Yamuna in Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have overpowered Keshi.|$|E

They are figments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as {{he was forced to}} make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
5|$|Inside Out is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy-drama {{adventure}} film, co-written {{and directed}} by Pete Docter. The film is set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> {{of a young girl}} named Riley Andersen (Kaitlyn Dias), where five personified emotions—Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)—try to lead her through life as she moves to a new city and has to adjust to her new life. After premiering it at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures released the film theatrically in the United States on June 19, 2015. Made on a production budget of $175 million, Inside Out grossed a worldwide total of $857 million, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2015 and the 49th highest-grossing film of all time as of July 2016. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, surveyed 317 reviews and judged 98% to be positive.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E
