5|$|A mutant who is Xavier's second-in-command and the X-Men's field leader, {{as well as}} an {{instructor}} at the Institute. He is engaged to Jean Grey. His powers include a strong red beam of force shooting from his eyes, which is only held in check by sunglasses or a specialized ruby-quartz visor, which also enables him to control the strength of the beam to <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> in combat.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{five months}} after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioan—still aground near Seal Rock—caught <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> a {{watchman}} aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died out before reaching the explosives that remained aboard the wreck. A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan to break in two. By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October New Jersey engaged {{a coastal}} {{installation}} with her guns; however, she shifted her <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> a recon plane spotting for the battleship reported an enemy truck concentration north of Nha Ky. New Jersey gunners quickly retrained the battleship's big guns {{and managed to}} inflict heavy damage on six of the vehicles.|$|E

50|$|Imperishable Night {{features}} {{a total of}} eight playable characters, in pre-set pairs (and later, individually). The pairs, one human and one yōkai, work in tandem: one person <b>fires</b> <b>when</b> unfocused, while the other pops in and <b>fires</b> <b>when</b> focused, with a reduction in movement speed. The two attacks can be drastically different. The individual characters {{do not have an}} attack change when focused, although the movement of player familiars (such as Remilia's) may change.|$|R
5|$|Port Royal, {{based on}} , {{contains}} the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to {{remove some of}} the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film. Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows, though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 1 Command Module {{has never}} been on public display. After the accident, the {{spacecraft}} was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to facilitate the review board's disassembly in order to investigate {{the cause of the}} <b>fire.</b> <b>When</b> the investigation was complete, it was moved to the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and placed in a secured storage warehouse.|$|E
5|$|The Dornier had {{self-sealing}} {{fuel tanks}} to protect fuel {{stored in the}} wings and fuselage. This reduced the loss of fuel and risk of <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> hit in action, and often enabled the aircraft to return. Twenty oxygen bottles were provided for crew use during long flights above 3,660 m (12,000ft).|$|E
50|$|A {{security}} {{guard at the}} hotel. He is later <b>fired</b> <b>when</b> {{he tries to get}} Kwok Hoi-yiu evicted from the hotel.|$|R
50|$|The castle had {{a battery}} of eight guns, from which Royal Salutes were often <b>fired,</b> <b>when</b> the Royal Yacht was visiting Cowes.|$|R

5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic <b>fire.</b> <b>When</b> set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
5|$|A few {{structures}} {{built by}} the Muisca still exist today; the Cojines del Zaque ("cushions of the zaque") in Tunja are two round stones with inclined upper parts used for religious ceremonies. Of the Goranchacha Temple, a circle of pillars remained, located on the terrains of the UPTC, also in Tunja. The holiest temple of the Muisca, the Sun Temple in sacred City of the Sun Sugamuxi had been destroyed by <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> the Spanish conquerors looted the shrine and has been rebuilt based on archaeological research by Eliécer Silva Celis. The temple {{is part of the}} Archaeology Museum of the city in Boyacá.|$|E
5|$|After 17:30 Kamimura led his {{division}} in a fruitless pursuit {{of some of}} the Russian cruisers, leaving Tōgō's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> the range closed to 8000–9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20:08 as night was falling. The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E

5|$|During the duel between Vengeur and Brunswick, the {{undamaged}} HMS Ramillies {{had approached}} and put {{herself in a}} favourable position to rake Vengeur, and was waiting for Brunswick to separate to open <b>fire.</b> <b>When</b> she did so, Ramillies fired two broadsides, leaving Vengeur with only her foremast standing, which fell half an hour later. Ramillies sustained some damage herself. Soon afterwards, seawater inundated the powder room of Vengeur, denying her all means of defence, and 250 of her crew were out of action. The Trente-et-un Mai closed in around 3:30, attempting to provide assistance, but the proximity of several British sails endangered her so that she eventually sailed away.|$|E
5|$|ML 306 {{also came}} under heavy <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> it arrived near the port. Sergeant Thomas Durrant of No. 1 Commando, manning the aft Lewis gun, engaged gun and {{searchlight}} {{positions on the}} run in. He was wounded but refused to leave the gun for treatment. The ML reached the open sea but was attacked at short range by the German torpedo boat Jaguar. Durrant returned fire, aiming for the torpedo boat's bridge. He was wounded again but remained at his gun even after the German commander asked for their surrender. Firing drum after drum of ammunition, he {{refused to give up}} until after the ML had been boarded. Durrant died of his wounds and, after the recommendation of the Jaguars commander, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|On 25 February the PAVN deluged {{the base}} with {{artillery}} fire and then launched a conventional armored/infantry assault. Smoke, dust and haze precluded observation by an American forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which was flying above 4,000 feet to avoid anti-aircraft <b>fire.</b> <b>When</b> a U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom jet {{was shot down}} in the area, the FAC left {{the area of the}} battle to direct a rescue effort for the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base. PAVN troops and tanks then overran the position, capturing the ARVN brigade commander in the process. FSB 31 was secured by the PAVN at an estimated cost of 250 killed, and 11 PT-76 and T-54 tanks destroyed. The Airborne had suffered 155 killed and over 100 captured.|$|E

5|$|Schmid {{was named}} the first coach of the new {{expansion}} franchise, Seattle Sounders FC. In their 2009 inaugural season, Seattle defeated D.C. United to win the U.S. Open Cup. On October 24, 2009, Seattle defeated FC Dallas 2–1, giving Schmid his 125th career MLS regular season win; this win moved Schmid past Bob Bradley for the most wins in MLS history. He led Seattle to the playoffs where, in the first round, the Dynamo defeated the team 1–0 in overtime of the second leg. Seattle was the first expansion team {{to make the playoffs}} in an inaugural season since the 1998 Chicago <b>Fire,</b> <b>when</b> the league was just two years old.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{discusses}} {{her research}} with Mulder, suspecting that L'Ively is the arsonist; this {{is confirmed by}} a police sketch taken from the witness' description. Upon reaching the Marsdens' house, Mulder and Scully find the driver's charred body in the bathroom before the second floor bursts into flames. Mulder faces his phobia {{and is able to}} save the Marsden children. Scully holds L'Ively at gunpoint, but is forced to hold her <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> L'Ively informs her of the rocket fuel he has painted on the house. However, Green throws a can of rocket fuel in his face, causing him to lose control and set himself alight outside.|$|E
5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} lignotuber, which stores energy and {{nutrients}} {{as a resource for}} rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch <b>fire.</b> <b>When</b> they do, the plant community becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire {{as the rest of the}} plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E

5|$|The Master and Mistress take Lad {{on their}} annual fall camping {{trip to the}} {{mountains}} for two weeks. During the trip, Lad playfully teases a bear, leading to a fight, which the master ends by scaring off the bear. At {{the end of the}} trip, Lad is accidentally left tied to a tree at the camp site. While his owners are returning to find their missing dog, Lad is trapped by a forest <b>fire.</b> <b>When</b> the bear he fought earlier rushes past with singed fur, Lad chews through his rope and follows the other animals of the forest to sit in a nearby lake. When his owners arrive, he runs through the burning fire to join them, blistering his paws on some coals.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} the citadel, {{especially}} to its northern and western walls, was only repaired in 1407. In 1414, governor of Damascus Nawruz al-Hafizi, sought refuge in the citadel against the army of Sultan Al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh. The citadel was bombarded by trebuchet and cannon. The siege ended when a treaty of surrender was signed. In 1461, the southwest tower collapsed in a <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> missiles were fired from it to force the rebellious governor of Damascus to leave the city. This tower and four others were rebuilt in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, indicating that the repairs of 1407 had been carried out in haste.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} along the coastline, including {{a total of}} 19.1inches (486mm) measured in a 48‑hour period in Acapulco. Totals of over 2inches (50mm) spread across much of Guerrero and Oaxaca, causing flash flooding and mudslides. The storm partially flooded about 40houses, {{and a total of}} 72people were forced to leave their homes. In Acapulco, floodwaters washed trash from street corners onto the beaches. Elsewhere in Guerrero, the flooding and mudslides blocked several highways, which stranded dozens of vehicles. The wall of a prison collapsed due to the rainfall. Also in Acapulco, the rainfall downed trees and power lines, causing power outages and sparking a <b>fire</b> <b>when</b> a transformer exploded. No deaths were reported.|$|E
