5|$|The {{life cycle}} of A.gallica {{includes}} two diploidization–haploidization events. The first {{of these is the}} usual process of cell fusion (forming a diploid) followed by meiosis during the formation of haploid basidiospores. The second event is more cryptic, and occurs before fruit body formation. In most basidiomycetous fungi, the hyphae of compatible mating types will fuse to form a two-nucleate, or dikaryotic stage; this stage is not observed in Armillaria species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra <b>haploidization</b> event prior to fruit body formation to create a genetic mosaic. These regular and repeating <b>haploidization</b> events result in increased genetic diversity, which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, like drought.|$|E
50|$|The parasexual cycle, {{a process}} {{peculiar}} to fungi and single-celled organisms, is a nonsexual mechanism of parasexuality for transferring genetic material without meiosis or {{the development of}} sexual structures. It was first described by Italian geneticist Guido Pontecorvo in 1956 during studies on Aspergillus nidulans (also called Emericella nidulans when referring to its sexual form, or teleomorph). A parasexual cycle is initiated by the fusion of hyphae (anastomosis) during which nuclei and other cytoplasmic components occupy the same cell (heterokaryosis and plasmogamy). Fusion of the unlike nuclei in the cell of the heterokaryon results in formation of a diploid nucleus (karyogamy), which {{is believed to be}} unstable and can produce segregants by recombination involving mitotic crossing-over and <b>haploidization.</b> Mitotic crossing-over can lead to the exchange of genes on chromosomes; while <b>haploidization</b> probably involves mitotic nondisjunctions which randomly reassort the chromosomes and result in the production of aneuploid and haploid cells. Like a sexual cycle, parasexuality gives the species the opportunity to recombine the genome and produce new genotypes in their offspring. Unlike a sexual cycle, the process lacks coordination and is exclusively mitotic.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasexual cycle}} resembles sexual reproduction. In both cases, unlike hyphae (or {{modifications}} thereof) may fuse (plasmogamy) and their nuclei will occupy the same cell. The unlike nuclei fuse (karyogamy) {{to form a}} diploid (zygote) nucleus. In contrast to the sexual cycle, in the parasexual cycle recombination takes place during mitosis followed by <b>haploidization</b> (but without meiosis). The recombined haploid nuclei appear among vegetative cells, which differ genetically {{from those of the}} parent mycelium.|$|E

By this approach it has been possible to overcome those barriers to recombination, principally chromosome rearrange-ments, which arise when non-sister strains are used. Selection against an allele has been demonstrated and the problem solved by use of p-fluorophenylalanine to in-duce <b>haploidization.</b> In addition, the selection of a morphologically stable strain from an unstable strain has been achieved and the genetic determinant for this instability allocated to a <b>haploidization</b> group...|$|E

40|$|Aspermatogenesis is {{a severe}} {{impairment}} of spermatogenesis in which germ cells are completely lacking or present in an immature form, {{which results in}} sterility in approximately 25 % of patients. Because assisted reproduction techniques require mature germ cells, biotechnology is a valuable tool for rescuing fertility while maintaining biological fatherhood. However, this process involves, for instance, the differentiation of preexisting immature germ cells or the production/derivation of sperm from somatic cells. This review critically addresses four potential techniques: sperm derivation in vitro, germ stem cell transplantation, xenologous systems, and <b>haploidization.</b> Sperm derivation in vitro is already feasible in fish and mammals through organ culture or 3 D systems, {{and it is very}} useful in conditions of germ cell arrest or in type II Sertoli-cell-only syndrome. Patients afflicted by type I Sertoli-cell-only syndrome could also benefit from gamete derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells of somatic origin, and human haploid-like cells have already been obtained by using this novel methodology. In the absence of alternative strategies to generate sperm in vitro, in germ cells transplantation fertility is restored by placing donor cells in the recipient germ-cell-free seminiferous epithelium, which has proven effective in conditions of spermatogonial arrest. Grafting also provides an approach for ex-vivo generation of mature sperm, particularly using prepubertal testis tissue. Although less feasible, <b>haploidization</b> is an option for creating gametes based on biological cloning technology. I...|$|E

The sequence of events was haploid groupings of the chromosomes in normal, human metaphase cells, followed by genomic doubling to homozygousdiploidy. These events were responses to DNA rep-lication stress fromamino acid glutamine deprivation. Importantly, these homozygous cells outgrew normal fi-broblasts in 2 - 3 passages—they had gained proliferative advantage (GPA), presumably from loss (LOH) of tu-mor suppressor genes. They were morphologically changed cells with rounded nuclei that grew in a “streaming” growth pattern and with changed form and size of mitosis, similar to some hyperplasias. The grouping of the chromosomes in metaphase cells was asymmetric with a narrow range around the median (23) (no micro-nuclei), suggesting genetic control.

40|$|Chrysanthemum {{is one of}} {{important}} ornamental species in the world. Its highly heterozygous state complicates molecular analysis, so it is of interest to derive haploid forms. A total of 2, 579 non-fertilized chrysanthemum ovules pollinated by Argyranthemum frutescens were cultured in vitro to isolate haploid progeny. One single regenerant emerged from each {{of three of the}} 105 calli produced. Chromosome counts and microsatellite fingerprinting showed that only one of the regenerants was a true haploid. Nine doubled haploid derivatives were subsequently generated by colchicine treatment of 80 in vitro cultured haploid nodal segments. Morphological screening showed that the haploid plant was shorter than the doubled haploids, and developed smaller leaves, flowers and stomata. An in vitro pollen germination test showed that few of the haploid's pollen were able to germinate and those which did so were abnormal. Both the haploid and the doubled haploids produced yellow flowers, whereas those of the maternal parental cultivar were mauve. Methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) profiling was further used to detect alterations in cytosine methylation caused by the <b>haploidization</b> and/or the chromosome doubling processes. While 52. 2 % of the resulting amplified fragments were cytosine methylated in the maternal parent's genome, the corresponding proportions for the haploid's and doubled haploids' genomes were, respectively, 47. 0 % and 51. 7 %, demonstrating a reduction in global cytosine methylation caused by <b>haploidization</b> and a partial recovery following chromosome doubling...|$|E

In the same experiments, we have also measured other meiotic parameters, such as premeiotic DNA synthesis, commitment to intragenic recombination, <b>haploidization,</b> ascus formation, and viability. rad 50 and spo 11 diploids make an undetectable amount of physically recombined DNA and < 1 % of wild-type levels of viable intragenic recombinants.

40|$|Abstract: Tulips are {{commonly}} associated with The Netherlands, {{even though they are}} native to Central Asia. This association began in 1594 and caused the famous ‘tulipomania ’ in the 1600 s. This vegetatively propagated crop is currently the most important bulbous geophyte in the world. Modern cultivars (predominantly Tulipa gesneriana) are grown for bulb production, cut flowers, flowering potted plants, and landscaping. The Netherlands and France are the primary tulip bulb producers. Continued breeding and improvement of T. gesneriana focus on disease resistance, improved floral longevity, and new flower shapes/colors. Interspecific hybridization is hampered by reproductive (pre- and post-pollination) and germination barriers (due to incongruity), and long generation times. Crossing barriers have been overcome with the use of techniques such as bud pollination, cut styles, grafted styles, placental pollination, and pollination of isolated ovules. <b>Haploidization</b> and molecular techniques are being used to create homozygous plants and conduct marker-assisted breeding, respectively...|$|E
40|$|<b>Haploidization</b> of {{the genome}} inmeiosis {{requires}} that chromosomes be sorted exclusively into pairs stabi-lized by synaptonemal complexes (SCs) and cross-overs.

We now describe telomere-led rapid prophasemovements (RPMs) that frequently exceed 1 mm/s and persist throughout meiotic prophase. Bouquet formation and RPMs depend on NDJ 1, MPS 3, and a new member of this pathway, CSM 4, which encodes a meiosis-specific nuclear envelope protein required specifically for telomere mobility. RPMs initiate independently of recombination but differ quantitatively in mutants that fail to complete recombination, suggesting that RPMs respond to re-combination status.

We analyzed requirements for aggregate formation and identified multiple phosphotarget residues in the nucleoplasmic domain of Matefin/SUN- 1.

It was found that the recombination process in both common-AB and compatible diploids was predominantly mitotic. However, the compatible diploids which developed a high frequency of dikaryotic components gave some evidence of meiotic-like activity. Thus, compatible mating-type factors are necessary for dikaryosis, but not sufficient in themselves to produce it. In compatible mycelia where dikaryosis does occur, meiotic-like recombination may also occur. It is proposed that both lapse into the dikaryotic state, and meiotic-like recombination was induced by different genes under control of the incompatibility factors. Dikaryosis and meiosis are thus seen as tandem phenomena, neither causal of the other but both induced by action of compatible mating-type factors...|$|E
40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans inner nuclear {{envelope}} protein matefin/SUN- 1 plays a conserved, {{pivotal role in}} the process of genome <b>haploidization.</b> CHK- 2 –dependent phosphorylation of SUN- 1 regulates homologous chromosome pairing and interhomolog recombination in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using time-lapse microscopy, we characterized the movement of matefin/SUN- 1 ::GFP aggregates (the equivalent of chromosomal attachment plaques) and showed that the dynamics of matefin/SUN- 1 aggregates remained unchanged throughout leptonene/zygotene, despite the progression of pairing. Movement of SUN- 1 aggregates correlated with chromatin polarization. We also analyzed the requirements for the formation of movement-competent matefin/SUN- 1 aggregates in the context of chromosome structure and found that chromosome axes were required to produce wild-type numbers of attachment plaques. Abrogation of synapsis led to a deceleration of SUN- 1 aggregate movement. Analysis of matefin/SUN- 1 in a double-strand break deficient mutant revealed that repair intermediates influenced matefin/SUN- 1 aggregate dynamics. Investigation of movement in meiotic regulator mutants substantiated that proper orchestration of the meiotic program and effective repair of DNA double-strand break...|$|E
40|$|Recombination {{in first}} meiotic {{prophase}} is initiated by endogenous breaks in double-stranded DNA (DSBs) which occurs {{during a time}} when chromosomes are remodeled and proteinaceous cores (axes) are assembled along their length. DSBs are instrumental in homologue recognition and underlie the crossovers that form between parental chromosomes to ensure genome <b>haploidization</b> during the following two successive meiotic divisions. Advances in fluorescence microscopy and genetic engineering of GFP-tagged fusion proteins have made it possible to observe the behavior of entire chromosomes and specific subregions in live cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In meiosis we observed that telomeres are dynamic and move about the entire nuclear periphery, only interrupted by their fleeting clustering at the spindle pole body (the centrosome equivalent), known as bouquet formation. This mobility translates to whole chromosomes and nuclei during the entire prophase I. Here we describe a simple setup for live cell microscopy that we used to observe chromosome movements {{during a time when}} DSBs are formed and transform into crossover and non-crossover products...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{illustrates}} that formal genetic analysis {{by means of}} mitotic recombination is perfectly feasible. It leads to the identification of linkage groups, {{of the order of}} genes, and of their distances, though in units, it is different from those of meiotic analysis. In aspergillus nidulans, which has a sexual cycle and in which the results of genetic analysis based on meiosis are available, mitotic mapping has been compared with, and helped by, meiotic mapping. But in other similar organisms, such as aspergillus niger, in which a sexual cycle is unknown, mitotic recombination is the only means available so far toward formal genetic analysis and breeding for scientific or applied purposes. The possibility of applying mitotic analysis to somatic tissues of higher organisms, better if in tissue cultures, is clearly at hand. Even if somatic crossing-over were not of widespread occurrence, the analysis could at least identify linkage groups making use of breakdowns of mitosis, similar to the <b>haploidization</b> described in the chapter, which are known to occur as rare accidents in higher organisms. The principles of mitotic analysis expounded in the chapter are clearly adaptable, with minor modifications, {{to a wide variety of}} special cases...|$|E
40|$|The MRE 4 gene was cloned by {{complementation}} of the defects of meiotic recombination and <b>haploidization</b> in an mre 4 - 1 mutant. Disruption of MRE 4 {{resulted in}} reduced meiotic recombination and spore inviability. The mre 4 spore lethality can be suppressed by spo 13, a mutation that causes cells {{to bypass the}} reductional division. Analysis of meiotic DNA extracted from the mre 4 mutant cells revealed that double-strand breaks occurred at the two sites of the HIS 4 -LEU 2 recombination hot spot, but at a frequency of about 10 - 20 % of the wild type. Northern blot analysis indicated that the MRE 4 gene produces four transcripts of 1. 63, 3. 2, 4. 0 and 6. 2 kb. All of these transcripts are absent from mitotic cells and are meiotically induced. The DNA sequence of the MRE 4 open reading frame predicts a 497 -amino acids protein with a molecular mass of 56. 8 kDa. The Mre 4 protein contains highly conserved amino acid sequences found specifically in serine-threonine protein kinases. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation is required directly or indirectly for meiotic recombination...|$|E
