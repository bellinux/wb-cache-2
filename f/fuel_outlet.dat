50|$|The {{primary air}} input to a ball tube mill {{performs}} a dual function. It {{is used for}} drying and as the fuel transport medium, and by regulating it the mill output is regulated. Governed by the pulverized <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature requirement, the cold air and hot air dampers are regulated to achieve the correct primary air temperature. In addition to raising the coal temperature inside the mill for drying and better grinding, the same air works as the transport medium to move the pulverized coal out of the mill: it travels through the annular space between the fixed trunnion tubes and the rotating hot air tube onwards to the classifier. Coal-laden air passes through double cone static classifiers, with adjustable classifier vanes, for segregation into pulverized fuel of the desired fineness, and coarse particles. The pulverised fuel continues its journey towards the coal burners for combustion. The coarse particles rejected in the classifier are returned to the mill for another cycle of grinding.|$|E

40|$|The {{changes in}} the anode and cathode {{potentials}} of a phosphoric acid fuel cell under various conditions were studied using a single cell equipped with four reversible hydrogen electrodes located near the inlets and outlets. When pure hydro-gen gas {{was used as a}} fuel, the polarizations under load were homogeneous in the plane of the cell. However, when the re-formate gas was used, inhomogeneity in the plane arose under load. The cathode and anode potentials hifted in the posi-tive direction at the <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> area. The potential shifts increased with an increase of fuel utilization or due to CO poisoning. The voltage loss due to CO poisoning (CO loss) caused an increase not only of the anode polarization but also of the cathode polarization in the fuel inlet area. The increase of cathode polarization at the fuel inlet area was due to current convergence into the fuel inlet area. The potential shifts at the <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> can be attributed to he acidity change of electro-lyte there. The local acidity change of electrolyte can arise from a local starvation of hydrogen and hence of protons. Half-cell investigations have been conducted to evaluate overpotentials of the electrodes in a phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC). For example, Appleby et al. (1 - 3) and Kunz et al.

40|$|High {{performance}} aircraft typically use {{hydrocarbon fuel}} to regeneratively cool the airframe and engine components. As the coolant temperatures increase, the fuel may react with dissolved oxygen forming deposits that limit the regenerative cooling system performance. This study investigates the deposition of Jet A using a thermal stability experiment and {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling. The experimental portion {{of this study is}} performed with a high Reynolds number thermal stability (HiRets) tester in which fuel passes though an electrically heated tube and the <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature is held constant. If the thermal stability temperature of the fuel is exceeded, deposits form and adhere {{to the inside of the}} tube creating an insulating layer between the tube and the fuel. The HiRets tester measures the tube outer wall temperatures near the <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> to report the effect of deposition occurring inside the tube. Final deposits are also estimated with a carbon burn off analysis. The CFD model was developed and used to simulate the fluid dynamics, heat transfer, chemistry, and transport of the deposit precursors. The model is calibrated to the experiment temperature results and carbon burn-off deposition results. The model results show that the dominant factor in deposition is the heated wall temperature and that most of the deposits are formed in the laminar sublayer. The models predicted a 7. 0 E- 6 kilograms per square meter-sec deposition rate, which compared well to the carbon burn-off analysis deposition rate of 1. 0 E- 6 kilograms per square meter-sec...|$|E

The technique is also able to distinguish among standard RP- 1 rocket fuels and those having reduced sulfur levels. Carbon burn off analysis of residue in the capillary tubes on the RP- 1 fuels correlates with the external temperature results...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the formation of one- and two-ring aromatic species in near atmospheric-pressure opposed-flow diffusion flames of 1, 3 -butadiene (1, 3 -CH). The chemical structures of two different 1, 3 -CH/Ar-O/Ar flames were explored using flame-sampling molecular-beam mass spectrometry with both electron and single-photon ionization. We provide mole fraction profiles of 47 components as function of distance from the <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> and compare them to chemically detailed modeling results. To this end, the hierarchically developed model described by Seidel et al. [16] has been updated to accurately comprise the chemistry of 1, 3 -butadiene. Generally a very good agreement is observed between the experimental and modeling data, allowing for a meaningful reaction path analysis. With regard to the formation of aromatic species up to naphthalene, it was essential to improve the fulvene and the C chemistry description in the mechanism. In particular, benzene is found to be formed mainly via fulvene through the reactions of the CH isomers with CH The n-CH radical reacts with CH forming 1, 3 -pentadiene (CH), which is subsequently oxidized to form the naphthalene precursor cyclopentadienyl (CH). Oxidation of naphthalene is predicted to be a contributor to the formation of phenylacetylene (CH), indicating that consumption reactions can be of similar importance as molecular growth reactions...|$|E
40|$|A vast {{majority}} of the medium and high speed Diesel engines are equipped with multi-hole injection nozzles nowadays. Inaccuracies in workmanship and changing hydraulic conditions in the nozzles result in differences in injection rates between individual injection nozzle holes. The new deformational measuring method described in the paper allows injection rate measurement in each injection nozzle hole. The differences in injection rates lead to uneven thermal loads of Diesel engine combustion chambers. All today known measuring method, such as Bosch and Zeuch give accurate results of the injection rate in diesel single-hole nozzles. With multihole nozzles they tellus nothing about possible differences in injection rates between individual holes of the nozzle. At deformational measuring method, the criterion of the injected fuel is expressed by the deformation of membrane occurring due to the collision of the pressure wave against the membrane. The pressure wave is generated by the injection of the fuel into the measuring space. For each hole of the nozzle the measuring device must have a measuring space of its own into which fuel is injected as well as its measuring membraneand its own <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet.</b> During measurements procedure the measuring space must be filled with fuel to maintain an overpressure of 5 kPa. Fuel escaping from the measuring device is conducted into the graduated cylinders for measuring the volumetric flow through each hole of the nozzle.

We devoted special attention to the membrane shape and temperature compensation of the strain gauges...|$|E
