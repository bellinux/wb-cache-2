40|$|NASA Langley has {{developed}} a multi-mode decision support system for pilots operating in a Distributed Air-Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM) environment. An Autonomous Operations Planner (AOP) assists pilots in performing separation assurance functions, including conflict detection, prevention, and resolution. Ongoing AOP design {{has been based on}} a comprehensive human factors analysis and evaluation results from previous human-in-the-loop experiments with airline pilot test subjects. AOP considers complex flight mode interactions and provides flight guidance to pilots consistent with the current aircraft control state. Pilots communicate goals to AOP by setting system preferences and actively probing potential trajectories for conflicts. To minimize training requirements and improve operational use, AOP design leverages existing alerting philosophies, <b>displays,</b> and <b>crew</b> interfaces common on commercial aircraft. Future work will consider trajectory prediction uncertainties, integration with the TCAS collision avoidance system, and will incorporate enhancements based on an upcoming air-ground coordination experiment...|$|R

50|$|The S11s were {{regarded}} as good locomotives on expresses around the ports served by the LSWR. The class was at first rostered to the West Country in order to ply their trade upon the gradients they were designed for. However, it was soon realised that the smaller wheels and larger boilers were {{not living up to}} expectations of successful operation on the route. The class was slower and more cumbersome than their siblings. This led to <b>crews</b> <b>displaying</b> their preference for the T9's higher speeds downhill and on the level stretches of railway.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of this incident, the ARB also began to pay close {{attention}} to the fire resistance of aircraft fittings and furnishings due to their potential to form major hazards in oxygen-fed inflight fires.
